Heat-clearing and detoxicating TCM is the most frequently used category in the treatment of cancerous tumors, but lacks sufficient validation studies. Aim of the study: The present research (in our series of studies) aims to explore the anti-angiogenic effects of TCM; so we begin with heat-clearing and detoxicating TCM. Materials and Methods: Six typical heat-clearing and detoxicating TCM (Philippine Violet Herb, Wild Chrysanthemum, Heartleaf Houttuynia Herb, Chinese Lobelia Herb, Spreading Hedyotis Herb and Uniflower Swisscentaury Root) were decocted, concentrated, sieved and desiccated to attain the water extract. This study utilized the vascular organism research model for Fli1a-EGFP zebrafish, which were raised and maintained under standard conditions. 22 h post-fertilization (hpf) embryos were distributed into 12-well plates for a treatment period of 26 h. The TCM water extracts which were diluted in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were added to each well at a concentration of 200 mu g/ml. The positive control was 5 mu g/ml PTK787 (vatalanib) and the vehicle control was 0.1% DMSO. At 48 hpf larvae were tricaine anesthetized and imaged. To demonstrate if TCM shows angiogenesis defects, ten larvae were randomly chosen to conduct a quantitative assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to dissect the mechanisms involved by analyzing the contributions of signaling pathways and molecules concerning angiogenesis, with a total of ten genes examined. Results: All 30 larvae treated with Wild Chrysanthemum, Uniflower Swisscentaury Root and PTK787 showed angiogenesis defects. Embryos treated with Wild Chrysanthemum and Uniflower Swisscentaury Root showed a lower number of complete intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and there was statistically significant differences between TCM and the vehicle control. Wild Chrysanthemum and Uniflower Swisscentaury Root have a higher inhibition rate and the statistical difference between TCM and the vehicle control was significant Compared with vehicle controls, Wild Chrysanthemum could significantly modulate the relative mRNA expression of all ten genes. Whereas, Uniflower Swisscentaury Root could significantly regulate the relative mRNA expression of seven genes, it did not show a significant impact on the remaining three genes. Conclusions: The present research demonstrates that Wild Chrysanthemum and Uniflower Swisscentaury Root have anti-angiogenic effects in zebrafish and that they could regulate both proangiogenic mechanisms and negative angiogenesis regulators. Their anti-angiogenic effects result from effects on negative regulators overriding their effects on proangiogenic mechanisms. The results provide new insights into their clinical application and therapeutic potential for the management of angiogenesis-dependent diseases such as cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recently, the increasing case reports on hepatotoxicity induced by Raw P. multiflorum (RP) have attracted particular attention. However, the diagnosis and identification of RP-induced hepatotoxicity are still very difficult for its unknown mechanism and the lack of specific biomarkers. Aim of the study: To further explore the toxicity and metabolic mechanisms involved in the hepatotoxicity induced by RP. Materials and methods: The hepatotoxicity induced by RP and its processed products (PP) (dosed at 20 g/kg for 4 weeks) on rats were investigated using conventional approaches including the biochemical analysis and histopathological observations. Further, a urinary metabolomic approach was developed to study the metabolic disturbances caused by RP and PP, followed by the pattern recognition approach and pathways analysis. Results: RP showed obvious hepatotoxity whereas PP did not. 16 potential biomarkers (pyridoxamine, 4-pyridoxic acid, citrate et al.) differentially expressed in RP group were identified compared with the control and PP-treated groups. The pathways analysis showed that vitamin B6 metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and citrate cycle might be the major enriched pathways involved in the hepatotoxicity of the herb. Conclusion: 16 differentially expressed metabolites were identified to be involved in the RP-induced hepatotoxicity. Vitamin B6 metabolism might be mostly related to the hepatotoxicity induced by RP. This finding may provide a potential therapeutic target or option to treat hepatotoxicity induced by RP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against clinical isolates of three extracts and the essential oil from Caoguo (Fructus Tsaoko) were determined by the agar dilution method. The anti-infectious efficacy of the essential oil was evaluated using a mouse peritonitis model which was infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. The chemical components of the essential oil were identified. RESULTS: The results showed that the essential oil exhibited strong antibacterial activity in vitro, with MICs ranging from 22.49 to 1438.91 mu g/mL. The results of in vivo anti-infectious efficacy showed that the Caoguo (Fructus Tsaoko) essential oil can protect the mice from Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli infection. The compositions of the essential oil and relative component percentages were examined. A total of 32 compounds, were identified. The major compounds of essential oil were 1, 8-cineole (25.92%) and geraniol (13.69%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Caoguo (Fructus Tsaoko) essential oil has broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. It warrants further investigation as an antibacterial agent targeting some bacterium with multi-drug resistance. (C) 2016 JTCM. All rights reserved.

Our previous work showed that Heshouwu-induced hepatotoxicity belonged to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI). Unfortunately, the components and mechanisms attributed to IDILI of Heshouwu are difficult to determine and thus remain unknown. Attempts to explore puzzles, we prepared the chloroform (CH)-, ethyl acetate (EA)-, and residue (RE) extracts of Heshouwu to investigate IDILI constituents and underlying mechanisms,using biochemistry, histopathology, and metabolomics examinations. The results showed that co-treatment with non-toxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and EA extract could result in evident liver injury, indicated by the significant elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, as well as obvious liver histologic damage; whereas other two separated fractions, CH and RE extracts, failed to induce observable liver injury. Furthermore, 21 potential metabolomic biomarkers that differentially expressed in LPS/EA group compared with other groups without liver injury were identified by untargeted metabolomics, mainly involved two pathways: tricarboxylic acid cycle and sphingolipid metabolism. This work illustrated EA extract had close association with the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of Heshouwu and provided a metabolomic insight into IDILI of different extracts from Heshouwu.

Purpose: To study the therapeutic effect of He-Wei-Tong-Xie (HWXT) decoction on acute pancreatitis (AP) complicated with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Methods: AP patients (50) were recruited from the Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and randomly divided into treatment and control groups (25 per group). All patients were evaluated at baseline, and thereafter subjected to standard therapeutic protocols, including, fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, administration of somatostatin and omeprazole. The patients in the treatment group also received 100 mL of HWTX by nasal route with high enema (three times/ day). Gastrointestinal function scores (stomach ache, abdominal distension, borborygmus and defecation), and hospitalization time were evaluated on days 3 and 7 of treatment. Results: No significant baseline differences were observed between the treatment and control groups with respect to etiological agents and AP syndrome scores (p > 0.05). However, after 3 and 7 days of treatment, all AP syndromes in treatment group showed significant improvement compared with the control patients (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in hospitalization time and rate of recovery between the treatment and control groups (p < 0.01). Conclusion: HWTX treatment appears to be a safe and potentially useful approach for treating AP complicated with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Neurogenic inflammation plays a key role in migraine attacks, and the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have been associated with the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor. Objective To investigate whether CB1 receptors mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of EA on migraine attacks. Methods A migraine model was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats by unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (TGES). Rats received EA daily on the 5 days preceding TGES with (TGES+EA+SR141716 group) or without (TGES+EA group) intraperitoneal injections of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716. Another group of TGES rats (TGES +MA group) and a non-TGES sham-operated group of rats (Sham+MA group) received minimal acupuncture (MA). Calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations were determined in serum obtained from the ipsilateral jugular vein at initiation of TGES and 5 min after. Postmortem interleukin (IL)-1 beta and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 protein levels in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and plasma protein extravasation (PPE) in the dura mater were assessed. Results TGES induced increases in serum CGRP and PGE2 levels (TGES+MA vs baseline and vs Sham: all p<0.001), as well as IL-1 beta and COX2 protein expression in the TG, and neurogenic PPE levels (TGES+MA vs Sham+MA: all p<0.001). EA attenuated TGES-induced increases in the levels of these proteins (TGES+EA vs TGES+MA: all p<0.001). CB1 receptor antagonism reversed the effects of EA (TGES+EA+SR141716 vs TGES+EA: all p<0.05). Conclusions CB1 receptors appear to mediate anti-inflammatory effects of EA in a rat model of migraine.

The raw material of CFS is commonly processed by stir-frying to obtain yellow (CFY), dark brown (CFD), and carbon dark (CFC) colored products, which are used for different clinical uses. In this study, an intelligent sensory system (ISS) was used to obtain the color, gas, and flavor samples data, which were further employed to develop a novel and accurate method for the identification of CFS and its processed products using principal component analysis. Moreover, this research developed a model of an artificial neural network, which could be used to predict the total organic acid, total flavonoids, citric acid, hyperin, and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural via determination of the color, odor, and taste of a sample. In conclusion, the ISS and the artificial neural network are useful tools for rapid, accurate, and effective discrimination of CFS and its processed products.

Based on the 3 wetland degradation stages, we determined the effects of wetland degradation on the structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling (nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying) microbial communities in 3 soil types (intact wetland: marsh soil; early degrading wetland: marsh meadow soil; and degraded wetland: meadow soil) using 454-pyrosequencing. The structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities differed in the 3 soil types. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in most soil samples but the most abundant soil nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microbial bacteria differed at the class, order, family, and genus levels among the 3 soil types. At the genus level, the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacterium sequences related to Bradyrhizobium were from marsh and marsh meadow soils; whereas those related to Geobacter originated from meadow soil. The majority of ammonia-oxidizing bacterium sequences related to Nitrosospira were from marsh (except for the 40-60 cm layer), marsh meadow and meadow soils; whereas those related to Candidatus Solibacter originated from 40-60 cm layer of marsh soil. The majority of denitrifying bacterium sequences related to Candidatus Solibacter and Anaeromyxobacter were from marsh and meadow soils; whereas those related to Herbaspirillum originated from meadow soil. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species were correlated with soil type based upon Venn and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Changes in soil type, caused by different water regimes were the most important factors influencing compositional changes in the nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying microbial communities.

Iridoid is an important constituent of V. jatamansi that contributes to the pharmacological efficacy of the herb. This study aims to investigate the regulation of lipid metabolism and its mechanism of the iridoids rich fraction in V. jatamansi (IRFV). A high fat diet was used to establish the hyperlipidemia rat model, with 2 mg/kg/d of simvastatin as a positive control, fed with 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/d of IRFV for 20 days to investigate the lipid regulation activity and mechanism of IRFV. Body weight, liver index, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in both serum and liver, as well as total bile acid (TBA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum were measured. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities and the apoprotein A5 (ApoA5), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha(PPAR-alpha), sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1c), and liver X receptor alpha(LXR-alpha) protein expressions were observed. Liver pathology was described through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Compared with the model group, three different IRFV dosages can slow down the weight gain of rats, reduce the contents of TG, and increase the contents of HDL-C in serum. Low IRFV dosage can significantly reduce the AST and ALT contents in serum, liver index, and the TG contents in liver, enhance LPL activity. Medium IRFV dosage can significantly decrease the TG and LDL-C contents in liver. High IRFV dosage can significantly reduce LDL-C, TBA, AST, and ALT contents in serum, and enhance HL activity. Three different IRFV dosages can significantly increase the ApoA5 and PPAR-alpha protein expression and decrease the SREBP-1c protein expression. Furthermore, the LXR-alpha protein expression decreased in low-and high-dose groups. Liver tissue pathological observation showed that IRFV can improve cell degeneration to a certain extent. These results strongly suggest that IRFV play significant roles in regulating lipid metabolism, the mechanism may be related to the increased ApoA5 protein expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The investigation of the influence of species and geographical origins on the phytochemicals of R. coptidis is crucial for its reasonable application and quality control. Objective: Development of an effective method to systematically study the phytochemical variations of the rhizomes of three Coptis species (Ranunculaceae) (Coptis chinensis Franch, Coptis deltoidea C. Y. Cheng et Hsiao and Coptis teeta Wall.) and a species (i.e., C. chinensis) obtained from both Daodi and non-Daodi production regions. Results: The three species had significant differences in their phytochemicals. The rhizome of C. chinensis contained more epiberberine (13.52 +/- 2.65 mg/g), palmatine (18.20 +/- 2.89 mg/g), coptisine (23.32 +/- 4.27 mg/g) and columbamine (4.89 +/- 1.16 mg/g), whereas the rhizomes of C. deltoidea and C. teeta showed the highest level of jatrorrhizine (8.52 +/- 1.36 mg/g) and berberine (81.06 +/- 4.83 mg/g), respectively. Moreover, the rhizome of C. chinensis from three Daodi production regions (Shizhu, Lichuan and Emeishan) contained more alkaloids than those from three non-Daodi production regions (Mianyang, Shifang and Zhenping). Discussion and conclusion: It is necessary to use the three R. coptidis species differentially in TCM clinical practice. Daodi C. chinensis medicinal materials have better quality than most non-Daodi ones, and so they should be preferred for TCM prescription. The combination of HPLC-based fingerprint analysis and quantification of multi-ingredients with statistical analysis provided an effective approach for species discrimination and quality evaluation of R. coptidis.

Previously we have shown that maternal cigarette smoke exposure (SE) leads to significantly increased oxidative stress and inflammation in both brain and kidney, as well as reduced brain and kidney mitochondrial activity. This is closely associated with significant kidney underdevelopment and abnormal function in adulthood in the male offspring. This study aimed to investigate the impact of maternal SE on brain and kidney health in the female offspring. In this study, the mouse dams were exposed to two cigarettes, twice daily for 6 weeks prior to gestation, during pregnancy and lactation. Brains and kidneys from the female offspring were collected at 20 days (P20) and 13 weeks (W13) and were subject to further analysis. We found that mRNA expression of brain inflammatory markers interleukin-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor 4 were significantly increased in the SE offspring at both P20 and W13. Their brain mitochondrial activity markers were however increased at W13 with increased antioxidant activity. Kidney development and function in the female SE offspring were not different from the control offspring. We concluded that although brain inflammatory markers were upregulated in the SE female offspring, they were protected from some of the indicators of brain oxidative stress, such as endogenous antioxidant and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as abnormal kidney development and function in adulthood.

The present shortage in analgesic drugs with a favorable spectrum but without remarkable side effects furthered the search for alternative therapeutic manipulations. Increasing evidence from both basic and clinical research on acupuncture, a main alternative therapy of traditional Chinese medicine, suggests that chronic pain is sensitive to acupuncture procedures. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms is a challenge of great theoretical and practical significance. The seminal hypothesis of Geoffrey Burnstock and the astounding findings of Maiken Nedergaard on the involvement of purinergic signaling in the beneficial effects of acupuncture fertilized the field and led to an intensification of research on acupurines. In this review, we will summarize the state-of-the-art situation and try to forecast how the field is likely to develop in the future.

In this work, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to explore dynamic variation patterns of aconitum alkaloids in Fuzi during the process of decocting aconite root. The fragmentation patterns of aconitum alkaloids using ESI and collision-induced dissociation (CID) techniques were reported. This assay method was validated with respect to linearity (r(2) > 0.9950), precision, repeatability, and accuracy (recovery rate between 94.6 and 107.9%). The result showed that the amounts of aconitum alkaloids in the decoction at different boiling time varied significantly. In the decoction process, the diester-type alkaloids in crude aconite roots have transformed into Benzoylaconines or aconines.

San-Huang-Xie-xin-Tang (SHXXT), composed with Rhizoma Rhei (Rheum palmatum L), Rhizoma Coptidis (Coptis chinensis Franch), and Radix Scutellaria (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi), is a famous formula which has been widely used in the fight against inflammatory abnormalities. Mutual reinforcement is one of the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine. Here this article reviewed and analyzed the recent research on (1) How the main constituents of SHXXT impact on inflammation associated signaling pathway molecules. (2) The interaction between the main constituents and efflux pumps or intestinal transporters. The goal of this work was to, (1) Provide evidence to support the theory of mutual reinforcement. (2) Clarify the key targets of SHXXT and suggest which targets need further investigation. (3) Give advice for the clinical use of SHXXT to elevated the absorption of main constituents and eventually promote oral bioavailability. We search literatures in scientific databases with key words of "each main SHXXT constituent," in combination with "each main inflammatory pathway target molecule" or each main intestinal transporter, respectively. We report the effect of five main constituents on target molecules which lies in three main inflammatory signaling pathways, we as well investigate the interaction between constituents and intestinal transporter. We conclude, (1) The synergistic effect of constituents at both levels confirm the mutual reinforcement theory of TCM as it is proven in this work. (2) The effect of main constituents on downstream targets in nuclear need more further investigation. (3) Drug elevating the absorption of rhein, berberine and baicalein can be employed to promote oral bioavailability of SHXXT.

S. Lian, Hippophae neurocarpa S. W. Liu & T. N. He and Hippophae tibetana Schlechtendal are typically used under one name "Shaji", to treat cardiovascular diseases and lung disorders in Tibetan medicine (TM). A complete set of infrared (IR) macro-fingerprints of these four Hippophae species should be characterized and compared simply, accurately, and in detail for identification. In the present study, tri-step IR spectroscopy, which included Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectroscopy, second derivative IR (SD-IR) spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation IR (2D-IR) spectroscopy, was employed to discriminate the four Hippophae species and their corresponding extracts using different solvents. The relevant spectra exhibited the holistic chemical compositions and variations. Flavonoids, fatty acids and sugars were found to be the main chemical components. Characteristic peak positions, intensities and shapes derived from FT-IR, SDIR and 2D-IR spectra provided valuable information for sample discrimination. Principal component analysis (PCA) of spectral differences was performed to illustrate the objective identification. Results showed that the species and their extracts can be clearly distinguished. Thus, a quick, precise and effective tri-step IR spectroscopy combined with PCA can be applied to identify and discriminate medicinal materials and their extracts in TM research.

Here, we used a sham catgut implantation group to determine whether catgut implantation at acupoints is an effective and safe treatment for allergic rhinitis. Methods: A randomized double-blind clinical trial, with parallel groups was conducted. Skin prick and puncture test (SPT) was performed to confirm the diagnosis before enrollment. The participants received two sessions of treatments of active or sham catgut implantation at acupoints (once every two weeks) with a follow-up phase of 8 weeks. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) were used to determine the severity of allergic rhinitis. The use of anti-allergic medication was used as a secondary indicator. The incidence of adverse events was also recorded and analyzed. Results: An improvement of the VAS and RQLQ scores was observed in both the active and sham-controlled group sat four and eight weeks after the treatment in the self-control analysis. Comparison revealed no significant difference between the treatment and sham-controlled groups until 8 weeks after the 2-week treatment regimen (t = -2.424, P = 0.017). However, the RQLQ scores significantly differed between the two groups after 4 weeks of treatment completion (t = -2.045, P = 0.05) and this difference lasted until the end of 8-week follow-up (t = -2.246, P = 0.033). Throughout the treatment regimen, none of the participants took any relief medication, and no severe adverse events occurred. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that catgut implantation at acupoints is an effective and safe method for symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Panax ginseng (PG) and Hippophae rhamnoides (HR) respectively has a wide application as a complementary therapeutic agent in China for the treatment of AAI and liver injury induced by alcohol. We investigated the effects of aqueous extracts from PG and HR (AEPH) on AA1 mice and identified its underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Models of AAI were induced by intragastric administration of ethanol (8 g/kg). Seventy-two Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Kunming mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal group, positive control group, AEPH of low dosage (100 mg/kg) group, AEPH of medium dose (200 mg/kg) group, AEPH of high dosage (400 mg/kg) group and model group. The mice were treated with metadoxine (MTD, 500 mg/kg) and AEPH. Thirty minutes later, the normal group was given normal saline, while the other groups were given ethanol (i.g., 8 g/kg). The impact of AEPH was observed. In the same way, another seventy-two Kunming mice were randomly divided into six groups equally. The blood ethanol concentration at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 6 h after ethanol intake was determined by way of gas chromatography. The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and microsomal ethanol oxidase (EO) in liver, and the concentration of beta-endorphin (beta-EP), leucine-enkephalin (LENK) in the brain were determined by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELI-SA). Results: AEPH markedly prolonged alcohol tolerance time and shortened sober-up time after acute ethanol administration. AEPH decreased blood ethanol levels in six tests after ethanol intake. The 7-day survival rate of AEPH group was obviously superior to model group. AEPH increased the activities of ADH, ALDH, and decreased EO activity in liver. The crucial find was that AEPH markedly decreased beta-EP and LENK concentration in the brain. Conclusions: AEPH can markedly increase the levels of ADH, ALDH, decrease EO activity in liver and decrease the concentration of beta-EP and LENK in the brain to against acute alcohol intoxication in mice.

Rehd. et Wils. (WCSW) in rat and mouse models. Methods: WCSW extract was prepared and the main constituents were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The acute toxicity of the extract was determined in mice. Platelet aggregation in rat platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was examined to evaluate the effect of the extract on platelet function. Thereafter, the cytotoxic activity of WCSW on HL60, A549, S180 and H22 cells was determined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In vivo antitumor effect of WCSW was further evaluated on H22 cells transplanted in mice, while the expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were assayed by Western blot analysis. Results: Protocatechuic acid, rhodiola glucoside and chlorogenic acid were identified as the main constituents of WCSW. Platelet aggregation was significantly inhibited by treatment with the extract at concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mg/mL. WCSW also showed significant inhibitory effect on HL60, A549, S180 and H22 cells in vitro with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value of 321.9, 285.0, 130.3 and 76.1 mu g/mL, respectively. Furthermore, WCSW exhibited obvious anti-tumor effect on H22 transplanted tumor in vivo. After treatment with WCSW, caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax were significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated, whereas Bcl-2 was significantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated in the tumor tissues. Conclusion: WCSW possesses significant antithrombosis and anti-tumor effect, and therefore, has the potentials to be developed into effective drugs for clinical treatment of cancer and thrombosis diseases.

Regarding the hypertoxic herb aconite, large samples are considered to be of better quality. However, this experiential classification lacks a scientific basis. In this study, we focused on the quality diversity among different grades and studied it using the minimum lethal dose assay and a novel ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. Toxicity assay result suggested grade I aconite had the lowest toxicity (p < 0.05). Using this method with partial least squares-discriminant analysis, we discovered nine chemomarkers, including neoline, songorine, fuziline, mesaconitine, talatizidine, dexyaconitine, talatisamine, hypaconitine, and fuzitine. Considering their toxicity and activity, we found the levels of toxic ingredients hypaconitine, dexyaconitine, and mesaconitine in grade I were lower than those in grade II (p < 0.01), while the levels of efficacy ingredients songorine, talatisamine, and neoline were the highest in grade I (p < 0.01). Further study demonstrated that the quality variation was associated with plant tissue development and toxic ingredient distribution law. Our results provide scientific evidence for the experiential quality evaluation of aconite, and it will be of great utility for other foods and herbs.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is one of the essential processes involved in the metastatic capacity of breast cancer. In the recent time, the studies demonstrate that microRNAs, a kind of small non-coding RNA molecules, could be served as negative regulators in breast cancer, regulating cell cycle, drug resistance, and the process of metastasis in cancer development. With the assistance of microRNA profiling, the study concentrating on the regulatory function of miRNAs in breast cancer could be investigated more effectively and efficiently. More recent studies demonstrate that miRNAs have an important role to play in the EMT process of breast cancer to modulate metastasis. This small essay is on the purpose of demonstrating the significance and detection of miRNAs in breast cancer EMT process as oncogenes and tumor suppress genes through miRNA profiling according to the reports mainly in the recent 5 years, providing the evidence of efficient target therapy and effective pro-diagnosis focusing on miRNAs expression of breast cancer patients.

The 80% ethanol extracts of Herpetospermum caudigerum were partitioned with chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, respectively. Male Kunming mice were divided into 13 groups with 16 mice in each group: a control group fed with water, 9 groups treated with 3 fractions of Herpetospermum caudigerum (chloroform fraction, ethyl acetate fraction and n-butanol fraction) at dose of 80, 160 and 320 mg/kg for the low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group, 3 herpetrione (HPE) treated groups fed with HPE at dose of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg for the low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group. All animals were treated once per day for 30 days. Anti-fatigue activity was assessed through the forced swimming test and serum biochemical parameters including blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic glycogen (HG), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) determined following the recommended procedures provided by the commercial kits. Compared with the control group, the lignans extract (ethyl acetate fraction) of Herpetospermum caudigerum and HPE could signifificantly prolonged the exhaustive swimming time (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and also increased the HG levels (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx and LDH, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); BLA and MDA levels were decreased considerably in lignans extract and HPE treated groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). HPE also could significantly decrease the BUN contents compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The chloroform and n-butanol fraction showed no effect on swimming time and biochemical parameters. The lignans extract had antifatigue activities and HPE may be partly responsible for the anti-fatigue effects of Herpetospermum caudigerum. The possible mechanisms of anti-fatigue activity were related to the decrease of BUN and BLA, the increase of the HG storage and protecting corpuscular membrane by preventing lipid oxidation via modifying several enzyme activities.

The purpose of this investigation was to develop a novel prediction model of carcinogenicity of chemicals by using a naive Bayes classifier. The established model was validated by the internal 5-fold cross validation and external test set. The naive Bayes classifier gave an average overall prediction accuracy of 90 +/- 0.8% for the training set and 68 +/- 1.9% for the external test set. Moreover, five simple molecular descriptors (e.g., AlogP, Molecular weight (M-W), No. of H donors, Apol and Wiener) considered as important for the carcinogenicity of chemicals were identified, and some substructures related to the carcinogenicity were achieved. Thus, we hope the established naive Bayes prediction model could be applied to filter early stage molecules for this potential carcinogenicity adverse effect; and the identified five simple molecular descriptors and substructures of carcinogens would give a better understanding of the carcinogenicity of chemicals, and further provide guidance for medicinal chemists in the design of new candidate drugs and lead optimization, ultimately reducing the attrition rate in later stages of drug development.

Neurite outgrowth is an early step in neuronal differentiation and regeneration. Using invitro differentiation of neuroblastoma-derived Neuro-2a (N2a) cell as a model, we performed expression profiling to identify lncRNAs putatively relevant for neurite outgrowth. We identified that Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) was one of the most significantly up-regulated lncRNAs during N2a cell differentiation. Malat1 knockdown resulted in defects in neurite outgrowth as well as enhanced cell death. To pinpoint signalling pathways perturbed by Malat1 depletion, we then performed a reporter-based screening to examine the activities of 50 signalling pathways in Malat1 knockdown cells. We found that Malat1 knockdown resulted in conspicuous inhibition of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway as well as abnormal activation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and P53 signalling pathway. Inhibition of ERK/MAPK pathway with PD98059 potently blocked N2a cell neurite outgrowth, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced ERK activation rescued defects in neurite outgrowth and cell death induced by Malat1 depletion. Together, our results established a critical role of Malat1 in the early step of neuronal differentiation through activating ERK/MAPK signalling pathway.

To further clarify how PU exerts its antiapoptotic effects, this study was designed to investigate the role of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and subsequent apoptotic events in the process of PU against Pb-induced cytotoxicity in rPT cells. The results showed that Pb-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening together with mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and subsequent poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage can be effectively blocked by the addition of PU. Simultaneously, upregulation and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bax with increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio due to PU administration further alleviated Pb-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, PU can reverse Pb-induced ATP depletion by restoring mitochondrial fragmentation to affect ATP production and by regulating expression levels of ANT-1 and ANT-2 to improve ATP transport. In summary, PU produced a significant protection against Pb-induced mitochondrial apoptosis in rPT cells by inhibiting MPTP opening to ameliorate the mitochondrial dysfunction.

Here, we report the results of whole transcriptome-wide analyses of P. cablin using next-generation sequencing technology. In the present study, we generated 108,996 unigenes using RNA sequencing data. Among these unigenes, 65,536 were annotated in the NR database. There were 40,670 intact open reading frames (ORFs), which accounted for 69 % of the 58,820 predicted ORFs, demonstrating that our assembled transcriptome was of high quality. Gene expression levels in the leaf and stem were quantified, and 18,481 unigenes (17 %) were determined to be significantly differentially expressed. The patchouli alcohol (PA) and pogostone (PO) metabolic pathway of P. cablin was also reconstructed, and among the 17 putative homologs to PA and PO biosynthesis-related genes, seven were significantly upregulated in the stems, and three genes were significantly upregulated in the leaves. The correlation between the essential oil contents of P. cablin and the potentially pivotal genes for PA and PO production were identified. Considering that the contents of PA and PO in leaves and stems are markedly different in the same plant and we did not detect any pattern in the expression levels of candidate genes between leaves and stems, we speculate that after the biosynthesis, more PA probably accumulates in the leaves, and more PO in the stems of P. cablin. The transcriptome of P. cabin will facilitate further researches on the molecular system biology of the Pogostemon genus, as well as the in-depth studyies of PA and PO biosynthesis and its potential applications for genetic engineering.

In the current studies, hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) plays a key role in reducing hypoxia-induced apoptosis. We aimed to study the pharmacologic preconditioning effects of salidroside versus those of HPC in hypoxia-/anoxia-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells (pheochromocytoma). Material/Methods: PC12 cells were treated by different experimental conditions: control condition, hypoxia condition, HPC condition, low-/middle-/high-dose condition of salidroside, cyclosporine A (CsA), and oratractyloside (ATR). The cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular Ca2+, caspase-3 activity, and expression of Bcl-2 were detected in PC12 cells after the hypoxia treatment. Salidroside, extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Rhodiola rosea L, plays an essential role in reducing hypoxia-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells by the mitochondrial pathway. Results: Salidroside decreased the apoptosis and increased the viability of hypoxia-induced PC12 cells more effectively than HPC Moreover, salidroside markedly stabilized MMP and intracellular Ca2+, reduced or inhibited LDH and caspase-3 activity, and up-regulated Bcl-2; CsA and ATR showed corresponding function. Conclusions: Salidroside administration restrains apoptosis induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells. The protective effects are mediated by preservation of mitochondrial integrity and MMP to inhibit the excessive Ca2+ influx and caspase-3 activity and to promote the Bcl-2 expression, providing a potential clinical and effective therapeutic mechanism to reduce deaths from ischemic or hypoxic injury.

Here, we investigated the sustained effect of acupuncture by evaluating centrality changes in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after manually stimulating the acupuncture point ST36 at the lower leg or two control point locations (CP1 same dermatome, CP2 different dermatome). Data from a previously published experiment evaluating instant BOLD effects and S2-seed-based resting state connectivity was re-analyzed using eigenvector centrality mapping and degree centrality mapping. These data driven methods might add new insights into sustained acupuncture effects on both global and local inter-region connectivity (centrality) by evaluating the summary of connections of every voxel. We found higher centrality in parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus after ST36 stimulation in comparison to the two control points. These regions are positively correlated to major hubs of the default mode network, which might be the primary network affected by chronic pain. The stronger integration of both regions within the whole-brain connectome after stimulation of ST36 might be a potential contributor to pain modulation by acupuncture. These findings highlight centrality mapping as a valuable analysis for future imaging studies investigating clinically relevant outcomes associated with physiological response to acupuncture stimulation.

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with T2DM were enrolled in the study, who only took metformin (500-1000 mg/day) for at least three months and with inadequate glycemic control (7.0% <= 5 hemoglobin A1c <= 9.0%) in the past three months. The patients stopped taking metformin with lifestyle interventions for three weeks, and 105 patients qualified for the program. They were randomly divided into the Sancai powder group and the metformin group (1500 mg/day). The follow-up period was for 12 weeks. Comparisons of several variables were analyzed. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two groups in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2 h post-meal glucose (2hPG), although they had decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function. index was significantly improved in Sancai powder group (P < 0.01), and there were significant differences in the changes of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity index in the two groups (P < 0.05). Sancai powder significantly reduced triglyceride level (P < 0.05), although there was no significant difference in the body weight and body mass index in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this 12-week study, Sancai powder could significantly reduce hemoglobin A1c, FPG and 2hPG levels, improved beta-cell function and insulin resistance of the T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin.

The mechanism of its antidiabetic effect has been known as it can competitively inhibit sodium-glucose symporters (SGLTs). However, phlorizin has a wide range of two-phase metabolism in systemic circulation and shows poor oral bioavailability. An alternative mechanism may involve gut microbiota in intestine. Sixteen obese mice with type 2 diabetes (db/db) and eight age-matched control mice (db/+) were divided into three groups: diabetic group treated with phlorizin (DMT group), vehicle-treated diabetic group (DM group), and normal control group (CC group). Phlorizin was given in normal saline solution by intragastric administration for 10 weeks. After the last treatment course, body weight, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), insulin resistance, and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were compared. 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR were used to determine the changes in microbiome composition. Coadministration of phlorizin significantly prevented metabolic syndrome by decreasing weight gain, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides, and insulin resistance, and the fecal level of total SCFAs was dramatically increased, especially butyric acid. DGGE and quantitative PCR demonstrated that phlorizin coadministration increased the gut microbial diversity and the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila and Prevotella. Meanwhile, the gut microbiota structure of db/db mice after phlorizin treatment was improved and approached the normal group. The mechanism of the hypoglycemic action of phlorizin is associated with LPS decrease and gut microbiota changes; briefly, it acts in the intestine to modify gut microbial community structure, resulting in lower LPS load in the host and higher SCFAs producing beneficial bacteria.

F.H. Chen, called Sanqi in China, is a perennial herb that has been used as a medicinal herb in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 400 years. Because notoginseng is included in many proprietary Chinese medicines, the quality of notoginseng directly affects its efficacy and safety. However, considering the complex and special growth environment requirements of notoginseng, it is insufficient to evaluate its quality based solely on the analysis of marker chemicals. Thus, in this study, we tried to evaluate the quality of notoginseng with integrated indicators: (1) the concentration of five marker chemicals, notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd; (2) the anticoagulant activity (ACA); and (3) twenty-one ecological factors (e.g., longitude, latitude, elevation and soil data). Using these 27 parameters, notoginseng from different regions could be distinguished effectively, indicating a remarkable divergence of quality. A correlation analysis showed that variations of the ecological factors were closely associated with the saponins content and biopotency. For instance, the total nitrogen (TN), alkali hydrolysis nitrogen (AHN) and rapidly available potassium (RAPT) were significantly correlated with ACA, and RAPT was significantly correlated with the content of ginsenoside Rd and notoginsenoside R1. The results demonstrated that the high-quality notoginseng was produced from the emerging regions such as Kunming, Qujing and Honghe, which had higher ACA and saponin content than the notoginseng produced in traditional regions such as Wenshan and Baise.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. (PPAR.) is a nuclear receptor regulating inflammation and microglial polarization and, therefore, a potential target for resolving depressive disorders. Our hypothesis was that antidepressant effects could be achieved through anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities by PPAR.-dependent microglia-modulating agents. Methods: Chronic mild stress (CMS) treatment was performed on C57BL/6 mice for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks with the CMS procedure, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by sucrose preference (SP), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), and locomotor activity. Pioglitazone was administered intragastrically once per day for 3 weeks at different doses. Neuroinflammatory cytokines were determined by real time-PCR (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blot. The activated microglial state was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. N9 microglial cells were subjected to lipopolysaccharide, pioglitazone, and GW9662 to discuss the phenotype of activated microglia by RT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot. Results: It was demonstrated that the PPAR. agonist pioglitazone (2.5 mg/kg) ameliorated depression-like behaviors in CMS-treated mice, as indicated by body weight (BW), the SP test, the FST, and the TST. The amelioration of the depression was blocked by the PPAR. antagonist GW9662. The expression of M1 markers (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF alpha, iNOS, and CCL2) increased, and the gene expression of M2 markers (Ym1, Arg1, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF beta) decreased in the hippocampus of the stress-treated mice. Pioglitazone significantly inhibited the increased numbers and morphological alterations of microglia in the hippocampus, reduced the elevated expression of microglial M1 markers, and increased the downgraded expression of microglial M2 markers in C57BL/6 mice exposed to CMS. In an in vitro experiment, pioglitazone reversed the imbalance of M1 and M2 inflammatory cytokines, which is correlated with the inhibition of nuclear factor kB activation and is expressed in LPS-stimulated N9 microglial cells. Conclusions: We showed that pioglitazone administration induce the neuroprotective phenotype of microglia and ameliorate depression-like behaviors in CMS-treated C57BL/6 mice. These data suggested that the microglia-modulating agent pioglitazone present a beneficial choice for depression.

Methods: GLT nanosuspension (GLT-NS) was prepared by high pressure homogenization and then suitably gelled to obtain GLT nanogel. The effects of TUS on GLT releasing from GLT nanogel and GLT permeation through the excised rat abdominal skin were evaluated. Moreover, a comparative study was also undertaken between different treatments of frostbite in rats: topical application of GLT nanogel (alone), TUS (alone) and GLT nanogel + TUS (plus). Results: In the in vitro release study, TUS has no influence on drug release from the nanogel. Results of the in vitro transdermal study indicated that TUS significantly increased the cumulative amount of GLT permeating across and into the skin and reduced the lag time in comparison with passive diffusion (without TUS). As evidenced by the significant increase of wound healing area and the improvement in frostbite, TUS applied with simultaneous treatment method could improve the therapeutic effect of the GLT nanogel for frostbite. Conclusion: The present study revealed that the TUS can be effectively used to actively enhance topical delivery of GLT from nanogel and improve the therapeutic effect for frostbite in rats.

Methods: The pH of aqueous extracts of AN and charred AN (CAN) were measured by a pH meter, and their absorbances at 420 nm were read in an ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer. Changes in saccharides and amino acids were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and automated amino acid analyzer, respectively. Results: The pH of AN (5.85 +/- 0.09) was lower than that of CAN (5.25 +/- 0.04). Stir-baking significantly increased the A(420) value of AN (0.32 +/- 0.01 to 0.62 +/- 0.02 (CAN). In addition, the contents of reducing saccharides (fructose and glucose) and free amino acids (serine, lysine, arginine and proline) were significantly decreased in the stir-baked CAN compared with AN. Conclusion: MR, during stir-baking of AN, decreases levels of free amino acids and reducing sugars due probably to the reaction between saccharides and amino acids.

Both herpetrione (HPE) and herpetin (HPN) are the most abundant ingredients in HTL and exhibit weak acidity. The purpose of the present study was to produce dried preparations of HTL (composed of HPE and HPN) nanosuspensions (HTL-NS) with high redispersibility using lyophilization technology. The HTL-NS was prepared by utilizing precipitation-combined homogenization technology based on acid-base neutralization reactions, and critical formulation and process parameters affecting the characteristics of HTL-NS were optimized. The resultant products were characterized by particle size analysis, SEM, XRD, stability, solubility, dissolution and in vivo bioavailability. HTL-NS showed near-spherical-shaped morphology and the size was 243 nm with a narrow PDI value of 0.187. The dried preparations with a relatively large particle size of 286 nm and a PDI of 0.215 were achieved by using 4% (W/V) mannitol as cryoprotectants, and had a better stability at 4 or 25 degrees C for 2 months, compared to HTL-NS. In the in vitro test, the dried preparations showed markedly increased solubility and dissolution velocity. Besides, in the in vivo evaluation, it exhibited significant increases in AUC(0-t), C-max,C- MRT and a decrease in T-max,compared to the raw drug. In conclusion, our results provide a basis for the development of a drug delivery system for poorly water-soluble ingredients with pH-dependent solubility.

Despite various data on antiviral activities of some anti-flu CHMs have been reported, most of them could not be compared using the standard evaluation methods for antiviral activity. This situation poses an obstacle to a wide application of anti-flu CHMs. Thus, it was necessary to develop an evaluation method to estimate antiviral activities of anti-flu CHMs. In the present study, we searched for anti-flu CHMs, based on clinic usage, to select study objects from commonly-used patented anti-flu Chinese medicines. Then, a neuraminidase-based bioassay, optimized and verified by HPLC method by our research group, was adopted to detect antiviral activities of selected 26 anti-flu CHMs. Finally, eight of these herbs, including Coptidis Rhizoma, Isatidis Folium, Lonicerae Flos, Scutellaria Radix, Cyrtomium Rhizome, Houttuynia Cordata, Gardeniae Fructus, and Chrysanthemi Indici Flos, were shown to have strong antiviral activities with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values being 2.02 to 6.78 mg.mL(-1) (expressed as raw materials). In contrast, the IC50 value of positive control peramivir was 0.38 mg.mL(-1). Considering the extract yields of CHMs, the active component in these herbs may have a stronger antiviral activity than peramivir, suggesting that these herbs could be further researched for active compounds. Moreover, the proposed neuraminidase-based bioassay was high-throughput and simple and could be used for evaluation and screening of anti-flu CHMs as well as for their quality control.

By employing Hilbert-Huang transform based prefiltering, the background intensities and modulation amplitudes of the two interferograms are suppressed and normalized respectively. With the addition and subtraction operation of the two prefiltered interferograms, two parametric equations are achieved which can be regarded as the complex harmonic motion of the Lissajous figure. The phase of the Lissajous figure can be directly demodulated by the ellipse fitting algorithm. Apart from the advantages of other well-known two-step phase demodulation algorithms, i.e., high accuracy and efficiency of the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization (GS) method and the less stringent requirement concerning the fringe number in the extreme value of interference (EVI) method, proposed Lissajous figure and ellipse fitting (LEF) approach has another bonus related to its robustness to the fluctuations of the fringe patterns noise, background intensity and modulation amplitude. Simulations demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method, and experiments further corroborate its effectiveness.

Methods: A meta-analysis was done, analyzing the association between epilepsy and SAD using the available data in Medline and Embase through February 2016. We followed the recommendations of the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) statement and the MOOSE (meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines. Results: A total of twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, which included 10,972 patients with epilepsy (PWE) and 2,618,637 patients with SAD. The PWE cohort was shown to have more than a 2.5-fold increased risk of SAD. The patients with SAD were also shown to have a more than 2.5-fold increased risk of epilepsy. The results indicated that patients <20 years of age had a 3-fold increased risk of SAD and epilepsy (OR = 3.04 [95% CI 1.27-7.27], P= 0.01; OR = 3.15 [95% CI 1.92-5.15], P < 0.01; respectively), and these risks were shown to be higher than patients >20 years of age. The PWE cohort had a 2.6-fold increased risk of celiac disease (OR = 2.65 [95% CI 1.41-4.97],P < 0.01). The patients with systemic lupus erythematosus had a 4.5-fold increased risk of epilepsy (OR = 4.57 [95% CI 2.40-8.67], P < 0.01). Conclusions: There is an association between epilepsy and SAD, which was shown to be stronger at a young age. (C) 2016 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

HBsAg positivity during pregnancy and adverse maternal outcomes: a retrospective cohort analysis	JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS			English	Article						caesarean section; gestational diabetes; HBsAg positivity; intrahepatic cholestasis; postpartum haemorrhage	HEPATITIS-B-VIRUS; CARRIER STATUS; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; SERUM FERRITIN; INFECTION; RISK; COMPLICATIONS; PREECLAMPSIA; PREVALENCE; IMPACT	Hepatitis B virus infection characterized by HBsAg positivity during pregnancy is a well-recognized issue in developing countries, but the association between HBsAg positivity and adverse maternal outcomes remains uncertain. To examine the association between HBsAg positivity during pregnancy and adverse maternal outcomes, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in Sichuan province, China. Deliveries were recorded from six hospitals between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010. Pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), intrahepatic cholestasis, Caesarean section and placenta previa were prespecified adverse maternal outcomes. We used two multivariate logistic regression models to assess the association between HBsAg positivity and adverse maternal outcomes. In total, 948 (4.2%) pregnant women were HBsAg positive from 22 374 deliveries. Pregnant women with positive HBsAg had higher risk of GDM (aOR1.41, 95%CI 1.15-1.74), PPH (1.44, 1.13-1.83), intrahepatic cholestasis (1.74, 1.40-2.16) and Caesarean section (1.24, 1.06-1.45). No statistical associations were found between HBsAg positivity and pre-eclampsia (1.36, 0.94-1.97), and placenta previa (1.21, 0.87-1.67). HBsAg positivity during pregnancy was associated with higher risk of multiple adverse maternal outcomes. Although the causality has yet to be established, efforts may be warranted in routine care, particularly in those with high risk for adverse maternal outcomes, given the volume population infected with HBsAg. Future studies are needed to establish causality and examine the impact of HBeAg on the adverse outcomes.

Condom Use During Commercial Sex Among Male Clients of Female Sex Workers in Sichuan China: A Social Cognitive Theory Analysis	AIDS AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Male clients; Commercial sex; Social cognitive theory; Condom use; HIV; China	SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; RISK BEHAVIORS; STD/HIV TRANSMISSION; HIV TRANSMISSION; HONG-KONG; PREVALENCE; PROSTITUTION; PREVENTION; PROVINCE	There has been little theory-based research focusing on condom use among male clients of female sex workers (CFSW) in China. The current study applied social cognitive theory to condom use behaviors of CFSW in China. Face-to-face structured interviews were conducted among 584 CFSW recruited through snowball sampling. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied to examine factors associated with consistent condom use. A minority (30.65 %) of respondents reported using condoms consistently with FSW, and 7 of 12 social cognitive dimensions/subdimensions were found to be significantly influential. The most significant factors were self-efficacy [adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) = 2.11, 95 %, CI = 1.74-2.43] and personal pleasure reduction (APR = 0.3, 95 % CI = 0.15-0.6). HIV-related knowledge, perceived HIV susceptibility, condom cost, condom efficacy, and embarrassment of carrying condoms were not associated with consistent condom uses with FSW. Findings from the current study suggest future prevention programs should target sex venues, and condom access should ensure both quantity and quality. Peer education should focus on knowledge education and peer norms, and knowledge education should include information on HIV infection severity and how to increase pleasure with condom use.

A systematic literature was performed to identify previous research related to the diagnostic performance of DW-MRI for determining whether human renal lesions were benign or malignant. ADC values were extracted from normal renal tissue and different lesion types. Data were extracted to assess the diagnostic performance of DW-MRI for differentiating malignant and benign human renal lesions, as well as running threshold effect and heterogeneity. Nine publications with 11 subsets were eligible for data extraction and diagnostic performance calculation. A total of 988 apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements were included. The differences in ADC values between benign lesions (2.47 +/- 0.81 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and malignant lesions (1.81 +/- 0.41 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The diagnostic odds ratio, the overall positive, negative likelihood ratios, pooled weighted sensitivity and specificity with 95% CI were 20.05 (95% CI 12.56-32.02), 3.32 (95% CI 2.13-5.18), 0.20 (95% CI 0.15-0.27), 88% (95% CI 0.84-0.91) and 72% (95% CI 0.67-0.76), respectively. The area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.90. This meta-analysis indicated that DW-MRI had a relatively good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating malignant and benign human renal lesions. We preliminarily recommend that DW-MRI is performed with a maximum b value ranging from 800 to 1000 s/mm(2) at 3.0 T for imaging protocol, and that DW-MRI should be used with caution when the study population includes children.

Materials and methods: After collagen induced arthritis (CIA) were established in rats, the animals were orally administered with ERCP (130, 260 and 520 mg/kg) for 30 days. During the treatment, the rats' body weights, arthritis indices and paw volumes were measured every 5 days. Subsequently, rats' blood samples were collected to determine TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein (CRP) contents in serum. Then, rats were sacrificed and the hind paws and knee joints were collected for histopathological examination. Results: Our results indicated that ERCP significantly suppressed the inflammatory reactions and destructions in joints and synovial tissues. ERCP inhibited the paw swelling and arthritis index in CIA rats. Additionally, it decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6) and CRP, whereas increased that of IL-10. Conclusion: Our results suggested ERCP has significant anti-arthritic effect on CIA rats, and the pharmacological mechanisms are related to the down-regulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and CRP and the up- regulation of IL-10.

In order to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between FKBP5 variants and MDD risk, seven studies involving 26582 subjects, including 12491 cases with MDD and 14091 controls, were enrolled totally. Four common SNPs (rs1360780, rs4713916, rs3800373 and rs755658) with complete data from two or more studies were analyzed. In the total sample, there was no evidence of a significant association between MDD and any of the four SNPs using a random-effects model. However, after removing one heterogeneous German study, as indicated by sensitivity analysis, both the rs1360780 T-allele (Z = 2.95, P = 0.003, OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.11) and the rs3800373 C-allele (Z = 3.05, P = 0.002, OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) were significantly associated with MDD in a fixed-effect model. Our study thus provides support for an association between specific FKBP5 genetic variants and MDD risk. Rs4713916 was not significantly associated with MDD; However, this analysis had limited statistical power and larger sample sizes are required to further validate this result. Future research should also investigate possible gender- and ethnicity-specific differences in the association between FKBP5 and MDD.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of TXET on mitochondrial function, energy metabolism and cognitive amelioration in the APPswe/PS1De9 transgenetic mouse model of AD. The energy charge and phosphocreatine, activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane potential, activity of Na+-K+ ATPase and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in the brains were measured, respectively. TXET exhibits significant protection on mitochondrial function and energy supply in addition to ameliorating cognitive decline in APPswe/PS1De9 mice. TXET rescues mitochondrial function by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, energy charge levels, activity of respiratory chain complexes and Na+-K+ ATPase activity. These findings suggest that TXET may attenuate cognition impairment through the restoration of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in the brains in APPswe/PS1De9 mice.

Herein, infrared-assisted technique is employed for the first time to extract BSP from B. striata (Thunb.) Reichb.f. based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology, with the optimum extraction parameters as follows: 75 degrees C extraction temperature, 2.5 h extraction time; and water to solid ratio (53 ml/g). Based on it, 43.95 +/- 0.26% yield of crude BSP was obtained. Subsequently, crude BSP was further decolorized, deproteinized, freeze-dried, and purified by a DEAE-52 cellulose column. Furthermore, the micro-structure and a triple-helical structure of BSP were characterized. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed its polysaccharide characterization via typical peaks. In addition, the significant in vitro antioxidant profiles of BSP were demonstrated by superoxide anion radical-scavenging assay, hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, DPPH free radical scavenging activity and chelation of ferrous ions. Taken together, this study provide an efficient extraction technique for BSP as a promising natural antioxidant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the current study, we examined structural changes in these brain regions by taking structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of 11 ischemic stroke patients and 15 healthy participants, and analyzing the data using voxel-based morphometry. Compared with healthy participants, patients exhibited higher gray matter density in the left inferior occipital gyrus and right anterior white matter tract. In contrast, gray matter density in the right cerebellum, left precentral gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus was less in ischemic stroke patients. The changes of gray matter density in the middle frontal gyrus were negatively associated with the clinical rating scales of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (r = -0.609, P = 0.047) and the left middle temporal gyrus was negatively correlated with the clinical rating scales of the nervous functional deficiency scale (r = -0.737, P = 0.010). Our findings can objectively identify the functional abnormality in some brain regions of ischemic stroke patients.

Methods: A simple, precise and accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was first developed for simultaneous quantification of four active alkaloids (magnoflorine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, and berberine) in Cortex berberidis obtained from Qinghai, Tibet and Sichuan Provinces of China. Method validation was performed in terms of precision, repeatability, stability, accuracy, and linearity. Besides, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied to study the quality variations of Cortex berberidis from various geographical origins. Results: The proposed HPLC method showed good linearity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy. The four alkaloids were detected in all samples of Cortex berberidis. Among them, magnoflorine (36.46 - 87.30 mg/g) consistently showed the highest amounts in all the samples, followed by berberine (16.00 - 37.50 mg/g). The content varied in the range of 0.66 - 4.57 mg/g for palmatine and 1.53 -16.26 mg/g for jatrorrhizine, respectively. The total content of the four alkaloids ranged from 67.62 to 114.79 mg/g. Moreover, the results obtained by the PLS-DA and ANOVA showed that magnoflorine level and the total content of these four alkaloids in Qinghai and Tibet samples were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those in Sichuan samples. Conclusion: Quantification of multi-ingredients by HPLC combined with statistical methods provide an effective approach for achieving origin discrimination and quality evaluation of Cortex berberidis. The quality of Cortex berberidis closely correlates to the geographical origin of the samples, with Cortex berberidis samples from Qinghai and Tibet exhibiting superior qualities to those from Sichuan.

Subsequently, blood was collected to determine serum levels of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-10, MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9, and hind paws and knee joints were collected for histopathological examination. Furthermore, indices of the thymus and spleen were determined, and synovial tissues were collected to determine the protein expressions of p-IB, IB, Cox-2 and iNOS. Our results indicated that matrine significantly suppressed inflammatory reactions and synovial tissue destruction. Matrine inhibited paw swelling, arthritis indices and weight loss in CIA rats. Additionally, matrine decreased the levels of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9. Matrine also down-regulated expressions of p-IB, Cox-2, and iNOS but up-regulated IB in synovial tissues in CIA rats. The results suggested matrine possesses an anti-arthritic effect in CIA rats via inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteins that promote the NF-B pathway.

Salvianolic acid B (SalB) has shown a variety of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. In this study, we examined whether SalB produced antidepressant-like actions in a chronic mild stress (CMS) mouse model, and explored the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like actions of SalB. Methods: Mice were subjected to a CMS paradigm for 6 weeks. In the last 3 weeks the mice were daily administered SalB (20 mg.kg(-1). d(-1), ip) or a positive control drug imipramine (20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1), ip). The depressant-like behaviors were evaluated using the sucrose preference test, the forced swimming test (FST), and the tail suspension test (TST). The gene expression of cytokines in the hippocampus and cortex was analyzed with RT-PCR. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and cerebral cytokines levels were assayed with an ELISA kit. Neural apoptosis and microglial activation in brain tissues were detected using immunofluorescence staining. Results: Administration of SalB or imipramine reversed the reduced sucrose preference ratio of CMS-treated mice, and significantly decreased their immobility time in the FST and TST. Administration of SalB significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and markedly increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta in the hippocampus and cortex of CMS-treated mice, and normalized their elevated plasma CORT levels, whereas administration of imipramine did not significantly affect the imbalance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and cortex of CMS-treated mice. Finally, administration of SalB significantly decreased CMS-induced apoptosis and microglia activation in the hippocampus and cortex, whereas administration of imipramine had no significant effect on CMS-induced apoptosis and microglia activation in the hippocampus and cortex. Conclusion: SalB exerts potent antidepressant-like effects in CMS-induced mouse model of depression, which is associated with the inhibiting microglia-related apoptosis in the hippocampus and the cortex.

Though rs1006737 in the CACNA1C gene showed significant association with MDD in a British large-scale candidate association study, most of the replication analyses with relatively small sample size reported negative association. Moreover, this locus has never been identified in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for MDD. Here, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between CACNA1C variants and MDD risk by combining all published data. Genetic data from one European GWAS and five individual follow-up studies, which include up to 12,629 patients of MDD and 28,653 controls, that is, the largest sample size on CACNA1C to date, were collected. Rs1006737 showed significant association with MDD in the fixed-effect model (Z=2.56, P=0.011, OR=1.08, 95%CI=1.04-1.12) and the association remained after reanalyzing the data according to ethnicity. We additionally analyzed other 25 SNPs, genotyped in only one replication study, across the CACNA1C locus, and found that two SNPs, rs4765905 (P=0.041, OR=1.05, 95%CI 1.00-1.09) and rs4765937 (P=0.025, OR=1.05, 95%CI 1.01-1.09) showed nominal association with MDD, while rs2239073 (P=0.002, OR=1.07, 95%CI 1.02-1.11) exhibited significant association with MDD, which survived from multiple corrections. Our study provides support for positive association between CACNA1C and MDD; however, the current data suggest the necessity of replication analyses in a larger-scale sample.

A mutation in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) also leads to chemoresistance in tumors; however, in CCRCC, TP53 is frequently functional, yet the tumors remain highly insensitive to chemotherapy. This indicates the possibility of a synergistic effect of VHL and P53 in CCRCC. The present study aimed to detect the chemosensitivity of CCRCC. The expression of VHL in the MZ1257 cell line sensitized these cells to ADM and sunitinib, and a knockdown of VHL in the ACHN cells increased their chemoresistance. To confirm that VHL and P53 are both required for chemosensitivity, VHL and P53 were co-expressed in 786-O cells. The results of the functional antagonist assay (which assessed the IC50 values, i.e. the half maximal inhibitory concentration) confirmed that VHL and P53 act in synergy to promote chemosensitivity. Cell cycle arrest was measured by propidium iodide staining following treatment with ADM or sunitinib. Further analysis indicated that co-expression of VHL and P53 inhibited cell proliferation by completely inhibiting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and promoted apoptosis following treatment with ADM or sunitinib. These findings demonstrated that VHL and P53 act synergistically in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in CCRCC. Overall, VHL and P53 have important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in CCRCC. Furthermore, the regulatory role of VHL is dependant on the activation P53.

Ginger can easily be polluted with mycotoxins. In this study, ginger samples were cultivated for 15 days after inoculation with fungi and were prepared based on ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction using methanol/water followed by immunoaffinity column clean-up and analysed by ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) for AFs and OTA. RESULTSThe limits of detection and quantification of AFs and OTA were 0.04-0.30 mu g mL(-1) and 0.125-1.0 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The recoveries were 82.0-100.2%. After 15 days' cultivation, no macroscopic mildew was found in ginger. But, the content of AFB(1) expressed an increasing trend in ginger, peel [less than the limit of quantification (LOQ)] to the innermost layer (51.86 mu mL(-1) ), AFB(2) was only detected in the innermost layer at the level of 0.87 mu mL(-1). A small amount (<LOQ) of OTA was found in the peel of ginger after the two fungi were inoculated on the surface of ginger. CONCLUSIONThe developed method was successfully applied to analyse five mycotoxins, and has many advantages including rapid determination and high sensitivity. Meanwhile, in practice, more attention should be paid to the safety and quality of ginger.

DIELS; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; IN-VIVO	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, known as Dang Gui (in Chinese), is a traditional medicinal and edible plant that has long been used for tonifying, replenishing, and invigorating blood as well as relieving pain, lubricating the intestines, and treating female irregular menstruation and amenorrhea. A. sinensis has also been used as a health product and become increasingly popular in China, Japan, and Korea. Aim of the review: This paper aims to provide a systemic review of traditional uses of A. sinensis and its recent advances in the fields of phytochemistry, analytical methods and toxicology. In addition, possible trends, therapeutic potentials, and perspectives for future research of this plant are also briefly discussed. Materials and methods: An extensive review of the literature was conducted, and electronic databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Reaxys were used to assemble the data. Ethnopharmacological literature and digitalised sources of academic libraries were also systematically searched. In addition, information was obtained from local books and The Plant List (TPL, www.theplantlist.org). Result: This study reviews the progress in chemical analysis of A. sinensis and its preparations. Previously and newly established methods, including spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra-performance liquid chromatography(UPLC), and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (NMR), are summarized. Moreover, identified bioactive components such as polysaccharides, ligustilide and ferulic acid were reviewed, along with analytical methods for quantitative and qualitative determination of target analytes, and fingerprinting authentication, quality evaluation of A. sinensis, and toxicology and pharmacodynamic studies. Scientific reports on crude extracts and pure compounds and formulations revealed a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory activity, antifibrotic action, antispasmodic activity, antioxidant activities, and neuroprotective action, as well as cardio- and cerebrovascular effects. Conclusions: Within the published scientific literature are numerous reports regarding analytical methods that use various chromatographic and spectrophotometric technologies to monitor various types of components with different physicochemical properties simultaneously. This review discusses the reasonable selection of marker compounds based on high concentrations, analytical methods, and commercial availabilities with the goal of developing quick, accurate, and applicable analytical approaches for quality evaluation and establishing harmonised criteria for the analysis of A. sinensis and its finished products. Compounds isolated from A. sinensis are abundant sources of chemical diversity, from which we can discover active molecules. Thus, more studies on the pharmacological mechanisms of the predominant active compounds of A. sinensis are needed. In addition, given that A. sinensis is one of the most popular traditional herbal medicines, its main therapeutic aspects, toxicity, and adverse effects warrant further investigation in the future.

It is important to elucidate the in vivo role of CYPs in secondary metabolism, in order to apply them in the production of valuable metabolites in medicinal plants via metabolic engineering. CYP76AH1 has been suggested to catalyze the conversion of the carbon skeleton miltiradiene into the intermediate ferruginol, which is involved in the biosynthesis of tanshinones, the chief bioactive ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza. However, its role in planta remains to be elucidated. In this work, we constructed a CYP76AH1 RNAi system for hairy roots. Metabolic analysis of RNAi-AH1 hairy root lines showed a significantly increased accumulation of miltiradiene compared to the control lines. At the same time, the concentration of ferruginol decreased revealing the in vivo catalytic activity of CYP76AHl. The content of tanshinones decreased significantly after silencing of CYP76AH1, which verified its key role in the biosynthesis of tanshinones, and indicated that it could be used as a target for metabolic engineering.

Previous studies have demonstrated that Sophocarpine exerts activity in immune modulation. It also has a therapeutic effect on liver protection in that it can alleviate liver fibrosis by suppressing both the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the proliferation of the activated hepatic stellate cells. However, whether Sophocarpine protects the liver by regulating NK cell activity remains unclear. In this study, the modulating effect of Sophocarpine on NK cells in the liver was investigated. The results showed that Sophocarpine dramatically decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuated the liver injury induced by Poly I: C/D-GaIN in C57113L/6- mice. More importantly, Sophocarpine pretreatment significantly suppressed NK cell activation and downregulated the expression of NKG2D, a receptor responsible for NK cell activation. Moreover, the protein levels of DAP12, ZAP76 and Syk decreased, as did their corresponding mRNA levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that Sophocarpine inhibits NK cell activity, thus making it a promising therapy for ILL	[Huang, Yin-Qiu; Zhou, Hou-Qin; Yang, Zhi-Rui] Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Coll Pharm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yin-Qiu; Zhou, Hou-Qin; Yang, Zhi-Rui; Zhao, Yan-Ling] 302 Mil Hosp China, Dept Pharm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Peng-Yan; Wang, Jia-Bo; Bai, Zhao-Fang; Xiao, Xiao-He] 302 Mil Hosp China, China Mil Inst Chinese Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Rui-Chuang] 302 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Res Ctr Clin & Translat Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Li-Fu; Li, Jian-Yu; Liu, Hong-Hong] 302 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Dept Integrat Med Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China	Zhao, YL (reprint author), 302 Mil Hosp China, Dept Pharm, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Xiao, XH (reprint author), 302 Mil Hosp China, China Mil Inst Chinese Med, Beijing, Peoples R China.	zhaoyl2855@126.com; xiaoxiaohe302@126.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China [81330090]; Major Projects of the National Science and Technology [2012ZX10005010-002-002]; National Natural Science Foundation Project of China [81303120, 81173571]	The current work was supported by the Major Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81330090), the Major Projects of the National Science and Technology (no. 2012ZX10005010-002-002) and the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (no. 81303120) and (no. 81173571).		34	1	1	5	5	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1663-9812			FRONT PHARMACOL	Front.

Emerging evidence indicates that the inflammasome plays a central role in regulating immune cells and cytokines related to cancer. The inflammasome is a multimeric complex consisting of Nod-like receptors (NLRs) and responds to a variety of endogenous (damage-associated molecular patterns) and exogenous (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) stimuli. Several lines of evidence suggests that in cancer the inflammasome is positively associated with characteristics such as elevated levels of IL-1 beta and IL-18, activation of NF-kappa B signaling, enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress, and activation of autophagic process. A number of NLRs, such as NLRP3 and NLRC4 are also highlighted in carcinogenesis and closely correlate to chemoresponse and prognosis. Although conflicting evidence suggested the duplex role of inflammasome in cancer development, the phenomenon might be attributed to NLRs difference, cell and tissue type, cancer stage, and specific experimental conditions. Given the promising role of inflammasome in mediating cancer development, precise elucidation of its signaling network and pathological significance may lead to novel therapeutic options for malignancy therapy and prevention.

Compared with that of MO, the pharmacokinetic profiling of HO and MA in the PMO was significantly changed and the mean T-max of HO and MA was increased by 31 and 50% (P < 0.05), respectively; the mean AUC(0-t) and C-max of HO were increased by 36 and 24% (P < 0.05), respectively. Subsequently, the chemical profiling of MO and PMO was investigated by a simple and rapid LC-Q/TOF-MS coupled with multivariate analysis method. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis of the chromatographic data demonstrated that the chemical profiling of PMO was significantly different from that of MO. Eight marker components including six alkaloids (magnocurarine, magnoflorine, roemerine and three unidentified peaks) and two lignans (obovatol and MA) were screened out by partial least-squares discriminant analysis. The results indicated that the changes of eight marker components of PMO may have an effect on the pharmacokinetic profiles of HO and MA.

Methods: CPA samples collected from different production areas in China were subjected to microwave digestion, and the contents of copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), tin (Sn), and antimony (Sb) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Heavy metal levels in the CPA samples followed the order: Cu (3.29-24.17 mg/kg) > Cr (0.04-7.33 mg/kg) > Ni (0.88-6.86 mg/kg) > Pb (0.00-3.84 mg/kg) > As (0.0011-1.08 mg/kg) > Cd (0.029-0.211 mg/kg) > Sb (0.03-0.21 mg/kg) > Sn (0.00-0.15 mg/kg) > Hg (0.000-0.032 mg/kg). Metal-to-metal correlation studies showed that there were significant correlations between Cu-Cr (p = -4.02), Cu-Ni (p = 0.561), Cu-As (p = 0.554) and Ni-As (p = 0.428) at the 0.01 level. Also, some metal-to-metal correlations were observed in Pb-Cr (p = 0.351), Pb-Cu (p = -0.310), Sb-Cd (p = 0.322), Sb-Hg (p = 0.311) and Cd-Sn (p = 0.309) at the 0.05 level. The highest concentrations of Pb and As in CPA exceeded the maximum permissible limits in China. Based on current safety standards, the concentrations of heavy metals in these CPA samples mean they are safe for human consumption. Conclusions: The status of heavy metal concentrations of CPA should be further investigated in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Jiangsu. In addition, ICP-MS is a reliable and rapid technique for the determination of the heavy metals in CPA.

Patchouli alcohol, an ingredient in pogostemonis herba, has the potential to treat inflammation as well as bacterial and fungal infections. The essential oil of pogostemonis herba (patchouli oil) is commonly given orally in clinical settings; however, no pharmacokinetic studies have examined its oral administration. The goal of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of patchouli alcohol following single-dose oral administration in rats; the influence of other patchouli oil components on the pharmacokinetic profile of patchouli alcohol was also examined. In this study, a simple and selective GC/MS method was developed and validated to measure the level of patchouli alcohol in rat plasma. The study revealed that the pharmacokinetics profile was linear in both the patchouli alcohol and patchouli oil groups. The C (max) and AUC(0-t) of patchouli alcohol were greater in all three doses of patchouli alcohol compared to corresponding patchouli oil doses. Additionally, the T (max) values were significantly greater in the patchouli oil group. These results suggest that the other ingredients in patchouli oil influence the pharmacokinetic behavior of patchouli alcohol during its absorption. The results provide a meaningful basis for evaluating the clinical application of patchouli oil and patchouli alcohol.

Telomere erosion might be accelerated or prevented to varying degrees when exposure to serious medical illnesses. In previous studies, an association between TL decrease and schizophrenia has been extensively reported; however, the results remain largely controversial. To further investigate TL in schizophrenia patients and reconcile this controversy, we first measured leucocyte TL (LTL) in our samples (52 paranoid schizophrenia, 89 non-paranoid patients and 120 controls), and then conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of the existing results of LTL in patients of schizophrenia compared to healthy subjects. Totally, 11 studies encompassing 1243 patients of schizophrenia and 1274 controls were included in the final meta-analysis model. In our samples, significant reduction of LTL in paranoid schizophrenia was observed compared to controls (F = 50.88, P < 0.001); whereas there was no significant difference in LTL between non-paranoid schizophrenia and controls (F = 0.842, P = 0.360). For meta-analysis, random-effects model showed significant LTL decrease in patients of schizophrenia when compared to controls (Z = 2.07, P = 0.039, SMD = -0.48, 95% CI = -0.94 to -0.03). Moreover, a marginal decrease in LTL was observed in medicated patients (Z = 1.92, P = 0.055, SMD = -0.58, 95% CI = -1.18-0.01) and those patients with poor response to antipsychotics (Z = 1.76, P = 0.078, SMD = -0.60, 95% CI = -1.27-0.07). In conclusion, we observed significant reduction of LTL in individuals with schizophrenia compared with controls. However, all the studies included in the meta-analysis were cross-sectional, and better controlled long-term studies are needed to replicate this result. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To date, antifibrotic treatment of fibrosis still remains an unconquered area for western medicine. Fufang Biejia Ruangan Pill (FFBJ) is the first anti-fibrosis drug approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration, and has been demonstrated to have a good antifibrotic efficacy in China. However, the chemical constituents of FFBJ and the absorption and distribution of it in vivo remain unclear, which restricts its research on bioactive components identification and mechanisms of action. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) combined with ultra performance liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC/QqQ-MS) was applied to identify compounds in FFBJ and its absorbed components in rat serum, liver and urine samples after intragastric administration of FFBJ. As a result, a total of 32 Chinese material medica components including organic acids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and alkaloids, were identified or tentatively characterized, while the distribution of 10 prototype compounds in rat serum, liver and urine were discovered. The identified constituents in FFBJ and the distribution of prototype compounds in rat serum, liver and urine are help for understanding the material bases of its therapeutic effects.

Plasma samples were processed with a protein precipitation. The separation was achieved by an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 1.7 mu m) column with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile. Detection was carried out using positive-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The validated method had an excellent linearity in the range of 1.0-100 ng/mL (r(2) > 0.9967) with a lower limit of quantification (1.0 ng/mL). The extraction recovery was in the range of 79.4-84.2% for tivantinib and 80.3% for carbamazepine (internal standard, IS). The intra- and inter-day precision was below 8.9% and accuracy was from -7.2% to 9.5%. No notable matrix effect and astaticism was observed for tivantinib. The method has been successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of tivantinib in rats for the first time, which provides the basis for the further development and application of tivantinib.

Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the cold/hot property differences of traditional Chinese medicine formulas of Mahuang and Maxingshigan decoctions. Materials and methods: A novel cold/hot pad differentiating assay method based on the Intelligent Animal Temperature Tropism Behavior monitoring system at 20 degrees C (cold pad) and 30 degrees C (hot pad) was introduced to investigate the variability of temperature tropism among the mice treated by 0.4mL/20g (drug volume/body weight) of Mahuang decoction and Maxingshigan decoction, respectively. Meanwhile, the oxygen consumption and activities of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) were measured to explore the energy metabolism mechanism. Results: Results showed that the differences between cold/hot properties of Mahuang decoction and Maxingshigan decoction were significant (p<0.05). Mahuang decoction produced significant synergic effect (a combination index of 1.60), while Maxingshigan decoction expressed significant antagonistic effect (a combination index of 0.35). The changes of energy metabolism including ATPase activity and oxygen consumption might be the possible factors to result in the differences. Those influences tended to be coherent with the definition of cold/hot properties of Chinese medicines based on traditional Chinese medicinal theory. Conclusions: The results indicated that the method based on cold/hot pad differentiating array could objectively and quantitatively represent the cold/hot properties of different compatibilities of traditional Chinese medicines in an ethological way according to the changes of animal's temperature tropism. These findings would provide some experimental basis and data references as well as a novel evaluation method for the study of the regularity of recipe composition.

Methods: Twelve batches of G. rhizoma collected from Sichuan, Guizhou and Shanxi provinces in china were used to establish the fingerprint. The chromatographic peak (gastrodin) was taken as the reference peak, and all sample separation was performed on a Agilent C18 (250 mmx4.6 mmx5 mu m) column with a column temperature of 25 degrees C. The mobile phase was acetonitrile/0.8 % phosphate water solution (in a gradient elution mode) and the flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection wavelength was 270 nm. The method was validated as per the guidelines of Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Results: The chromatograms of the samples showed 11 common peaks, of which no. 4 was identified as that of Gastrodin. Data for the samples were analyzed statistically using similarity analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The similarity index between reference chromatogram and samples' chromatograms were all > 0.80. The similarity index of G. rhizoma from Guizhou, Shanxi and Sichuan is evident as follows: 0.854 - 0.885, 0.915 - 0.930 and 0.820 - 0.848, respectively. The samples could be divided into three clusters at a rescaled distance of 7.5: S1 - S4 as cluster 1; S5 - S8 cluster 2, and others grouped into cluster 3. Conclusion: The findings indicate that HPLC fingerprinting technology is appropriate for quality control and origin discrimination of G. rhizoma.

Analytes were analyzed on an Agilent 6460 LC-MS/MS system (Agilent, USA) using an Agilent Zorbax SB-C-18 column (4.6x150mm, 5m). Gradient elution was applied for the analyte separation using a mobile phase composed of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution and methanol at a flow rate of 1.0mL/min with a total running time of 12min. The calibration curves for ISL and NIS showed good linearity in the concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 4.000g/mL with correlation coefficients >0.998. The precision, accuracy, recovery and stability were deemed acceptable. The method was applied to the pharmacokinetics study of ISL and NIS in rats by single and combination administration. The result showed that C-max and AUC(0t) of ISL were markedly increased from 0.53 to 1.20g/mL, and from 69.63 to 200.74ming/mL by combination administration. The mean t(1/2) value was also prolonged from 64.55 to 203.74min in the combination group. These results indicated that NIS may have been metabolized to ISL which increased the absorption and extended the elimination of ISL. However, little difference was found for NIS pharmacokinetics parameters between single NIS and the combination group, which suggested that there was no significant biotransformation of ISL to NIS.

In this study, forty rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, model group (carbon tetrachloride, CCl4) and three OMT treatment groups (30, 60, 120 mg/kg). After CCl4 alone, the fibrosis score was 20.2 +/- 0.8, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hydroxyproline content, and collagen I expression was elevated, but OMT blunted these parameters. Treatment with OMT prevented CCl4-induced increases in expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, meanwhile OMT promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic factors such as interleukin (IL)-10 and bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (Bambi). Moreover, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), which activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and modulate hepatic fibrogenesis through hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) or Kupffer cells, were significantly decreased by OMT treatment. These results were further supported by in vitro data. First, OMT suppressed the expression of TLR4 and its downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines, lowered the level of HMGB1, TGF-beta 1 in macrophages. Then, OMT promoted Bambi expression and thereby inhibited activation of HSCs mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1. In conclusion, this study showed that OMT could effectively attenuate the CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis, and this effect may be due to modulation of TLR4-dependent inflammatory and TGF-beta 1 signaling pathways.

Two new terpene synthase genes were isolated from the transcriptome data of Peaonia lactiflora. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence characterization revealed that one gene, named PlPIN, encoded a monoterpene synthase that might be involved in the biosynthesis of paeoniflorin. In vitro enzyme assay showed that, in contrast to most monoterpene synthases, PlPIN encoded an alpha-pinene synthase which converted GPP into alpha-pinene as a single product. This newly identified alpha-pinene synthase could be used for improving paeoniflorin accumulation by metabolic engineering or for producing alpha-pinene via synthetic biology.

Despite the multi-components determination method significantly promoted the progress of herbal quality evaluation, however, which mainly concerned the total amount of multiple components and ignored the activity variation between each one, and did not accurately reflect the biological activity of botanical medicines. In this manuscript, we proposed a toxicity calibrated contents determination method for hyper toxic aconite, called toxic constituents index (TCI). Initially, we determined the minimum lethal dose value of mesaconitine (MA), aconitine (AC), and hypaconitine (HA), and established the equation TCI = 100 x (0.3387 x X-MA + 0.4778 x X-AC + 0.1835 x X-HA). Then, 10 batches of aconite were selected and their evaluation results of toxic potency (TP), diester diterpenoid alkaloids (DDAs), and TCI were compared. Linear regression analysis result suggested that the relevance between TCI and TP was the highest and the correlation coefficient R was 0.954. Prediction error values study also indicated that the evaluation results of TCI was highly consistent with that of TP. Moreover, TCI and DDAs were both applied to evaluate 14 batches of aconite samples oriented different origins; from the different evaluation results, we found when the proportion of HA was reached 25% in DDAs, the pharmacopeia method could generate false positive results. All these results testified the accuracy and universality of TCI method. We believe that this study method is rather accurate, simple, and easy operation and it will be of great utility in studies of other foods and herbs.

Panaxatriol saponin (PTS), the main components extracted from Panax notoginseng, has been shown to be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke in China. The aim of this study is to determine the anti-platelet activity and explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Inhibitory effect of PTS and its main ginsenosides on agonists-induced platelet aggregation was determined using rabbit or human platelets. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) mobilization was detected with fura-2/AM probe. MAPKs phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. Results: Our results showed PTS inhibited the rabbit platelet aggregation induced by various agonists (collagen, thrombin and ADP). The three main ginsenosides (Rg1, Re and R1) existing in PTS also showed anti-platelet activity, while their combination exhibited no synergistic effect on rabbit platelet aggregation. Further study demonstrated that PTS and its main ginsenosides also exhibited inhibitory effect on human platelet aggregation. Mechanism study demonstrated that pre-treatment with PTS inhibited the agonists-induced intracellular calcium mobilization. Moreover, PTS significantly suppressed the activation of both ERK2 and p38 by the agonists via reducing the phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38. Conclusion: We proved that PTS is effective in anti-platelet aggregation, which may, at least in part, be related to the suppression of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK2/p38 activation. This study may provide one reasonable explanation for the efficacy of PTS on the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

However, the chemical constituents and mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of this medicinal plant are poorly understood. Here, coptisine, the main constituent of C. chinensis, was shown to potently inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) by suppressing the protein and mRNA expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Coptisine also inhibited the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1I3 (IL-113) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by suppressing expression of cytokine mRNA. Coptisine suppressed the degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Alt (PI3K/Akt). Coptisine had no effect on the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) as well as LPS binding to TLR-4. Coptisine also inhibited carrageenan-elicited rat paw edema and reduced the release of TNF-oc and NO in rat inflamed tissue. These results suggest that coptisine inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking nuclear factor-kappa B, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt activation in macrophages, and can be used as an agent for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Here, we present the entire chloroplast genome of P. cablin. This genome, with 38.24% GC content, is 152,460 bp in length. The genome presents a typical quadripartite structure with two inverted repeats (each 25,417 bp in length), separated by one small and one large single-copy region (17,652 and 83,974 bp in length, respectively). The chloroplast genome encodes 127 genes, of which 107 genes are single-copy, including 79 protein-coding genes, four rRNA genes, and 24 tRNA genes. The genome structure, GC content, and codon usage of this chloroplast genome are similar to those of other species in the family, except that it encodes less protein-coding genes and tRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that P. cablin diverged from the Scutellarioideae clade about 29.45 million years ago (Mya). Furthermore, most of the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are short polyadenine or polythymine repeats that contribute to high AT content in the chloroplast genome. Complete sequences and annotation of P. cablin chloroplast genome will facilitate phylogenic, population and genetic engineering research investigations involving this particular species.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of electroacupuncture with loperamide. It was a prospective, randomized, parallel group controlled trial. A total of 448 participants were randomly assigned to He electroacupuncture group (n = 113), Shu-Mu electroacupuncture group (n = 111), He-Shu-Mu electroacupuncture group (n = 112), or loperamide group (n=112). Participants in the 3 acupuncture groups received 16 sessions of electroacupuncture during a 4-week treatment phase, whereas participants in the loperamide group received oral loperamide 2 mg thrice daily. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in stool frequency at the end of the 4-weeks treatment. The secondary outcomes were the Bristol scale, the MOS 36-item short form health survey (SF-36), the weekly average number of days with normal defecations and the proportion of adverse events. Stool frequency was significantly reduced at the end of the 4-week treatment in the 4 groups (mean change from baseline, 5.35 times/week). No significant difference was found between the 3 electroacupuncture groups and the loperamide group in the primary outcome (He vs. loperamide group [mean difference 0.6, 95% CI, -1.2 to 2.4]; Shu-Mu vs. loperamide group [0.4, 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.3]; He-Shu-Mu vs. loperamide group [0.0, 95% CI, -1.8 to 1.8]). Both electroacupuncture and loperamide significantly improved the mean score of Bristol scale and increased the weekly average number of days with normal defecations and the mean scores of SF-36; they were equivalent in these outcomes. However, the participants in electroacupuncture groups did not report fewer adverse events than those in the loperamide group. Similar results were found in a subgroup analysis of separating patients with IBS-D and FD patients.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the add-on effects of electroacupuncture to conventional drugs for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. Methods/design: This study is a two-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 116 eligible patients with polycystic ovary syndrome will be randomly allocated in a 1: 1 ratio to the electroacupuncture plus clomiphene citrate group or to the clomiphene citrate group. Participants in the electroacupuncture plus clomiphene citrate group will receive electroacupuncture treatment in addition to clomiphene citrate capsules, whereas participants in the clomiphene citrate group will be prescribed clomiphene citrate capsules only. Electroacupuncture treatment will be performed from the fifth day of menstruation or withdrawal bleeding until the next menstruation, in three sessions per week for three menstrual cycles. The primary outcome is the ovulation rate. The secondary outcomes include the dominant follicle rate, mean number of dominant follicles, endometrial thickness, time point of ovulation, follicular size before ovulation, luteinizing hormone, estradiol level, and pregnancy rate. The measuring points for outcomes will be baseline and the completion of treatment. Any adverse events occurring during the trial process will be recorded. In addition, a quality-monitoring group independent from the research team will be set up to control the quality of the trial. Discussion: The design and methodological rigor of this trial will allow for the collection of valuable data to evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture for treating polycystic ovary syndrome. Therefore, this trial will contribute reliable evidence for use in clinical decision-making in acupuncture therapy of polycystic ovary syndrome as well as to future research in acupuncture for polycystic ovary syndrome.

(Patchouli) is an important traditional Chinese medicinal plant that has both essential oil value and a broad range of therapeutic effects. Here we report the first de novo assembled 1.15-Gb draft genome sequence for P. cablin from next-generation sequencing technology. Our assembly, with a misassembly rate of < 4 bp per 100 kb, is similar to 73% of the predicted genome size (1.57 Gb). Analysis of whole-genome sequences identified 3,147,333 heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 490,407 insertions and deletions, giving an estimated heterozygosity rate of 0.274%. A comprehensive annotation pipeline indicated that repetitive sequences make up 58.55% of the assemblies, and that there are estimated 45,020 genes. Comparative genomics analysis showed that the Phrymaceae and Lamiaceae family split similar to 62.80 Mya, and the divergence between patchouli and sesame occurred similar to 52.42 Mya, implying a potentially shared recent whole-genome duplication event. Analysis of gene homologs involved in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis showed that patchouli contains key genes involved in more sesquiterpenoid types and has more copies of genes for each sesquiterpenoid type than several other related plant species. The patchouli genome will facilitate future research on secondary metabolic pathways and their regulation as well as potential selective breeding of patchouli.

We investigated the effects of aqueous extract from Aconitum carmichaelii Debeaux (AEACD) on acute liver failure and identified the possible mechanisms of these effects. Material and methods: Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Wistar rats were used to establish acute liver failure model by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (D-GaIN) and treated with Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC) and AEACD by gavage. Then, the serum biochemical parameters, the pathological scores in the liver tissue, the mRNA expressions of toll- like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and caspase-3, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive rates were analyzed. Results: The liver function was improved, the pathological scores were decreased, the expressions the TLR4, HMGB1, and caspase-3 were inhibited, and the PCNA positive rates were increased by both SNMC and AEACD, but AEACD induced greater effects. Conclusions: AEACD protected liver function by inhibiting inflammatory reaction, apoptosis and promoting liver tissue regeneration in the acute liver failure rats induced by D-galactosamine.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of commercially available silica (SiO2) as a carrier of solid dispersion to enhance the dissolution of Andro. Materials and Methods: The solvent evaporation method was adopted, and a series of process parameters were studied to prepare a solid dispersion. Andro, SiO2, physical mixture, and solid dispersion were characterized with respect to particle size distribution, special surface area, pore volume, and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction studies. Results: Single factor test suggested the best preparation of solid dispersion was the drug and carrier (SiO2B) ratio of 1:8, with tetrahydrofuran as the solvent, and a recovery temperature of 50 degrees C. Compared to crude drug and mixture, solid dispersion was found to form a unique structure to disperse the drug and displayed superior performance in rapid dissolution. Conclusion: The present study signifies the commercially available SiO2 is an excellent but cheap carrier to improve the dissolution of Andro. Our results provide a highly operability approach for improving the dissolution of insoluble natural products and are beneficial for the clinical effects improvement.

Methods: An HPLC method was used to establish the fingerprint of charred areca nut (CAN). The promoting effect on contractility of intestinal smooth was carried out to evaluate the duodenum contractility of CAN in vitro. In addition, the spectrum-effect relationships between HPLC fingerprints and bioactivities of CAN were investigated using multiple linear regression analysis (backward method). Results: Fourteen common peaks were detected and peak 3 (5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furfural, 5-HMF) was selected as the reference peak to calculate the relative retention time of 13 other common peaks. In addition, the equation of spectrum-effect relationships {Y = 3.818 - 1.126X1 + 0.817X2 - 0.045X4 - 0.504X5 + 0.728X6 - 0.056X8 + 1.122X9 - 0.247X13 - 0.978X14 (p < 0.05, R-2 = 1)} was established in the present study by the multiple linear regression analysis (backward method). According to the equation, the absolute value of the coefficient before X1, X2, X4, X5, X6, X8, X9, X13, X14 was the coefficient between the component and the parameter. Conclusion: The model presented in this study successfully unraveled the spectrum-effect relationship of CAN, which provides a promising strategy for screening effective constituents of areca nut.

A Clustered Randomized Controlled Trial to Reduce Secondhand Smoke Exposure Among Nonsmoking Pregnant Women in Sichuan Province, China	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; PUBLIC PLACES; INTERVENTION; COUNTRIES; PARTNERS; HUSBANDS; BARRIERS; OUTCOMES; HAIR; HOME	Introduction: Nonsmoking pregnant women in China have significant exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). Few interventions have focused on pregnant women reducing their SHS exposure. Methods: This clustered randomized controlled trial, conducted at eight hospitals in Sichuan, China, compared a prenatal health education intervention with usual clinical care as a control. The primary outcome was self-reported "no SHS exposure" before and 3 months after birth. The intervention consisted of three large group educational sessions, standardized clinician advice, brief monthly follow-up calls, and educational materials and resources. A random sample of participants was biochemically validated before birth with hair nicotine, a long-term biomarker of smoke exposure. Results: Overall, 1181 participants were randomized to intervention (n = 526) and control (n = 655) groups. More participants in the intervention group than the control group reported no SHS exposure 3 months after birth (Total: 77.9% vs. 52.6%, P < .001; Home: 81.2% vs. 53.3%, P < .001). The intervention group also had greater changes in improved smoke-free homes and SHS knowledge and attitudes. Controlling for covariates, the intervention group was less likely to report SHS exposure than the control group (Total: OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.71; Home: OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.53), and this effect was sustained 3 months after birth. The adjusted log concentration of hair nicotine for the intervention group decreased by 0.28 log mu g/g more than the control group. Conclusions: Our smoke-free health education intervention for nonsmoking pregnant women significantly reduced SHS exposure before and after birth. This intervention model can become part of a standard protocol for the care of pregnant women in hospital settings.

Multiple DTI-derived indices may help to deduce the pathophysiological type of white matter (WM) changes and provide more specific biomarkers of WM neuropathology in the whole brain of young smokers. Twenty-three young smokers and 22 age-, education- and gender-matched healthy non-smoking controls participated in this study. Tract-based spatial statistics was employed to investigate the WM microstructure in young smokers by integrating multiple indices, including FA, mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD). Compared with healthy non-smoking controls, young smokers showed significantly increased FA with increased AD and decreased RD in several brain regions, while no difference in MD was observed. Specifically, the overlapped WM regions with increased FA, increased AD and decreased RD were found in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule, the right external capsule and the right superior corona radiata. Additionally, average FA and RD values in the WM regions mentioned earlier were significantly correlated with pack-years and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, while no correlation in AD was found. The WM tracts with increased FA may be more associated with RD, rather than AD in young smokers. We suggested that WM properties of several fibres in young smokers may be the biomarker as the cumulative effect and severity of nicotine dependence.

A male was treated with starvation, intravenous fluids and antibiotics while in the hospital for acute diarrhea. He suddenly suffered from shortness of breath and subsequently died. A forensic autopsy was carried out, and several specimens were collected for toxicological screening. Propofol was tentatively identified in the blood by GC-MS. Based on the presence of propofol in the blood, a suspect confessed that two other drugs, namely midazolam and vecuronium, were involved in this murder. Analytical drug quantification was then performed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Blood analysis revealed the following: propofol at 0.5 mu g/mL, midazolam at 0.098 mu g/mL, and vecuronium at 0.10 mu g/mL. These results suggest that the cause of death was respiratory depression due to the acute combined effect of several anesthetic drugs administered by the victim's companion.

The trial group (n = 47) engaged in a Ba Duan Jin exercise program for 12 weeks, whereas the control group (n = 48) participated in a 12-week walking exercise program. After the intervention, participants' balance ability was evaluated using the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), One Leg Standing Test (OLST), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES). Ba Duan Jin was associated with increased TUGT and OLST scores at Week 6 with continuous increases reported through Week 12. Ba Duan Jin was also associated with increased BBS and MFES scores at Week 12. Ba Duan Jin may be an effective means for improving balance ability in Chinese community-dwelling older adults.

In recent years, knowledge about the important role of the Nogo-A protein in several neuronal pathologies has grown considerably. Here, we employed a neonatal cortex freeze lesion (NFL) model in neonatal rats and measured the expression of Nogo-A and NgR in the resulting cerebrocortical microdysgenesis 5-75 days after freezing injury. We observed marked upregulation of Nogo-A and NgR in protein levels. Furthermore, the migration of neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) toward the sits of injury was perturbed by treatment of NgR antagonist peptide NEP1-40. In vitro analysis showed that the knockdown of NgR by lentivirus-delivered siRNA promoted in axonal regeneration and SVZ-derived neural stem cell/progenitor cell (SVZ-NPCs) adhesion and migration, findings which were similar to the effects of NEP1-40. Taken together, our results indicate an important role for NgR in regulating the physiological processes of SVZ-NPCs. The observation of upregulated Nogo-A/NgR in lesion sites in the NFL model suggest that the effects of the perturbed Nogo-A are a key feature during the development and/or the progression of cortical malformation.

METHODS: A behavioral sensitization mouse model induced by ethanol was established to observe the effect of PG on the development and expression of behavioral sensitization induced by ethanol by recording the spontaneous activity of mice. The resident time of mice in a white box was measured to evaluate the effect of PG on developing CPP induced by ethanol. Concentrations of dopamine (DA), Glutamate (Glu), and a-aminobutyric acid (GA BA) in the corresponding mesolimbic region of mice were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Although PG did not alter spontaneous activity in mice, it reduced the growth of spontaneous activity stimulated by ethanol. The residence time in the white box after-ethanol-training of mice in CPP experiments was decreased. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that PG blocked the development and expression of behavioral sensitization induced by ethanol and the development of CPP in mice. The mechanism might be related to the decreased content of DA and Glu and increased content of GABA in the mesolimbic dopamine system. This suggests that PG might be useful for the prevention and treatment of alcohol addiction. (C) 2016 JTCM. All rights reserved.

Therefore, we compared the in vitro anti-HBV effects of matrine, oxymatrine, sophocarpine, and sophoridine by treating an HBV-transfected cell line (HepG2.2.15) with 0.4-1.6 mM of the compounds for 24 or 72 h. The levels of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg) in the culture medium, as well as the intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA levels, were determined. Metabolomic analysis and detection of the mRNA level of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) 6, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 10 (NLRP10), and caspase-1 were conducted in sophoridine-treated HepG2.2.15 cells. HepG2.2.15 cell exposure to 0.4-1.6 mM sophocarpine or sophoridine for 24 h reduced the HBsAg level of the medium more effectively than exposure to matrine and oxymatrine did, and reduced the HBeAg levels more effectively than these compounds did at 1.6 mM. Sophoridine (0.4-1.6 mM) reduced the cell medium HBV DNA levels more than the same concentrations of matrine, oxymatrine, or sophocarpine did. After 72 h, 0.4 and 0.8 mM sophoridine reduced HBsAg and intracellular HBV DNA levels more potently than matrine, oxymatrine, or sophocarpine did. Furthermore, sophoridine (0.8 mM) potently reduced the cell medium HBeAg levels while the metabolomic analyses revealed that HepG2.2.15 cells exposed to 0.8 mM sophoridine for 72 h exhibited reduced cycloleucine and phytosphingosine levels. In addition, the mRNA expression analyses revealed that HepG2.2.15 cells exposed to 0.8 mM sophoridine showed reduced levels of p38 MAPK, TRAF6, ERK1, NLRP10, and caspase-1. Sophoridine produced more potent anti-HBV effects than matrine, oxymatrine, and sophocarpine did. These effects may be related to the sophoridine-mediated reduction of p38 MAPK and TRAF6 levels.

Methods: CIA was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intradermal injection of bovine collagen II in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. The rats were treated with daily oral doses of WERA (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days. Methotrexate (MTX, 3 mg/kg), used as a positive control, was administered orally 2 times/week for 3 weeks. The severity of arthritis was evaluated using indices of paw swelling, arthritic score, body weight, thymus index, and spleen index. In addition, the serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were measured. Results: All doses of WERA significantly inhibited paw edema (p < 0.01), decreased arthritis scores (p < 0.01) and spleen index (p < 0.05), and alleviated the weight loss associated with CIA in rats. Furthermore, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 serum levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) by all doses of WERA. By contrast, IL-10 serum levels were markedly increased (p < 0.05). Conclusion: WERA exerts therapeutic effects in CIA in rats by decreasing the serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-10, suggesting WERA may be an effective candidate drug for treating human rheumatoid arthritis.

However, interactions between active constituents of P. cablin and their targets remain unclear. Here, the scPDB - An Annotated Database of Drug gable Binding Sites from the Protein Data Bank was searched using a Libdock-based reverse docking approach and network analysis, to identify putative targets and potential mechanisms of seven natural compounds derived from P. cablin, also known as Patchouli. These in silico results indicate that P. cablin affects bacterial DNA synthesis and repair, cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, or energy metabolism, which would inhibit bacterial replication. Our experimental results suggest that of seven potential active molecules, Friedelin, Pogostone, Patchouli alcohol, and Meanie acid displayed significant inhibitory activity toward corresponding enzymes and several pathogenic bacterium, whereas sitosterol, friedelan-3-ol, and alpha-Guaiene proved less effective, which supports the hypothesized results.

In the present study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) combined with second derivative spectra were used to identify and analyze H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis from different producing areas. The characteristic absorption peaks, including 2 925, 2 854, 1 743, 1 541 and 1 173 cm(-1) belonging to fatty acids, flavonoids and saccharides appear in all 20 samples. But the absorption peak intensities and locations varied due to the different geographical regions. The results also showed that the absorption peaks at the range of 3 429 similar to 3 336 and 1 744 cm(-1) were important characteristic absorption peaks which can identify H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis from different producing areas. Also, absorption peaks at 1 030 and 1 516 cm(-1) further confirmed the existence of flavonoids in all samples by comparing the second derivative infrared spectra in the range of 1 800 similar to 1 000 cm(-1). However, the samples' differences can be intuitively found around peaks 1 711, 1 476 cm(-1) and ranges from 1 689 similar to 1 515 and 1 400 similar to 1 175 cm(-1). The results demonstrated that FTIR was a simple, convenient, fast and intuitive approach to identify and analyze H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis from different producing areas. This method provides foundations for the analysis of chemical compositions and quality control for the TCM.

The malt samples were extracted by 60% methanol/PBS and the extracts were diluted five times with 20% methanol/PBS. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected to prepare sample solution for analysis. The fluorescence-encoded microsphere surface was labeled with bovine serum albumin OTA (BSA-OTA) to compete with OTA in samples for anti-OTA monoclonal antibody (mAb). Then, FITC-IgG was added to bind with the captured mAb on the microsphere. After centrifugation and washing, the mean fluorescence intensity from FITC on the surface of microsphere was detected by a BD FACSCalibur analyzer for accurately qualitative and quantitative analysis of OTA. The results showed that the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 1.20 ng mL(-1) with the correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.989, and the limit of detection (LOD) for OTA was 0.12 ng mL(-1). The average recovery rates in malt samples were 93.9%-97.4% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 3.6% at three spiking levels. Sixteen malt samples were analyzed and OTA was found in two samples with the contents less than 3.83 mu g kg(-1) which was lower than the maximum permitted residue level (5 mu g kg(-1)) proposed by the European Union. All the positive samples were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. In this study, the CBA technique based on indirect competition principle was developed for the first time for successful detection of OTA in malt samples. The method was easy, rapid, sensitive and reliable with high potential for the qualitative and quantitative of multiple mycotoxins in other complex matrices.

Nano-sized polymeric drug carrier systems have remarkably great advantages in drug delivery and cancer therapy, which are still plagued with severe deficiencies, especially insufficient cellular uptake. Recently, surface charge of medical NPs has been demonstrated to play an important role in cellular uptake. NPs with positive charge show higher affinity to anionic cell membranes such that with more efficient cellular internalization, but otherwise cause severe aggregation and fast clearance in circulation. Thus, surface charge-reversal NPs, specifically activated at the tumor site, have shown to elegantly resolve the enhanced cellular uptake in cancer cells vs. non-specific protein adsorption dilemma. Herein, this review mainly focuses on the effect of tumor-site activated surface charge reversal NPs on tumor treatment, including the activated mechanisms and various applications in suppressing cancer cells, killing cancer stem cell and overcoming multidrug resistance, with the emphasis on recent research in these fields. With the comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the activated surface charge reversal NPs, this approach might arouse great interest of scientific research on enhanced efficient polymeric nano-carriers in cancer therapy.

Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, model, vitacoenzyme (0.2 g center dot kg(-1)center dot day(-1)), WPX high-dose (H-WPX, 15 g center dot kg(-1)center dot day(-1)), WPX medium-dose (M-WPX, 7.5 g center dot kg(-1)center dot day(-1)) and WPX low-dose (L-WPX, 3.75 g center dot kg(-1)center dot day(-1)) groups. After successfully establishing the GPL model, the rats were consecutively administered WPX or vitacoenzyme by gastrogavage for 10 weeks. Differential expression of Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-proteincoupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), Wnt1, Wnt3a, and beta-catenin in gastric mucosal epithelial cells in all groups were immunohistochemically detected, and the images were taken and analyzed semiquantitatively by image pro plus 6.0 software. Gastric epithelium in the model group showed significantly higher expression levels of Lgr5, MMP-7, Wnt1, Wnt3a and beta-catenin than those of the control group(P < 0.01). Interestingly, we also observed Lgr5+ cells, which generally located at the base of the gastric glandular unit, migrated to the luminal side of gastric epithelium with GPL. The expression levels of Lgr5, MMP-7, Wnt1, and beta-catenin were all down-regulated in the L-WPX group as compared with those of both model and vitacoenzyme groups (P < 0.05). A similar, but nonsignificant down-regulation in expression level of Wnt3a was noted in all WPX groups (P > 0.05). Our findings suggested that the therapeutic mechanisms of WPX in treating GPL might be related with its inhibitory effects on the expressions of Lgr5, MMP-7, Wnt1, beta-catenin and the aberrant activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

Paeoniflorin displays bright prospects in liver protective effect. However, its molecular mechanism has not been well-explored. This study was designed to assess the effects and possible mechanisms of paeoniflorin against alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced liver injury. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight combined with principle component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis were integrated to obtain differentiating metabolites for the pathways and clarify mechanisms of disease. The results indicated that paeoniflorin could remarkably downregulate serum biochemical indexes and alleviate the histological damage of liver tissue. Different expression of 14 metabolites demonstrated that paeoniflorin mainly regulated the dysfunctions of glycerophospholipid metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Moreover, several pathways such as arginine and proline metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism were also related to the efficacy. In conclusion, paeoniflorin has indicated favorable pharmacological effect on serum biochemical indexes and pathological observation on cholestatic model. And metabolomics is a promising approach to unraveling hepatoprotective effects by partially regulating the perturbed pathways, which provide insights into mechanisms of cholestasis.

By using a C-18 column, the four analytes were separated by gradient elution with acetonitrile and water both containing 0.1% formic acid at the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for quantification, and an information-dependent acquisition (IDA) method was used to trigger enhanced product ion scans (EPI) for supplementary characteristic identification for qualitative research. Calibration curves showed good linearities with correlation coefficients (r) higher than 0.9990. The method showed high sensitivity with limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) less than 0.0002 ng/mL and 0.0008 ng/mL, respectively, as well as good precision and reproducibility. Mean recoveries for four analytes ranged from 92.5% to 106.2% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 14.59%. Real application of the developed method in 32 batches of S. miltiorrhizae samples demonstrated that the total contents of four analytes in all samples were in the range of 2.258-52.342 mg/g. Ultrasound-assisted extraction technique took a small amount of sample and low time but giving high extraction efficiency. Combining with UFLC-MS/MS method in MRM-IDA-EPI mode, more components in other complicated matrices can be simultaneously analyzed for qualitation and quantitation in one run. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, functional characterization of CYPs has been challenging because of the expansive families found in plant genomes, diverse reactivity and inaccessibility of their substrates and products. Here we present the characterization of two CYPs, CYP76AH3 and CYP76AK1, which act sequentially to form a bifurcating pathway for the biosynthesis of tanshinones, the oxygenated diterpenoids from the Chinese medicinal plant Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza). These CYPs had similar transcription profiles to that of the known gene responsible for tanshinone production in elicited Danshen hairy roots. Biochemical and RNA interference studies demonstrated that both CYPs are promiscuous. CYP76AH3 oxidizes ferruginol at two different carbon centers, and CYP76AK1 hydroxylates C-20 of two of the resulting intermediates. Together, these convert ferruginol into 11,20-dihydroxy ferruginol and 11,20-dihydroxy sugiol en route to tanshinones. Moreover, we demonstrated the utility of these CYPs by engineering yeast for heterologous production of six oxygenated diterpenoids, which in turn enabled structural characterization of three novel compounds produced by CYP-mediated oxidation. Our results highlight the incorporation of multiple CYPs into diterpenoid metabolic engineering, and a continuing trend of CYP promiscuity generating complex networks in terpenoid biosynthesis.

Altered regional cortical thickness and subcortical volume in women with primary dysmenorrhoea	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; CHRONIC PAIN; MENSTRUAL PAIN; DEFAULT-MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NETWORK ANALYSIS; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; BRAIN ACTIVITY	BackgroundThere is emerging evidence that primary dysmenorrhoea (PDM) is associated with altered brain function and structure. However, few studies have investigated changes in regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in PDM patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize differences in both cortical thickness and subcortical volumes between PDM patients and healthy controls (HCs). MethodsT1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained from 44 PDM patients and 32 HCs matched for age and handedness. Cortical thickness was compared in multiple locations across the continuous cortical surface, and subcortical volumes were compared on a structure-by-structure basis. Correlation analysis was then used to evaluate relationships between the clinical symptoms and abnormal brain structure in PDM. ResultsPDM patients had significantly increased cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula (IN), primary/secondary sensory area (SI/SII), superior temporal cortex (STC), precuneus (pCUN) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Meanwhile, significantly decreased subcortical volumes of the caudate, thalamus and amygdala were found in PDM patients. Moreover, there were significant positive correlations between the PDM-related duration and the OFC, SFC, STC and IN. The MPQ scores were positively correlated with the pCUN. ConclusionsThese findings provide further evidence for grey matter changes in patients with PDM, and in addition, the results support relationships between the structural abnormalities and their role in symptom production. All these results are likely to be potential valuable to provide us with direct information about the neural basis of PDM.

Owing to the excellent characteristics of the strong magnetic responsivity, outstanding hydrophilicity and abundant ic-electron system, the obtained core-shell structured microspheres showed great potential as a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) adsorbent. Several kinds of phthalate esters (PAEs) were selected as model analytes to systematically evaluate the applicability of adsorbents for extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. Various parameters, including adsorbents amounts, adsorption time, species of eluent, and desorption time were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, Validation experiments such as recovery, reproducibility, and limit of detection were carried on and showed satisfactory results. The analysis method showed excellent linearity with a wide range of 0.2-10 mg/kg (R-2> 0.9974) and low limits of detection (LOD) of 0.02-0.09 mg/kg (S/N=3). Ultimately, the novel magnetic adsorbents were successfully employed to detect the PAEs in apparel textile samples. And the results indicated that this novel approach brought forward in the present work offered an attractive alternative for rapid, efficient and sensitive MSPE for PAEs compounds.(C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The main secondary metabolites in magnolia bark are phenolic compounds and terpenoids. Squalene synthase plays a significant role in catalyzing two farnesyl diphosphate molecules to form squalene, the first precursor of triterpenoid, phytosterol, and cholesterol biosynthesis. In this study, a full-length cDNA of squalene synthase was cloned from M. officinalis and designated MoSQS (GenBank accession no. KT223496). The gene contains a 1240-bp open reading frame and it encodes a protein with 409 amino acids. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis clearly suggested that MoSQS shared high similarity with squalene synthases among other plants. Prokaryotic expression showed that a transmembrane domain-deleted (385-409 aa) MoSQS mutant (MoSQSA Delta TM) could be expressed in its soluble form in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3). GC MS analysis showed that squalene was detected in an in vitro reaction mixture. These results indicated that MoSQS Delta TM was functional, thereby establishing an important foundation for the study of triterpenoid biosynthesis in M. officinalis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

CKI, combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), is believed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report an updated and extended meta-analysis with detailed outcomes of both the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of CKI combined with TACE therapy. Materials and methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Wanfang, the VIP medicine information system (VMIS) and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were examined for relevant articles before November 13, 2015. An odds ratio (OR) was used to estimate tumor response (TR), Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) improvement, Child-Pugh (CP) improvement, survival rate (SR) and AEs. A publication bias and a subgroup analysis were also assessed. Results: Eighteen studies, with a total of 1,338 HCC patients who met the criteria for the meta-analysis, were included. TR, KPS improvement and CP improvement were significantly enhanced for the combination therapy compared to TACE alone (OR = 1.84, 95% Cl: [1.46, 2.33], P < 0.00001; OR = 2.37, 95% Cl: [1.76, 3.18], P < 0.00001; OR = 1.81, 95% Cl: [1.08, 3.03], P = 0.02, respectively). The combination therapy was associated with an improvement in 1-year and 2-year SRs but not an improved 3-year SR (OR = 2.40; 95% CI: [1.59, 3.62], P < 0.0001; OR = 2.49, 95% CI: [1.24, 5.00], P = 0.01; OR = 2.49, 95% CI: [0.94, 6.61], P = 0.07, respectively). A safety analysis indicated that AEs (including nausea/vomiting, fever, hepatalgia, increased transaminase, increased bilirubin and leukopenia) were reduced for the combination treatment compared to TACE alone. Conclusion: The combination treatment of TACE and CKI was associated with improved TR, KPS and CP improvement and improved 1- and 2-year SRs in patients with unresectable HCC. The 3-year SR was not improved. The combination therapy resulted in a reduction in AEs. The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and study limitations.

Rhubarb, a widely used herbal medicine, has been frequently used at a relatively large dose for treating cholestasis. However, whether large doses are optimal and the therapeutic mechanism remain unclear. To explore these questions, the anti-cholestatic effect of five doses of rhubarb (0.21, 0.66, 2.10, 6.60, and 21.0 g/kg) in an alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced rat model of cholestasis was examined by histopathology and serum biochemistry. A dose-dependent anti-cholestatic effect of rhubarb (0.21-6.6 g/kg) was observed, and an overdose of 21.0 g/kg showed a poor effect. LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics together with pathway analysis were further applied to characterize the metabolic alterations induced by the different rhubarb doses. Altogether, 13 biomarkers were identified. The dose-response curve based on nine important biomarkers indicated that doses in the 0.42-6.61 g/kg range (EC20-EC80 range, corresponding to 4.00-62.95 g in the clinic) were effective for cholestasis treatment. The pathway analysis showed that bile acid metabolism and excretion, inflammation and amino acid metabolism were altered by rhubarb in a dose-dependent manner and might be involved in the dose-response relationship and therapeutic mechanism of rhubarb for cholestasis treatment.

Radix Astragali is a commonly used edible and medicinal herbal plant that is susceptible to contamination with aflatoxins from Aspergillus flavus. There have been no studies on mycotoxin transfer into pharmaceutical preparations or derivative products. RESULTS: To facilitate the aflatoxin reduction and bioactivity retention, the dynamic variations of aflatoxins as well as herbal compounds, namely calycosin-7-glucoside, astragaloside and formononetin, in Radix Astragali contaminated by A. flavus during water decoction and ethanol refluxing treatments were evaluated simultaneously by an ultra-fast liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry method. After the extraction processes, although the amount of alfatoxins was reduced remarkably, aflatoxin residuals in preparation still exceed recommended limits, manifesting the great need to establish a limit for aflatoxins in herbal extractions or derivative products. Meanwhile, due to the hydrolysis of glucoside, water decoction period should be no longer than 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation would benefit from the determination of the dynamic variation of aflatoxins in infected herbs in preparation treatments, in order to further develop aflatoxin limits in herbal preparations.

Besides cyclooxygenase, AMPK is another target of the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agent aspirin. Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that aspirin can inhibit several types of cancer such as colorectal adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the cellular response to aspirin that may lead to aspirin resistance. Here, we show that aspirin induces the expression of MCL-1 in HepG2 and SW480 cells through AMPK-mTOR-Akt/ERK axis. Treatment of HepG2 and SW480 cells with aspirin leads to increased MCL-1 expression, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt/MEK abrogates the induction of MCL-1 by aspirin. Aspirin activates AMPK, which in turn up-regulates mTORC2 activity, Akt, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MCL-1 expression. MCL-1 knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to aspirin-induced apoptosis. Combination of aspirin and AMPK, Akt or MEK inhibitor results in more significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis than single agent. Moreover, sorafenib blocks aspirin-induced MCL-1 up-regulation. Combination of aspirin and sorafenib leads to much more cell death and less cell proliferation than each drug alone. Treatment of HCC and colon cancer xenografts with both aspirin and sorafenib results in more significant tumor suppression than single agent. These data demonstrate that AMPK-mediated up-regulation of mTORC2 and MCL-1 may compromise the anticancer effects of aspirin. Combination of aspirin and sorafenib may be an effective regimen to treat HCC and colon cancer.

Products bearing adjacent quaternary-tertiary centers were smoothly obtained in high yields (up to 93% yield) with good diastereoselectivity (up to >20:1). In addition, their biological activity has been preliminarily demonstrated by in vitro evaluation against human lung cancer cells A549 and human leukemia cells K562 by the MIT-based assays, using the commercially available standard drug of Cisplatin as a positive control. The results also demonstrated that most of the compounds showed considerable cytotoxicities to these two cell lines of K562 and A549, showed comparably potent or even more potent than the positive control of Cisplatin (up to 5.1 times), and indicated that novel turmerone motif-fused spiropyrrolidine oxindoles may be potential leads for further biological screenings and may generate drug-like molecules.

Formulae related to Paeoniae Radix Rubra (PRR) at high doses have been applied to treat hyperbilirubinemia in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of formulae relevant to high-dose PRR in patients suffering from hyperbilirubinemia induced by viral hepatitis. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of formulae that apply a high dose of PRR for hyperbilirubinemia. Seven databases were searched until April, 2015. All studies were included according to detailed criteria and assessed for methodological quality. The outcome measurements were recorded for further analysis using the RevMan 5.2.11 software. Results: Fifteen articles involving 1323 patients with hyperbilirubinemia were included. Formulae with high-dose PRR might promote the efficacy of either a combined application ([OR: 3.98, 95% Cl (2.91, 5.43)]; P < 0.01) or a single application ([OR: 4.00, 95% Cl (1.50, 10.68)1; P < 0.01) for hyperbilirubinemia. The indices of TBIL, ALT, and AST significantly decreased ([MD: -75.57, 95% Cl (-94.88, -56.26)], [MD: -26.54, 95% Cl (-36.19, -16.88)], and ([MD: -28.94, 95% Cl (-46.26, -11.61)]; P < 0.01), respectively. In addition, formulae with high-dose PRR could enhance the treatment efficacy of hyperbilirubinemia triggered by hepatitis B ([OR: 2.98, 95% Cl (1.75, 5.05)]; P < 0.01). Furthermore, the efficacy was enhanced with an increasing dosage of PRR. Two articles reported that no side effects occurred in clinical trials, and three studies noted that patients presented light digestive tract symptoms. Conclusion: Formulae relevant to high-dose PRR ameliorate hyperbilirubinemia and might constitute a promising therapeutic approach. For widespread acceptance by practitioners, more rigorously designed multicenter, double-blind, randomized, and large-scale controlled trials are required.

The fat mass- and obesity -associated (FTO) gene, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9939609, has been identified as a genetic risk loci associated with MDD. However, most prior studies have involved European and American populations. Whether rs9939609 is an true risk SNP for MDD in Asian populations remains inconclusive. Methods: In the present study, we conducted a meta -analysis of the association between rs9939609 and MDD in Asian populations by combining 5 available case -control samples totaling 6531 cases and 12,359 controls. Results: Our meta -analysis suggests that rs9939609 is not a risk SNP for MDD in Asian populations by fixed effect model (Z=1.04, P=0.30, OR=0.96, 95% CI =0.90-1.03). Limitations: The age distribution and gender ratios were not matched well in the combined samples of cases and controls. Publication bias might be also considered with only a relatively small number of association studies of FTO rs9939609 with MDD in Asian populations. Conclusions: The absence of association of rs9939609 with MDD in our Asian populations suggests a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of MDD on this locus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives To assess the effect of electroacupuncutre for alleviating the symptoms of subjective tinnitus. Methods Extensive literature searches were carried out in three English and four Chinese databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang Chinese Digital Periodical and Conference Database, VIP, and ChiCTR). The date of the most recent search was 1 June 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were included. The titles, abstracts, and keywords of all records were reviewed by two authors independently. The data were collected and extracted by three authors. The risk of bias in the trials was assessed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, version 5.1.0. (http://www.handbook.cochrane.org). Eighty-nine studies were retrieved. After discarding 84 articles, five studies with 322 participants were identified. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies identified weaknesses in all five studies. All studies were judged as having a high risk of selection and performance bias. The attrition bias was high in four studies. Incompleteness bias was low in all studies. Reporting bias was unclear in all studies. Because of the limited number of trials included and the various types of interventions and outcomes, we were unable to conduct pooled analyses. Conclusions Due to the poor methodological quality of the primary studies and the small sample sizes, no convincing evidence that electroacupuncture is beneficial for treating tinnitus could be found. There is an urgent need for more high-quality trials with large sample sizes for the investigation of electroacupuncture treatment for tinnitus.

However, a growing number of T. vaginalis isolates are resistant to these drugs, which make it becomes an urgent issue. Objective: The current study was designed to evaluate the anti-T. vaginalis activity of the essential oil from A. tsao-ko used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a spice and its main component, geraniol. Materials and methods: The anti-T. vaginalis activities of A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol were evaluated by the minimum lethal concentration (MLC) and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in vitro. The morphological changes of T. vaginalis were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, sub-MLC concentration treatment with sub-MLC A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol was also performed. Results: This study shows that MLC/IC50 of A. tsao-ko essential oil was 44.97 mu g/ml/22.49 mu g/ml for T. vaginalis isolate Tv1, and 89.93 mu g/ml/44.97 mu g/ml for T. vaginalis isolate Tv2. Those of geraniol were 342.96 mu g/ml/171.48 mu g/ml, respectively. After A. tsao-ko essential oil or geraniol treatment, obvious similar morphological changes of T. vaginalis were observed by TEM: the nuclear membrane was damaged, nuclei were dissolved, and the chromatin was accumulated; in the cytoplasm, numerous vacuoles appeared, rough endoplasmic reticulum dilated, the number of ribosomes were reduced, organelles disintegrated, the cell membrane was partially damaged, with cytoplasmic leakage, and cell disintegration was observed. The action time did not increase the effect of A. tsao-ko essential oil or geraniol against T. vaginalis, as no significant difference was observed after sub-MLC concentration treatment for 1, 3, and 5h with A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol. Discussion and conclusion: The study describes the first report on the activity and morphological changes of A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol against T. vaginalis. The results obtained herein presented new opportunities for antitrichomonal drugs.

Results: Three amorfrutins showed good linearity (r(2)>0.999) in the ranges of 4.2-84.5, 4.5-90.2, and 4.6-92.7g/mL. The amorfrutins were only detected in fruits of A. fruticosa with the contents of 2-carboxy-3,5-dihydroxy-4-geranylbibenzyl, amorfrutin A, and amorfrutin B in the ranges of 1.31-7.43, 0.54-3.52, and 0.64-4.63mg/g, respectively. No amorfrutin was detected in fruits of Amorpha canescens Pursh and roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Fabaceae), Glycyrrhiza inflate Bat., or Glycyrrhiza glabra L. Discussion and conclusion: A novel HPLC method was developed, validated, and applied to identify and quantify amorfrutins in complex botanic matrixes and the characteristic MS fragmentation behaviors of amorfrutins were revealed for the first time. The analytical method presented in this study could be used for the quality control of related plant materials and amorfrutin-based nutraceuticals.

Using DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region, we assessed the genetic diversity and genetic structure among samples collected from three sites of the wild population as well as from three hatcheries. The haplotype diversity of the wild samples (h=0.899-0.975) was significantly higher than that of the hatchery ones (h=0.296-0.666), but the nucleotide diversity was almost identical between them (=0.0170-0.0280). Relatively high gene flow was detected between the hatchery and wild samples. Analysis of effective population size indicated that M. asiaticus living in the Yangtze River has been expanding following a bottleneck in the recent past. Our results suggest the hatchery release programs for M. asiaticus have not reduced the genetic diversity, but have influenced the genetic structure of the species in the upper Yangtze River.

Fuziline and Neoline internal standard were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C-18 column with the total running time of 4 min using gradient elution at the flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The calibration curves for Fuziline showed good linearity in the concentrations ranging from 2 to 400 ng/mL with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.9971. The lower limit of quantification was 0.8 ng/mL. Intra- and interbatch relative standard deviations ranged from 2.11 to 3.11% and 3.12 to 3.81%, respectively. Fuziline was stable under different sample storage and processing conditions. The developed method was successfully applied to the comparative pharmacokinetic study of Fuziline in Beagle dog after intravenous and oral administration. Low absolute bioavailability of Fuziline (1.45 +/- 0.76%) suggested a significant metabolism transformation extent in Beagle dog.

Facing the realistic situation, developing novel anti-P. aeruginosa agents is urgent. Leaves of Dracontomelon dao were extensively used in southern China to treat various infectious diseases 1000 years ago. And in the study, the heat flow power-time (HFP-time) curves generated by P. aeruginosa which were disturbed by the five fractions (PE, CHCl3, EtOAc, n-BuOH and Vestiges fraction) from them were investigated through microcalorimetry, and then, some thermal kinetic parameters were obtained from the curves to characterize the metabolism of P. aeruginosa. The parameters were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), and the anti-P. aeruginosa activities of the five fractions were systematically compared and evaluated. The results showed that five fractions all expressed respective anti-P. aeruginosa effects in a dose-dependent manner and especially the performance of EtOAc fraction with half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 18.06 mu g mL(-1). Simultaneously, the prospective performance of EtOAc fraction was confirmed by turbidimetry. Based on the promising anti-P. aeruginosa activities of EtOAc fraction, it could be developed as a novel anti-bacterial agent used in practice for treating certain infectious diseases.

METHODS: Seventy specific pathogen free male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (normal rats, n = 10), ALF group (ALF model, n = 20), Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC) group (ALF model + SNMC, n = 20), and IPTT group (ALF model + IPTT, n = 20). The ALF model group was administered an intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (1.4 g/kg), and the control group received normal saline intraperitoneally. The SNMC and IPTT groups were treated with SMMC (15.6 mg/kg) or IPTT (28.6 g/kg) by gavage at 24 h intervals, and the ALF and control groups were treated with normal saline. At 36 h after injection, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, and cholinesterase and prothrombin time were determined, and liver histopathological scores were observed by microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA expression of high mobility group box (HMGB) 1, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-.B) and caspase-3 were analyzed via fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry in liver tissue was also performed. RESULTS: D-galactosamine notably decreased the biochemical and coagulation profiles in serum. IPTT not only improved liver function and histopathology but also normalized the gene expression levels in liver tissue. Compared with the model group, in the IPTT and SNMC groups, HMGB1 mRNA/beta-actin (0.06 +/- 0.03, 0.11 +/- 0.04 vs 0.25 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05); TLR4 mRNA/beta-actin (0.07 +/- 0.02, 0.22 +/- 0.08 vs 0.41 +/- 0.22, P < 0.05); NF-kappa B mRNA/-actin (0.74 +/- 0.41, 1.78 +/- 0.64 vs 2.68 +/- 1.35, P < 0.05); and caspase-3 mRNA/beta-actin levels were all significantly reduced (1.61 +/- 0.45, 2.57 +/- 1.04 vs 3.41 +/- 0.85, P < 0.05). The gene expression levels were significantly lower in the IPTT group than in the SNMC group (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the PCNA expression in liver tissue was significantly enhanced in the IPTT and SNMC groups (36.34 +/- 4.91, 25.57 +/- 2.94 vs 17.55 +/- 2.40, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IPTT attenuates inflammation in ALF via inhibition of HMGB1 production, which may contribute to limited liver regeneration.

This study aimed to identify the brain functional and structural mechanisms underlying cognitive decline observed in mild WMLs. Multi-domain cognitive tests, as well as resting-state, diffusion tensor and structural images were obtained on 42 mild WMLs and 42 age/sex-matched healthy controls. For each participant, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) of three resting-state networks (RSNs) related to the changed cognitive domains: the default mode network (DMN) and the bilateral fronto-parietal network (FPN). We also performed voxel-based morphometry analysis to compare whole-brain gray matter (GM) volume, atlas-based quantification of the white matter tracts interconnecting the RSNs, and the relationship between FC and structural connectivity. We observed FC alterations in the DMN and the right FPN combined with related white matter integrity disruption in mild WMLs. However, no significant GM atrophy difference was found. Furthermore, the right precuneus FC in the DMN exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the memory test scores. Our study suggests that in mild WMLs, dysfunction of RSNs might be a consequence of decreased white matter structural connectivity, which further affects cognitive performance.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a Food and Drug Administration approved somatic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, the involvement of surgery has limited VNS only to patients who have failed to respond to multiple treatment options. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) is a relatively new, noninvasive VNS method based on the rationale that there is afferent/efferent vagus nerve distribution on the surface of the ear. The safe and low-cost characteristics of tVNS have the potential to significantly expand the clinical application of VNS. METHODS: In this study, we investigated how tVNS can modulate the default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity (FC) in mild or moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Forty-nine MDD patients were recruited and received tVNS or sham tVNS (stVNS) treatments. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the study and were included in data analysis. After 1 month of tVNS treatment, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score reduced significantly in the tVNS group as compared with the stVNS group. The FC between the DMN and anterior insula and parahippocampus decreased; the FC between the DMN and precuneus and orbital prefrontal cortex increased compared with stVNS. All these FC increases are also associated with 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale reduction. CONCLUSIONS: tVNS can significantly modulate the DMN FC of MDD patients; our results provide insights to elucidate the brain mechanism of tVNS treatment for MDD patients.

(PLP) is a classical Chinese herbal medicine that has been used to treat hepatic disease for 1000s of years. Our previous work suggested that PLP can be used to treat hepatitis with severe cholestasis. This study explored the mechanism by which PLP affects ANIT-induced cholestasis in rats using a metabolomics approach. Methods: The effects of PLP on serum indices (TBIL, DBIL, AST, ALT, ALP, and TBA) and the histopathology of the liver were analyzed. Moreover, UHPLC-Q-TOF was performed to identify the possible effect of PLP on metabolites. The pathway analysis was conducted to illustrate the pathways and network by which PLP treats cholestasis. Result: High-dose PLP remarkably down-regulated the serum indices and alleviated histological damage to the liver. Metabolomics analyses showed that the therapeutic effect of high-dose PLP is mainly associated with the regulation of several metabolites, such as glycocholic acid, taurocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, L(D)-arginine, and L-tryptophan. A pathway analysis showed that the metabolites were related to bile acid secretion and amino acid metabolism. In addition, the significant changes in bile acid transporters also indicated that bile acid metabolism might be involved in the therapeutic effect of PLP on cholestasis. Moreover, a principal component analysis indicated that the metabolites in the high-dose PLP group were closer to those of the control, whereas those of the moderate dose or low-dose PLP group were closer to those of the ANIT group. This finding indicated that metabolites may be responsible for the differences between the effects of low-dose and moderate-dose PLP. Conclusion: The therapeutic effect of high-dose PLP on cholestasis is possibly related to regulation of bile acid secretion and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, these findings may help better understand the mechanisms of disease and provide a potential therapy for cholestasis.

In March 2012, DXXK capsules were approved in the Netherlands, making them the first traditional herbal medicinal product (THMP) made outside of Europe. Aim: To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of DXXK and the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels. Materials and methods: In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. The sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay was used to study the effect of DXXK on the proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells. Gene expression levels of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), COX-2, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 beta and IL-6 were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), while COX-2 protein levels were evaluated using western blotting. The levels of PGE2 in the culture media were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels were detected using a Milliplex Map Mouse Cytokine Panel system. The activation and nuclear trans location of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) were studied using western blotting. In vivo studies in mice were carried out using the carrageenan-air pouch models of inflammation. In exudates, leucocytes were counted, total protein was determined using the Bradford assay, nitric oxide(NO) levels were assessed using the Griess reagent, and PGE2 and TNF-a levels were quantified by ELISA. Results: The SRB assay showed that at the doses used in this study (10, 20 and 40 mu g/mL), DXXK did not affect the proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells. DXXK (10, 20 and 40 mu g/mL) inhibited LPS-induced PGE2 production by down-regulating the expression of COX-2, without influencing COX-1 expression. We also demonstrated that DXXK reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6, at both the gene and protein levels. Furthermore, DXXK inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B activation and nuclear translocation by suppressing the phosphorylation of I kappa B. Consistent with the in vitro results, the in vivo studies demonstrated that DXXK reduced leucocyte counts as well as total protein, NO, PGE2 and TNF-a levels in the exudates of mice with carrageenan-air pouch inflammation. Conclusions: The current study revealed that DXXK has a significant anti-inflammatory effect that may be attributed to its inhibitory effect on the NF-kappa B/COX-2 pathway and associated inflammatory mediators, including PGE(2), NO, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6. The current study provides additional evidence of the effects of DXXK in inflammation. Based on the combination of our results and previously reported data, we propose that DXXK has multiple pharmacological effects that could be harnessed to treat systemic diseases.

One hundred MwoA patients and forty-six matched HC were recruited. Patients were randomized to verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Resting state fMRI data were collected and seed based functional connectivity analysis was applied. Compared with HC, MwoA patients showed reduced rs-fc between the PAG and rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (rACC/mPFC), key regions in the DPMS and other pain related brain regions. The reduced rs-fc between the PAG and rACC/mPFC was associated with increased migraine headache intensity at the baseline. After treatments, rs-fc between the PAG and the rACC in MwoA patients significantly increased. The changes of rs-fc among the PAG, rACC and ventral striatum were significantly associated with headache intensity improvement. Impairment of the DPMS is involved in the neural pathophysiology of migraines. Impaired DPMS in migraine patients can be normalized after effective treatment.

Until 2000, all of these were officially listed as a single item, LJF (Jinyinhua), in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. However, there have recently been many academic controversies concerning the separation and combination of LJF and LF in administrative regulation. Till now there has been little work completed evaluating the relationships between biological activity and chemical properties among these drugs. Microcalorimetry and UPLC were used along with principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to investigate the relationships between the chemical ingredients and the antibacterial effects of LJF and LF. Using multivariate statistical analysis. LJF and LF could be initially separated according to their chemical fingerprints, and the antibacterial effects of the two herbal drugs were divided into two clusters. This result supports the disaggregation of LJF and LF by the Pharmacopoeia Committee. However, the sample of Lonicera fulvotomentosa Hsu et S. C. Cheng turned out to be an intermediate species, with similar antibacterial efficacy as LJF. The results of CCA indicated that chlorogenic acid and 3,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid were the major components generating antibacterial effects. Furthermore, 3,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid could be used as a new marker ingredient for quality control of LJF and LE	[Shi, Zhilong; Liu, Zhenjie; Wu, Mingquan; Ma, Xiao] Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Coll Pharm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zhilong; Liu, Zhenjie; Wu, Mingquan; Ma, Xiao; Wang, Jiabo; Zhao, Yanling; Xiao, Xiaohe] 302 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, China Mil Inst Chinese Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chunsheng; Zang, Yimei] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Chinese Pharm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Haibin] 302 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Liver Failure Therapy & Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China	Wang, JB; Zhao, YL; Xiao, XH (reprint author), 302 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, China Mil Inst Chinese Med, Beijing, Peoples R China.	pharmsci@outlook.com; zhaoyl320@outlook.com; pharmacy302@outlook.com			National TCM Industry Science and Technology Program [201507002]	This work was supported by the National TCM Industry Science and Technology Program (no. 201507002).		15	2	2	18	43	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1663-9812			FRONT PHARMACOL	Front.

Methods: The polysaccharides (PSD) and alkaloids (ALK) from RCC were prepared using the water extraction and alcohol precipitation method and Reinecke's salt precipitation method, respectively. Subsequently, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects of PSD, ALK, and PSD/ALK at various ratios were evaluated spectrophotometrically in vitro. Results: With a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 171.67 mu g/mL, ALK showed higher alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity than PSD (IC50 = 296.89 mu g/mL). In addition, the polysaccharides/alkaloids (PSD/ALK) at the ratio of 3: 1 exhibited stronger alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 160.9 mu g/mL) than PSD, ALK and PSD/ALK at ratios of 1: 3 (IC50 = 394.78 mu g/mL), 1: 2 (IC50 = 185.18 mu g/mL), 1: 1 (IC50 = 350.51 mu g/mL), and 2: 1 (IC50 = 229.16 mu g/mL). Conclusion: The results obtained suggest that PSD/ALK (3: 1) possesses the strongest alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect and may be considered as a candidate agent in future anti-diabetes drug development.

Sch Bip. (BP), as well as its antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities. Methods: The whole herb of BP was extracted with 95 % ethanol, which was then partitioned sequentially with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butyl alcohol to obtain petroleum ether, ethyl acetate (EE-BP), n-BuOH and water fractions. EE-BP was further isolated and purified by repeated column chromatography. The obtained compounds were identified by comparing H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with published data for the compounds. Flavonoids were evaluated for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazy (DPPH) and 2, 2 -azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging activity by colorimetric methods, while their anti-proliferative effect against human colon cancer RKO cells was determined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) method. Results: A total of 6 compounds were isolated from BP, including flavonoids or flavonoid glycosides, among which were isoquercitrin (1), vitexin (2), astragalin (3), 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxylflavone (4), 5,3', 4'-trihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxylflavone (5) and quercetin (6). The results indicate that compound 6 was the most effective in both DPPH and ABTS free radical-scavenging assays, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10.7 mu mol/L and 17.5 mu mol/L, respectively. Both compounds 4 and 5 exhibited significant growth inhibitory effect on RKO cells with IC50 of 39.08 mu mol/L and 17.68 mu mol/L, respectively (p < 0.01). Conclusion: BP contains a series of flavonoid compounds, possessing significant antioxidant activity and antiproliferative effect in RKO cells, thus suggesting that it is a potential health supplement and an easily available resource of natural antioxidants for use in colon cancer prevention.

Although plant lectins seems promising as a potential anticancer agent for further preclinical and clinical uses, further research is still urgently needed and should include more focus on molecular mechanisms. Herein, a Naive Bayesian model was developed to predict the protein-protein interaction (PPI), and thus construct the global human PPI network. Moreover, multiple sources of biological data, such as smallest shared biological process (SSBP), domain-domain interaction (DDI), gene co-expression profiles and cross-species interolog mapping were integrated to build the core apoptotic PPI network. In addition, we further modified it into a plant lectin-induced apoptotic cell death context. Then, we identified 22 apoptotic hub proteins in mesothelioma cells according to their different microarray expressions. Subsequently, we used combinational methods to predict microRNAs (miRNAs) which could negatively regulate the abovementioned hub proteins. Together, we demonstrated the ability of our Naive Bayesian model-based network for identifying novel plant lectin-treated cancer cell apoptotic pathways. These findings may provide new clues concerning plant lectins as potential apoptotic inducers for cancer drug discovery.

Nineteen patients were scanned at 2 time points: before and 1 month after the treatment. The authors assessed the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and probabilistic fiber tracking of left and right M1 of every patient, and then compared these results to the 15 healthy controls. The authors also evaluated the correlations between the neuroimaging results and clinical scores. Compared with the controls, the patients showed a significant decrease of FC in the contralateral motor cortex before treatment, and the disrupted FC was restored after treatment. The fiber tracking results in the controls indicated that the body of the corpus callosum should be the main pathway connecting the M1 and contralateral hemispheres. All patients exhibited reduced probability of structural connectivity within this pathway before treatment and which was restored after treatment. Significant correlations were also found in these patients between the connectivity results and clinical scores, which might imply that the connectivity of M1 can be used to evaluate the motor skills in stroke patients. These findings can help elucidate the neural mechanisms responsible for the brain connectivity recovery after stroke.

Lee et F. N. Wei (Lauraceae), is the main source of Gold Phoebe, a rare and extremely valuable wood in China. However it has undergone a dramatic decline. In this study, we used 12 amplified fragment length polymorphism primer combinations to assay 92 accessions, which were highly representative of the entire P. zhennan germplasm. It revealed that P. zhennan consisted of three genetic populations, named as SCZ (central Sichuan), CQH (eastern Sichuan, Chongqin, Hubei and Hunan) and YG (Yunnan and Guizhou), probably owing to natural selection caused by topography differences. The CQH population further diverged into two geographical sub-populations: CD-CQ(SCD and west region of Chongqin) and HB-HN (eastern side of Chongqin, Hubei and Hunan). The loci were moderately polymorphic (40.4%). The genetic distance between SCZ and YG was the highest, between CD-CQ and HB-HN the lowest. Pairwise fixation indices (Phi(PT)) between any inferred populations were significant. This rare species exhibited low genetic diversity; therefore, the results provided significant data related to the conservation and management of P. zhennan. That is, with this genetic information, land managers are equipped with better tools allowing them to more effectively protect this species and its limited genetic diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Computer-search for 8 medical databases and 5 clinical trail registries were conducted for: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), added with hand-search for 10 Chinese acupuncture-moxibustion journals and additional references. Data from included RCTs were pooled by RevMan5.1. Methodology quality of RCTs was judged by Cochrane Collaboration assessment tool while quality of primary outcomes was evaluated by GRADE3.2. Five RCTs were finally included, all reported in small sample size with high risk of: bias. Comparisons on single moxibustion and rest relief (without treatment) were studied. Six outcomes were reported, all favored moxibustion to rest relief for EIF. Primary outcomes showed as rating of perceived exertion (RPE) with mean difference (MD)=-0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.80, -0.19], 800-m race performance with MD=-2.21, 95% CI [-3.57, -0.85], and Harvard Step Index (HSI) with MD=14.75, 95% CI [8.35, 21.15]. Moreover, all primary outcomes as RPE, 800-m race performance and HSI were rated low quality. Single moxibustion might be considered effective for EIF. However, due to small samples of included RCTs, high risk of bias among studies and poor quality of primary outcomes and subjects restricted to Chinese athletes only, these results present limitation, and should be taken with caution for practice. More large-size studies with rigorous design are warranted to further test effectiveness of moxibustion for EIF.

The purpose of the present study was to detect the altered functional connectivity architecture in the large-scale network of the whole brain in migraine without aura (MWoA). Meanwhile, the brain functional hubs which are targeted by MWoA could be identified. A new voxel-based method named functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping was applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 55 female MWoA patients and 44 age matched female healthy controls (HC). Comparing to HC, MWoA patients showed abnormal short-range FCD values in bilateral hippocampus, bilateral insula, right amygdale, right anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral putamen, bilateral caudate nucleus and the prefrontal cortex. The results suggested decreased intraregional connectivity of these pain-related brain regions in female MWoA. In addition, short-range FCD values in left prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate nucleus were significantly negatively correlated with duration of disease in MWoA group, implying the repeated migraine attacks over time may consistently affect the resting-state functional connectivity architecture of these brain hubs. Our findings revealed the dysfunction of brain hubs in female MWoA, and suggested the left prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate nucleus served as sensitive neuroimaging markers for reflecting the disease duration of female MWoA. This may provide us new insights into the changes in the organization of the large-scale brain network in MWoA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the constituents which have antibacterial activity were not clarified yet. In this study, the antibacterial effect of five extracts from W. indica on Escherichia coli was evaluated by microcalorimetry coupled with agar dilution method. The ethanol extract of W. indica was isolated with organic solvents of different polarities including petroleum (P.E.) extract, chloroform (CHCl3) extract, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract, n-butylalcohol (nBuOH) extract, and residue extract. The metabolic profiles of E. coli growth at 37 A degrees C were measured by microcalorimetry. According to the principal component analysis, k (1), k (2), and P (1) were obtained from heat flow power-time (HFP-time) curve. The agar dilution method was performed to verify the results of thermodynamics. The results of microcalorimetric experiment indicated that EtOAc fraction demonstrated the strongest antibacterial activity with half-inhibitory concentration of 92.4 mu g mL(-1). Meanwhile, similar results were gained from the common method of agar diffusion, which suggested that EtOAc extract could be further developed as antibacterial bioactive fraction of W. indica. Altogether, microcalorimetry is a useful technique to provide sufficient quantitative information and evaluate the antimicrobial effect with its sensitive.

Inhibition of the 26S proteasome by small molecules may be a new strategy to enhance the efficacy of type I IFNs and reduce their side effects. Using cellbased screening assay for new 26S proteasome inhibitors, we found that emodin, a natural anthraquinone, was a potent inhibitor of the human 26S proteasome. Emodin preferably inhibited the caspase-like and chymotrypsin-like activities of the human 26S proteasome and increased the ubiquitination of endogenous proteins in cells. Computational modeling showed that emodin exhibited an orientation/ conformation favorable to nucleophilic attack in the active pocket of the beta 1, beta 2, and beta 5 subunits of the 26S proteasome. Emodin increased phosphorylation of STAT1, decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 and increased endogenous gene expression stimulated by IFN-alpha. Emodin inhibited IFN-alpha-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation of type I interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1). Emodin also sensitized the antiproliferative effect of IFN-a in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and reduced tumor growth in Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice. These results suggest that emodin potentiates the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha by activation of JAK/ STAT pathway signaling through inhibition of 26S proteasome-stimulated IFNAR1 degradation. Therefore, emodin warrants further investigation as a new means to enhance the efficacy of IFN-alpha/beta.

Twelve RCTs were included, and the overall bias was low. As the monotherapy, compared with control (placebo, metformin and liraglutide), dulaglutide resulted in a significant reduction in HbA1c (WMD, -0.68%; 95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40), FPG (WMD, -0.90 mmol/L; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.52), a similar risk of hypoglycemia (7.8% vs. 10.6%), less body weight loss (WMD, 0.51 kg; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.75). As an add-on intervention with oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM) and insulin, compared with control (placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide, liraglutide and glargine), dulaglutide lowered HbA1c (WMD, -0.51%; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.35) and body weight significantly (WMD, -1.30 kg, 95% CI, -1.85 to -1.02) notably, and elicited a similar reduction in FPG (WMD, -0.19 mmol/L; 95% CI, -1.20 to 0.82), an similar incidence of hypoglycemia (24.5% vs. 24.5%). This meta-analysis revealed the use of dulaglutide as a monotherapy or an add-on to OAM and lispro appeared to be effective and safe for adults with T2DM.

However, recognition of metabolites or potential biomarkers closely related to either particular clinical symptoms or prognosis has been difficult. The current study aims to identify potential biomarkers of functional dyspepsia (FD) by a new strategy that combined hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR)-based metabonomics techniques and an integrative multi-objective optimization (LPIMO) method. First, clinical symptoms of FD were evaluated using the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI), and plasma metabolic profiles were measured by H-1 NMR. Correlations between the key metabolites and the NDI scores were calculated. Then, LPIMO was developed to identify a multi-biomarker panel by maximizing diagnostic ability and correlation with the NDI score. Finally, a KEGG database search elicited the metabolic pathways in which the potential biomarkers are involved. The results showed that glutamine, alanine, proline, HDL, beta-glucose, alpha-glucose and LDL/VLDL levels were significantly altered in FD patients. Among them, phosphatidycholine (PtdCho) and leucine/isoleucine (Leu/Ile) were positively and negatively correlated with the NDI Symptom Index (NDSI) respectively. Our procedure not only significantly improved the credibility of the biomarkers, but also demonstrated the potential of further explorations and applications to diagnosis and treatment of complex disease.

Methods: The solvent diffusion-evaporation combined with magnetic stirring method has been chosen for the entrapment of aniracetam. The M-C-PLA-NP was characterized with respect to its morphology, particle size, size distribution and aniracetam entrapment efficiency. The in vivo distribution was studied in male SD rats after an intranasal administration. Results: In vitro release of M-C-PLA-NP showed two components with an initial rapid release due to the surface-associated drug and followed by a slower exponential release of aniracetam, which was dissolved in the core. The AUC(030min) of M-C-PLA-NP in brain tissues resulted in a 5.19-fold increase compared with aniracetam solution. The ratios of AUC in brain to that in other tissues obtained after nasal application of M-C-PLA-NP were significantly higher than those of aniracetam solution. Conclusion: Therefore, it can be concluded that M-C-PLA-NP demonstrated its potential on increasing the brain-targeting efficiency of drugs and will be used as novel brain-targeting agent for nasal drug delivery.

Some clinical trials have reported the effects of moxibustion and confirmed temporal factors are the important elements influencing the efficacy of moxibustion. However, no systematic review has yet been conducted. In this study, we assessed the effects of moxibustion in patients with PD enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the difference among different intervention times to start moxibustion. We extracted data for studies searched from 10 electronic databases and evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. We discussed three outcomes: effective rate, pain remission, and the level of PGF2 alpha in serum. Current clinical researches showed that, compared with nonmoxibustion treatments for PD, moxibustion leads to higher effective rate and lower level of PGF2 alpha in serum. However, there was no difference in using moxibustion to treat PD at different intervention times. Based on the theory of Chinese medicine and the results of this study, choosing 5 +/- 2 days before menstruation to start moxibustion can achieve good efficacy for PD patients. However, more high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the conclusions.

Astragaloside IV, the component of Astragalus membranaceus, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammation, anti-cancer and immunoregulatory properties. In the present study, we investigated the role of astragaloside IV in the chemoresistance to cisplatin in NSCLC cells. Methods: We established astragaloside IV-suppressed NSCLC cell lines including A549, HCC827, and NCI-H1299 and evaluated their sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro. In addition, we examined the mRNA and protein levels of B7-H3 in response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Results: We showed that high doses of astragaloside IV (10, 20, 40 ng/ml) inhibited NSCLC cell growth, whereas low concentrations of astragaloside IV (1, 2.5, 5 ng/ml) had no obvious cytotoxicity on cell viability. Moreover, combined treatment with astragaloside IV significantly increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin in NSCLC cells. On the molecular level, astragaloside IV co-treatment significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of B7-H3 in the presence of cisplatin. In addition, ectopic expression of B7-H3 diminished the sensitization role of astragaloside IV in cellular responses to cisplatin in NSCLC cells. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that astragaloside IV enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin via inhibition of B7-H3 and that treatment with astragaloside IV and inhibition of B7-H3 serve as potential therapeutic approach for lung cancer patients.

It is necessary tostudy the preoperative anxiety association with the postoperative satisfaction in anterior dental implant surgery. Methods: A total of 92 patients with anterior tooth missing were included and all were over 18 years old. Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL90) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), as well as pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Self-satisfaction evaluation, were used to test the psychological status of each subject. Results: There were no significant difference. between age, relationship status or health behaviors and pain or satisfaction (all P values >0.05). Most scores of SCL90-R did not show a significant difference between national norm of Chinese and participants. Concerning to the scores of VAS of pain and self-satisfaction, significant differences in trait and state anxiety were found. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that there are correlations between SAI, TAI and anxious (SCL90R) and the VAS of pain and self-satisfaction. Conclusion: These findings indicate that there is an explicitly relevance between preoperative psychological factors and postoperative outcomes in anterior dental implant surgery. In addition, preoperative anxiety contribute to the increase of pain in anterior tooth implantation surgery rather than age and gender.

Methods: 42 healthy adult Japanese big-ear rabbits were randomly divided into the normal control (n = 6), model (n = 18) and electroacupuncture (EA; n = 18) groups. Rabbit models of facial nerve injury were established by clamping the right facial nerve. Electron microscopy, light microscopy and immunohistochemistry were performed to observe the morphology of injured facial nerves and detect the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Results: Compared with the normal control group, the majority of myelin sheaths were damaged in the model group. There were significant differences in the number of myelinated nerve fibers, the thickness of myelin sheath, and axonal area between the model and normal control groups on days 10 and 15 after injury (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). CNTF expression in the model group was significantly greater than that in the control group on days 5, 10 and 15 after injury (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the extent of demyelination was less severe, and there was a greater number of intact organelles in the EA group. CNTF expression in the EA group was significantly lower than that in the model group on days 5 after injury (P < 0.05). Subsequently, CNTF expression in the EA group increased and was significantly different from that in the model group on day 15 after injury (P < 0.01). In the EA group, demyelination was milder on day 5 after injury than on days 10 or 15 after injury, and was associated with the duration of low CNTF expression. Conclusions: EA rapidly promotes the repair of injured facial nerves and improves the morphology of Schwann cells during the initial stage of facial nerve injury. It may be disadvantageous to the recovery of injured facial nerve fibers and Schwann cells during the later stages of the repair process.

A clinical epidemiology study on 44 symptoms, 5 tongue signs and 2 pulse signs (TCM diagnostic features) was conducted among 2,765 patients with KDS. Accordingly, an effective syndrome-identifying model on KDS-YANG and KDS-YIN was established. The results indicated that in terms of statistical significance (P < 0.05) of the cases with the above two different syndromes, the diagnostic indicators such as 11 symptoms, 2 tongue signs, and 1 pulse signs was found out by logistic regression analysis. The accurate rate of differentiating KDS-YANG and KDS-YIN was proved to be 88.0%. What's more, four symptoms-aversion to cold, cold limbs, pale tongue, deep and thread pulse-were confirmed to be the most significant variables, which was beneficial for the syndrome differentiation. The decision tree analysis model was an effective approach to differentiate KDS-YANG and KDS YIN, which could be helpful to change the syndrome-diagnosing method from experience-based to datamodel based.

Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. By traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pattern classification, damp heat stasis in the middle-jiao (DHSM) and liver Qi stagnation and spleen deficiency (LSSD) are two most common subtypes of CHB. Results. In this study, we employed iTRAQ proteomics technology to identify potential serum protein biomarkers in 30 LSSD-CHB and 30 DHSM-CHB patients. Of the total 842 detected proteins, 273 and 345 were differentially expressed in LSSD-CHB and DHSM-CHB patients compared to healthy controls, respectively. LSSD-CHB and DHSM-CHB shared 142 upregulated and 84 downregulated proteins, of which several proteins have been reported to be candidate biomarkers, including immunoglobulin (Ig) related proteins, complement components, apolipoproteins, heat shock proteins, insulin-like growth factor binding protein, and alpha-2-macroglobulin. In addition, we identified that proteins might be potential biomarkers to distinguish LSSD-CHB from DHSM-CHB, such as A0A0A0MS51_HUMAN (gelsolin), PON3_HUMAN, Q96K68_HUMAN, and TRPM8_HUMAN that were differentially expressed exclusively in LSSD-CHB patients and A0A087WT59_HUMAN (transthyretin), ITIH1_HUMAN, TSP1_HUMAN, CO5_HUMAN, and ALBU_HUMAN that were differentially expressed specifically in DHSM-CHB patients. Conclusion. This is the first time to report serum proteins in CHB subtype patients. Our findings provide potential biomarkers can be used for LSSD-CHB and DHSM-CHB.

J	Gong, GM; Yuan, HP; Liu, Y; Qi, LG				Gong, Guangming; Yuan, Haipo; Liu, Ya; Qi, Luguang			Investigation of the Effects and Mechanisms of Mai Tong Formula on Lower Limb Macroangiopathy in a Spontaneous Diabetic Rat Model	Journal of Diabetes Research			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE; FOOT ULCERS; MELLITUS; MICE; ADIPOCYTES; SYNTHASE; THERAPY; DISEASE; LIFE	A new Chinese herbal formula called Mai Tong Formulae (MTF) has recently been used to treat lower limb macroangiopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. In this study, we investigated the effect of MTF on lower limb macroangiopathy in a spontaneous diabetic rat model (GK rats). We found that MTF treatment significantly reduced serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), IL6, and VEGF and increased serum insulin in this model. Histological and ultrastructural observations showed that MTF treatment significantly reduced vascular endothelial cell shedding and improved endothelium injuries. We further detect proteome alteration following MTF treatment. 25 differential proteins (DPs) abnormally expressed in GK rats were normalized by MTF treatment. These DPs significantly are enriched in biological processes and pathways that regulate muscle contraction and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and so on. Additional protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses of the DPs showed that Fasn and Prkar2a are involved in the AMPK signaling pathway, and Gnas, Myh11, and Myh6 are involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction; these 5 DPs were validated by Western blotting. These results indicate that MTF treatment effectively treats lower limb macroangiopathy by regulating key proteins involved in AMPK signaling pathway and vascular smooth muscle contraction.

Its pathology often accompanies inflammatory action, and astrocytes play important roles in such procedure. Rela(p65) is one of significant message factors in NF-B pathway which has been reported high expression in astrocyte treated by A. HupA, an alkaloid isolated from Chinese herb Huperzia serrata, has been widely used to treat AD and observations reflected that it improves memory and cognitive capacity of AD patients. To reveal its molecular mechanisms on p65, we cultured astrocytes, built A-induced AD model, treated astrocytes with HupA at different concentrations, assayed cell viability with MTT, and detected p65 expression by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Our results revealed that treatment with 10M A1-42 for 24h induced a significant increase of NF-B in astrocytes; HupA significantly down-regulated p65 expression induced by A in astrocytes. This study infers that HupA can regulate NF-B pathway to treat AD.

A novel homozygous mutation in the solute carrier family 12 member 3 gene in a Chinese family with Gitelman syndrome	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Gitelman syndrome; SLC12A3 gene; Homozygous mutant; Pedigree	PHENOTYPE; GENOTYPE; COTRANSPORTER	Loss of function of mutated solute carrier family 12 member 3 (SLC12A3) gene is the most frequent etiology for Gitelman syndrome (GS), which is mainly manifested by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. We report the genetic characteristics of one suspicious Chinese GS pedigree by gene sequencing. Complete sequencing analysis of the SLC12A3 gene revealed that both the proband and his elder sister had a novel homozygous SLC12A3 mutation: c.2099T > C and p.Leu700Pro. Moreover, the SLC12A3 genes of his mother and daughter encoded the same mutated heterozygote. It was noted that in this pedigree, only the proband complained about recurrent episodes of bilateral lower limb weakness over 8 years, while his elder sister, mother and daughter did not present symptoms. The inconsistent clinical features of this pedigree implied that besides diverse phenotypes possibly originated from the same genotype, gender difference may also dominate the variant GS phenotypes. Further genetic and proteomic research are needed to investigate the precise mechanisms of GS, including the study of specific ethnicities.

However, it is still known whether the dietary flavonoids exhibit their antiviral and anticancer properties by modulating the function of type I IFNs. Objective: This study aimed at determining the role of apigenin, a dietary plant flavonoid abundant in common fruits and vegetables, on the type I IFN-mediated inhibition of cancer cell viability. Design: Inhibitory effect of apigenin on human 26S proteasome, a known negative regulator of type I IFN signaling, was evaluated in vitro. Molecular docking was conducted to know the interaction between apigenin and subunits of 26S proteasome. Effects of apigenin on JAK/STAT pathway, 26S proteasome-mediated interferon receptor stability, and cancer cells viability were also investigated. Results: Apigenin was identified to be a potent inhibitor of human 26S proteasome in a cell-based assay. Apigenin inhibited the chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities of the human 26S proteasome and increased the ubiquitination of endogenous proteins in cells. Results from computational modeling of the potential interactions of apigenin with the chymotrypsin site (beta 5 subunit), caspase site (beta 1 subunit), and trypsin site (beta 2 subunit) of the proteasome were consistent with the observed proteasome inhibitory activity. Apigenin enhanced the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STAT1 and STAT2) and promoted the endogenous IFN-alpha-regulated gene expression. Apigenin inhibited the IFN-alpha-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation of type I interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1). Apigenin also sensitized the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha on viability of cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that apigenin potentiates the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha on cancer cell viability by activating JAK/STAT signaling pathway through inhibition of 26S proteasome-mediated IFNAR1 degradation. This may provide a novel mechanism for increasing the efficacy of IFN-alpha/beta.

Breit., and has been used for thousands of years as a traditional Chinese medicine. However, its genomic background is little known. With the development of high-throughput genomic sequencing, it is now easy and cheap to obtain genomic information. In this study, 193,032,910 high-quality clean reads were generated using the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. A total of 53,544 unigenes were identified from the contigs assembled. Functional annotation analysis annotated 37,318, 27,697, 23,043, 22,869, 23,328, and 27,415 unigenes. KEGG analysis revealed that five pathways (169 genes) were associated with alkaloid synthesis, 201 unigenes were related to fatty acid biosynthesis (ko00061), and 133 unigenes were involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (ko01040). In addition, 6703 simple sequence repeats were designed based on the unigene sequences for screening germplasm resources in the future. These data are a valuable resource for genomic studies on Pinellia plants.	[Huang, X.; Jing, Y.; Liu, D. J.; Yang, B.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of TLXN on learning and memory impairment in vascular dementia (VD) rats' model, explore the effect of the MAPK signaling pathway on chronic ischemia, and determine the underlying mechanism. VD was induced in rats by permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. The Morris water maze and histopathological examinations were used to evaluate the effect of TLXN on learning and memory impairment, whereas real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to determine the levels of mRNA and phosphorylation of members of the MAPK signaling pathway, respectively. Compared to rats in the sham group, VD rats exhibited learning and memory impairments such as escape latency prolongation and decreases in the times of entrance into the first quadrant, valid region and escape platform; however, these conditions improved following TLXN administration. Moreover, TLXN may regulate the p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via the inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (p38), ERK1/2, MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6), and c-jun and a reduction in the mRNA levels of p38, ERK1/2, and c-jun. These results suggest that TLXN demonstrates the potential for development as a drug for vascular dementia and that the underlying mechanism involves the regulation of the p38 and ERK MAPK signaling pathways.

It has attracted increasing attention as one of the most popular and valuable herbal medicines. However, the systematic analysis of the chemical constituents of DHI is difficult and thus has not been well established. In this paper, rapid, sensitive, and reliable ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) was established to characterize the components of DHI. And the UNIFI software with the Traditional Medicine Library was applied to identify the chemical constituents of DHI for the first time, which is simpler and more effective. Under the optimized conditions, a total of 44 peaks including nucleotides, phenolic acids, and flavonoid glycosides were identified or tentatively characterized by comparing the retention time and MS data. The results may provide useful information for the further study of the pharmacology and mechanism of DHI. Furthermore, with the introduction of the UNIFI software into the analysis of TCM, this will provide a type of validated rapid and high-throughput methodology for the identification of constituents in Chinese herbal prescriptions; we expect that this approach would be useful for the screening and characterization of compounds in other famous TCM products.

Quantitative analysis of flavonoid profiles in the genus Actinidia, which has not been intensively conducted, is useful to a better understanding of the pattern and distribution of flavonoids. In the present work, a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed to profile the flavonoids, which was then used to determine the dynamic change of 17 biologically active flavonoids in the leaves of Actinidia valvata at the main growing stages, including glucuronides and acylated di- and triglycosides of flavonoids. The contents of flavonoid triglycosides were significantly higher than other flavonoids. The highest concentrations of kaemperol glycosides were observed in June, while other flavonoids showed highest concentrations in October. On the other hand, the contents of four isorhamnetin glycosides were increased sharply in September to October. The flavonoid profiles seem to be related to temperature, UV-B, and water deficit. Further studies are required to examine the functions of flavonoids in the Actinidia valvata and the underlying molecular mechanisms of actions.

Diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of low-dose streptozotocin (STZ; 40mg/kg). At 26 weeks onwards, PTIF 421mg/kg was administrated to the rats once daily consecutively for 10 weeks. Metabolic profiling changes were analyzed by Ultraperformance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Exactive Orbitrap-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS). The principal component discriminant analysis (PCA-DA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used for multivariate analysis. Moreover, free amino acids in serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). Additionally, oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Eleven potential metabolite biomarkers, which are mainly related to the coagulation, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, have been identified. PCA-DA scores plots indicated that biochemical changes in diabetic rats were gradually restored to normal after administration of PTIF. Furthermore, the levels of BCAAs, glutamate, arginine, and tyrosine were significantly increased in diabetic rats. Treatment with PTIF could regulate the disturbed amino acid metabolism. Consequently, PTIF has great therapeutic potential in the treatment of DM by improving metabolism disorders and inhibiting oxidative damage.

However, these wet chemical methods for determining antioxidant activities are time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. Objectives - This study was conducted to establish a rapid determination of antioxidant activity of Radix Scutellariae using near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. Material and methods - Antioxidant capabilities were evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrazyl (DPPH) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. The total flavonoid contents (TFCs) of Radix Scutellariae were measured by the aluminium chloride colorimetric method. The same sample was then scanned using NIR and MIR spectroscopy. Chemometrics analysis using partial least-squares (PLS) regression was performed to establish the models for predicting the antioxidant activities of Radix Scutellariae. Results - A better predictive performance was achieved using PLS models based on NIR data. The determination coefficient (R-2) and the residual predictive deviation (RPD) for the validation set were 0.9298 and 2.84 for DPPH, and 0.9436 and 2.66 for TFCs, respectively. MIR-PLS algorithms gave a slightly lower reliability (R-2 = 0.9090 and 0.9374, RPD = 2.01 and 2.42, for DPPH and TFC, respectively). Very comparable results for ORAC were obtained with the two methods. Conclusion - The developed spectroscopic method can be successfully applied in high-throughput screening of the antioxidant capability of Radix Scutellariae samples. It can also be a viable and advantageous alternative to laborious chemical procedures. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in SCM, which could function as new markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of SCM patients. Therefore, we attempted to identify and develop specific miRNAs as prognostic and predictive markers for SCM patient survival. Expression profiles of miRNA and genes and the corresponding clinical information of 448 SCM samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA dataset, the dataset of gene expression. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) were performed on the differentially expressed miRNAs. The impacts of miRNA expressions and miRNA-interactions on survival were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard regression model. Biological processes and network of putative and validated targets of miRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics. A total of 96 differentially expressed miRNA were obtained by the analysis of normal samples and skin cancerous melanoma specimen, including 17 up-regulated miRNA and 79 down-regulated miRNA, which accounting for 17.7% and 82.3% respectively. Five interested miRNA, were identified. The up-regulated hsa-mir-202, hsa-mir-206, hsa-mir-3681 hsa-mir-122 and down-regulated hsa-mir-1246 and hsa-mir-129-2 were found to be significantly associated with survival time of SCM patients. Our results demonstrated that miR-202, miR-206, miR-3681, miR-122, miR-1246 and the 5 miRNA-interactions could serve as prognostic and predictive markers for survival of patients with skin cutaneous melanoma, suggesting a potential application in improvement of prognostic tools and treatments.

However, its mechanism of therapeutic action is not clear because of its complex chemical system. The purpose of our study is to establish a comprehensive and systemic method that can predict the mechanism of action of SCG in antihepatic fibrosis. Materials and methods: In this study, a "compound-target-disease" network was constructed by combining the SCG-specific and liver fibrosis-specific target proteins with protein-protein interactions, and network pharmacology was used to screen out the underlying targets and mechanisms of SCG for treatment of liver fibrosis. Then, some key molecules of the enriched pathway were chosen to verify the effects of SCG on liver fibrosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA). Results: This systematic approach had successfully revealed that 16 targets related to 11 SCG compounds were closely associated with liver fibrosis therapy. The pathway-enrichment analysis of them showed that the TGF-beta 1/Smad signaling pathway is relatively important. Animal experiments also proved that SCG could significantly ameliorate liver fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-beta 1/Smad pathway. Conclusion: SCG could alleviate liver fibrosis through the molecular mechanisms predicted by network pharmacology. Furthermore, network pharmacology could provide deep insight into the pharmacological mechanisms of Chinese herbal formulas.

Therefore, we aim to perform pairwise comparisons of the 6 SGLT2 inhibitors. Methods and analysis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis will be conducted. Clinical studies that examine effectiveness and safety of either canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, tofogliflozin or luseogliflozin will be included. These studies will be systematically retrieved in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, from inception to November 2015. Two reviewers will independently screen for eligible studies and then extract data from the studies as well as assess risk of bias. Discrepancies in screening and data extraction will be arbitrated by a third reviewer. A traditional meta analysis will be performed to combine the effect sizes calculated from head-to-head comparisons with a random effect model. The effect sizes computed from indirect comparisons will be further combined in a network meta-analysis. Heterogeneity will be tested with the Cochrane's Q statistic, and publication bias will be assessed using a funnel plot and the Egger's test. Ethics and dissemination: Relative effectiveness and harms of the 6 SGLT2 inhibitors will be demonstrated through this systematic review and network meta-analysis. The result of the review will be disseminated through a peer-review journal and conference presentations. Patients, clinicians and policymakers will benefit from this review in selecting a SGLT2 inhibitor for glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The chemical structures were determined based on spectroscopic methods. All the isolated compounds 1-5 were evaluated by cytotoxicity and antifungal effects. Our present results indicated that compounds 1-4 showed notable anti-fungal activities (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 g/mL) for all the tested pathogens including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus fumigatus. In addition, compounds 1-4 possessed notable cytotoxcities against human cancer cell lines of HL-60 cells with the IC50 values of below 100 M. Besides, compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 showed strong cytotoxities on the LOVO cell line with the IC50 values were lower than 100 M. In conclusion, our study suggested that endophytic fungi of D. officinale are great potential resources to discover novel agents for preventing or treating pathogens and tumors.

However, its mechanism remains unclear. So, this study was attempted to reveal the anti-inflammatory effect of ZBCS-moxi on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats. Methods and Materials: Forty health SD female rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10/group): control group, model group, Zanthoxylum bungeanum-cake-separated moxibustion group (ZBCS-moxi group) and Aconitum carmichaeli-cake-separated moxibustion group (ACCS-moxi group). RA model was induced by injecting 0.1 ml Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) into the right hind paw of rats. Eleven days after CFA injection, the rats in ZBCS-moxi group received Zanthoxylum bungeanum-cake-separated moxibustion on Shenshu (BL23), Zusanli (ST36) acupoints and the dorsum right hind paw respectively for 3 weeks. The ACCS-moxi group was used as a positive control, while the rats were treated with Aconitum carmichaeli-cake-separated moxibustion on the same acupoints and courses. After a 3-week treatment, we investigated anti-inflammatory effect by measuring the paw volume, observing the pathologic morphology of synovial membranes and detecting the concentration of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in serum. Results: Compared to model group, the swollen paw volumes, the synovial hyperplasia and pannus formation of synovial membranes and the concentration of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in serum decreased obviously (P<0.01, P<0.05) in ZBCS-moxi group, as well as in ACCS-moxi group. However, the swollen paw volumes, the synovial hyperplasia and pannus formation of synovial membranes and the concentration of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in serum in ZBCS-moxi and ACCS-moxi group did not show significant differences (P>0.05) Conclusions: ZBCS-moxi displays anti-inflammatory effect on RA rats via suppressing the expression of cytokines and has similar effect to ACCS-moxi.

Buzui consists of Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis, Fructus Chebulae, Fructus Mume, Fructus Crataegi, Endothelium Corneum Gigeriae Galli, and Excrementum Bombycis. The buzui mixture was delivered by gavage, and ethanol was delivered subsequent to the final treatment. The effects of buzui on the righting reflex, inebriation rates, and the survival curve are depicted. Blood alcohol concentrations, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were recorded. The activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as malonaldehyde (MDA) levels, were also measured. Our results demonstrated that a traditional buzui recipe showed significant effects on promoting wakefulness and the prevention of acute alcohol intoxication, accelerating the metabolism of alcohol in the liver and reducing the oxidative damage caused by acute alcoholism.

With one national methadone clinic and three outpatient service sites, and three NEP sites, the HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Xichang was estimated as 18.0% (2.8 times of national HIV prevalence among PWID) in 2012. Methods: Face-to-face questionnaire interviews were used in a cross-sectional study to assess experience, attitudes, possibility and acceptability of implementing 8 pharmacy-delivered services among PWID (n = 403). The concordance of attitudes, possibility and acceptability between PWID and pharmacy staff (n = 50) was examined. Results: Rather than medical facility (23.1%), and NEP (8.9%), pharmacies were the main source of syringes for PWID in the last 12 months (82.1%), PWID (63.5%) reported syringes could be bought in single piece and at the price of $0.16 USD (59.3%). In the last 30 days, only 1 PWID brought used syringes back to a pharmacy. Pharmacy staff's attitudes were generally negative but nearly neutral (average score -0.18), discrimination/business concerns against pharmacy-delivered services existed, and 4 of 5 compared attitude questions between PWID and pharmacy staff were statistically different (p < 0.01). 5 of 8 pharmacy-delivered services were available for PWID at low level (<= 16.9%). Pharmacy staff's supportive perception for pharmacy-delivered services focused on pharmacies' initiate roles targeting on general population more than on PWID. PWID were more supportive and optimistic than pharmacy staff toward potential usage of pharmacy-delivered services (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Pharmacy-delivered services for PWID in Xichang were partly in reality, and could be feasible. It is urgently needed to address the legal requirements and remuneration for pharmacies. Pharmacy staff should receive additional training on services related knowledge and skills, cultural sensitivity toward PWID. Successful pharmacy-delivered services would benefit from identifying mutual interest and benefit between pharmacies and PWID. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations followed by free energy decomposition analysis to study conformational changes in MDM2 induced by three known spiro-oxindole inhibitors. Analysis of individual energy terms suggests that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions explain much of the binding affinities of these inhibitors. Binding free energies calculated for the three inhibitors using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area model were consistent with experimental data, suggesting the validity of this approach. Based on this structure-function analysis, several novel spiro-oxindole derivatives were selected and evaluated for their ability to block the MDM2-p53 interaction in vitro. These results suggest that combining in silico and experimental techniques can provide insights into the structure-function relationships of MDM2 inhibitors and guide the rational design of anticancer drugs targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction.

Cytotoxicity screening of these isolates and several synthetic derivatives indicated that the introduction, removal, position modification, or glycosylation of hydroxy groups in isoliquiritigenin did not improve the resultant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines. In addition, cyclization of OH-2' chalcones or reduction of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl double bond decreased such cytotoxicity substantially. However, methylation of hydroxy groups resulted in a marked increase in such cytotoxic activity. Among these active isoliquiritigenin analogues, 3',4',5',4 ''-tetramethoxychalcone (3h) was obtained as a compound with promising cytotoxic activity.

Design: In this pilot randomized crossover trial, each participant received both head massage and the control intervention in a randomized fashion. Settings/Location: The study was conducted at Children's & Women's Health Centre of British Columbia between June and November 2014. Participants: Ten otherwise healthy adults (6 men and 4 women) were enrolled in this study. Interventions: The intervention comprised 10 minutes of head massage therapy (HMT) in a seated position compared with a control intervention of sitting quietly on the same chair with eyes closed for an equal amount of time (no HMT). Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were the main parameters of HRV, including total power (TP), high frequency (HF), HF as a normalized unit, pre-ejection period, and heart rate (HR). Results: A single short session (10 minutes) of head massage demonstrated an increase in TP continuing up to 20 minutes after massage and reaching statistical significance at 10 minutes after massage (relative change from baseline, 66% for HMT versus -6.6% for no HMT; p=0.017). The effect on HF also peaked up to 10 minutes after massage (59.4% for HMT versus 4% for no HMT; p=0.139). Receiving head massage also decreased HR by more than three-fold compared to the control intervention. Conclusion: This study shows the potential benefits of head massage by modulating the cardiac autonomic nervous system through an increase in the total variability and a shift toward higher parasympathetic nervous system activity. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample size and multiple sessions of massage are needed to substantiate these findings.

OS is considered as a potential inducing factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS, which is one of the most common complex endocrine disorders and a leading cause of female infertility, affecting 4%-12% of women in the world, as OS has close interactions with PCOS characteristics, just as insulin resistance (IR), hyperandrogenemia, and chronic inflammation. It has also been shown that DNA mutations and alterations induced by OS are involved in cancer pathogenesis, tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and so on. Furthermore, recent studies show that the females with PCOS are reported to have an increasing risk of cancers. As a result, the more serious OS in PCOS is regarded as an important potential incentive for the increasing risk of cancers, and this study aims to analyze the possibility and potential pathogenic mechanism of the above process, providing insightful thoughts and evidences for preventing cancer potentially caused by PCOS in clinic.

In this present study, we examined the differential expression in proteins of CLOCK knockdown sperm. Clock gene expression was knocked down in cells to confirm those differentially expressions and serine protease inhibitor SERPINA3K was identified as a potential target. The up-regulated SERPINA3K revealed an inverse relationship with Clock knockdown. Direct treatment of normal sperm with recombinant SERPINA3K protein inhibited the acrosin activity and reduced in vitro fertilization rate. The luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the down-regulated of Clock gene could activate the Serpina3k promoter, but this activation was not affected by the mutation of E-box core sequence. Co-IP demonstrated a natural interaction between SERPIAN3K and RORs (alpha and beta). Taken together, these results demonstrated that SERPINA3K is involved in the Clock gene-mediated male fertility by regulating acrosin activity and provide the first evidence that SERPINA3K could be regulated by Clock gene via retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements.

Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate several elements downstream of type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (InsR). However, it is unknown whether and how mTOR regulates IGF-IR and InsR themselves. Here we show that mTOR possesses unexpected tyrosine kinase activity and activates IGF-IR/InsR. Rapamycin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of IGF-IR/InsR, which is largely dependent on rictor and mTOR. Moreover, mTORC2 promotes ligand-induced activation of IGF-IR/InsR. IGF- and insulin-induced IGF-IR/InsR phosphorylation is significantly compromised in rictor-null cells. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) directly interacts with SIN1 thereby recruiting mTORC2 to IGF-IR/InsR and promoting rapamycin-or ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR/InsR. mTOR exhibits tyrosine kinase activity towards the general tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu-Tyr) and IGF-IR/InsR. Both recombinant mTOR and immunoprecipitated mTORC2 phosphorylate IGF-IR and InsR on Tyr1131/1136 and Tyr1146/1151, respectively. These effects are independent of the intrinsic kinase activity of IGF-IR/InsR, as determined by assays on kinase-dead IGF-IR/InsR mutants. While both rictor and mTOR immunoprecitates from rictor(+/+) MCF-10A cells exhibit tyrosine kinase activity towards IGF-IR and InsR, mTOR immunoprecipitates from rictor(-/-) MCF-10A cells do not induce IGF-IR and InsR phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-deficient mutation of residue Tyr1131 in IGF-IR or Tyr1146 in InsR abrogates the activation of IGF-IR/InsR by mTOR. Finally, overexpression of rictor promotes IGF-induced cell proliferation. Our work identifies mTOR as a dual-specificity kinase and clarifies how mTORC2 promotes IGF-IR/InsR activation.

Herein, we developed a dual-functional biodegradable micellar system constituted by glycyrrhetinic acid coupling poly(ethylene glycol)-disulfide linkage-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (GA-PEG-SS-PLGA) to achieve both hepatoma-targeting and redox-responsive intracellular drug release. Tanshinone IIA (TAN IIA), an effective anti-HCC drug, was encapsulated. Notably, it exhibited rapid aggregation and faster drug release in 10 mM dithiothreitol compared with the redox-insensitive control. Furthermore, GA-decorated micelles revealed HCC-specific cellular uptake in human liver cancer HepG2 cells with an energy-dependent manner, in which micropinocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis were demonstrated as the major cellular pathways. The enhanced cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effects against HepG2 cells in vitro were observed, mediated by up-regulation of the intracellular ROS level, the increased cell cycle arrest at S phase, enhanced necrocytosis and up-regulation of caspase 3/7, P38 protein expression. In addition, TAN IIA-loaded micelles had a significantly prolonged circulation time, improved bioavailability, and resulted in an increased accumulation of TAN IIA in the liver. With the synergistic effects of HCC-targeting and controlled drug release, TAN IIA-loaded GA-PEG-SS-PLGA micelles significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased survival time in a mouse HCC-xenograft model. Collectively, the GA-PEG-SS-PLGA micelles with HCC-targeting and redox-sensitive characters would provide a novel strategy to deliver TAN IIA effectively for HCC therapy.

METHODS: Outward K+ currents were recorded by using whole -cell patch -clamp techniques on acutely isolated rat RGCs. Outward K+ currents were induced by a series of depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential of -70 mV to +20 mV in an increment of 10 mV. RESULTS: Extracellular application of DSX voltage-dependently suppressed both the steady-state and peak current amplitudes of outward K+ currents in rat RGCs. Furthermore, DSX reversibly and dose -dependently inhibited the amplitudes of outward K+ currents of the cells. At +20 mV membrane potential DSX at the concentrations of 0.02 g/L and 0.05 g/L showed no significant effects on the currents. In contrast, DSX at higher concentrations (0.1 g/L, 0.2 g/L and 0.5 g/L) significantly suppressed the current amplitudes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DSX reversibly and dose -dependently suppress outward K+ channel currents in rat RGCs, which may be one of the possible mechanisms underlying Erigeron breviscapus prevents vision loss and RGC damage caused by glaucoma.

METHODS: Twenty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to normal, model, and acupuncture groups. The model and acupuncture groups were given injections of ISO (85 mg/kg) to establish the MI model. After model establishment, the acupuncture group was treated with acupuncture at Neiguan (PC 6) for 30 min. Echocardiography was used to monitor diastolic and systolic function for 30 min starting from the time after the acupuncture needles were removed. Changes in the length of left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd), length of left ventricular internal diameter at end-systole (LVIDs), the ratio of mitral peak velocity at early diastole and atrial contraction (E/A), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and stroke volume (SV) were measured. RESULTS: Compared with the model group at 0 and 15 min after needles were removed, the means of LVIDd and LVIDs were significantly lower (P < 0.01) and E/A, EF, FS, and SV significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the acupuncture group. In the acupuncture group, the means of LVIDd and LVIDs 15 min after the needles were removed were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those at 0 min. The means of E/A, EF, FS, and SV significantly decreased (P < 0.01) from 0 to 15 min in the acupuncture group.

This one-pot approach utilizes an organocatalytic Michael reaction followed by intermolecular alpha-amination and intramolecular hemiaminalization to yield a chiral pyridazine backbone with contiguous stereogenic centers and multiple functional groups in good yield and with high stereoselectivity. Compounds synthesized by this method potently inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Mechanistic studies suggest that compound 5c exerts these anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis through extracellular signal related kinase (ERK)- and poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP)-regulated pathways, as well as mitochondrial pathways.

Patients who underwent graft urethroplasty for anterior urethral strictures at West China Hospital from 2005 to 2010 were followed up with clinical evaluation. According to the site of graft fixed, patients were divided into single-onlay group (dorsal or ventral) and double-onlay group (dorsal plus ventral). Success rate and complications were compared between the two groups and were analyzed using t test and chi-square. A total of 77 patients completed the follow-up, 51 in single-onlay group and 26 in double group. There was no statistical difference in terms of age, length, site, stricture reason, and the type of graft used between the two groups. The mean follow-up time was 15.6 months (range from 4 to 33 months) in double group and 39.5 months (range from 15 to 59 months) in single group. The total success rate was 72.5 % in single-onlay group and 88.5 % in double-onlay group; no statistical difference existed (p>0.05). Subgroup analysis shows the success rate was higher for double-onlay urethroplasty for the stricture of penoscrotal junction (88.9 vs 60.9 %, p<0.05). The main postoperative complications including infection and urethrocutaneous fistula were not significant between the two groups (p>0.05). Combined dorsal plus ventral double-graft urethroplasty showed a high success and low complication rate for anterior urethral strictures, especially for the penoscrotal junction.

Methods: CIA was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rat by intra-dermal injection of bovine collagen type II (C II) in Freund's complete adjuvant (cFA). The rats were treated daily for 21 consecutive days with WERA at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Methotrexate (MTX) was used as positive control, and administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally in two-weekly cycles for 3 weeks. Severity of arthritis was evaluated by arthritic scores, including paw swelling, arthritic score, body weight, thymus index and spleen index. The levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha in serum were also measured. Results: The results revealed that WERA significantly inhibited paw edema (p-value < 0.01), decreased arthritis scores (p-value < 0.01) and spleen index (p-value < 0.05), and alleviated the weight loss of CIA rats. Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory cytokines of TNF-alpha (19.3%, 60.5% and 73.9%, respectively), IL-1 beta (7.9%, 41.1% and 52.7%, respectively) and IL-6 (26.6%, 48.0% and 72.2%, respectively) were remarkably attenuated in serum of all WERA-treated rats, however, IL-10 (72.4% and 39.1%, respectively) was markedly increased at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg of WERA. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that WERA exerts therapeutic effects in collagen-induced arthritis of rats by decreasing the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-10 in serum, and therefore may be an effective candidate drug for the treatment of human rheumatoid arthritis.

Sanyuansan is a compound recipe composed of ginseng total saponins, fish oil, and valeriana. The aims of this study were to validate whether Sanyuansan has antidepressant-like effects through acute behavioral tests including the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), locomotor activity test, and chronic mild stress (CMS) mice model of depression. C57BL/6 mice were given oral administration of 30 mg/kg imipramine, Sanyuansan, and saline, respectively. The acute behavioral tests including the TST, FST, and locomotor activity test were done after the administration of drugs for consecutively three times (24 hours, 1 hour, and 0.5 hour prior to the tests). Furthermore, the sucrose preference and the serum corticosterone level of mice in the CMS model were examined. Sanyuansan only at 900 mg/kg markedly reduced immobility time in the TST compared with the saline-treated group of mice. Sanyuansan at doses of 225 mg/kg, 450 mg/kg, and 900 mg/kg significantly reduced immobility time of mice in the FST. Sanyuansan reversed the CMS-induced anhedonia and hyperactivation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition, our results showed that neither imipramine nor Sanyuansan at any dosage increased spontaneous motor activity. These results suggested that Sanyuansan induced significant antidepressant-like effects in mice in both acute and chronic animal models, which seemed unlikely to be attributed to an increase in locomotor activities of mice, and had no sedative-like effects.

For this purpose we transfected HEK293 cells with P2X2 and P2X3 encoding cDNA at the ratios of 1:2 and 4:1, and analysed the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the generated receptors by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The concentration-response curves for the selective agonist alpha,beta-meATP did not differ from each other under the two transfection ratios. However, co-expression of an inactive P2X2 mutant and the wild type P2X3 subunit and vice versa resulted in characteristic distortions of the alpha,beta-meATP concentration response relationships, depending on which subunit was expressed in excess, suggesting that HEK293 cells express mixtures of (P2X2)(1)/(P2X3)(2) and (P2X2)(2)/(P2X3)(1) receptors. Whereas the allosteric modulators H+ and Zn2+ failed to discriminate between the two possible heterotrimeric receptor variants, the alpha,beta-meATP-induced responses were blocked more potently by the competitive antagonist A317491, when the P2X2 subunit was expressed in deficit of the P2X3 subunit. Furthermore, blue-native PAGE analysis of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK293 cells revealed that plasma membrane-bound P2X2/3 receptors appeared in two clearly distinct heterotrimeric complexes: a (P2X2-GFP)(2)/(P2X3)(1) complex and a (P2X2-GFP)(1)/(P2X3)(2) complex. These data strongly indicate that the stoichiometry of the heteromeric P2X2/3 receptor is not fixed, but determined in a permutational manner by the relative availability of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits.

A validated HPLC method was successfully applied to elucidate the synergism mechanism from pharmacokinetics aspect after oral administration of Rhubarb extract with a dose of 0.25 g to normal and constipation rats. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic data of normal and constipation rats showed that there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the main pharmacokinetic parameters. The C (max) and AUC of emodin in constipation rats were about ten times that of normal rats, while the t (1/2) was remarkably decreased (p < 0.05). However, a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in AUC value for aloe-emodin and rhein was observed in model group compared with normal group. The results may be attributed to the direct action of aloe-emodin and rhein on intestinal cell membranes and the indirect action of emodin on bowel movement through the adjustment by nervous system.

Cav-1 overexpression was frequently confirmed in advanced cancer stages and positively associated with ABC transporters, cancer stem cell populations, aerobic glycolysis activity and autophagy. Cav-1 was tied to various stresses including radiotherapy, fluid shear and oxidative stresses and ultraviolet exposure, and interacted with stress signals such as AMP-activated protein kinase. Finally, a Cav-1 fluctuation model during cancer development is provided and Cav-1 is suggested to be a stress signal and cytoprotective. Loss of Cav-1 may increase susceptibility to oncogenic events. However, research to explore the underlying molecular network between Cav-1 and stress signals is warranted.

Paederia scandens (Lour.) Men. var. tomentosa (Rubiaceae) has been used as traditional medicine in Asian countries to treat jaundice, dysentery, and abdominal mass. Furthermore, the abundance of iridoid glycosides in Paederia species indicates their notable hepatoprotective potential. Materials and methods: Total iridoid glycosides (TG) was prepared, and constituents of TG were analyzed by HPLC. TG and silymarin (positive) were orally administered for 15 days. Then, acute liver injury rats was induced by intraperitoneally injection (i.p.) of 10% CCl4 (0.12%, v/v, dissolved in olive oil, 10 mL/kg, body weight). Rats were sacrificed at 16 h after CCl4 injection. Liver tissues and blood were collected. Serum samples were prepared to determine the activities of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), whereas liver tissue sections were prepared for the purpose of examining possible liver histopathological changes. In addition, antioxidant enzyme activities in liver tissues were also evaluated. Results: Our results demonstrated that TG significantly decreased the levels of AST and ALT, compared with those in control rats. In addition, pre-treatment of the rats with TG clearly alleviated their liver tissue injuries. What's more, the activities of GSH, GAT and SOD in the groups of TG-treated rats were significantly increased compared with those of rats in the control group, whereas the levels of MDA were decreased. Conclusions: Our present research indicated that TG possessed notable hepatoprotective activity via decreasing oxidative stress level in liver tissues. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Artificial neural networks (ANN) models, including general regression neural network (GRNN) and multi-layer feedforward neural network (MLFN), were used to analyze the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer - Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (GC-MSAMDIS) data of the essential oils of the XPCR. The Root Mean Square (RMS) errors of each ANN model was obtained through judging the characteristic of old peels and new peels. Results: The Root Mean Square (RMS) error of GRNN was 0.22, less than the error MLFN at different levels, indicating that GRNN model is more reliable and accurate for judging the characteristics of old peels and new ones. Conclusion: The general regression neural network model is established to reliably distinguish between old peels and new peels.

As result of the nonlinearity of the Lorentz transformation, the energy-momentum dispersion relation is modified. One simple way to import DSR to curved spacetime is "Gravity's rainbow", where the spacetime background felt by a test particle would depend on its energy. Focusing on the "Amelino-Camelia dispersion relation" which is E-2 = m(2) + p(2) [1 - eta (E/m(p))(n)] with n > 0, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of a Schwarzschild black hole and a static uncharged black string for all possible values of fri and n in the framework of rainbow gravity. It shows that there are non-vanishing minimum masses for these two black holes in the cases with n < 0 and n >= 2. Considering effects of rainbow gravity on both the Hawking temperature and radius of the event horizon, we use the geometric optics approximation to compute luminosities of a 2D black hole, a Schwarzschild one and a static uncharged black string. It is found that the luminosities can be significantly suppressed or boosted depending on the values of n and n.

In this review, we summarize the promising neuroprotective agents tested on animal models and pilot clinical studies of neonatal H-I brain injury according to the different phases of the disease. These agents target various phases of injury including the early phase of excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as late-phase inflammatory reaction and neural repair. We analyze the cell survival and cell death pathways modified by these agents in neonatal H-I brain injury. We aim to 'build a bridge' between animal trials of neuroprotective agents and potential candidate treatments for future clinical applications against H-I encephalopathy.

Paeoniflorin, the major active compound isolated from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora pall and Paeonia veitchii Lynch, is extensively used for liver diseases treatment in China. However, the mechanism of paeoniflorin's hepatoprotective effect on cholestasis has not been investigated yet. In this study, we administered paeoniflorin to rats for 3days prior to alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) administration for once, then went on administering paeoniflorin to rats for 3days. The data demonstrated that paeoniflorin significantly prevented ANIT-induced change in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphates (ALP), serum total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), total bile acid (TBA) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT). Histology examination revealed that paeoniflorin treatment rats relieved more liver injury and bile duct proliferation than ANIT-administered rats. Moreover, our data indicated that paeoniflorin could restore glutathione (GSH) and its related synthase glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc) and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLm) in ANIT-treated group. In addition, the RNA and protein expression of Akt and nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) were also activated by paeoniflorin in ANIT-induced rats. These findings indicated that paeoniflorin protected ANIT-induced cholestasis and increased GSH synthesis by activating Nrf2 through PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. Therefore, paeoniflorin might be a potential therapeutic agent for cholestasis. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Pre-column derivatization was performed before separation. Baseline separation with a resolution factor > 2.5 was accomplished within 10 min by use of a Chiralpak AD column (250 x 4.6 mm; particle size 5 mu m) and n-hexane-2-propanol (90:10 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). Eluted analytes were monitored by UV detection at 260 nm. The effects of mobile phase composition and temperature on enantiomeric selectivity and on resolution of enantiomers were thoroughly investigated. Calibration curves were plotted within the concentration range 0.005-2 mg mL(-1) (n = 12), and recoveries between 98.23 and 101.34 % were obtained, with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 1.39 %. LOD and LOQ for the trelagliptin derivative were 1.51 and 5.03 mu g mL(-1); those for its enantiomer were 1.49 and 4.94 mu g mL(-1), respectively.

Administration of insulin alone is prone to cause secondary effects, resulting in an unsatisfactory outcome. Shen-Qi-Formula (SQF), a well-known Chinese medicinal formula, has been used for diabetic treatment for a long time. The present study was designed to investigate whether SQF in combination with insulin improved the clinical outcome of type2 diabetes mellitus, and what mechanisms were possibly involved in the treatment. Materials and MethodsA total of 219 patients were included in the study. Of these, 110 patients were treated with insulin monotherapy, and 109 with the combination therapy of SQF and insulin. Before and after 12-week treatment, the fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, -cell function, insulin resistance and blood lipids were measured. ResultsThe 12weeks of SQF treatment in combination with insulin significantly decreased the fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels. Insulin secretion was not increased after the treatment, but -cell function and insulin resistance were obviously improved. Furthermore, 12weeks of treatment with SQF and insulin improved the levels of glucagon-like peptide-1, oxidative stress, blood lipids, coagulation function and bodyweight. ConclusionThe results from our study showed that the combination therapy of SQF and insulin significantly improved the clinical outcome of type2 diabetes mellitus compared with insulin monotherapy. The mechanism of improvement was possibly involved in the multiple pathways.

A modest inflammatory stress potentiating liver injury has been linked to the idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI). In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interacts with emodin could synergize to cause liver injury in rats. Emodin (ranging from 20, 40, to 80 mg/kg), which is in the range of liver protection, was administered to rats, before LPS (2.8 mg/kg) or saline vehicle treatment. The biochemical tests showed that non-toxic dosage of LPS coupled with emodin caused significant increases of plasma ALT and AST activities as compared to emodin alone treated groups (P < 0.05). In addition, with LPS or emodin alone could not induce any changes in ALT and AST activity, as compared with the control group (0.5% CMC-Na treatment). Meanwhile, the plasma proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 increased significantly in the emodin/LPS groups compared to either emodin groups or the LPS (P < 0.05). Histological analysis showed that liver damage was only found in emodin/LPS cotreatmented rat livers samples. These results indicate that non-toxic dosage of LPS potentiates the hepatotoxicity of emodin. This discovery raises the possibility that emodin and herbal medicines containing it may induce liver injury in the inflammatory stress even in their therapeutic dosages.

METHODS: One hundred and nine patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology and the Department of TCM of the Sixth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Subjects were divided into three groups according to TCM syndrome: intrinsic Damp (n = 42), Yin deficiency and internal Heat (n = 25), and Qi and Yin deficiency (n = 42). Subcutaneous interstitial glucose was monitored with a continuous glucose monitoring system for 3 consecutive days to investigate the glycemic profile in each group. Plasma C-peptide levels were measured, and an arginine test was taken in 10 patients randomly selected from each group. Glucose data and glycemic variability were analyzed to investigate the differences among the groups. The change in C-peptide levels and the results from arginine trial were used to evaluate 13 cell function. RESULTS: Indicators reflecting blood glucose level were the highest in subjects with Yin deficiency and internal Heat syndrome, and parameters reflecting glycemic variability were the lowest in those with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome. The change in C-peptide levels showed that subjects with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome had the best 13 cell function among the three groups; this was confirmed by the arginine trial. CONCLUSION: Patients with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome had a more stable blood glucose profile, as glycemic variability was higher in those with intrinsic Damp syndrome and those with Yin deficiency and internal Heat syndrome.

This study aims to discriminate between medicinal and non-medicinal Hippophae species by DNA barcodes, the ITS2, psbA-trnH, and a combination of ITS2 and psbA-trnH (ITS2 + psbA-trnH). Methods: DNA was extracted from the dried fruit samples. Primer pairs ITS2F/3R for ITS2 and psbAF/trnHR for psbA-trnH were used for PCR amplification. The purified PCR products were bidirectionally sequenced. Genetic distances were calculated according to the Kimura 2 parameter model and phylogenetic tree was constructed based on neighbor-joining (NJ) method, barcoding gap was also analyzed to assess identification efficiency. Results: Amplification and sequencing efficiencies for both ITS2 and psbA-trnH were 100 %. Sequence data revealed that ITS2 + psbA-trnH was the most suitable candidate barcode at the species and subspecies level. The closely related Hippophae species were effectively differentiated in the NJ tree. Conclusion: The combination of the two loci, ITS2 + psbA-trnH is applicable to the identification of medicinal and non-medicinal Hippophae species.

However, it tends to be taken overdose or long term in these years, which has resulted in liver damage reported in many countries. In this study, the indicative roles of nine bile acids (BAs) were evaluated to offer potential biomarkers for HSW induced liver injury. Nine BAs including cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) in rat bile and serum were detected by a developed LC-MS method after 42 days treatment. Partial least square-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to evaluate the indicative roles of the nine BAs, and metabolism of the nine BAs was summarized. Significant change was observed for the concentrations of nine BAs in treatment groups compared with normal control; In the PLS-DA plots of nine BAs in bile, normal control and raw HSW groups were separately clustered and could be clearly distinguished, GDCA was selected as the distinguished components for raw HSW overdose treatment group. In the PLS-DA plots of nine BAs in serum, the normal control and raw HSW overdose treatment group were separately clustered and could be clearly distinguished, and HDCA was selected as the distinguished components for raw HSW overdose treatment group. The results indicated the perturbation of nine BAs was associated with HSW induced liver injury; GDCA in bile, as well as HDCA in serum could be selected as potential biomarkers for HSW induced liver injury; it also laid the foundation for the further search on the mechanisms of liver injury induced by HSW.

And their structures were determined by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and mass spectroscopy. In the bioscreening experiments, ten compounds (A1-A5, PO, A7-A10) exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 4-512 mg/L, and nine compounds (Al-AS, PO, A7-A8, A10) exhibited antibacterial activities against Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 with MIC values of 4-256 mg/L. Moreover, compound A10 showed the highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and MRSA with MIC values of 4 mg/L, while the MIC values of Amoxicillin were 8 mg/I. and >256 mg/L, respectively. Two compounds (A8 and PO) exhibited antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with MIC values of 32-512 mg/L However, only one compound (A8) exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa CVCC 3360 with MIC value of 256 mg/L. Moreover, A10 exhibited significant inhibition of proliferation in the four cell lines MCF-10, A549, A2780 and MFC, and showed stronger inhibitive activity of these four selected cell lines than cisplatin in the cytotoxic assay.

Local and distant acupuncture points stimulation for chronic musculoskeletal pain: A systematic review on the comparative effects	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Review							CHRONIC NECK PAIN; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; TRIGGER POINT; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; MYOFASCIAL PAIN; EFFICACY	One in four people suffers from chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). Acupuncture points stimulation is increasingly used for pain relief for CMP. Commonly, a combination of local and distant points is used. However, the difference between the effects of local and distant point stimulation is unknown. This systematic review aimed to determine if there was a difference in effects between stimulating local and distant points, and the combination of both when compared with either alone. English and Chinese electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials, where local or distant points were stimulated in adults with CMP. Pain intensity was the primary outcome measure. Nineteen were included in the qualitative analysis and 15 in the meta-analysis. Local and distant point stimulation was more effective than their respective controls in pain reduction immediately after treatment. Three studies directly compared the stimulation of local and distant points and found no significant difference between the two. No studies compared combined local and distant point stimulation with either alone. Subgroup analyses showed that, local tender point stimulation was more effective than local acupuncture points. Local and distant point stimulation induces similar degree of acupuncture analgesia. The benefit of combining local and distant point stimulation is unknown. However, subgroup analyses suggested that local tender points could be important in the treatment of CMP for short-term pain relief.	[Wan, D. Wong Lit; Wang, Y.; Xue, C. C.

Objective: This study aims to the substance dependence effect of the ethanolic extract and iridoid-rich fraction. Materials and Methods: The study included two experiments: Mice were given orally with ethanolic extract for 12 weeks or iridoid-rich fraction for 16 weeks in experiment I and experiment II, respectively. Diazepam was used as a control drug and the normal mice groups were administered with 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose Na in both experiments. All groups were administered twice daily. Natural withdrawal symptoms, withdrawal-induced body weight change, audiogenic tail-erection test (in experiment I), and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsion test (in experiment II) were measured. Results: (1) Compared to normal group in both experiments, the diazepam-treated group exhibited obvious withdrawal symptoms of tail-erection, irritability, teeth chattering, etc; the body weight of them after withdrawal had a period of significant loss (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); and the ratios of tail-erection and seizure in two experiments were improved significantly when mice were induced by mixer noise ringtone (experiment I) or PTZ (experiment II) (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).(2) In experiment I and II, there were no significant differences between mice that received ethanolic extract or iridoid-rich fraction and normal group in terms of natural withdrawal symptoms and withdrawal-induced body weight change (P > 0.05); in audiogenic tail-erection test, it found that the significant difference compared with normal group was just in ethanolic extract 900 mg/kg dose group on week 8 (P < 0.05); in PTZ-induced convulsion test, mice in iridoid-rich fraction groups had a slightly tail-erection and seizure, all results of them were with no significant difference compare to normal mice (P > 0.05), while significant lower than diazepam group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: (1) The two experiments successfully established the physical dependence of diazepam by gradually increasing the dose.(2)There were just a few mice received with ethanolic extract for 12 weeks or iridoid-rich fraction for 16 weeks appearing some slight withdrawal symptoms after precipitated withdrawal, but it didnt show significant difference compared to normal mice. Therefore, these indicated that the risks of potential drug dependence about ethanolic extract and iridoid-rich fraction were far lower than that of diazepam.

METHODS: Literature searches were performed in PubMed and EMBASE, and 11 studies met our criteria. Summary hazard ratios or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the effect. For the pooled analysis of the correlation between decreased Muc5AC expression and clinicopathological characteristics (tumour invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, tumour-node-metastasis stage, tumour size, venous invasion and lymphatic invasion), ORs and their variance were combined to estimate the effect. RESULTS: Eleven retrospective cohort studies comprising 2135 patients were included to assess the association between Muc5AC expression and overall survival and/or clinicopathological characteristics. Decreased Muc5AC expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival of gastric cancer patients (pooled HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.08-1.7). Moreover, decreased Muc5AC expression was also significantly associated with tumour invasion depth (pooled OR = 2.12, 95%CI: 1.56-2.87) and lymph node metastasis (pooled OR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.00-2.44) in gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Decreased Muc5AC expression might be a poor prognostic predictor for gastric cancer.

In 2012, people who inject drugs (PWID) in Xichang, the capital city, contributed to 60.0 % of the HIV infections. The goal of the current study was to examine the feasibility of implementing pharmacy-delivered harm reduction services (PDHRS) for PWID. Methods: Face-to-face structured interviews with 403 PWID included questions on PWID's experiences of syringe services and their specific experiences, acceptance, and potential usage of PDHRS. Results: There were some reports of harassment/bad treatment from pharmacists (12.2 %) and police (17.6 %). Non-prescription syringe sales (NPSS) from pharmacies in single piece were the main source (82.1 %) of syringes. 72.5 % of PWID reported visiting 31.5 % of the identified pharmacies. Most (74.7 %) PWID disposed of their used syringes by throwing them away. Only one PWID brought used syringes back to a pharmacy in the past 30 days. Half of the PDHRS, such as printed materials about HIV, Hepatitis C and STIs; risk reduction services; (16.9 %) and sharps container to dispose of syringes (0.2 %) were offered by a few pharmacies (< 20 % for each service). The acceptance rates among PWID toward currently offered services were high (>= 91.1 %). All potential PDHRS were acceptable by most (68-95.3 %) PWID, and correspondingly 67-94.5 % of PWID reported they would use each service if offered. Conclusions: NPSS from pharmacies provided many PWID in Liangshan with new syringes. However, disposal of used syringes was problematic. At the time of investigation, half of 16 assessed PDHRS were already available in pharmacies in Xichang. PWID were ready to use all the potential PDHRS and 14 of 16 PDHRS were feasible to provide. HIV testing kits may be available in pharmacies in the future. Many pharmacy-delivered harm reduction services are feasible and acceptable among PWID in Xichang, China.

Seventy-six peaks were separated and detected on a fused-core column with 35 min. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis of the chromatographic data showed that the 17 batches of Qinjiao could be well categorized into three groups, which were closely related to the origins of them. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) exhibited that the quality differentiation might be explained by at least four components, in which, gentiopicroside (GE), loganic acid (LA), swertiamarin (SA) were characterized by external reference, one of them was unidentified in this work. The content levels of GE, LA and SA were more relevant to comprehensive quality of Qinjiao than the ones of shanzhiside methyl ester and sweroside was confirmed by the PLS prediction models through analyzing the relevance of the chemical profiling to the levels of them. The present study not only indicated that GE, LA, SA and one unidentified compound were the rational markers to represent the comprehensive quality of Qinjiao but also demonstrated the power of chemical profiling platform in the quality assessment of Chinese medicine herbals.

Nevertheless, little information has been released about C. chinensis, as far as functional genes and biosynthetic pathway of berberine are concerned. Here, we isolated a novel (S)-canadine synthase gene (designated as CAS-1) fromC. chinensis by using RT-PCR and RACE techniques. Results: Bioinformatics analysis showed that the cDNA is 1942 bp in length with a complete open reading frame (ORF) of 1476 bp, and the ORF encodes a polypeptide of 491 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55.29 kDa and a pI value of 8.92. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that CcCAS-1 was constitutively expressed in leaf, petiole and rhizome tissues, especially in the leaves of C. chinensis. However, the results of berberine content in different tissues by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) method showed that the leaves and the petiole tissues have similar content of berberine. Conclusions: We found that the berberine content in the rhizomewas seven times (more or less) than that in the leaves and the petioles. In addition, the full length coding sequence of CcCAS-1 was inserted into pET-32a andwas successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, laying a solid foundation for protein purification, activity assay and multi-clonal antibody preparation. Together, our data suggest that CcCAS-1 is a novel heme-thiolate enzyme essential for berberine biosynthesis in C. chinensis. (C) 2015 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

Due to limited accumulation of secondary metabolites in plants and their important roles, characterization of key enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathway will enable metabolic engineering or synthetic biology to improve or produce the compounds in plants or microorganisms, which provides an alternative for production of these valuable compounds. Salvia miltiorrhiza, containing tanshinones and phenolic acids as its active compounds, has been widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The biosynthetic analysis of secondary metabolites in S. miltiorrhiza has made great progress due to the successful genetic transformation system, simplified hairy roots system, and high-throughput sequencing. The cloned genes in S. miltiorrhiza had provided references for functional characterization of the post-modification steps involved in biosynthesis of tanshinones and phenolic acids, and further utilization of these steps in metabolic engineering. The strategies used in these studies could provide solid foundation for elucidation of biosynthetic pathways of diterpenoids and phenolic acids in other species. The present review systematically summarizes recent advances in biosynthetic pathway analysis of tanshinones and phenolic acids as well as synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications of the rate-limiting genes involved in the secondary metabolism in S. miltiorrhiza.

Diabetes self-management is critical for patients to achieved better health outcomes, however, previous studies have shown suboptimal diabetes self-management performance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors associated with diabetes self-management in Chinese adults. The results showed that confrontation, resignation, overall health beliefs, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy were factors associated with overall diabetes self-management performance and six aspects of diabetes self-management behaviors. There is some limited evidence to suggest that provider-patient communication, married individuals, higher educational level, and higher household income level may also be linked to better diabetes self-management practice. Having healthcare insurance and utilizing chronic illness resources generally appeared to have a favorable effect on diabetes self-management performance. In addition, there were a number of factors for which the evidence is too limited to be able to ascertain its strength of association with diabetes self-management practice. The findings of this review suggest that diabetes self-management behaviors are affected by a wide range of personal and environmental factors, which allow health care providers to develop theory-based strategies to improve diabetes-self-management behaviors in this population.

The observed downregulation of the protein level of p53 in cisplatin-treated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) indicates the association between cisplatin resistance, miR-125a and miR-125b. In the present study, through the detection of the expression levels of miR-125a and miR-125b, a significant upregulation of these miRs was demonstrated in cisplatin-treated patients with NPC. As a consequence, the protein expression level of p53 decreased notably. To confirm the induction of miR-125a and miR-125b by treatment with cisplatin, a cisplatin-resistant TW03 cell model (TW03/DDP) was constructed. As expected, in the TW03/DDP cells, the expression levels of miR-125a and miR-125b were upregulated, and this caused downregulation of p53. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs in the TW03 cell model sensitized TW03 to cisplatin by decreasing the protein expression levels of p53, whereas ectopic expression in the antisense oligos of these microRNAs demonstrated the opposite effect. In addition, the present demonstrated that the cisplatin-induced expression of miR-125a and miR-125b inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the TW03 cells by decreasing the protein expression levels of p53. Taken together, the present study revealed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that induction of the expression of miR-125a and miR-125b by treatment with cisplatin resulted in resistance to the cisplatin drug in the NPC cells.

Aim of the study: Evaluate the safety of iridoids rich fraction from V. jatamansiJones (IRFV) and to provide data for clinical application. Materials and methods: The acute and sub-chronic toxicity of IRFV were investigated by employing established methods. The acute toxicity study was conducted through oral administration of a single dose (3200 mg/kg body weight) of IRFV to adult mice. The vehicle used for dilution of the IRFV was a mixture of 0.5% CMC-Na and 99.5% water. The weight, diet, toxic reaction, and death after 14 days were observed. In the sub-chronic toxicity study, low doses (240 mg/kg bw), middle doses (960 mg/kg bw), and high doses (1200 mg/kg bw) of IRFV were administered daily to adult rats for 6 days a week (except Sunday) for 3 months. The general behavior of the rats was observed and recorded daily. The weight and food consumption of rats were tested weekly. The effect on organs, the hematological and blood biochemical parameters, and the histopathology were assessed after 1.5 months (five males and five females) and after 3 months (10 males and 10 females). The remaining 10 rats (five males and five females) in each group were fed for 2 weeks to observe reversible and delayed toxicity after the medicine was administered. Results: In the acute toxicity study, no significant difference was found in the body weight of the mice in the control group and those in the drug group (p > 0.05). The maximum tolerated dose of IRFV on mice was 3200 mg/kg, which is 2666 times of the clinical adult daily dose. In the sub-chronic toxicity study on rats, the daily single oral doses of the IRFV did not result in death nor affected the general behavior, including appearance, activities, discharge, and waste at all tested doses. Moreover, no significant difference was found (p > 0.05) between the body weights of the rats from the drug groups and those from the control group. Food consumption was significantly affected (p < 0.05) only in the first 3 weeks. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in the hematological and blood biochemical parameters, and no abnormality of other organs were noted in both gross and histopathological examinations, except several animal transients (p < 0.05) or spontaneous lesions (abnormality). Conclusion: IRFV is extremely safe in the usual clinical dose, and may not have any single dose toxicity. The lethal dose with 50% mortality rate (LD50) on mice is over 2000 mg/kg bw. The no-observed adverse effects level is 1200 mg/kg/day for rats. No direct correlation was found between the hematology, blood biochemical indexes, and organ coefficient of tested rats and the toxicity of IRFV. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We sought to identify the common pathological link and mechanism of action for Traditional Chinese medicine in type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular dementia, and to explicate the material basis for treating the different diseases with the same method in Traditional Chinese Medicine. METHODS: In total, 168 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular dementia were enrolled in the study, and randomly divided into two groups by simple randomization. Patients in the treatment group received oral Sancaijiangtang powders with pioglitazone hydrochloride three times daily, while patients in the control group received pioglitazone hydrochloride alone. The treatment course was for 12 weeks. Mini-mental state examinations (Chinese version) and Montreal Cognitive Assessments (Beijing version) were performed, and fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, plasma nitric oxide and endothelin-1 levels were measured before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The post-treatment levels for all measurements in both groups were better than pre-treatment levels (P < 0.05). The post-treatment levels for all measurements in the treatment group were better than the levels measured in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular dementia have common pathological mechanisms for insulin resistance and endothelium dysfunction. Sancaijiangtang powders could improve the release of nitric oxide and inhibit the secretion of endothelin-1. Therefore, the material basis exists for treating the different diseases with the same method in Traditional Chinese Medicine. (C) 2015 JTCM. All rights reserved.

METHODS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups: a trial group with 35 patients and a control group with 32 patients. The trial group was given TCCT for 3 months, then administered IVF-ET or awaited natural pregnancy. The control group was administered IVF-ET without TCCT 3 months after the previous IVF-ET or natural pregnancy attempt. The patterns of KLB were observed both before and after treatment. The natural pregnancy rate of the two groups was calculated after treatment. Differences between the two groups were compared after using IVF-ET treatment again in fertilized egg number and fertilization rate were evaluated. RESULTS: After treatment with TCM comprehensive therapy, seven patients in the treatment group became pregnant, while there were no successful conceptions in the control group. The difference in clinical pregnancy rate in the initial cycle and transfer cycle of IVF were significantly different (P < 0.05). The trial group had a significantly higher conception rate than that of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TCCT can promote the natural pregnancy rate in patients with previously failed IVF-ET. TCCT could increase patients' fertilized egg number, fertilization rate, pregnancy rate, and clinical pregnancy rate after another IVF-ET treatment. TCCT can also relieve the symptoms of KLB.

Other than the samples from Zhenping, the content of six selected alkaloids in C. chinensis did not differ significantly among the habits. Furthermore, the results of the genetic analysis showed that the genetic diversity and the genetic distance among the samples were low, suggesting that the C chinensis samples from different habits had the same genetic characteristics. These results would suggest that the quality of the drugs are not influenced by the habitats the plant is growing in. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, high-speed counter-current chromatography was investigated for the isolation and purification of prenylated phenolics from the fruits of Amorpha fruticosa by using a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane/ethanol/water (5: 4: 1, v/v). As a result, 14.2 mg of 5,7-dihydroxy-8-geranylflavanone, 10.7 mg of amorfrutin A and 17.4 mg of amorfrutin B were obtained from 200 mg of n-hexane-soluble crude extract in one step within 250 min. The purities of 5,7-dihydroxy-8-geranylflavanone, amorfrutins A and B were 95.2, 96.7 and 97.1%, respectively, as determined by ultra high performance liquid chromatography. The structural identification was performed by mass spectrometry and H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the established method is an efficient and convenient way to purified prenylated phenolics from A. fruticosa extract.

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with superiority test was designed. A total of 240 patients with chronic stable angina (blood stasis syndrome) from multiple centers were randomly and equally assigned to the treatment group and the control group. Based on standard treatment of Western medicine, the treatment group was given WSC, while the control group was given WSC mimetic, both for 12 weeks. Observed indicators included the efficacy in angina, the efficacy in Chinese medicine syndrome, the withdrawal or reduce rate of nitroglycerin and routine safety indices. After 12-week treatment, the significant effective rate and total effective rate of the treatment group were significantly better than those of the control group (23.5% vs. 9.2%, 64.7% vs. 30.8%), respectively, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.01). After 12-week treatment, the decreased points and the decreased rate of angina symptom score in the treatment group were better than in the control group (5.1 +/- 4.2 points vs. 2.8 +/- 3.5 points, 44.9%+/- 37.2% vs. 25.4%+/- 30.7%) respectively, with significant difference (P < 0.01). After 12-week treatment, the significant effective rate and total effective rate of the treatment group were better than the control group (respectively, 30.3% vs. 15.0%, 67.2% vs. 45.0%,P < 0.01). After 8- or 12-week treatment, the decreased points and the decreased rate of Chinese medicine syndrome score in the treatment group were better than the control group (P < 0.05 orP < 0.01). After 12-week treatment, nitroglycerin withdrawal rate and the withdrawal or reduce rate in treatment group were better than the control group (P < 0.01). On safety evaluation, the incidence of adverse events (7.563% vs. 7.500%) and the incidence of cardiovascular events (0.840% vs. 0.000%) in the treatment group were similar with the control group, and the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). In treatment of chronic stable angina (blood stasis syndrome), WSC can reduce angina attacks and consumption of nitroglycerin, decrease angina severity degree, effectively relieve the blood stasis syndromes, such as chest pain, chest tightness, palpitations, dark purple tongue and other symptoms. Besides, adverse events and cardiovascular adverse events in the treatment group and the control group showed no difference. All shows that the drug is safe and effective.

PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH			English	Article						Rheum palmatum L; Aconitum carmichaelii Debx; rhubarb anthraquinones; compatibility; comparative pharmacokinetics	RAT PLASMA; ANTHRAQUINONES; RHUBARB; EXTRACT; OFFICINALE; MEDICINE	Rhei Radix et Rhizoma was one of the commonly used traditional Chinese medicines, and the compatibility of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma and Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata was the basic herb pair applied in many Chinese traditional prescription. Rhubarb anthraquinones were the main bioactive materials of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma. To elucidate the compatibility of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma and Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, the pharmacokinetics of rhubarb anthraquinones as the main marker constituents were investigated. In the present study, pharmacokinetic differences of rhubarb anthraquinones were detected after oral administration of extract of Rheum palmatum L. and compatibility with Aconitum carmichaelii Debx. After oral administration, no difference of peak time can be found for anthraquinones between rhubarb group and compatibility group. But C-max and area under the curve of aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol in compatibility group were significantly higher than that in rhubarb group. Although the C-max of rhein in compatibility group was much lower than that in rhubarb group, the area under the curve value was similar in two groups. The clearance and t(1/2) of rhubarb anthraquinone were also changed after compatibility. The change of pharmacokinetics characteristics of rhubarb anthraquinone after compatibility may be caused by the drug-drug interaction medicated by chemical reaction and cytochromes P450.

Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) may be beneficial for such people. However, the exact mechanism underlying HBO-PC is not well known yet. The aim of this study is to explore the role of osteopontin (OPN) in HBO-PC-induced neuroprotection. The study consisted of two experiments. In experiment 1, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups: sham group, HBO-PC sham group, stroke group, and HBO-PC group (HBO-PC + stroke). The animals in the second experiment were randomly assigned to one of two groups: OPN small interfering (siRNA) group (HBO-PC + stroke + OPN siRNA) and control siRNA group (HBO-PC + stroke + negative control siRNA). Neurological outcome in HBO-PC group was better than that of stroke group. After OPN siRNA was administered, neurological function aggravated compared with control siRNA group. Brain morphology and structure seen by light microscopy was diminished in stroke group and OPN siRNA group, while fewer pathological injuries occurred in HBO-PC and control siRNA group. The infarct volume in HBO-PC group was the lowest, followed by OPN siRNA group and stroke group, respectively. Preconditioning with HBO promoted expression of OPN, which reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta/nuclear factor-kappa-gene binding (NF kappa B) and augmented protein kinase B (Akt). OPN siRNA reversed these changes. OPN plays an important role in the neuroprotection elicited by HBO-PC. Pretreatment with HBO may be beneficial for people going to undertake brain surgery.

DesignProactive multicenter clinic register collaboration. SettingData on all deliveries at eight hospitals in Sichuan province, China, collected from 1 January 2009 to 12 December 2010. Population33993 delivering women and 34547 live births. MethodsWe defined SMM as a combination indicator of severe maternal complications, critical interventions, admission to the intensive care unit and maternal near-miss instances. We randomly selected 80% of the data from the entire database to build a logistic regression model. The remaining 20% were used to test the predictive power of the model. Main outcome measuresSMM incidence, adjusted odds ratios (aORs), and area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. ResultsSevere maternal morbidities incidence was 43.4/1000 live births [confidence interval (CI) 41.24-45.56]. Fifteen variables were independent contributors to the model. Seven medical co-morbidities significantly affected the occurrence of SMM, including iron-deficiency anemia (aOR 3.07, CI 2.47-3.83) and other hematological diseases (aOR 5.82, CI 3.50-9.69), hepatitis-B virus infection (aOR 1.48, CI 1.12-1.97) and other hepatic diseases (aOR 3.81, CI 1.61-9.04), cardiopathy (aOR 3.59, CI 2.62-4.93), hypertension (aOR 5.23, CI 4.06-6.75), and respiratory diseases (aOR 2.10, CI 1.25-3.52). The area under the ROC curve was 0.8127. ConclusionsThe incidence of SMM was typical of a low resource area. There is a need to identify medical co-morbidities and to adopt prophylactic measures and interventions.

Methods Expression of mRNAs encoding TET1-3 and TDG in 162 breast cancer tissues was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The general characteristics of patients and clinicopathologic factors were collected. Estimation of patient survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic indicators were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Results The level of TET1 mRNA was significantly related to overall survival (OS) (P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis shows that the TNM stage was an independent predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.761, 95% CI: 1.124-2.761, P = 0.014) and OS (HR = 2.135, 95% CI: 1.070-4.263, P = 0.032). Further, in patients with EBC who were treated with anthracy-clines, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates that the levels of TET3 and TDG mRNAs were related to DFS (P = 0.026 and 0.030, respectively), and multivariate analysis reveals that high levels of TET3 (HR = 1.944, 95% CI: 1.029-3.672, P = 0.040) and TDG (HR = 2.178, 95% CI: 1.140-4.163, P = 0.018) mRNAs were independent indicators of favorable DFS. Conclusions Our study indicates that EBC patients with decreased expression of TET1 mRNA had worse OS and that the levels of TET3 and TDG mRNAs were independent prognostic factors for patients who received anthracycline chemotherapy.

Gaertn is a famous drinking food and herbal medicine in China, and have been commonly used for treating various diseases. Purpose: This study was designed to investigate the antitumor effect of tatariside F (TF) isolated from the roots of F tataricum against H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo and explore the possible mechanisms. Methods: In our present study, the anti-proliferative effect of IF against H22 cells was evaluated by MTT method. Furthermore, a mice xenograft model was established to investigate the antitumor effect of IF on HCC in vivo, and the possible mechanisms were determined by western blot and fluorescence polarization binding assay. In addition, the protective effect of TF on liver was also investigated by examining the histopathological changes and determining the liver biochemical parameters. Results: Our results demonstrated that IF possessed notable antitumor effect against HCC both in vivo and in vitro, and the possible mechanism might be related to up-regulation of the protein expressions of Bax and p53, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. What's more, IF also exhibited protective effects against CTX (cyclophosphamide)-induced liver damages when co-administrated with CTX. Conclusion: Our study suggested that IF possess notable antitumor effects against HCC and might play a favorable role in drug combination therapy against tumors with protective effect on liver.

The complex's physicochemical properties were systemically investigated in terms of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR). In vivo and in vitro antitumor studies, CUB-PLC-BER and the unmodified cucurbitacin B-phospholipid complex (CUB-PLC) presented stronger antitumor efficacy against human cholangiocarcinoma cells (QBC939 cells) than free cucurbitacin B (CUB), while phospholipids (PL) itself had no significant toxicity. Besides that, CUB-PLC showed the advantage over the free CUB and CUB-PLC-BER with regard to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo antitumor study. Failure to establish the orthotopic CC model, the study attempted to measure the level of CUB in plasma and in bile to explore bile duct-targeted effect indirectly. In the pharmacokinetics study in rats, the average values of C-max and AUC(0-8h) of CUB-PLC-BER group in rat bile were higher than those of CUB-PLC, while an opposite result was found in plasma. Meanwhile, the C-max, AUC(0-8h), and AUC(0-8h) of CUB were the least both in plasma and in bile. The results indicated that the CUB-PLC-BER tended to provide a high and prolonged drug concentration to bile duct, and PL played a central role in internalizing CUB into cells to improve the water insoluble drug's permeability, which was of great benefit to enhance the bioavailability of CUB and improve therapeutic efficacy of CC. These results elucidated the potential of CUB-PLC-BER as drug delivery system for improving bile duct-targeted and therapeutic efficacy for CC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Liquiritigenin is available in common foods and alternative medicine, and its derivative-ISL is applied into food additives and disease treatment like cancer therapy, antibiotic therapy, and so on. This review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the pharmacological activities of ISL. The information published between 1972 and 2014 from a number of reliable sources including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Wiley-Blackwell. The practical application of ISL on the various disease prevention and treatments may stem from its numerous pharmacological properties such as antiinflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-oxidative, anticancer activities, immunoregulatory, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective effects.

Raw plant materials used for medicinal products from different geographical regions are often inconsistent in chemical composition. Metabolic fingerprinting provides a new approach for distinguishing the geographical origins of L. rotata. ObjectiveTo identify metabolites that contribute to the different geographical regions of L. rotata samples. MethodsLamiophlomis rotata metabolomics were performed by H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analyses. The L. rotata metabolic profile was prepared for NMR measurements using methanol-d(4) solvent. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to analyse the L. rotata(1)H-NMR spectroscopy data. ResultsNine iridoid glycosides, one flavonoid and three phenylpropanoid glycosides were detected in L. rotata by H-1-NMR spectroscopy. H-1-NMR measurements and multivariate analysis were used to successfully discriminate samples from three different locations. ConclusionThe NMR-based analysis of L. rotata is a more comprehensive approach than traditional chromatographic methods. Simple sample preparation, rapidity and reproducibility of are additional advantages of NMR analysis. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, no systematic review of Yinchenhao decoction in treating cholestasis has been completed. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Yinchenhao decoction in treating cholestasis. Materials and methods: The major databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang database, VIP medicine information system and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched from the databases' inception through November 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Yinchenhao decoction reported in publications for treatment of cholestasis were extracted by two reviewers. The RCTs examined included total efficacy rate and biochemical indices including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL). The Cochrane tool was applied to assess the risk of bias of the trials. The main outcomes of the trials were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 software. The odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the effect. Results: Among the 698 studies identified in the literature search, 15 studies involving 1405 subjects with cholestasis were included in the analysis. Yinchenhao decoction demonstrated efficacy in cholestasis treatment whether in a combined application or not. Additionally, the decoction significantly reduced the elevated levels of cholestasis serum markers, such as ALT, AST, TBIL and DBIL, with a significant difference observed in short and long curative time periods. Remarkably, Yinchenhao decoction displayed a significant efficacy in treating the long-term disease. Conclusion: No serious adverse event was reported. This meta-analysis provides evidence that Yinchenhao decoction is an effective and safe treatment for cholestasis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 49 consecutive patients with histopathologically confirmed small solid renal tumors, and seven healthy volunteers were imaged using nonenhanced MRI and DW-MRI. The ADC map was calculated using the b values of 0, 50, 400, and 600 s/mm(2) and values compared via the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. The utility of ADC for differentiating RCCs and benign lesions was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Multiple nonenhanced MRI features were analyzed by Logistic regression. Results: The tumors consisted of 33 cases of clear-cell RCCs (ccRCCs) and 16 cases of benign tumors, including 14 cases of minimal fat angiomyolipomas and 2 cases of oncocytomas. The ADCs showed significant differences among benign tumors ([0.90 +/- 0.52] x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), ccRCCs ([1.53 +/- 0.31] x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and the normal renal parenchyma ([2.22 0.12] x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (P < 0.001). Moreover, there was statistically significant difference between high and low-grade ccRCCs (P = 0.004). Using a cut-off ADC of 1.36 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, DW-MRI resulted in an area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity equal to 0.839, 75.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Nonenhanced MRI alone and the combination of imaging methods led to an AUC, sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.919, 93.9%, and 81.2%, 0.998, 97%, and 100%, respectively. The Logistic regression showed that the location of the center of the tumor (inside the contour of the kidney) and appearance of stiff blood vessel were significantly helpful for diagnosing ccRCCs. Conclusions: DW-MRI has potential in distinguishing ccRCCs from benign lesions in human small solid renal tumors (<= 4 cm), and in increasing the accuracy for diagnosing ccRCCs when combined with nonenhanced MRI.

The objective of this study was to determine the brain structural characteristics in FD patients. Methods Optimized voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were employed to investigate the changes in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) respectively in 34 FD patients with postprandial distress syndrome and 33 healthy controls based on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. The Pearson's correlation evaluated the link among GM alterations, WM abnormalities, and clinical variables in FD patients. The optimal brain structural parame-ters for identifying FD were explored using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Key Results Compared to controls, FD patients exhibited a decrease in GM density (GMD) in the right posterior insula/temporal superior cortex (marked as pINS), right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and left middle cingulate cortex, and an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, and external capsule (EC). Interestingly, the GMD in the pINS was significantly associated with GMD in the IFC and FA in the EC. Moreover, the EC adjacent to the pINS provided the best performance for distinguishing FD patients from controls. Conclusions & Inferences Our results showed pINS-related structural abnormalities in FD patients, indicating that GM and WM parameters were not affected independently. These findings would lay the foundation for probing an efficient target in the brain for treating FD.

GT-NLCs was prepared by the high pressure homogenization method and then characterized by morphology and analyses of particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), and drug loading (DL), The NLCs was suitably gelled for skin permeation studies in vitro and pharmacodynamic evaluation in vivo, compared with the GT emulgel. The GT-NLC remained within the colloidal range and Was uniformly dispersed after suitably gelled by carbopol preparation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study showed GT-NLCs was spherical in shape. The EE (%) and DL (%) could reach up to (81.84 +/- 0.60)% and (2.13 +/- 0.12)%, respectively. The result of X-ray diffractograms (XRD) showed that GTs were in an amorphous state in the NLC-gel. In vitro permeation studies through rat skin indicated that the amount of GTs permeated through skin of GT-NLCs after 24 h was higher than that of GT emulsion, and GT-NLCs increased the accumulative amounts of GTs in epidermis 7.76 times greater than GT emulsion. GT-NLC-gel was found to possess superior therapeutic effect for frostbite, compared with the GT emulgel. The NLC based topical gel of GTs could improve -their therapeutic effect for frostbite.

In this study, spirolingzhines A-D, four meroterpenoids with a spiro[benzofuran-2,1'-cyclopentanel motif, lingzhines A-F, six meroterpenoids with diverse ring systems, along with two known compounds were isolated from the fruiting bodies of this fungus. The structures and stereochemistry of these substances were determined by using spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic and computational methods. Chiral HPLC was used to separate (-)- and (+)-antipodes of seven of ten meroterpenoids, which were isolated from the fungus as racemic mixtures. Several of the metabolites were found to promote proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and, as such, they constitute a class of NSC stimulators. The most potent member of this series, (-)-spirolingzhine A, was shown to affect NSC cell cycle progression using the 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The anti-proliferative effects of 4-ACGC on lung cancer cell lines including A549, NCI-H1299, HCC827 were evaluated by MIT method and the IC50 values were calculated, and subsequently a mice xenograft model of A549 was established to investigate the antitumor effect of 4-ACGC in vivo. Furthermore, the apoptosis of the A549 cells was determined by fluorescence microscope by staining with Hoechst 33324 and flow cytometer by staining with FITC conjugated Annexin V/PI, and the further mechanisms were investigated by Western blotting. Our results demonstrated that 4-ACGC possessed notable anti-tumor activity on lung cancer in vivo and in vitro; the mechanisms were involved in inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via up-regulations of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bad and Bax, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Collectively, our results indicated that the 4-ACGC could be treated as a new candidate for treatment of lung cancer in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The antioxidant activities of the extracts were evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays. Baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. For microwave extraction, with a ten minutes treatment, the extraction efficiencies of the analytes were higher than treatments by refluxing for 180minutes and sonication for sixty minutes. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the microwave extracts was slightly higher than the extracts obtained by the other methods. Microwave extraction conditions were further optimized by a single-factor experiment and the optimum conditions were 50 percent ethanol-water (volume by volume), an extraction temperature of 100 degrees celsius, an extraction time of ten minutes, and a sample to solvent ratio of 1:50. This study combines extraction, phytochemistry, and bioactivity to screen the most efficient extraction procedure for flavonoids from Radix Scutellariae.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hypothalamic LKB1-AMPK-ACC signaling and EA. Methods: Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups fed either chow (chow-fed group) or high-fat diet (HF group). After 4 weeks of feeding, obese rats in the HF group (defined as weighing 20 % or more than rats in the chow-fed group) were randomly allocated into an EA or Diet-induced obesity (DIO) group. The EA group was given EA on bilateral ST25-ST36 for 4 weeks, while the DIO group received no further intervention. Body weight of the chow-fed, DIO, and EA groups were measured weekly. mRNA and protein levels of the hypothalamic LKB1-AMPK-ACC signaling pathway were detected using real-time (RT)-PCR and western blot, respectively. Results: After 4 weeks of EA treatment, the weight growth trend of rats in the EA group was inhibited compared with those in the DIO group. RT-PCR and western blotting showed that EA upregulated the transcription of Adenosine 5'-monophosphate - activated protein kinase alpha 2 (AMPK alpha 2), promoted protein expression of Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMPK alpha 1, and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) protein expression in the hypothalamus. Conclusions: This study suggests that hypothalamic LKB1-AMPK-ACC signaling plays an important role in EA treatment for obesity.

However, it should be noted that MTT assay may not accurately reflect the effect of Cistanche tubulosa ethanolic extract on EA.hy926 cells viability. To investigate and identity the components responsible for the contradictory observations of the MTT assay, echinacoside and acteoside, two main phenylethanoid glycosides, from C. tubulosa ethanolic extract were isolated. The data derived from CCK-8, Hoechst 33342 and annexin V-FITC/PI assays suggest that the caffeyl group present in both isolated compounds was responsible for the conflicting results of the MTT assay. These data emphasize the need of using a variety of different methods to determine the effect of medicinal agents on cell viability to avoid generating misleading results.

At present, the majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies focus on the motor dysfunction and the acute stage of ischemic stroke. This study recruited 15 right-handed ischemic stroke patients at subacute stage (15 days to 11.5 weeks) and 15 age-matched healthy participants. A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed on each subject to detect cerebral activity. Regional homogeneity analysis was used to investigate the difference in cerebral activities between ischemic stroke patients and healthy participants. The results showed that the ischemic stroke patients had lower regional homogeneity in anterior cingulate and left cerebrum and higher regional homogeneity in cerebellum, left precuneus and left frontal lobe, compared with healthy participants. The experimental findings demonstrate that the areas in which regional homogeneity was different between ischemic stroke patients and healthy participants are in the cerebellum, left precuneus, left triangle inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus and anterior cingulate. These locations, related to the motor, sensory and emotion areas, are likely potential targets for the neural regeneration of subacute ischemic stroke patients.

Because they regulate arterial inflammation and are closely related to atherosclerosis and plaque instability, these two mutated genes have become a research hotspot. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the risk of ischemic stroke and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ALOX5AP and PDE4D genes in a southeastern Chinese population. Methods: A total of 459 patients with stroke and 462 control individuals were recruited in the study. Four ALOX5AP SNPs (SG13S32, SG13S42, SG13S89, and SG13S114), and three PDE4D SNPs (SNP83, SNP87, and SNP45) were studied. SNP genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by allele-specific primer extension, with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. Data were coded and entered in SPSS Windows (version 16.0). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis was applied to detect gene-gene interactions. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the SNP genotype frequencies between cases and controls for the seven SNPs studied. GMDR analysis revealed no evidence of interactions between these seven polymorphic sites and an increased stroke risk. In addition, no association between different stroke types and the control group was detected. Results showed that only the ALOX5AP gene, and specifically the rs9551963 and rs4769060 genotypes, exhibited significantly different distributions between the stroke and control groups in female participants. Conclusion: No association was found between SNPs of ALOX5AP or PDE4D and the risk of overall ischemic stroke in a southeastern Chinese population. Interactions between these two genes were not risk factors for cerebral infarction. In atherothrombotic and small-artery disease subtypes, none of the seven SNPs was associated with any stroke risk; however, the ALOX5AP gene might be related to ischemic stroke incidence in females.

Methods: The relationship of chemical constituents in Baizhi with different sulfur fumigation time and dosages was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint and chemometrics methods, including similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). HPLC was carried out on a Diamonil C18 column; linear gradient elution was performed with acetonitrile and water; column temperature, injection volume of sample, flow rate, detection wavelength and testing time were 30 degrees C, 20 mu L, 1 mL/min, 310 nm and 75 min respectively. Results: The chemical constituents of Baizhi significantly (p < 0.05) decreased after sulfur fumigation though sulfur fumigation time and dosage were at low levels - 2 h and 25 g (sulphur)/10 kg (Baizhi), respectively. Conclusion: Sulfur fumigation is not a desirable method for field processing of Baizhi even when sulfur fumigation time and dosage were short and small.

Pinnatifida (FCP) fruit and its stir-fried forms. Methods: FCP fruit was stir-fried and monitored by an online-type and non-contact temperature measurement system (ONTMS). Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the volatile composition of raw FCP and its various stir-fried forms. Results: The color of FCP turned darker with the stir-frying process. In all, 47 volatile compounds with contents > 1 % were identified. The major volatile components were methyl acetate (4.40 %), n-hexane (2.90 %), 2-methyl-furan (1.80 %), 3-methyl-butyraldehyde (3.64 %), hexanal (2.08 %), furaldehyde (5.77 %), and D-limonene (7.99 %) in raw FCP. Following stir-frying, the contents of furaldehyde, 5-methyl-furaldehyde, methyl acetate, 2-methyl-butyraldehyde, D-limonene and 2-methyl-furaldehyde were altered significantly, which might have resulted in odor changes. Conclusion: HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS is a rapid and eco-friendly method with the potential to analyze volatile compounds in raw and processed FCP.

Through method optimization, the five compounds all expressed good linearity (R-2 > 0.9990) in a wide concentration range together with satisfactory accuracy, precision, and stability. Moreover, through qualitative analysis of the chemical fingerprint combined with similarity analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, principle component analysis, and partial least-squares discriminate analysis, we determined that the 13 batches of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. were similar in internal quality and the differences resulted from various cultivation environments, recovery elements, and others. Seen from the results of hierarchical cluster analysis and principle component analysis, the classification of 13 batches was in accordance, and partial least-squares discriminate analysis technique was more suitable than the principle component analysis model to provide a distinct classification of test samples on the basis of their different components. Moreover, a permutation test verified the rationality of partial least-squares discriminate analysis and variable importance plot showed that peaks 37 and 38 were the most significant variables in distinguishing the Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. samples. The idea of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. was convenient, sensitive, and comprehensive, which could be applied to evaluate the quality of more traditional Chinese medicines.

In the present study, we investigated whether hFTUC-derived stem cells are able to differentiate into germ cells. The hFTUC-derived stem cells were first isolated, expanded and then cultured in differentiation medium containing human follicular fluid, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol for 24 days. During the period of induction, a subpopulation of the cultured cells appeared that had a morphological resemblance to primordial germ cells (PGCs) and cumulus-oocyte complex (COC)-like cells, and oocyte-like cells (OLCs). The PGC-like cells expressed specific markers indicative of germ cell formation such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1), B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (BLIMP1), PR domain containing 14 (PRDM14), transcription factor AP-2 gamma (TFAP2C), VASA, STELLA, deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3). The OLCs, which contained a single germinal vesicle, expressed oocyte-specific markers, such as synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3), growth/differentiation factor-9 (GDF9), GDF9B and zona pellucida (ZP)1, ZP2 and ZP3. The COC-like cells secreted estradiol, vascular endothelial growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor. Thus, our findings suggest that hFTUC-derived stem cells have an intrinsic ability to differentiate into OLCs, which may provide an in vitro model for the identification of factors involved in germ cell formation and differentiation.

The association between the nervous and immune system is defined as an neuroimmunological theory that supports a model of pathology or treatment for AD. Interleukin (IL)-1 beta has a pro-inflammatory function in AD; however, the mechanism of its dysregulation in AD remains unknown. It is therefore of significance to understand the molecular mechanisms of IL-1 beta and how it may regulate AD. Proteins, which have been previously reported to be associated with IL-1 beta in AD, have been used in the present study as nodes to illustrate a net of protein interaction in Cytoscape. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was used to further analyze the association of these proteins with the pathology of AD. The present study identified and subsequently compared two AD and six IL-1 beta pathways with the network produced in Cytoscape. The present study identified important mechanisms in the pathology of AD and constructed two novel networks using Cytoscape.

The hippocampus, a limbic structure important in anxiety-related behavior, is vulnerable to long-term stress. Given that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is widely distributed in the hippocampus and its genetic variation is thought to contribute to the interindividual variability in pain perception and anxiety regulation, whether or not migraine and COMT val(158)met genotype have an interactive effect in the key brain area related to maladaptive stress, the hippocampus, is still poorly understood. Using T1-weighted and resting functional MRI, we evaluated the effect of COMT genetic variations on migraine and possible interactions between COMT and the disease in brain structure and function in 135 females with migraine without aura (MWoA) and 111 matched health controls (HC). Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses were applied. From the whole brain VBM analysis, we found a significant disease x genotype interaction in the hippocampus, which overlapped with disease-related increase of gray matter (GM) in val homozygote migraineurs. In our results, increased GM in the hippocampus was only found in val homozygote MWoA compared to val homozygote HC. Moreover, FC between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly decreased in val homozygotes, and it was negatively correlated with self-rating anxiety scale values.Our results indicated that brain structure and function of the hippocampus are differentially affected by migraine in val homozygotes compared with met carriers.

However, the principle of reorganization of the migraine brain network as the brain progresses into chronic pain remain poorly understood. Here, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and graph theory approaches, we aimed to investigate the dynamic dysfunctional connectivity in 108 patients with migraine without aura (MWoA) and 30 gender-matched healthy controls (HC). All patients were divided into 40 groups using a sliding boxcar grouping of subjects in disease duration order. As compared with HC, nonparametric permutation tests were applied for between-group comparisons of functional connectivity strength in each patient group. We focused only on the between-group differences of functional connections in MWoA, and the situation how these different connections were organized along with the changing trend. As the disease duration increased, the presence of chronic headache altered the functional connectivity from the local central nervous system (CNS) to a disruption in the whole-brain networks. These dysfunctional connections integrated into a connected component in relatively longer migraine duration groups, suggesting an abnormal integrated network configuration with ongoing central changes for long-term migraine. Within these between-group differences of the connected component, there were contained a small number of brain regions that had disproportionately numerous connections. Moreover, these brain regions exhibited a tendency to link to each other were organized into a strongly interconnected community. These interconnected brain regions were mainly located in the sensory-discriminative brain areas. Our results exhibited a working model of the central mechanisms of migraine where the brain functional connectivity was altered from the local central nervous system to a densely interconnected center, which may extend our understanding of the role of learning mechanisms which are likely involved in maintenance of chronic pain.

For insights to chilling resistance ability of this plant species, a cold response transcription factor, JcCBF2, was cloned and studied. It codes a 26 kDa protein, which contains all conserved motifs unique to the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) family and has high similarity to CBFs of Ricinus communis and Populus. Its transcripts express specifically in leaves of Jatropha at cold temperature. After transmitting the report vector, 35S::JcCBF2-GFP, into Arabidopsis thaliana, JcCBF2 protein is main detected in cell nucleus, being consistent to the nuclear orientation signal in its N-terminal. Compared to the control Arabidopsis, the frozen leaves of JcCBF2-overexpressed seedlings grow stronger with less malondialdehyde, smaller leaf conductivity and activer superoxide dismutase, showing their higher freezing tolerance. RT-PCR tests revealed that JcCBF2 functioned mainly at the early stage (0-6 h) of resistance events in Arabidopsis, and its transcripts reduced after 6 h. In addition, JcCBF2 could quickly regulate transcripts of some cold-responsive (COR) genes such as RD29A, COR105A and COR6.6, also during the early stage of frozen treatment. This study not only proves the chilling resistance roles of JcCBF2, but also presents a candidate gene engineering for improvement of chilling tolerance in J. curcas.

Previous studies have demonstrated that ISL efficiently limited the activities of breast CSCs. However, the cancer prevention activities of ISL and its precise molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report a novel function of ISL as a natural demethylation agent targeting WIF1 to prevent breast cancer. ISL administration suppressed in vivo breast cancer initiation and progression, accompanied by reduced CSC-like populations. A global gene expression profile assay further identified WIF1 as the main response gene of ISL treatment, accompanied by the simultaneous downregulation of beta-catenin signaling and G0/G1 phase arrest in breast CSCs. In addition, WIF1 inhibition significantly relieved the CSC-limiting effects of ISL and methylation analysis further revealed that ISL enhanced WIF1 gene expression via promoting the demethylation of its promoter, which was closely correlated with the inhibition of DNMT1 methyltransferase. Molecular docking analysis finally revealed that ISL could stably dock into the catalytic domain of DNMT1. Taken together, our findings not only provide preclinical evidence to demonstrate the use of ISL as a dietary supplement to inhibit mammary carcinogenesis but also shed novel light on WIF1 as an epigenetic target for breast cancer prevention.

Although acupuncture has been widely accepted as a clinical approach for angina, there is no sufficient evidence of its effectiveness against this syndrome, and its mechanisms have not yet been well elucidated. We develop this protocol to confirm the clinical efficacy of electro-acupuncture on stable angina pectoris by needling on acupoint Neiguan (PC6). Furthermore, we employ high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the gene expression profiling and determine involvement of histone modifications in the regulation of genes after electro-acupuncture treatment. Methods/Design: A randomized, controlled, double-blinded (assessor and patients) trial will be carried out. Sixty participants will be randomly assigned to two acupuncture treatment groups and one control group in a 1: 1: 1 ratio. Participants in acupuncture groups will receive 12 sessions of electro-acupuncture treatment across 4 weeks, followed by a 12-week randomization period. The acupuncture groups are divided into Neiguan (PC6) on Pericardium Meridian of Hand-jueyin or a non-acupoint. The primary clinical measure of effect is the frequency of angina attacks between these groups for four weeks after randomization. RNAs are extracted from peripheral neutrophils collected from all participants on day 0, day 30, and week 16, and are processed to RNA-Seq. We then investigate profiles of histone modifications by ChIP-Seq, for H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylation of H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27ac), in the presence or absence of acupuncture treatment. Discussion: This study determines the efficacy and mechanisms of electro-acupuncture on stable angina pectoris. We focus on effectiveness of acupuncture on alleviating symptoms of myocardial ischemia and the gene regulation and the chromatin remodeling marks, including H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and H3K27ac, which could be key factors for regulating gene expressions caused by electro-acupuncture treatment at Neiguan. This is the first genome-wide study of electro-acupuncture treatment in angina patients, and will provide valuable information for future studies in the fields of acupuncture and its underlying mechanisms. Fourteen patients have been recruited since recruitment opened in November of 2012. This study is scheduled to end in November of 2014.

The present study was designed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of HCD and ascertain its active ingredients and possible mechanism. Materials and methods: Mice were orally administrated with different parts (seeds, testa and kernel) and fractions of HCD. The hepatoprotective activities of different parts (seeds, testa and kernel) and three fractions (petroleum ether fraction, ethyl acetate fraction and aqueous fraction) with different polarities of HCD and herpetrione (HPE) isolated from HCD were determined using a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver injury based on the analysis of serum ALT and AST activities and the changes of antioxidant parameters like malondialdehyde (MDA) content, glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the liver. Moreover, the chemical analysis of different parts and fractions of HCD was later analyzed by HPLC. Results: Our results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction and HPE significantly alleviated liver injury as indicated by the decreased levels of serum ALT and AST and reduce the pathological tissue damage induced by CCl4. Moreover, they decreased the MDA content and increased the levels of SOD, GSH and GSH-Px. Chemical analysis indicated that the ethyl acetate fraction were rich in HPE. Conclusions: The lignans extract of Herpetospermum caudigerum is effective for the prevention of CCl4-induced hepatic damage in mice and HPE may be partially responsible for the pharmacological effect of hepatoprotection. The hepatoprotective effect may be related to its free radical scavenging effect, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increasing antioxidant activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present paper aims to provide an up-to-date review on the traditional uses and advances in the botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of this plant. Furthermore, the possible trends and a perspective for future research of this plant are also discussed. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed on A. catechu based on classic books of herbal medicine, PhD. and MSc. dissertations, government reports, the state and local drug standards, scientific databases including Pubmed, SciFinder, Scopus, the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and others. Various types of information regarding this plant are discussed in corresponding parts of this paper. In addition, perspectives for possible future studies of A. catechu are discussed. Results: The seeds of A. catechu (areca nut) have been widely used in clinical practice in China, India and other South and Southeast Asian Countries. Currently, over 59 compounds have been isolated and identified from A. catechu, including alkaloids, tannins, flavones, triterpenes, steroids, and fatty acids. The extracts and compounds isolated from A. catechu have many pharmacological activities. These include antiparasitic effects, antidepressive effects, anti-fatigue effects, antioxidant effects, antibacterial and antifungal effects, antihypertensive effects, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, anti-allergic effects, the promotion of digestive functions, suppression of platelet aggregation, regulatory effects on blood glucose and lipids, etc. Although arecoline is the primary active constituent of A. catechu, it is also the primary toxic compound. The main toxicities of arecoline are the promotion of oral submucosal fibrosis (OSF) and cytotoxic effects on normal human cells, which involve inducing apoptosis. Conclusion: As an important herbal medicine, A. catechu has potential for the treatment of many diseases, especially parasitic diseases, digestive function disorders, and depression. Many traditional uses of A. catechu have now been validated by current investigations. However, further research should be undertaken to investigate the clinical effects, toxic constituents, target organs, and pharmacokinetics and to establish criteria for quality control for A. catechu-derived medications. In addition, it will be interesting to investigate the active macromolecular compounds and active constituents other than alkaloids in both raw and processed products of A. catechu.

However, the quantitative relationship between the transcallosal tract integrity and clinical motor performance score after stroke remains unexplored. The current study employed a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the relationship between white matter diffusivity changes and the clinical scores in stroke patients. Probabilistic fiber tracking was also used to identify structural connectivity patterns in the patients. Thirteen ischemic stroke patients and fifteen healthy control subjects participated in this study. TBSS analyses showed that the corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) in the stroke patients exhibited significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and increased axial and radial diffusivity compared with those of the controls. Correlation analyses revealed that the motor and neurological deficit scores in the stroke patients were associated with the value of diffusivity indices in the CC. Compared with the healthy control group, probabilistic fiber tracking analyses revealed that significant changes in the inter-hemispheric fiber connections between the left and right motor cortex in the stroke patients were primarily located in the genu and body of the CC, left anterior thalamic radiation and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral CST, anterior/superior corona radiate, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus, strongly suggesting that ischemic induces inter-hemispheric network disturbances and disrupts the white matter fibers connecting motor regions. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that DTI-derived measures in the CC can be used to predict the severity of motor skill and neurological deficit in stroke patients. Changes in structural connectivity pattern tracking between the left and right motor areas, particularly in the body of the CC, might reflect functional reorganization and behavioral deficit.

Extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments have proved that the decreased activity of the cholinergic neuron is responsible for the memory and cognition deterioration. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine recePtor (alpha 7-nAChR) is proposed to a drug target of AD, and compounds which acting as alpha 7-nAChR agonists are considered as candidates in AD treatment. Chinese medicine Coptidis Rhizome and its compounds are reported in various anti-AD effects. In this study, virtual screening, docking approaches and hydrogen bond analyses were applied to screen potential alpha 7-nAChR agonists from Coptidis Rhizome. The 3D structure of the protein was obtained from PDB database. 87 reported compounds were included in this research and their structures were accessed by NCBI Pubchem. Docking analysis of the compounds was performed using AutoDock 4.2 and AutoDock Vina. The images of the binding modes hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic interaction were rendered with PyMOL1.5.0.4. and LigPlot+ respectively. Finally, N-tran-feruloyltyramine, isolariciresinol, flavanone, secoisolariciresinol, (+)-lariciresinol and dihydrochalcone, exhibited the lowest docking energy of protein-ligand complex. The results indicate these 6 compounds are potential alpha 7 nAChR agonists, and expected to be effective in AD treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Human platelet lysate represents an efficient alternative to fetal bovine serum for clinical-scale expansion of MSCs. Different media used in culture processes should maintain the biological characteristics of MSCs during multiple passages. However, bone marrow-derived MSCs and adipose tissue-derived MSCs have not yet been directly compared with each other under human platelet lysate conditions. This study aims to conduct a direct head-to-head comparison of the biological characteristics of the two types of MSCs under human platelet lysate-supplemented culture conditions for their ability to be used in regenerative medicine applications. Methods: The bone marrow-and adipose tissue-derived MSCs were cultured under human platelet lysate conditions and their biological characteristics evaluated for cell therapy (morphology, immunophenotype, colony-forming unit-fibroblast efficiency, proliferation capacity, potential for mesodermal differentiation, secreted proteins, and immunomodulatory effects). Results: Under human platelet lysate-supplemented culture conditions, bone marrow-and adipose tissue-derived MSCs exhibited similar fibroblast-like morphology and expression patterns of surface markers. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs had greater proliferative potential than bone marrow-derived MSCs, while no significantly difference in colony efficiency were observed between the two types of cells. However, bone marrow-derived MSCs possessed higher capacity toward osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation compared with adipose tissue-derived MSCs, while similar adipogenic differentiation potential wase observed between the two types of cells. There were some differences between bone marrow-and adipose tissue-derived MSCs for several secreted proteins, such as cytokine (interferon-gamma), growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1), and chemokine (stem cell-derived factor-1). Adipose tissue-derived MSCs had more potent immunomodulatory effects than bone marrow-derived MSCs. Conclusions: Adipose tissue-derived MSCs have biological advantages in the proliferative capacity, secreted proteins (basic fibroblast growth factor, interferon-gamma, and insulin-like growth factor-1), and immunomodulatory effects, but bone marrow-derived MSCs have advantages in osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential and secreted proteins (stem cell-derived factor-1 and hepatocyte growth factor); these biological advantages should be considered systematically when choosing the MSC source for specific clinical application.

Here, we report a novel strategy for safe and efficient endosomal/lysosomal escape of transgenes mediated by Pluronic L64, a neutral amphiphilic triblock copolymer. L64 enhanced the permeability of biomembranes by structural disturbance and pore formation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. When applied at optimal concentration, it rapidly reached the endosome/lysosome compartments, where it facilitated escape of the transfection complex from the compartments and dissociation of the complex. Therefore, when applied properly, L64 not only significantly increased polyethylenimine- and liposome-mediated transgene expression, but also decreased the cytotoxicity occasioned by transfection process. Our studies revealed the function and mechanism of neutral amphiphilic triblock copolymer as potent mediator for safe and efficient gene delivery.

We conducted a systematic review of the auricular therapy, aiming to evaluate whether there are advantages of auricular acupuncture with seed or pellet attachments for the treatment of primary insomnia. Methods: A search of relevant literatures was performed on major medical databases, including Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data and so on. Risk of bias evaluation, meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and evidence rating of all extracted information were conducted also. Results: A total of 1381 records were identified, with 15 studies deemed eligible for the present review. Meta-analyses were conducted in two comparisons separately: participants received auricular acupuncture were more likely to make an improvement in clinical effective rate (RR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.83), sleep duration (MD = 56.46, 95% CI 45.61 to 67.31), sleep efficiency (MD = 12.86, 95% CI 9.67 to 16.06), global score on PSQI (MD = -3.41, 95% CI -3.93 to -2.89), number of awakenings (MD = -3.27, 95% CI -6.30 to -0.25) and sleep onset latency (MD = -10.35, 95% CI -14.37 to -6.33) when compared to sham auricular acupuncture or placebo; while in auricular acupuncture VS medications comparison, a better effective rate (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.34), better sleep efficiency (MD = 21.44, 95% CI 16.30 to 26.58), lower PSQI score (MD = -3.62, 95% CI -4.59 to -2.65) and less adverse effect (RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26) can be seen also in auricular acupuncture group. Although these results suggested benefits of auricular acupuncture, the overall quality of evidence rated by the GRADE system was low. Conclusion: Statistical analyses of the outcomes revealed a positive effect of auricular acupuncture for primary insomnia. Nonetheless, considering the poor methodological quality, insufficient sample size and possible publication bias, current evidence is not yet adequate to provide a strong support for the use of auricular acupuncture in the treatment of primary insomnia. More strictly designed clinical studies will be needed to obtain a more explicit conclusion.

The acute cholestasic hepatitis models were induced by intragastric administration of ANIT on the third day of CDTHD administration. Then, the protective effects on cholestatic hepatitis were investigated by examining the following parameters: body weights of rats, morphological and histopathological liver changes, the levels of serum biomarkers including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Furthermore, the dose-effect relationship was investigated with the application of correspondence analysis. Result: In the tested range of doses, CDTHD at the maximum tolerance dose did not show any toxicity as time went on. The efficacy result showed that CDTHD from 21.6 g/kg.d to 86.4 g/kg.d exhibited significant hepatoprotective effect against ANIT-induced acute cholestatic hepatitis. It alleviated liver injury and reversed adverse biochemical and histopathological changes in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondence analysis showed that Radix Paeoniae Rubra in CDTHD was the main effective component and CDTHD could enhance the integrated efficacy in dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: CDTHD is beneficial to liver protection in a dose-dependent manner. Especially large dose demonstrates potent efficacy and Radix Paeoniae Rubra in the formula contributes the main effect on ANIT-induced acute cholestatic hepatitis without toxicity.

Cerebral responses to puncturing at different acupoints for treating meal-related functional dyspepsia	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						acupoint specificity; cerebral activity; functional dyspepsia	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT; PET-CT; CONNECTIVITY ANALYSIS; GASTRIC-MOTILITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SPECIFICITY; DISORDERS; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION	Background To investigate the similarities and differences in cerebral responses to puncturing at different acupoints for treating meal-related functional dyspepsia (FD). Methods Twenty right-handed FD patients were enrolled and randomized divided into two groups. Each patient received 20 sessions' electroacupuncture treatment. The acupoints used in Group A were four acupoints on the Stomach Meridian, and the acupoints used in Group B were four acupoints on the Gallbladder Meridian. PET-CT scans were performed before and after acupuncture treatment to record the changes of cerebral glycometabolism. Key Results After treatment, the dyspepsia symptoms and the quality of life (QOL) of the patients in each group were significantly improved (p < 0.05) and there was insignificant difference in efficacy between the two groups (p > 0.05). In Group A, deactivation in brainstem, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and cerebellum, left superior medial frontal gyrus, orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and thalamus, etc., and activation in bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), precuneus and lingual gyrus, etc. were observed. In Group B, deactivation in brainstem, bilateral thalamus, putamen, ACC, postterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, etc., and activation in bilateral MCC, precuneus, left OFC, etc. were observed (p < 0.05, Family-wise error corrected). Conclusions & Inferences Different acupoints have similar clinical efficacy but relatively different cerebral responses. The influence on the sensory transduction regions (brainstem and thalamus) and visceral modulation regions might be the common mechanism of different acupoints treating for FD, and the modulation on some emotion/cognition-related areas (e.g., prefrontal cortex) is the potential difference between the different acupoints.

A Retrospective Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial	FORSCHENDE KOMPLEMENTARMEDIZIN			English	Review						Retrospective analysis; Acupuncture; Functional dyspepsia subtype	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STIMULATION; ITOPRIDE; SYMPTOMS; GENOTYPE; THERAPY; POINTS	Background: Whether subgroups of functional dyspepsia (FD) should be treated with different approaches is controversially discussed in research. As our previous study has demonstrated the effect of acupuncture in FD treatment, we now further analyze the therapeutic effect of acupuncture in the treatment of postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted in 465 eligible PDS patients and 241 EPS patients. 4 acupuncture groups (group A: specific acupoints along the stomach meridian; group B: non-specific acupoints along the stomach meridian; group C: alarm and transport acupoints; group D: specific acupoints along the gallbladder meridian) were compared with a non-acupoint sham acupuncture group and an itopride group. The patients were treated in 5 consecutive sessions per week for 4 weeks and were followed-up for 12 weeks afterwards. Primary outcome of the study was defined as response rate and symptom improvement as measured by the Symptom Index of Dyspepsia, while secondary outcome was designated as improvement in quality of life (QoL) as determined by the Nepean Dyspepsia Index. Results: Symptoms of dyspepsia and QoL were improved from baseline in all groups. In EPS patients, no statistically significant differences could be observed in response rate (p = 0.239) and symptoms improvement (p = 0.344 for epigastric pain; p = 0.465 for epigastric burning). In contrast, PDS patients of the acupuncture group A showed higher response rate (53.2% vs. 19.7%, p<0.001; 53.2% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.025) and score change in postprandial fullness (1.01 vs. 0.27, p<0.001; 1.01 vs. 0.57, p<0.001), early satiation (0.81 vs. 0.21, p<0.001; 0.81 vs. 0.39, p=0.001), and QoL (14.5 vs. 4.33, p<0.001; 14.5 vs. 8.5, p<0.001) compared to the sham acupuncture and itopride group. Conclusions: FD patients with PDS responded better to the acupuncture therapies, especially at the specific acupoints along the stomach meridian. The positive therapeutic effect of acupuncture on PDS was correlated with the improvement in postprandial fullness. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrial. gov NCT00599677.

Methods: All chemical structures were re-drawn using Chemdraw Ultra 11.0. Furthermore, software including Bio-Loom for Windows - version 1.5, Molinspiration Property Calculator and ACD/I-LAB service were used to predict the drug-like properties of the alkaloids, including relative molecular mass (MW), partition coefficient log P (cLog P), number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD), number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), topological polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds (NROTB), pKa, and aqueous solubility at a given pH (LogS). In addition, Lipinski's rule was used to evaluate drug-like properties. Results: From our research, MWs of the seven compounds were all < 500. HBD and cLog P values of the seven compounds were all < 5, and HBA values were all < 10. In addition, TPSA value of each compound was < 60 angstrom(2), and NROTB value was < 10. Besides, pKa values of the seven alkaloids were > 7.5; furthermore, they possess good solubility at pH 1.0, 5.0, and 7.0. Conclusion: All the seven alkaloids possess good drug-like properties, and demonstrated good oral absorption and bioavailability. The results also suggest that these compounds can be further developed into new oral drugs for treating certain diseases.

Using the TAM air isothermal microcalorimeter, the HP-time curves of the metabolic activity of mitochondria were measured. The effects of five Aconitum L. plants, Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata (RALP), Radix Aconiti (RA), Radix Aconiti Kusnezoffii (RAK), Radix Aconiti Brachypodi (RAB), and Radix Aconiti Singularis (RAS) on the metabolic activity of mitochondria were investigated, respectively. The quantitative information, such as k, Q, P (max), T (max), T (lag), and P (av) obtained from the HP-time curves, were accumulated for analysis. With the help of PCA method, P (av) was selected as the standard for comparing the different effects of five Aconitum L. plants on metabolic activity of mitochondria. The potential sequence of efficiency was RAS > RAK > RAB > RA > RALP, and the EC50 were separately 1.43, 2.31, 1.10, 1.61, and 2.56 mg mL(-1). The results demonstrated that the five Aconitum L. plants had different bioeffects on the mitochondria metabolism. Meanwhile, this study indicated that microcalorimetry was a powerful tool to evaluate the drugs' efficiency on living system, providing some useful references for the application of five Aconitum L. plants in practice.

In this paper, microcalorimetry and Cold/Hot plate differentiating technology (CHPD) were employed to explore the hot property differences of ALRP, together with its compatibility with different ginger processed products. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), the heat power of the second peak (P (2)) and the total heat output (Q) which were the main parameters affecting the E. coli metabolism from the power-time curves were obtained. The results showed that the hot property of ALRP in compatibility with different processed ginger was in order of ZR + ALRP > ZRR + ALRP > ZRP + ALRP > ALRP. Meanwhile, the oxygen consumption and remaining rate (RR) in mice on warm plate suggested that the hot property of ALRP was totally different. The relationships between the main parameters (P (2) and Q) values and the observation indexes from CHPD were investigated with canonical correlation analysis. The correlation coefficient showed that parameter Q had a marked correlation with the observation indexes (R > 0.85). Altogether, based on bio-thermodynamics, the hot property differences of ALRP and its compatibility with different ginger processed products followed the order of ZR + ALRP > ZRR + ALRP > ZRP + ALRP > ALRP. This could provide guidance for clinical use of ALRP combining with different ginger processed products.

The present study was intended to investigate the roles of microglia on neurodevelopment and cognition in young offspring rats with prenatal sleep deprivation. Pregnant Wistar rats received 72 h sleep deprivation in the last trimester of gestation, and their prepuberty male offspring were given the intraperitoneal injection with or without minocycline. The results showed the number of Iba1(+) microglia increased, that of hippocampal neurogenesis decreased, and the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were impaired in MSD offspring. The classical microglial activation markers (M1 phenotype) IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CD68 and iNOS were increased, while the alternative microglial activation markers (M2 phenotype) Arg1, Ym1, IL-4, IL-10 and CD206 were reduced in hippocampus of MSD offspring. After minocycline administration, the MSD offspring showed improvement in MWM behaviors and increase in BrdU(+)/DCX+ cells. Minocycline reduced Iba1(+) cells, suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and reversed the reduction of M2 microglial markers in the MSD prepuberty offspring. These results indicate that dysregulation in microglial pro-and anti-inflammatory activation is involved in MSD-induced inhibition of neurogenesis and impairment of spatial learning and memory.

However, the lack of reliable and sensitive miRNA detection methods has become a bottleneck in the process. Here, we report an absolute quantification method based on the competitive PCR amplification of specific miRNAs and synthetic RNA spike-ins in a single reaction. RNA spike-ins are quantified as dynamic RNA copy number standards and are used to measure selected miRNAs free from the effects of intra-assay variables, including those from individual sample sources. Combined with the size differentiation power of capillary electrophoresis, the content of miRNAs was reproducibly measured, with verifiable detection limits of 10-46 copies over 5-log detection ranges. The direct measurements of miRNAs from 168 human serum samples and their considerable value as a diagnostic for bronchopneumonia and bronchiolitis demonstrate the potential of the assay in clinical applications.

Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how expertise influences the resting brain. Among these studies, most focused on the connectivity features within/across regions, i.e., connectivity patterns/strength. However, little concern has been given to a more fundamental issue whether or not expertise modulates baseline brain activity. We investigated this question using amplitude of low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuation (ALFF) as the metric of brain activity and a novel expertise model, i.e., acupuncturists, due to their robust proficiency in tactile perception and emotion regulation. After the psychophysical and behavioral expertise screening procedure, 23 acupuncturists and 23 matched non-acupuncturists (NA) were enrolled. Our results explicated higher ALFF for acupuncturists in the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the contralateral hand representation of the primary somatosensory area (SI) (corrected for multiple comparisons). Additionally, ALFF of VMPFC was negatively correlated with the outcomes of the emotion regulation task (corrected for multiple comparisons). We suggest that our study may reveal a novel connection between the neuroplasticity mechanism and resting state activity, which would upgrade our understanding of the central mechanism of learning. Furthermore, by showing that expertise can affect the baseline brain activity as indicated by ALFF, our findings may have profound implication for functional neuroimaging studies especially those involving expert models, in that difference in baseline brain activity may either smear the spatial pattern of activations for task data or introduce biased results into connectivity-based analysis for resting data.

Subsequently, continuous semipreparative HPLC was applied to further purify JC1 (99.8% as determined by HPLC). In addition, UPLC-PDA and UPLC-MS were established and successfully used to evaluate the isolated JC1 and PE-rich crude extract. The purity of JC1 was only 87.8% by UPLCUV. A peak (a compound highly similar to JC1) was indentified as the isomer of JC1 by comparing the characteristic UV absorption and MS spectra. Meanwhile, this strategy was also applied to analyze the PE-rich crude extract from J. curcas. It is interesting that there may be more than 15 PEs according to the same quasi-molecular ion peaks, highly similar sequence-specific fragment ions, and similar UV absorption spectrum.

We report a 41-year-old man died after transfusion of levofloxacin, gentamicin and clindamycin in the hospital. The results of toxicological investigation demonstrated three anesthetic agents (propofol, midazolam, vecuronium) in the deceased's blood, urine, liver and kidney. The autopsy and histological findings were in accordance with previous reports of propofol-related death. Eosinophilic granulocyte infiltration was not observed, but the IgE level was significantly high. After a thorough investigation, the death was clarified as a murder disguised as medical accident, from which the offender purposed to claim the compensation from the hospital. We concluded that the cause of death was cardiac and respiratory failure induced by respiratory muscles relaxation, secondary to the intravenous administration of a lethal cocktail of anesthetics, but not the anaphylaxis of antibiotics. To our knowledge, it was the first reported case of disguised medical accident complicated by anesthetics. This case highlighted the significance of cooperation between pathologists and toxicologists.

Preclinical studies demonstrate that rhein has anticancer activity. Treatment of a variety of cancer cells with rhein may induce apoptosis. Here, we report that rhein induces atypical unfolded protein response in breast cancer MCF-7 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells. Rhein induces CHOP expression, eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and caspase cleavage, while it does not induce glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression in both MCF-7 and HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, rhein inhibits thapsigargin-induced GRP78 expression and X box-binding protein 1 splicing. In addition, rhein inhibits Akt phosphorylation and stimulates FOXO transactivation activity. Rhein induces Bim expression in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, which can be abrogated by FOXO3a knockdown. Knockdown of FOXO3a or Bim abrogates rhein-induced caspase cleavage and apoptosis. The chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate acid antagonizes the induction of FOXO activation, Bim expression and caspase cleavage by rhein, indicating that protein misfolding may be involved in triggering these deleterious effects. We conclude that FOXO3a-mediated up-regulation of Bim is a key mechanism underlying rhein-induced cancer cells apoptosis.

Precision, repeatability, stability, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity range and accuracy tests were used to validate this method. The results, precision (RSD < 2%, n= 6), repeatability (RSD< 2%, n = 6) and stability (RSD < 2%, n = 6), LOD (lower than 0.02 mg/kg), LOQ(lower than 0.067 mg/kg), linearity range (0.016-39.270 mu g/mL), recoveries (90-110%, RSD <15%, n = 6), indicated that the method was feasible. This paper provided an optimization method about ion transitions which can improve the specificity of mass spectrum monitoring and the accuracy of content determination. This method can be also used to monitor and determine pesticide residues of other traditional Chinese medicine, but it was worth noting that the ion transitions should been again optimized according to the sample matrix.

We investigated the effects of MSND on acute liver failure and identified the possible mechanisms of these effects. Material and methods: Acute liver failure was induced by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (D-GalN) into specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats. Next, the rats were treated with Stronger Neo-Minophagen C and MSND via gavage. Biochemical parameters, histological changes in the liver, the survival of rats and the mRNA levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) caspase-3 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were analyzed. Results: MSND prolonged the survival times of the acute liver failure rats. The biochemical parameters were improved, and necrosis in the liver tissues was reduced by both Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC) and MSND, but MSND induced greater effects. The mRNA expressions of HMGB1, TLR4, NF-kappa B, and Caspase-3 were remarkably decreased, and the expression of PCNA was remarkably increased by SNMC and MSND, and the effects of MSND were greater. Conclusions: MSND protected the liver and increased the survival rate of acute liver failure rats. These effects were likely mediated by the inhibitions of the inflammatory reaction and apoptosis and the promotion of liver tissue regeneration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we evaluate whether the point locations chosen for a somatosensory stimulation with acupuncture needles differently change the brain activity in healthy volunteers. We used EEG, event-related fMRI, and resting-state functional connectivity fMRI to assess neural responses to standardized needle stimulation of the acupuncture point ST36 (lower leg) and two control point locations (CP1 same dermatome, CP2 different dermatome). Cerebral responses were expected to differ for stimulation in two different dermatomes (CP2 different from ST36 and CP1), or stimulation at the acupuncture point vs. the control points. For EEG, mu rhythm power increased for ST36 compared to CP1 or CP2, but not when comparing the two control points. The fMRI analysis found more pronounced insula and S2 (secondary somatosensory cortex) activation, as well as precuneus deactivation during ST36 stimulation. The S2 seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed increased connectivity to right precuneus for both comparisons, ST36 vs. CP1 and ST36 vs. CP2, however in different regions. Our results suggest that stimulation at acupuncture points may modulate somatosensory and saliency processing regions more readily than stimulation at non-acupuncture point locations. Also, our findings suggest potential modulation of pain perception due to acupuncture stimulation.

This approach utilizes an organocatalytic tandem Michael-Michael-aldol reaction that yields diverse chiral spirocyclic backbones containing six contiguous stereogenic centers and multiple functional groups. The target compounds are generated in good yield and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 95: 5 dr). Intriguingly, diastereocontrol of the spiro-products changes depending on the substrate.

Microsatellites have been preferred as the most popular molecular markers and proven effective in estimating population size, paternity test, genetic diversity for the critically endangered species. The availability of the giant panda complete genome sequences provided the opportunity to carry out genome-wide scans for all types of microsatellites markers, which now opens the way for the analysis and development of microsatellites in giant panda. Results: By screening the whole genome sequence of giant panda in silico mining, we identified microsatellites in the genome of giant panda and analyzed their frequency and distribution in different genomic regions. Based on our search criteria, a repertoire of 855,058 SSRs was detected, with mono-nucleotides being the most abundant. SSRs were found in all genomic regions and were more abundant in non-coding regions than coding regions. A total of 160 primer pairs were designed to screen for polymorphic microsatellites using the selected tetranucleotide microsatellite sequences. The 51 novel polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci were discovered based on genotyping blood DNA from 22 captive giant pandas in this study. Finally, a total of 15 markers, which showed good polymorphism, stability, and repetition in faecal samples, were used to establish the novel microsatellite marker system for giant panda. Meanwhile, a genotyping database for Chengdu captive giant pandas (n = 57) were set up using this standardized system. What's more, a universal individual identification method was established and the genetic diversity were analysed in this study as the applications of this marker system. Conclusion: The microsatellite abundance and diversity were characterized in giant panda genomes. A total of 154,677 tetranucleotide microsatellites were identified and 15 of them were discovered as the polymorphic and stable loci. The individual identification method and the genetic diversity analysis method in this study provided adequate material for the future study of giant panda.

METHODS: Rats were modeled by 4% 1-Naphthylisothiocyanate (75 mg/kg, p.o.). After 48 h, CHT was given (p.o.) at 0.75 g/kg once a day, 0.375 g/kg twice a day, and 0.25 g/kg three times a day. Blood was collected from the orbital sinus at different intervals. Levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin were detected using these blood samples. Bile was collected and determined after the first administration of CHT. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the concentration of berberine in bile simultaneously. Time-effect and time-dose curves were then obtained. RESULTS: Compared with rats taking CHT twice and three times a day, the total amount of bile within 10 h of rats taking CHT once a day were 1.32and 1.47-fold higher, respectively. There was good consistency between the pharmacokinetics of berberine and the pharmacodynamics of the effect on liver enzymes and bilirubin in vivo. The pharrna-. cokinetic analyses showed that rats administered CHT once daily maintained a higher concentration of berberine in bile for a longer period than rats administered CHT two- and three-times daily. CONCLUSION: In jaundiced rats, taking CHT once a day is better than taking CHT twice or three times a day. These data may provide a reference for the clinical application of CHT. (C) 2015 JTCM.

Fluctuations of the ecogeographical environment and major hydrographic formations might have promoted the formation of new subspecies or species. In order to understand the impact of plateau uplift on freshwater fish evolutionary history, we estimated the genetic diversity and population structure in two subspecies of Schizopygopsis chengi (S. c. chengi and S. c. baoxingensis) in upper Yangtze River in Tibetan Plateau area using mitochondrial DNA control region and eight microsatellite markers, which suggested that there was a close genetic relationship. S. chengi showed some significant genetic structure that did not correlate with geographic distance. Bayesian assignment tests indicated that S. chengi samples in the study could be divided into four populations: upstream population, midstream population, tributary population and S. c. baoxingensis population. S. c. chengi and S. c. baoxingensis showed significant genetic divergence. However, phylogenetic analysis, population structure analysis and historical gene flow estimation suggested that there was close genetic relationship between S. c. baoxingensis and the Dawei population which belongs to populations of S. c. chengi. The time that Dawei population suffered from a bottleneck and S. c. baoxingensis underwent population expansion was congruent with the last glacial period on the Tibetan Plateau. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the Dawei River and Baoxing River were once connected, and the Dawei and Baoxing populations originated from a single population, but were isolated into separate populations because of crustal movements and the Baoxing population evolved as S. c. baoxingensis.

It is commonly used for the treatment of acute & chronic cholecystitis as well as choleithiasis. To study its choleretic effect, healthy rats were randomly divided into DSC high (DSCH, 900 mg/kg), medium (DSCM, 450 mg/kg), and low (DSCL, 225 mg/kg) group, Xiaoyan Lidan tablet (XYLDT, 750 mg/kg), and saline group. The bile was collected for 1 h after 20-minute stabilization as the base level, and at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h after drug administration, respectively. Bile volume, total cholesterol, and total bile acid were measured at each time point. The results revealed that DSC significantly stimulated bile secretion, decreased total cholesterol level and increased total bile acid level. Therefore, it had choleretic effects. To identify the active components contributing to its choleretic effects, five major constituents which are menthol (39.33 mg/kg), menthone (18.02 mg/kg), isomenthone (8.18 mg/kg), pluegone (3.31 mg/kg), and limonene (4.39 mg/kg) were tested on our rat model. The results showed that menthol and limonene could promote bile secretion when compared to DSC treatment (p> 0.05); Menthol, menthol and limonene could significantly decrease total cholesterol level (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) as well as increase total bile acid level (p <0.05 or p <0.01); Isomenthone, as a isomer of menthone, existed slightly choleretic effects; Pluegone had no obvious role in bile acid efflux. These findings indicated that the choleretic effects of DSC may be attributed mainly to its three major constituents: menthol, menthone and limonene.

However, there is currently no appropriate method to clarify the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. Here, we use photoacoustic tomography ( PAT) to study the effect of acupuncture on mouse brain blood vessels. Ten healthy mice were stimulated with acupuncture needles on two acupoints. PAT images were obtained before and after acupuncture. We report that stimulation of certain acupoints resulted in changes in hemodynamics/blood flow at these points. The results demonstrate that PAT can non-invasively detect blood flow changes in mouse brain under acupuncture. This pilot study shows the potential of PAT as a visualization tool for illuminating the mechanism of acupuncture and promoting its clinical applications.

The treatment of dysmenorrhea is typically selected from multidisciplinary options, including complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion. However, there are few published randomized controlled trials concerning moxibustion treatment for dysmenorrhea. This trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of moxibustion for primary dysmenorrhea, and to identify the optimal time of moxibustion treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods/Design: This protocol is for a randomized controlled trial in which the assessor and statistician will be blinded. A total of 222 eligible patients with dysmenorrhea will be randomly assigned to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio as treatment group A (treated before menstruation onset), treatment group B (treated at the onset of menstruation), or control group C (waiting list group). The participants assigned to the treatment groups will receive suspended moxibustion treatment at Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Guanyuan (CV4), while the waiting list group will not receive moxibustion treatment until the completion of the study. The trial period will consist of three baseline menstrual cycles, three menstrual cycles of treatment, and three menstrual cycles in the follow-up period. The primary outcome will be measured by changes in the Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale and the secondary outcomes will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale, Cox Retrospective Symptom Scale, diary entries, the Self-rating Depression Scale, and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale. The safety of moxibustion will be assessed at every visit. Discussion: This trial aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion for primary dysmenorrhea, as well as to determine whether the optimal time of treatment for primary dysmenorrhea in clinical practice is before or after the onset of menstrual pain.

However, the precise gene expression profile and their interactions association with FHF are yet to be further elucidated. Methods: In this study, we detected the digital gene expression profile (DGEP) by high-throughput sequencing in normal and FHF mouse liver, and the candidate genes and potential targets for FHF therapy were verified. And the FHF mouse model was induced by D-Galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: Totally 12727 genes were detected, and 3551 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from RNA-seq data in FHF mouse liver. In FHF mouse liver, many of those DEGs were identified as differentially expressed in metabolic process, biosynthetic process, response to stimulus and response to stress, etc. Similarly, pathway enrichment analysis in FHF mouse liver showed that many significantly DEGs were also enriched in metabolic pathways, apoptosis, chemokine signaling pathways, etc. Considering the important role of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in metabolic regulation and delicate balance between cell survival and death, several DEGs involved in NF-kappa B pathway were selected for experimental validation. As compared to normal control, NF-kappa Bp65 and its inhibitory protein I kappa Ba were both significantly increased, and NF-kappa B targeted genes including tumor necrosis factor a(TNFa), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1 beta, chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 were also increased in hepatic tissues of FHF. In addition, after NF-kappa B was successfully pre-blocked, there were significant alteration of hepatic pathological damage and mortality of FHF mouse model. Conclusions: This study provides the globe gene expression profile of FHF mouse liver, and demonstrates the possibility of NF-kappa B gene as a potential therapeutic target for FHF.

Older ginseng plants are substantially more medically potent, but ginseng age can be simulated using unscrupulous cultivation practices. Telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division until they reach a critical length, at which point cells enter replicative senescence. However, in some cells, telomerase maintains telomere length. In this study, to determine whether telomere length reflects ginseng age and which tissue is best for such an analysis, we examined telomerase activity in the main roots, leaves, stems, secondary roots and seeds of ginseng plants of known age. Telomere length in the main root (approximately 1 cm below the rhizome) was found to be the best indicator of age. Telomeric terminal restriction fragment (TRF) lengths, which are indicators of telomere length, were determined for the main roots of plants of different ages through Southern hybridization analysis. Telomere length was shown to be positively correlated with plant age, and a simple mathematical model was formulated to describe the relationship between telomere length and age for P. ginseng.

Materials and Methods: It emphasized that disease, medicine and treatment method were interconnecting and the relationship among these three aspects should be handled reasonably. The major factors (including organism status, medicine source, medicine processing, compatibility of medicines, dose and course, dosage form) under the three aspects which have a more important and direct influence on the medicine clinical effect should be considered seriously in the TCM application. Results: However, it was analyzed that most of side effects of TCM may be due to the incorrect application, which violated this principle to a certain degree. In order to help people to understand the safety and toxicity of TCM objectively and provide a rational guidance for the safe and effective application of TCM, we will introduce the concept of You Gu Wu Yun and discuss these factors having influence on medicine in this review. An example will be shown in order to clarify how these factors work in medicine. Conclusions: As a unique medical system, TCM has its own theoretical basis and treatment principle. It stresses syndrome differentiation, namely personalized medicine. Therefore, it is critical to handle the relationship among disease, medicine and treatment for safe and effective medicine application.

In this study, we investigated whether the total phenols of Magnolia officinalix Rehd. et Wils (TPM) treatment improves gastrointestinal tract dysmobility induced by intraperitoneal injection of atropine (5 mg/kg) in rats. Rats were randomly grouped into three units: TPM-pretreated/atropine-treated group, atropine-treated group and control group. TPM were administrated for 7 days. Gastric residual rate and intestinal transit were measured 20 min after atropine injected, and gastrointestinal hormones (including: gastrin (GAS), motilin (MTL), somatostatin (SS) and p substance (PS) levels in serum were also measured by ELISA kits. The number and distribution of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in stomach were detected by immunohistochemistry analysis, while c-kit and stem cell factor (SCF) expressions in stomach were also measured by western blotting. We found that TPM pretreatment significantly improved atropine-induced gastric residual rate increase, while had no significantly effects on intestinal transit; it also significantly normalized GAS, MTL and PS serum levels. Atropine-induced ICCs numbers decreased in both sinuses ventriculi and body of stomach, which is improved by TPM pretreatment. Western blotting results showed the expressions of c-kit and SCF were down-regulated after atropine injection, which can be reversed with TPM pretreatment. These results above indicates that TPM treatment can significantly protected atropine-induced gastric dysmoblility, which may owed to its regulation on c-kit/SCF signing pathway.

Sperms were obtained by testicular biopsy surgery, with which we used in ICSI subsequently. The outcomes were compared by different kinds of causes leading to azoospermia in the 107 cases. 69 cases of obstructive azoospermia and 38 cases non-obstructive, the fertilization rates were 61.94% and 53.47% respectively, and pregnancy rates were 67.65% and 52.63%. 78 cases with normal volume testes and 29 cases with small testes, the fertilization rates were 70.93% and 48.80% respectively, and pregnancy rates were 66.25% and 50.00%. There was significant difference in fertilization rates between obstructive, non-obstructive and normal volume testes, small testes (P < 0.05), but no significant difference in pregnancy rates (P > 0.05). The pregnancy rate was significant difference between female age < 32 and >= 32 whatever the cause of azoospermia was (P < 0.05). Our study reveals that obstructive azoospermia and normal volume testes have higher fertilization rates in ICSI, but the pregnancy rates are only related to female age.

This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for lateral epicondylitis (LE). Methods. Seven databases and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal were searched to identify relevant studies. The data were extracted and assessed by two independent authors, and Review Manager Software (V.5.3) was used for data synthesis with effect estimate presented as standard mean difference (SMD) and mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the level of evidence. Results. Four RCTs with 309 participants were included with poor methodological quality. Participants who received acupuncture and acupuncture plus moxibustion with material insulation were likely to have an improvement in elbow functional status and/or myodynamia. The overall quality rated by GRADE was from very low to low. Two studies reported that the needle pain would be the main reason for the dropout. Conclusion. For the small number of included studies with poor methodological quality, no firm conclusion can be drawn regarding the effect of acupuncture of elbow functional status and myodynamia for LE. This trial is registered with CRD42015016199.

We conducted this randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Feng Gou Zhen as an add-on compared to conventional analgesics for patients with PAS. 132 patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to either a acupuncture group receiving sharp-hook acupuncture plus acupoint injection with conventional analgesics or a control group. Patients from both groups were evaluated at week 0 (baseline), week 1, and week 4. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline shoulder pain, measured by Visual Analogue Scale at 7 days after treatment. Secondary outcome measures include the (i) function of shoulder joint and (ii) McGill pain questionnaire. The results showed that patients in acupuncture group had better pain relief and function recovery compared with control group (P < 0.05) at 1 week after treatment. Moreover, there were statistical differences between two groups in VAS and shoulder joint function and McGill pain questionnaire at 4 weeks after treatment (P < 0.05). Therefore, the sharp-hook acupuncture helps to relieve the pain and restore the shoulder function for patients with periarthritis of shoulder.

This study investigates the influence of analytical parameters on the efficiency of separation of sennoside A and sennoside B in rhubarb by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The chromatographic parameters of column temperature and flow rate have a non-linear relationship with the theoretical plate number and symmetry factor; the optimal column temperature was 30 degrees C and the optimal flow rate was 0.20 mL min(-1). A new UHPLC analytical method was developed based on these optimal parameters. The chromatographic peak purity of sennoside A and sennoside B in rhubarb was satisfactory. This UHPLC-based analytical method was successfully applied for the quantitative determination of sennoside A and sennoside B in two sources of rhubarbs, Cassia angustifolia Vahl. and Paidu Yangyan capsule. There are remarkable content differences between sennoside A (more than 19 times) and sennoside B (more than 18 times) in the two species of rhubarb tested. In order to make the analytical method widely applicable, the analytical parameters of UHPLC have been converted into those of HPLC. In conclusion, the devised technique is suitable for the quality control of laxative herbs and diet drugs containing sennoside A and sennoside B.

Given quite a few analogs and low PGE(2) content in biological fluids, it is quite important to simultaneously meet the demands of high specificity and sensitivity. Results: Highly specific anti-PGE(2) antibodies were obtained by combined use of cationic carrier protein and Mannich reaction. The cross-reactivity values of the resultant polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against eight analogs were <14 and <5%, respectively. Furthermore, we established a highly sensitive ELISA, which could be applied to direct analysis of PGE(2) at the pg/ml level (LOQ = 15.6 pg/ml). Conclusion: We provide an appropriate strategy to develop a highly-specific and sensitive immunoassay for measuring low PGE(2) content in biological samples.

Our study mainly analyzed the expression level and function of CASP1 gene transcript variant mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with gout in different TCM syndromes. The expression of CASP1 gene transcript variant and IL-1 beta mRNA in PBMCs were detected in patients with PG [acute phase (AP: 44 cases); nonacute phase (NAP: 52 cases)] and healthy controls (HC: 30 cases) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and/or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expressions of plasma IL-1 beta in patients with PG and HC were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dysregulated expression of the CASP1 gene and its transcript variant, plasma proinflammatory cytokines in all patients with primary gout in different TCM syndromes, correlation analysis showed that there was negative correlation between the expression of CASP1-gamma gene transcript variant mRNA and IL-1 beta protein in APPG group. The study suggested that CASP1 gene and its transcript variant may play a critical role in the inflammatory response of patients with PG in different phases and TCM syndromes.

Acupuncture is advised as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. However, the effectiveness of acupuncture is inconsistent among previous studies. Fourteen ischemic patients were collected and divided into two groups: conventional treatment group (CG) and acupuncture treatment group (AG). The results of a Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and diffusion tensor imaging were collected before and after treatment. The AG exhibited a higher improvement in FMA than the CG. Repeated measures analysis of variance on diffusion data only found a significant main effect for scanning time point in all diffusion indices. In each group, a postpair t-test revealed that diffusion indices values were changed significantly after treatment intervention in the body of the corpus callosum and bilateral corticospinal tracts, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the forceps minor, the cingulum gyrus, and the thalamic radiation. However, there was no significant difference in the diffusion indices between the two groups. In conclusion, acupuncture had a better behavioral score than traditional medicine treatment. However, acupuncture did not significantly change WM in the AG compared to the CG as expected within one month after the intervention.

The aim of this review is to estimate the effectiveness and safety of ACE on obesity. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBASE, CNKI, and so forth, using combination subject terms of obesity (or overweight, weight loss, etc.) and acupoint catgut embedding (or catgut implantation, catgut embedding). Improvement rate, reduction of body weight and body mass index (BMI), and so forth were analyzed. 43 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. Although with poor methodological quality, ACE was superior to manual acupuncture (MA), sham, and cupping in improvement rate and presented a better tendency (OR > 1) compared with drugs and electroacupuncture (EA). Mean values of weight loss by ACE were 1.14 kg, 1.26 kg, 1.79 kg, and 3.01 kg comparing with MA, drugs, EA, and sham, respectively. Mean of BMI reduced to 0.56kg/m(2), 0.83 kg/m(2), 0.79 kg/m(2), and 1.63kg/m(2) comparing with MA, drugs, EA, and sham. Less adverse effects were reported. Pooled outcomes presented a tendency of equal or superior effects to other interventions and fewer side effects. Future high quality trials with rigorous design and positive FDA approved drug as control are urgent to assess the effect of ACE for obesity.

The raw SA (RAW) is commonly processed by stir-baking to yellow(SBY), stir-baking to dark brown (SBD), and stir-baking to carbon dark (SBC) for different clinical uses. In our present investigation, intelligent sensory technologies consisting of computer vision (CV), electronic nose (E-nose), and electronic tongue (E-tongue) were employed in order to develop a novel and accurate method for discrimination of SA and its processed products. Firstly, the color parameters and electronic sensory responses of E-nose and E-tongue of the samples were determined, respectively. Then, indicative components including 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) and arecoline (ARE) were determined by HPLC. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factor analysis (DFA) were performed. The results demonstrated that these three instruments can effectively discriminate SA and its processed products. 5-HMF and ARE can reflect the stir-baking degree of SA. Interestingly, the two components showed close correlations to the color parameters and sensory responses of E-nose and E-tongue. In conclusion, this novel method based on CV, E-nose, and E-tongue can be successfully used to discriminate SA and its processed products.

(PLP), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been used for hepatic disease treatment over thousands of years. In our previous study, PLP was shown to demonstrate therapeutic effect on hepatitis with severe cholestasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidative effect of PLP on alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced cholestasis by activating NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Materials and methods: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to identify the main compounds present in PLP. The mechanism of action of PLP and its therapeutic effect on cholestasis, induced by ANIT, were further investigated. Serum indices such as total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), and total bile acid (TBA) were measured, and histopathology of liver was also performed to determine the efficacy of treatment with PLP. Moreover, in order to illustrate the underlying signaling pathway, liver glutathione (GSH) content and mRNA or protein levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc), glutamate-cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLm), Akt, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), and Nrf2 were further analyzed. In addition, validation of PLP putative target network was also performed in silico. Results: Four major compounds including paeoniflorin, albiflorin, oxypaeoniflorin, and benzoylpaeoniflorin were identified by LC-MS analysis in water extract of PLP. Moreover, PLP could remarkably downregulate serum levels of TBIL, DBIL, AST, ALT, ALP, gamma-GT, and TBA, and alleviate the histological damage of liver tissue caused by ANIT. It enhanced antioxidative system by activating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway through increasing Akt, Nrf2, HO-1, Nqo1, GCLc, and GCLm expression. The putative targets network validation also confirmed the important role of PLP in activating Akt expression. Conclusion: The potential mechanism of PLP in alleviating ANIT-induced cholestasis could to be related to the induction of GSH synthesis by activating Nrf2 through PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. This indicates that PLP might be a potential therapeutic agent for cholestasis.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Kushenin (KS) combined with nucleoside analogues (NAs) for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of KS combined with NAs for CHB were identified through 7 databases. Frequencies of loss of serum HBeAg, HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable serum HBV-DNA, ALT normalization, and adverse events at 48 weeks were abstracted by two reviewers. The Cochrane software was performed to assess the risk of bias in the included trials. Data were analyzed with Review Manager 5.3 software. Results. 18 RCTs involving 1684 subjects with CHB were included in the analysis. KS combined with NAs including lamivudine (LAM), entecavir (ETV), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), and telbivudine (TLV) showed different degree of improvement in CHB indices. KS combined with NAs increased the frequency of loss of serum HBeAg, HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable HBV-DNA levels, and ALT normalization compared with single agents. It also decreased serum ALT and AST level after one-year treatment. However, KS combined with TLV did not show a significant difference in CHB indices. The side-effects of KS combined with NAs were light and of low frequency. Conclusion. KS combined with NAs improves the efficacy of NAs in CHB.

Materials and Methods: Animals were orally administered STE at the doses of 125, 250, 500 mg/kg. The analgesic effect was estimated in mice by hot-plate test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. The anti-inflammatory effect was assessed using rat paw edema model elicited by fresh egg white and the mouse ear edema model caused by dimethylbenzene. The antipyretic effect was determined using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat fever model. In addition, the acute oral toxicity of STE was studied. Results: STE significantly and dose-dependently reduced the number of writhing responses in mice, prolonged reaction time of mice against heat stimulation, depressed egg white-induced paw edema in rats and the dimethylbenzene-caused ear edema in mice, but did not alleviate LPS-induced pyrexia in rats. No death of mice was observed when orally administered STE up to 52.8 g/kg (approximately 2080 times of clinical dose used). Conclusion: STE possesses evident analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, but has no antipyretic effect. Furthermore STE has a favorable safety. These findings support the applications of Speranskia tuberculata as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in folk medicine.

However, its anti-mucus-hypersecretion mechanism has yet not been fully interpreted. We aim to assess the effect and dose-response relationships of Tanreqing injection on lipopolysacchaide (LPS) induced airway mucus hypersecretion in rats. Material and methods: Forty-eight male rats were randomly divided into four groups (12 per group). A rat model of airway mucus hypersecretion was generated with LPS. Tanreqing injection was given by intratracheal instillation, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the right lung was collected. BALF total protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid disodium assay (BCA). Muc5ac was measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. The expression of muc5ac mRNA was detected by real-time polyermase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The middle lobe of the right lung was stained with alcian blue-periodic acid sthiff (AB-PAS) and positive staining relative shading area examined. Results: LPS caused airway mucus hypersecretion, The LPS-induced airway mucus hypersecretion increased beginning at 24 hr, and peaked at 96 hr. Tanreqing injection could inhibit airway mucus hypersecretion, and suppress the expression of muc5ac mRNA. Conclusion: Tanreqing injection inhibits airway mucus hypersecretion in a certain dose-dependent trend.

Methods: Five hundred and seventy-six SAP patients were randomly assigned to receive Xinxuekang (XXK) capsules or Compound Danshen (CDS) tablets for 8 weeks. Global similarity degree analysis and nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) were employed to reveal the cutoff points and influencing factors in dynamic changes in the SAP phenotypic group. The phenotypic group was defined as the six phenotypes in SAP, including angina, choking sensation in the chest, palpitations, dark purple lips, ecchymosis on the tongue, and fine-choppy pulse, which were quantitatively evaluated on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56. Results: Variation in the six individual phenotypes and distribution of the SAP phenotypic profile were similar between the two experimental groups, but cutoff points for changes in the SAP phenotypic group were 7.28 and 10.73 weeks in XXK and CDS groups, respectively. Degree of severity of SAP as well as study site significantly affected the tendency for change in the SAP Xueyu Zheng in both XXK and CDS treatment groups. Different Chinese patent drugs affected the tendency for change in phenotypic group in patients with SAP. XXK was superior to CDS in controlling a clinical phenotypic group. Conclusion: Based on global similarity degree analysis and NONMEM, the cutoff point and influencing factors in phenomic variation of SAP may be determined, to improve the development and modification of treatment regimens.

Since the combination therapy with Chinese Medicine (CM) and conventional western medicine (CWM) is considered an effective approach to many conditions, many CM experts have investigated the combination therapy with CM and RAS blockade to look for new approaches to DN. Aim: The purpose of this article is to review the antiproteinuric and renopretective effects of combination therapy of CM and ACEI/ARBs for the management of DN. Methods: Relevant articles were identified through PubMed and three major Chinese databases (CBM, CAJD, CSTJ) up to March 2013. Findings: The results of the current literature are consistent with CM theories (e.g., tonifying and replenishing CM with blood-activating and stasis-resolving CM as major therapeutic strategies for the management of DN). 91 clinical articles on the combination therapy of CM and ACEI/ARBs were identified, but only eight randomized controlled trials were eventually included in the present review. The results were not always consistent: three articles reported that CM conferred both anti-proteinuric and reno-protective effects in addition to ACEI/ARBs; three articles reported that CM failed to provide additional reno-protective benefits; two articles reported that CM conferred neither anti-proteinuric nor reno-protective effects in addition to ACEI/ARBs. Conclusion: Current literature indicates that combination therapy with CM and ACEI/ARBs might have polypharmacological anti-proteinuric and reno-protective effects for the management of DN. Shortcomings concerning the interaction between CM and CWM, methodology, and study design need to be addressed in future research.

Acupuncture, a popular therapeutic method in China, can improve memory, orientation, calculation, and self-managing ability in VaD patients. However, in clinical acupuncture and acupuncture research, the selection of acupoints to treat VaD remains challenging. This study aimed to discover acupoints and acupoint combinations with potential for VaD based on data mining. After database searching and screening for articles on clinical trials evaluating the effects of acupuncture on VaD, 238 acupuncture prescriptions were included for further analysis. Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shuigou (GV 26), and Shenting (GV 24) appeared most frequently in the modern literature and are potential acupoints for VaD. Combinations between Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shenting (GV 24), Shuigou (GV 26), and Zusanli (ST 36) were most frequent and represent potential combinations for VaD treatment. These results provide a reference for the selection and combination of acupoints to treat VaD in clinical acupuncture and acupuncture research.

Methods: A retrospective study was developed involving 210 patients with pneumothorax who had undergone CT-guided percutaneous core biopsies from January 2012 to March 2014 for various pulmonary lesions. Asymptomatic patients with minimal pneumothorax were treated conservatively. Simple manual aspiration was performed for symptomatic patients with minimal pneumothorax and for all patients with moderate to large pneumothorax. An opposite position aspiration was performed when simple manual aspiration failed. The efficacy of simple manual aspiration and the opposite position aspiration was observed. Results: Among 210 patients with pneumothorax, 128 (61.0%) asymptomatic patients with minimal pneumothorax were treated conservatively. The remaining 82 were treated with attempted simple manual aspiration. Out of these 82 patients, simple manual aspiration was successful in 58 (70.7%, 58/82) cases. The complete and partial regression rates were 17.2% (10/58) and 82.8% (48/58), respectively. In the other 24 patients (29.3%, 24/82), simple aspiration technique was ineffective. An opposite position (from prone to supine or vice versa) was applied, and a new biopsy puncture site was chosen for reaspiration. This procedure was successful in 22 patients but not in 2 patients who had to have a chest tube insertion. The complete and partial regression rates were 25.0% (6/24) and 66.7% (16/24), respectively. Applying the new method, the total effective rate of aspiration improved significantly from 70.7% (58/82) to 97.6% (80/82). Conclusion: The opposite position aspiration can be safe, effective and minimally invasive treatment for CT-guided lung biopsy-induced pneumothorax thus reducing the use of chest tube significantly. Advances in knowledge: (1) Opposite position aspiration can elevate the success rate of aspiration significantly (from 70.7% to 97.6% in our study); (2) this procedure is a safe, effective and minimally invasive treatment for pneumothorax caused by biopsy; and (3) opposite position aspiration is a useful technique to reduce the use of chest tube, which has clinical significance.

Methods. 27 psychogenic ED patients and 27 healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent an fMRI scan in resting state. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was used to detect the brain activity changes in ED patients with different patterns. Results. Compared to HS, ED patients showed an increased cerebral activity in bilateral cerebellum, insula, globus pallidus, parahippocampal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Compared to the patients with liver-qi stagnation and spleen deficiency pattern (LSSDP), the patients with kidney-yang deficiency pattern (KDP) showed an increased activity in bilateral brainstem, cerebellum, hippocampus, and the right insula, thalamus, MCC, and a decreased activity in bilateral putamen, medial frontal gyrus, temporal pole, and the right caudate nucleus, OFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex (P < 0.005). Conclusions. The ED patients with different TCM patterns showed different brain activities. The differences in cerebral activity between LSSDP and KDP were mainly in the emotion-related regions, including prefrontal cortex and cingulated cortex.

However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions is still not clear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarise the direct and indirect evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent migraine attack. Methods and analysis: We will perform an umbrella systematic review to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the recommended interventions for migraine prophylaxis according to the guidelines. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for systematic reviews, which will be screened for RCTs. We will describe the general information of the RCTs for participants, interventions, outcome measurements, comparisons and the primary findings. Additionally, a network meta-analysis will be conducted to determine the comparative effectiveness of the treatments with a random-effects model. The absolute and relative effectiveness of the treatments will be provided. The heterogeneity and inconsistency between trials will be assessed by the I-2 statistical test and Cochrane's Q test. Risk of bias will be assessed and the overall strength of the evidence will be summarised. Discussion: The result of this network meta-analysis will provide direct and indirect evidence of treatments for migraine prophylaxis, and it may provide a ranking of the treatments for patients and clinicians to help them select the best option.

Systematic reviews indicate that acupuncture may be effective for patients with FC. However, this conclusion is not convincing due to the quality, sample size and methodological heterogeneity of the studies included by these systematic reviews. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conduct a meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) from high-quality clinical trials to determine whether acupuncture is effective for patients with FC. Methods and analysis: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for adult patients with FC will be searched in several databases from inception to April 2015. The corresponding authors of eligible studies will be contacted and invited to contribute raw data. The primary outcome is the change in spontaneous defaecation per week from baseline. The secondary outcomes include the proportion of responders, changes in stool quality, mean transit time, proportion of patients using laxatives and adverse events. We will check all of the data and perform reanalysis according to the statistical methodology reported in previous publications. Then we will harmonise the raw data and use a two-step method to conduct the IPD meta-analysis. First, we will calculate the effect size of acupuncture of each trial by analysis of covariance, with the principal end point as the dependent variable and the baseline scores as the covariates. Second, the effect size of acupuncture in each original study will be combined in the meta-analysis. Dissemination: On the basis of the IPD meta-analysis of high-quality RCTs, this review will answer the question of whether acupuncture is effective for FC. The findings of the review will be disseminated through peer-review publications and conference presentations.

For acupuncturist, it is important to judge and control Deqi in clinical practice. However, enough attention is paid to patients' feelings rather than acupuncturists' nowadays. We thus conducted this survey to determine acupuncturists' perspectives about Deqi and to further find the proper way to induce Deqi. A total of 250 questionnaires were sent out to acupuncturists and 202 (80.8%) were returned. According to the results, most acupuncturists believe that Deqi is vital to obtain preferable clinical effects. The reliability of acupuncturists' Deqi sensation ranks as sinking>tightening>astringent. The reliability of patients' Deqi sensations ranks as sourness> numbness> distention> heaviness> pain. The reliability of influential factors ranks as manipulation> specificity of acupoint> TCM constitution> disease status> patient's psychological condition> acupuncturists' psychological guidance> clinical environment. This study is believed to provide additional evidence to the qualitative and quantitative research of Deqi in the future.

With liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) and organic extraction from plasma and follicular fluid, a fast and efficient method was established for detecting the metabolites of human plasma and follicular fluid. Certain metabolites were closely related with human physiological activities, such as hormone, amino acid, estrogen and fatty acid, and estrogen fatty acyllipid lipid were successfully detected in human plasma and follicular fluid. The metabolites in follicular fluid and plasma on the day of oocyte retrieval were found to be similar. But those in the latter and basal plasma were partially different. Methyl (3 alpha, 5 beta, 7 alpha, 12 alpha)-3,7,12-trihydroxycholan-24-oate, androst-4-ene-3,17-dione and tryptophan were identified and might be potential biomarkers on oocyte quality. It demonstrates that LC-TOF-MS combined with organic extraction could be an efficient tool to investigate the metabolites of human plasma and follicular fluid. Based on this study, it is expected to provide the basis for the further steps to explore possible influential factors on oocyte quality.

Therefore, pinpointing the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of OLP is important to develop efficient treatments for OLP. Recently, the accumulation of the large amount of omics data, especially transcriptome data, provides opportunities to investigate OLPs from a systematic perspective. In this paper, assuming that the OLP associated genes have functional relationships, we present a new approach to identify OLP related gene modules from gene regulatory networks. In particular, we find that the gene modules regulated by both transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of OLP and many genes in the modules have been reported to be related to OLP in the literature.

Dysmenorrhea is a common problem for which acupuncture provides effective analgesia. Although acupoint selection affects the effectiveness of acupuncture, the basic rules of acupoint selection are little understood. This study aims to investigate the principles of acupoint selection and characteristics of acupoints used for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Database were searched for clinical trials published in English or Chinese from January 1978 to April 2014 evaluating the effect of acupuncture on primary dysmenorrhea, with or without methods of randomization and/or control. Three authors extracted information and two reviewers inputted information on titles, journals, interventions, main acupoints, and outcomes using the self-established Data Excavation Platform of Acupoint Specificity for data mining. Results. Sanyinjiao (SP06), Guanyuan (CV04), and Qihai (CV06) were used most frequently. The most frequently used meridians were Conception Vessel, Spleen Meridian of Foot Taiyin, and Bladder Meridian of Foot Taiyang. 67.24% of acupoints used were specific acupoints. Acupoints on lower limbs were most frequently used. Conclusion. Data mining is a feasible approach to identify the characteristics of acupoint selection.

Although this is not beneficial overall, it could provide a compensatory source for the estrogen production for the menopausal women. So it would be meaningful to find an agent that could inhibit the fat production while does not disturb the total estrogen production by fat tissues. In the present study, the effect of oleanolic acid (OA) on the fat production and the total estrogen production of the differentiating mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 as well as the mechanisms behind those effects were preliminarily investigated. The cell line 3T3-L1 was chosen as the model cell because it is usually used for the research about the obesity. During the induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, cells were intervened continuously with OA. The fat production was determined with the oil red staining assay and the total estrogen production was measured with the ELISA assay. Finally, the expression patterns for important genes of the fat production and the estrogen production were studied, respectively with the real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results showed that for the differentiating 3T3-L1 cells, OA could significantly inhibit the fat production and did not disturb the total estrogen production significantly. In the mechanism studies, OA was found to significantly down-regulate ACC, the key gene for fat synthesis, which could explain the inhibitory effect of OA on the fat production; OA was also found to significantly up-regulate CYP11A1, CYP17, CYP19, the key genes for the estrogen synthesis and significantly down-regulate CYP1A1, the key gene for the estrogen decomposition, which preliminarily explained the lack of the effect of OA on the total estrogen production. In conclusion, OA was found able to inhibit the fat production while maintaining the total estrogen level and the mechanisms for the above findings were preliminarily clarified, which suggests that OA may be useful to treat the menopausal obesity.

The bulbus materials are commonly crushed into a powder form for their utilization, resulting in an inefficient discrimination of the materials, and leading to financial loss and even health hazards. In our present investigation, the electronic nose (E-nose) and electronic tongue (E-tongue) combined with chemometrics were applied to rapidly discriminate the bulbus of different Fritillaria species and to detect adulterations of Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus (FCB) in the form of powder. First, four species of BF were collected and artificial adulterations of FCB were prepared by mixing it with other BF, coicis semen and wheat flour. Then, E-nose and E-tongue were used to detect the powder samples and multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factor analysis (DFA), were performed. Our results demonstrated that E-nose and E-tongue can effectively discriminate the bulbus of the four Fritillaria species, and the FCB adulterations can also be discriminated. The accurate rate of 100% was achieved by DFA for recognizing the bulbus of the different Fritillaria species and FCB, and their adulteration. For the discrimination of the specific adulterants, all the unknown samples were correctly recognized by DFA according to E-nose; in addition, an accurate rate of 80.95% was acquired by DFA according to E-tongue, and a successful recognition with an accurate rate of 100% was obtained after data fusion. Therefore, the proposed analyzing method based on E-nose and E-tongue is rapid and simple, and it can successfully discriminate the different species of BF and FCB mixed with the adulterants.

However, the actions of the formulas remain to be proven at the cellular and molecular levels. In this study, we investigate whether the two formulas have any effect on germ cell formation and differentiation by culturing rat medicated serums containing YGW or ZGW with stem cells derived from human first trimester umbilical cord. Our results showed that while the normal rat serums had no significant effects, the rat medicated serums had significant effects on the differentiation of the stem cells into oocyte-like cells (OLCs) based on (1) cell morphological changes that resembled purative cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs); (2) expressions of specific markers that were indicative of germ cell formation and oocyte development; and (3) estradiol production by the COC-like cells. Furthermore, ZGW medicated serums exhibited more obvious effects on specific gene expressions of germ cells, whereas YGW medicated serums showed stronger effects on estradiol production. Accordingly, our study provides evidence demonstrating for the first time that one of molecular and cellular actions of YGW or ZGW in treating human reproductive dysfunctions may be through an enhancement of neooogenesis.

Chinese black ants (Polyrhachis dives), an edible insect, are well-known for kidney tonifying and anti-inflammatory properties. We have conducted a study that led to isolation of thirteen nonpeptide nitrogen containing compounds from P. dives. Most of these substances possess pyridine moieties and three are alkaloids isolated for the first time from natural sources. Based on ethnopharmacological considerations, the biological potentials of these substances were determined utilizing multiple assays including renal protection, T-, B-lymphocyte proliferation, TNF-alpha, COX-1, COX-2, and Jak3 kinase inhibition. The finding that several members of this family display activities in one or more of these assays has led to the elucidation of part of the chemical profile of P. dives in terms of non-peptide, small-molecule components.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the brain-based correlations of psychological factors and FD. Methods Based on Fluorine-18-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography, the altered cerebral glycometabolism was investigated in 40 FD patients compared with 20 healthy controls during resting state using statistical parametric mapping software. Results FD patients exhibited increased glucose metabolism in multiple regions relative to controls (P < 0.001, family-wise error corrected). After controlling for the dyspeptic symptoms, increased aberrations persisted within the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and middle frontal cortex (midFC), which was related to anxiety and depression score. Interestingly, FD patients without anxiety/depression symptoms also showed increased glycometabolism within the insula, ACC, MCC and midFC. Moreover, FD patients with anxiety/depression symptoms exhibited more significant hypermetabolism within the above 4 sites compared with patients without anxiety/depression symptoms. Conclusions Our results suggested that the altered cerebral glycometabolism may be in a vicious cycle of psychological vulnerabilities and increased gastrointestinal symptoms.

Previous pharmacological research has provided evidence that members of the Nitraria genus have numerous beneficial effects. In the present review, the pharmacological and phytochemical studies of Nitraria were presented and assessed. The review was written using information published between 1968 and 2013 from a number of reliable sources, including ScienceDirect, Springer, PubMed, EMBASE and CNKI. Numerous compounds, such as alkaloids and flavonoids have been isolated from the plants of this genus in the past, and multiple members of these constituents have been demonstrated to exert antitumor or anti-oxidative activities. The extracts of plants of the Nitraria genus possess antitumor, antiproliferative, anti-oxidative, antifatigue, anti-mutagenic, antimicrobial, hypotensive, hepatoprotective, lipid-lowering and hypoglycemic effects. However, the possible active components in the fraction and the molecular mechanisms require further investigation prior to their use in clinical practice.

The therapeutic effects may be influenced by a variety of factors. Stimulation quantity is one of the factors for achieving good therapeutic effects in acupuncture practice. With the development of science and technology, besides the influence of manual manipulations, the parameters adopted for electroacupuncture have become the benchmark of stimulation quantity. This study, by referring to the related literatures, is designed to explore the influence of manual manipulations and electrical parameters on therapeutic effects of acupuncture. The results from the present study show that different manual manipulations and electrical parameters may exert different therapeutic effects of acupuncture, which are closely related to the characteristics of diseases. Different manual manipulations and electrical parameters should be adopted according to syndrome differentiation of TCM. This is very important in acupuncture treatment. (C) 2014 JTCM.

Many neuroimaging studies were conducted to explore acupoint specificity in pain and other condition, but till now there is still discrepancy. Based on our previous finding, this study investigated the brain metabolism changes of acupuncture analgesia induced by sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint stimulation. Methods: 30 migraineurs were included and randomly assigned to 3 groups: Acupuncture Group (AG), Sham Acupuncture Group (SAG) and Migraine Group (MG). In AG, a combination sub-specific points of Shaoyang meridians, Luxi (TE19), San Yangluo (TE8), and Xi Yangguan(GB33) has been stimulated with electroacupuncture, while non-acupoints for SAG were used and MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to identify differences in brain glucose metabolism between groups. Results: In the AG, brain glucose metabolism increase compared with the MG was observed in the middle frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, the precuneus, parahippocampus, cerebellum and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and decrease were observed in the left hemisphere of Middle Temporal Cortex (MTC). In the SAG, compared with MG, glucose metabolism increased in the poster cingulate cortex (PCC), insula, inferior temporal gyrus, MTC, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, fusiform, inferior parietal lobe, superior parietal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, middle occipital lobe, angular and precuneus; while, decreased in cerebellum, parahippocampus. Conclusions: Acupuncture stimulation at both sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint yields ameliorating effect to migraine pain, but with evidently differed central mechanism as measured by PET-CT. The pattern of brain glucose metabolism change in acupoint is pertinent and targeted, while in non-acupoint that was disordered and randomized. These finding may provide new perspectives into the validation of acupoint specificity, optimizing acupuncture analgesia and revealing central mechanism of acupuncture analgesia by neuroimaging measurement.

In order to find the more active natural substances in Patchouli oil, one of the major components, Pogostone, was isolated and its antibacterial activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in this study. Methods In vitro test, Pogostone was screened for antimicrobial properties against 83 bacteria comprising 35 gram positive and 48 gram negative bacteria strains via the agar double dilution method. In vivo test, specific pathogen free (SPF) strain of both male and female white Kunming mice, weighing 18-22 g, were used to test the protective ability of Pogostone after being injected with the median lethal doses (MLDs) of the tested strains. Results In vitro test, Pogostone could inhibit both gram negative bacteria (0.098-1 600 mu g/ml) and gram positive bacteria(0.098-800 mu g/ml). For Corynebacterium xerosis and some Chryseobacterium indologenes, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Pogostone were extremely low (<0.098 mu g/ml). It was significant that Pogostone was also active against some drug-resistant bacteria like MRSA. Furthermore, Pogostone showed antibacterial activity in vivo against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and MRSA via intraperitoneal injection. Ninety percent of the mice infected with E. coli could be protected at the concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg, and 60% of the mice at 25 mg/kg, while the rate of protection for the mice infected with MRSA was 60% and 50% at doses of 100 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. Conclusion Pogostone could be developed as a potential antibacterial agent for clinical therapy.

The elevation of HIF-1 alpha and mTOR is relevant to CCl4 induced liver fibrotic rats. Paeoniflorin has been consistently shown to exhibit multiple pharmacological effects in liver disease. However, so far, no research demonstrates the relationship between paeoniflorin and HIF-1 alpha/mTOR fibrogenesis pathway in liver fibrosis. In this study, the liver fibrosis was performed by CCl4 rats and HSC-T6 cell line. The data demonstrated that paeoniflorin treatment could attenuate liver fibrosis and inhibit the activation of HSC. Moreover, paeoniflorin significantly enhanced hepatic function by decreasing serum level of ALT, AST and ALP, and increasing level of ALB, TP. Meanwhile, ECM degradation was modulated by paeoniflorin treated rats with a remarkable reduce of alpha-SMA and collagen III mRNA expression. Moreover, the alleviation effect of liver fibrosis was relevant to inhibiting HIF-1 alpha and phosphor-mTOR Our data indicate that paeoniflorin alleviates liver fibrosis by inhibiting HIF-1 alpha expression partly through mTOR pathway and paeoniflorin may be a potential therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis.

The analyte was separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C-18 column with a total running time of 3min using a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution and methanol (80:20, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.25mL/min. The calibration curves for fuziline showed good linearity in the concentrations ranging from 1 to 200ng/mL with correlation coefficients >0.997. The precision, accuracy, recovery and stability were deemed acceptable. The method was applied to a pharmacokinetics study of fuziline in rats. The mean half-life was 5.93, 6.13 and 5.12h for 1, 2 and 4mg/kg oral administration of fuziline, respectively. The peak concentration and area under the concentration-time curve increased linearly with the doses. The sum of these results indicated that, in the range of the doses examined, the pharmacokinetics of fuziline in rat was based on first-order kinetics. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The fingerprints of Fuzi from various sources were determined by UPLC and hierarchical clustering analysis. Some quantitative thermo-kinetic parameters such as the heat-flow maximum power (P (max)) and its time corresponding to t (max), which obtained from the thermogenic curves of mitochondria metabolic activity affected by Fuzi were analyzed using principal component analysis. The fingerprint-efficacy relationship of chemical fingerprint and promoting effect of Fuzi were established using canonical correlation analysis. Our results showed that the sources and places of production of Fuzi had some significant influence on the chemical fingerprints and promoting metabolic effects of this CHM. Fingerprint-efficacy study provided a powerful way and some references for the quality control of Fuzi and other CHMs.	[Zhu, Yun] Chinese PLA, Sch Med, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yun] 302 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Dept Integrat Med Ctr, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Quanfu; Chen, Zhe] Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Coll Pharm, Chengdu 610075, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Quanfu; Chen, Zhe; Zhao, Yanling; Wang, Zhongxia; Yang, Huiyin; Li, Jianyu; Li, Yonggang; Xiao, Xiaohe] China Mil Inst Chinese Med, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Sun, Zhiyong] Fourth Hosp Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang 050011, Peoples R China	Zhao, YL (reprint author), China Mil Inst Chinese Med, 100 4th Ring Rd, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China.	zhaoyl2855@126.com; xiaoxiaohe302@126.com			National Natural Sciences Foundation [81173571, 81303120]; Major Projects of the National Science and Technology [2012ZX10005010-002-002]	We are grateful for the support of the National Natural Sciences Foundation (No. 81173571; 81303120) and the Major Projects of the National Science and Technology (2012ZX10005010-002-002).		35	2	2	6	26	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	1388-6150	1572-8943		J THERM ANAL CALORIM	J.

This is a 24-week, randomized, multicenter, single-blind study comparing TCM with WM (as used in China) carried out between June 2002 and December 2004 in nine research centers in China, involving 489 patients. Patients were randomized to receive TCM (n = 247), MTX and SSZ (n = 242). MTX was started at a dose of 5 mg to a final dose of 7.5-15 mg weekly. The maintenance dose was 2.5-7.5 mg weekly. The starting dose of SSZ was 0.25 g bid, increasing by 0.25 g a day once a week to a final dose of 0.5-1 g qid. The maintenance dose was 0.5 g tid to qid. Primary end point was the proportion of patients with response according to the American College of Rheumatology 20 % improvement criteria (ACR20) at weeks 24. At 24 weeks, ACR20 responses were 53.0 % in TCM group and 66.5 % in WM group, (P < 0.001) at 24 weeks. ACR 50 responses were 31.6 % of TCM group and 42.6 % in WM group, (P = 0.01). ACR70 responses were 12.6 % in TCM group and 17.4 % in WM group, (P = 0.14). Side effects were observed more frequently in WM group. In this study, ACR20, ACR50 responses at 24 weeks were significantly better in the WM treated group, by intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol analysis. The ACR 70 response showed no significant difference between the two groups. TCM, while effective in treating RA, appears to be less effective than WM in controlling symptoms, but TCM is associated with fewer side effects.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) first formed from MESC-R1/E and EBs were allowed to attach to the bottoms of normal cell-culturing plate and grow. Then, different compounds including RA, OA and so on were respectively added to induce MESC-R1/E to differentiate. After 72h, microscopy images were taken for all interventions, then total RNAs were extracted, cDNAs were synthesized and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to detect the transcriptional expression patterns of 11 reproductive-differentiation-related genes for different compounds respectively. During the data analysis, it was found RA significantly up-regulated the expression levels of GDF-9, Stra8, SCP3, Mvh, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, while significantly down-regulated the levels of Itag6 and Itgb1, and the level of Oct-4 was down-regulated insignificantly, while the level of TP2 was up-regulated insignificantly; OA significantly up-regulated the expression levels of Stra8, SCP3, Mvh, ZP1, ZP2, Itgb1, and TP2, and the levels of Oct-4, GDF-9, ZP3, and Itga6 were up-regulated insignificantly. The data showed that RA can induce MESC-R1/E to differentiate toward female germ cells while OA can induce MESC-R1/E to differentiate toward male and female germ cells.

Here we accomplish a controlled diastereodivergence in the asymmetric synthesis of fully functionalized tetrahydropyrans by adjusting the sequence of an organocatalytic cascade reaction. We also show that this one-pot operation provides two synthetically important architectures with excellent stereocontrol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published kinetic resolution of MBH alcohols in an organocascade.

Di'ao Xinxuekang (XXK) capsule and Compound Danshen (CDS) tablet have been approved for treating angina pectoris for more than 20 years in China. We compare the anti-anginal effectiveness of XXK capsule and CDS tablet in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina. A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, superiority trial was conducted in 4 study sites. 733 patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina were included in the full analysis set. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients who were angina-free and the proportion of patients with normal electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings during 20 weeks treatment. Compared with CDS, XXK significantly increased the proportion of angina-free patients, but no significant difference was noted in the proportion of patients with normal ECG recordings. Weekly angina frequency and nitroglycerin use were significantly reduced with XXK versus CDS at week 20. Moreover, XXK also improved the quality of life of angina patients as measured by the SAQ score and Xueyu Zheng (a type of TCM syndrome) score. We demonstrate that XXK capsule is more effective for attenuating anginal symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina, compared with CDS tablet.

Although oral antiviral therapy for patients with CHB reduces the risk of such complications, once cirrhosis is established, the benefits of antiviral therapy are not robustly demonstrated. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), some Chinese herbal medicines promote blood circulation and soften hard masses, and therefore they may block and reverse hepatic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of TCM tablets of the compound biejia ruangan (RGT) administered for fibrosis, and entecavir (ETV), on the development of HCC in patients with CHB or hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related compensated cirrhosis. Methods/design: This multicenter, centrally randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study is planned to complete within 5 years. For the study, 1,000 with CHB or HBV-related compensated cirrhosis are randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to a treatment group (0.5 mg ETV once daily; 2 g RGT three times daily) or a control group (0.5 mg ETV once daily; 2 g RGT dummy agent three times daily). The primary end points are the development of HCC and liver-related death. Secondary end points include disease progression and overall survival. Discussion: Although antiviral therapy can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication, thereby preventing cirrhosis, patients with CHB treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) retain a higher risk for HCC compared with patients with inactive disease. Although previous clinical trials with RGT have confirmed the efficacy of blocking and reversing hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHB or compensated cirrhosis, the long-term risk for HCC or disease progression in these patients treated with combination of RGT and NUCs compared with NUCs alone is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of the RGT blockade and reversal of hepatic fibrosis on the development of HCC in patients with CHB or HBV-related compensated cirrhosis in large, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in China.

Liquid-liquid extraction was used to separate pogostone from canine plasma, and the mean extraction recovery rates of pogostone and the internal standard (isoalantolactone) were 80.61 and 75.89%, respectively. Plastic centrifuge tubes were inadequate for the plasma sample treatment procedure because of the adsorption effect of pogostone on the inner surface. The chromatographic separation was performed on a capillary column of Agilent HP-5ms, and the spectrometer was operated in an electron-impact ionization with an electron multiplier voltage mode. The standard curve was linear over the concentration range of 1.02-406 ng/mL (r > 0.99). The intra-and interday accuracies for pogostone at four concentrations were 97.77-99.92% and 98.51-100.22%, respectively. The relative standard deviations were <15%. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study after the oral administration of pogostone to beagle dogs.

Targeting the aberrant beta-catenin signaling in CSCs has become a promising strategy to improve chemosensitivity in cancer treatment. In a pilot screening study, we found that the natural compound isoliquiritigenin (ISL) blocked B-catenin transcription activity with the highest inhibition ratio. Here, we investigated the chemosensitizing effects of ISL on breast CSCs and the underlying mechanisms regulating the beta-catenin pathway. ISL could have synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic drugs to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition, ISL could significantly limit the side population and CSC ratios in breast cancer cells, accompanied by inhibited self-renewal and multidifferentiation abilities. A mechanistic study revealed that ISL could inhibit beta-catenin/ABCG2 signaling by activating the proteasome degradation pathway. The drug affinity responsive target stability strategy further identified GRP78 as the direct target of ISL. Subsequent molecular docking analysis and functional studies demonstrated that ISL could dock into the ATP domain of GRP78 and thereby inhibit its ATPase activity, resulting in its dissociation from beta-catenin. An in vivo study also suggested that ISL could chemosensitize breast CSCs via the GRP78/beta-catenin/ABCG2 pathway, with little toxicity in normal tissues and mammary stem cells. Taken together, the data from this study not only suggest ISL as a natural candidate to enhance breast CSC chemosensitivity but also highlight the significance of GRP78 in mediating cancer drug resistance and beta-catenin signaling in CSCs.

An increasing expression of HIF-1 alpha and ERK accompanies CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Curcumin is verified to have antifibrotic effects in several kinds of liver fibrosis models. There is no specific evidence illustrating a connection between curcumin and the HIF-1 alpha/ERK pathway in rat liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. In this study, liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 in treated rats. The data demonstrated that curcumin was able to attenuate liver fibrosis and inhibit the proliferation of HSC. Moreover, curcumin could remarkably elevate the hepatic function by decreasing serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP, and increasing levels of ALB, TP and alpha-SMA, Col III mRNA expression. Meanwhile, ECM status could also be reflected by curcumin treatment. The alleviation with curcumin treatment was associated with inhibition of HIF-1 alpha and phosphor-ERK. This study indicates that curcumin alleviates fibrosis by reducing the expression of HIF-1 alpha partly through the ERK pathway.

A randomized, double-blind, multi-center parallel trial was conducted involving 360 patients in hospitals in Beijing (108 cases), Heilongjiang (90 cases), Sichuan (90 cases), Shanghai (72 cases), China. They were randomly assigned with central randomization method to group A (LBS placebo plus doxazosin), group B (LBS plus doxazosin) or group C (LBS plus doxazosin placebo), 120 cases for each group. The international prostate symptom score, maximum urinary flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume and prostate volume were measured for evaluating the efficacy of the three treatments. At baseline, there was no significant difference in the measured variables among the three groups. After 12-month treatment, the three groups showed significant improvements in IPSS and maximum urinary flow rate from baseline (P < 0.01). Although postvoid residual urine volume was not significantly different from the baseline in group A (P > 0.05), it significantly decreased in group B and C (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events were similar among the three groups. The treatment of LBS alone or LBS plus doxazosin was able to significantly improve IPSS in patients with BPH. The treatments may reduce the increase in prostate volume and postvoid residual urine volume as well.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry was applied to investigate the characteristic components of a mice model of Kidney (Shen)-yang deficiency syndrome (KDS), and the remedial effect of a typical CM formula Shenqi Pill (e,3/4ae degrees"a). Thirty-six females and 18 males of Balb/c mice were randomly divided into KDS, Shenqi or control group. The females and males of the same group freely were mated for 96 h, and the males were taken out and only the female mice were raised. Females of the KDS group were threatened by a ferocious cat every other day for 14 d. After delivery, the KDS, or gestational threatened, offspring were raised at standard condition for 11 weeks. Then 10 male offspring were randomly selected, anaesthetized and their representative organs, i.e. testes, kidneys, lungs and feet were collected, for the FT-IR scan. Mice of the Shenqi group were intragastric administered Shenqi Pill; while mice in the KDS and control groups were given the same volume of saline. The attenuated birth outcomes of the KDS group were displayed. The remarkable FT-IR differences of all organs between KDS mice and healthy control were mainly at 1,735-1,745 cm(-1) (indicating the increased levels of lipids) and at 1,640-1,647 cm(-1) and 1,539-1,544 cm(-1) (displaying the decreased proteins). No statistic FT-IR difference between Shenqi and control mice was observed. In accordance with major traits of KDS, prenatal stress extensively impaired the building up of proteins and resulting in the excessive lipid storage, and FT-IR could effectively identify the biomarkers of KDS.

In the current study, we synthesized copolymers of p-dioxanone and L-phenylalanine (PDPA) and evaluated the mechanism of its particular inhibition effect on L929 fibroblast proliferation when used as a culture surface. PDPA electrospun membranes could induce apoptosis of L929 fibroblasts. We hypothesized there were two reasons for the apoptosis induction: one was the ability to facilitate cell adhesion of materials, and the other was production of the degradation product, L-phenylalanine. Ninhydrin colorimetric results revealed that L-phenylalanine was continuously released during the culture process and could induce apoptosis in L929 cells. Relatively poor cell adhesion and constant release of L-phenylalanine made PDPA-1 to be the most efficient polymer for the induction of apoptosis. Analysis of apoptosis-related genes revealed that PDPA-induced apoptosis might be performed in a mitochondrial-dependent pathway. But poly(p-dioxanone)-induced apoptosis might occur in a c-Myc independent pathway that was different from PDPA. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although often recommended, the potential efficacy of massage therapy in general, and Chinese massage (tuina) in particular, for relief of chronic low back pain (CLBP) has not been fully established due to inadequate sample sizes, low methodological quality, and subclinical dosing regimens of trials to date. Thus, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of tuina massage therapy versus conventional analgesics for CLBP. Methods/Design: The present study is a single center, two-arm, open-label RCT. A total of 150 eligible CLBP patients will be randomly assigned to either a tuina treatment group or a conventional drug control group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the tuina group receive a 20 minutes, 4-step treatment protocol which includes both structural and relaxation massage, administered in 20 sessions over a period of 4 weeks. Patients in the conventional drug control group are instructed to take a specific daily dose of ibuprofen. The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline back pain and function, measured by Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, at two months. Secondary outcome measures include the visual analogue scale, Japanese orthopedic association score (JOAS), and McGill pain questionnaire. Discussion: The design and methodological rigor of this trial will allow for collection of valuable data to evaluate the efficacy of a specific tuina protocol for treating CLBP. This trial will therefore contribute to providing a solid foundation for clinical treatment of CLBP, as well as future research in massage therapy.

Although substantial achievements have been made under the new scheme, only a limited number of herbal medicinal products from non-European traditions commonly used in Europe have been registered. Therefore, identification of the obstacles, and determination of appropriate means to overcome the major challenges in the registration of non-European traditional herbal medicinal products are of critical importance for the EU herbal medicinal product market. Aims of the study: The primary aims of this study were to understand the key issues and obstacles to registration of non-European traditional herbal medicinal products within the EU. The findings may identify the need for more attention on the Community herbal monographs elaborated by the Herbal Medicinal Products Committee (HMPC), as well as further evidence based scientific research on non-European herbal substances/preparations by the scientific community. Methods: A systematic evaluation of the herbal substances and preparations included in Community herbal monographs and public statements has been carried out. The focus was herbal substances and preparations derived from non-European traditions. Results: Of the 109 adopted Community herbal monographs, 10 are herbal substances used in Chinese traditional medicine. Where the HMPC issued a public statement because it was unable to elaborate a monograph more than half-involved herbal substances/preparations from non-European traditions. The main reasons herbal substances/preparations from non-European traditions were not accepted for inclusion in the Community herbal monographs have been identified as due to unfulfilled requirements of Directive 2004/24/EC. The most common reasons were the lack of evidence to demonstrate a 15-year minimum medicinal use period in the EU and evidence of absence of health risk as required by Article 16a (1) (d), and Article 16a (1) (e). Conclusions: Under the current EU legislation, the requirement to demonstrate 15-year minimum medicinal use in the EU is a major obstacle to the registration of non-European traditional herbal medicinal products. Acces to scientific data to support the product safety profile may be a possible solution to overcome the hurdle presented by the 15-year minimum medicinal use period. Furthermore, the Community herbal monographs play an important role in the registration process.

There is debate as to whether or not De Qi is a key factor in achieving the efficacy of acupuncture. However, there is no sufficient evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials to confirm the role of De Qi in the treatment of acupuncture for tinnitus. This study aims to identify the effect of De Qi for patients who receive acupuncture to alleviate tinnitus by a prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial. Methods and design: This study compares two acupuncture groups (with or without manipulation) in 292 patients with a history of subjective tinnitus. The trial will be conducted in the Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the study, the patients will be randomly assigned into two groups according to a computer-generated randomization list and assessed prior to treatment. Then, they will receive 5 daily sessions of 30 minutes each time for 4 consecutive weeks and undergo a 12-week follow-up phase. The administration of acupuncture follows the guidelines for clinical research on acupuncture (WHO Regional Publication, Western Pacific Series Number 15, 1995), and is performed double-blind by physicians well-trained in acupuncture. The measures of outcome include the subjective symptoms scores and quantitative sensations of De Qi evaluated by Visual Analog Scales (VAS) and the Chinese version of the 'modified' Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (C-MMASS). Furthermore, adverse events are recorded and analyzed. If any subjects are withdrawn from the trial, intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis will be performed. Discussion: The key features of this trial include the randomization procedures, large sample and the standardized protocol to evaluate De Qi qualitatively and quantitatively in the treatment of acupuncture for tinnitus. The trial will be the first study with a high evidence level in China to assess the efficacy of De Qi in the treatment of tinnitus in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled manner.

The RGD-modified hybrid nanoparticles (RGD-lpNPs) could overcome the poor water solubility of Cur to meet the requirement of intravenous administration and tumor active targeting. The obtained optimal RGD-lpNPs, composed of PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))-mPEG (methoxyl poly(ethylene- glycol)), RGD-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-cholesterol (Chol) copolymers and lipids, had good entrapment efficiency, submicron size and negatively neutral surface charge. The core-shell structure of RGD-lpNPs was verified by TEM. Cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that the RGD-lpNPs encapsulated Cur retained potent anti-tumor effects. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the cellular uptake of Cur encapsulated in the RGD-lpNPs was increased for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Furthermore, Cur loaded RGD-lpNPs were more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor model. The results of immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical studies by Cur loaded RGD-lpNPs therapies indicated that more apoptotic cells, fewer microvessels, and fewer proliferation-positive cells were observed. In conclusion, RGD-lpNPs encapsulating Cur were developed with enhanced anti-tumor activity in melanoma, and Cur loaded RGD-lpNPs represent an excellent tumor targeted formulation of Cur which might be an attractive candidate for cancer therapy.

Methods: Seeds of nux-vomica were parched in sands by an herbal medicine roaster with an onlinetype and non-contact temperature measurement system (ONTMS). Processing was monitored by ONTMS and the processing temperature was accurately controlled within the range 200 - 220 degrees C. Ultra performance liquid chromatography - linear trap quadrupole -orbitrap-mass spectrometry method in positive ionization mode was established in this work. The samples were extracted by ultrasonication with 50 % methanol for 30 min. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column using a gradient program with acetonitrile and 1 % formic acid as the mobile phase and a diode array detector set at 254 nm for quantification. Results: The surface color of the processed seeds of nux-vomica were brown or dark brown and the cross-section bulged with small bubble which meets the requirements of Chinese traditional processing methods. Fourteen major compounds from crude and processed nux-vomica were identified simultaneously by HPLC-DAD. According to the MS fragmentation pathways and by comparing with reference literature, the structures of eleven of the compounds were confirmed. Conclusion: Methods using ONTMS are more accurate for parching nux-vomica in sands and UPLC-LTQ- Orbitrap-MS is a rapid and straightforward method for compound profiling in crude and processed nux-vomica.

Male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation (SO), I/R, electro-acupuncture at the PC6 Neiguan acupoint pretreatment (EA) and electro-acupuncture at non-acupoint pretreatment (NA). Compared with the I/R group, the survival rate of the EA group was significantly increased, the arrhythmia score, infarction area, serum concentrations of CK, LDH and CK-Mb and plasma level of cTnT were significantly decreased. RNA-seq results showed that 725 genes were up-regulated and 861 genes were down-regulated under I/R conditions compared to the SO group; both EA and NA reversed some of these gene expression levels (592 in EA and 238 in NA group). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that these genes were involved in multiple pathways, including ECM, MAPK signaling, apoptosis, cytokine and leukocyte pathways. In addition, some pathways were uniquely regulated by EA, but not NA pretreatment, such as oxidative stress, cardiac muscle contraction, gap junction, vascular smooth muscle contraction, hypertrophic, NOD-like receptor, and P53 and B-cell receptor pathways. This study was first to reveal the gene expression signatures of acute myocardial I/R injury and electro-acupuncture pretreatment in rats.

This study investigated a new needle-free approach for insulin delivery. A portable powder needleless injection (PNI) device with an automatic mechanical unit was designed. Its efficiency in delivering insulin was evaluated in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. The skin irritation caused by the device was investigated and the results were analyzed in relation to aerodynamic parameters. Inorganic salt-carried insulin powders had hypoglycemic effects, while raw insulin powders were not effective when delivered by PNI, indicating that salt carriers play an important role in the delivery of insulin via PNI. The relative delivery efficiency of phosphate-carried insulin powder using the PNI device was 72.25%. A safety assessment test showed that three key factors (gas pressure, cylinder volume, and nozzle distance) were related to the amount of skin irritation caused by the PNI device. Optimized injection conditions caused minimal skin lesions and are safe to use in practice. The results suggest that PNI has promising prospects as a novel technology for delivering insulin and other biological drugs.

Although several analytical methods have been reported for the detection of alkaloids, so far no attempt has been made to analyze the interspecific relationships between molecular phylogeny and main alkaloids in Coptis. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Coptis from China are resolved with high support. Coptis chinensis, Coptis deltoidea and Coptis omeiensis cluster together, and this clade ('clade III') is sister to Coptis teeta. Here, we provide evidences that the relationships inferred by chemical taxonomy are different to those of the present molecular phylogeny. Within clade III, C. deltoidea, C. omeiensis and C. chinensis are sister to C teeta, while C. teeta shares more similar metabolic compounds with C. deltoidea, and C omeiensis than with C. chinensis. Most likely, the metabolic components are mainly affected by environmental factors resulting in convergent evolution of alkaloid contents that do not reflect phylagenetic relationships.

A number of GSK3 targets in diverse signaling pathways have been uncovered, such as tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 and beta-catenin. The O subfamily of forkhead/winged helix transcription factors (FOXO) is known as tumor suppressors that induce apoptosis. In this study, we find that FOXO binds to type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) promoter and stimulates its transcription. GSK3 positively regulates the trans-activation activity of FOXO and stimulates IGF-IR expression. Although kinase-dead GSK3 beta cannot up-regulate IGF-IR, the constitutively active GSK3 beta induces IGF-IR expression in a FOXO-dependent manner. Serum starvation or Akt inhibition leads to an increase in IGF-IR expression, which could be blunted by GSK3 inhibition. GSK3 beta knockdown or GSK3 inhibitor suppresses IGF-I-induced IGF-IR, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, knockdown of GSK3 beta or FOXO1/3/4 leads to a decrease in cellular proliferation and abrogates IGFI-induced hepatoma cell proliferation. These results suggest that GSK3 and FOXO may positively regulate IGF-I signaling and hepatoma cell proliferation.

Detailed characterization and comparison of the complete set of metabolites of these two species are critical for their objective identification and quality control. In this study, a rapid, simple and comprehensive H-1 NMR-based metabolomics method was first developed to differentiate the two species. A broad range of metabolites, including iridoid glycosides, xanthones, triterpenoids, flavonoids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, were identified. Statistical analysis showed evident differences between the two species, and the major markers responsible for the differences were screened. In addition, quantitative H-1 NMR method (qHNMR) was used for the target analysis of the discriminating metabolites. The results showed that S. mussotii had significantly higher contents of gentiopicrin, isoorientin, glucose, loganic acid, and choline, whereas S. chirayita exhibited higher levels of swertiamarin, oleanolic acid, valine, and fatty acids. These findings indicate that H-1 NMR-based metabolomics is a reliable and effective method for the metabolic profiling and discrimination of the two Swertia species, and can be used to verify the genuine origin of Zangyinchen.

G(1) (AFG(1)), G(2) (AFG(2)) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in ginger and related products collected from local markets in Beijing, China. The optimized analytical procedure was based on immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence (UHPLC-FLR) detection. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for the five mycotoxins were 0.005-0.2 and 0.0125-0.5 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The average recoveries ranged from 84.2 to 97.3% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) from 0.63 to 7.86% at three spiking levels. Good linearity was observed for the analytes with correlation coefficients all higher than 0.9995. The established method was applied to 30 samples of 10 different species of ginger and related products, and all positive samples were confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that 5 samples of ginger products were contaminated with AFB(1) at 0.13 -1.38 mu g kg(-1), while 3 samples of ginger and 2 samples of ginger products were contaminated with OTA at 0.31-5.17 mu g kg(-1). All the contamination levels were below the legally allowable limits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, pesticide residues were generally very low, similar to trace analysis and as low as millionth or less, the content determination of pesticide residues was a troublesome problem. With the application and promotion of tandem mass spectrometry, it was able to do trace analysis. GC-El/MS/MS was a common method for the determination of pesticide residues. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was the most common quantitative method used in GC-El/MS/MS. It has the characteristics of high sensitivity, good reproducibility, high accuracy, strong anti-interference and high ion flux. Multiple-twin precursor ions, product ions and collision energy of thirty-four pesticides were provided for MRM. It could play an important role in developing MRM method for the quantifying of 34 kinds of pesticide. Meanwhile, the development of MRM method for the quantifying of other compounds could also refer to this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pharmacologically targeting autophagy-related miRNAs is a novel strategy to reverse drug resistance. Here, we report a novel function of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) as a natural inhibitor of autophagy-related miR-25 in killing drug-resistant breast cancer cells. ISL induced chemosensitization, cell cycle arrest and autophagy, but not apoptosis, in MCF-7/ADR cells. ISL also promoted the degradation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCG2 primarily via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. More importantly, miRNA 3.0 array experiments identified miR-25 as the main target of ISL in triggering autophagy flux. A mechanistic study validated that miR-25 inhibition led to autophagic cell death by directly increasing ULK1 expression, an early regulator in the autophagy induction phase. miR-25 overexpression was demonstrated to block ISL-induced autophagy and chemosensitization. Subsequent in vivo experiments showed that ISL had chemosensitizing potency, as revealed by an increase in LC3-II staining, the downregulation of ABCG2, a reduction in miR-25 expression and the activation of the miR-25 target ULK1. Overall, our results not only indicate that ISL acts as a natural autophagy inducer to increase breast cancer chemosensitivity, but also reveal that miR-25 functions as a novel regulator of autophagy by targeting ULK1.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed by using a structured questionnaire. A total of 1343 women aged 35 years or younger in six urban areas of Chengdu were included in the study. According to the Screening Criteria of sub-health conditions, these women were categorized into three groups: postpartum healthy group, sub-healthy group, and reproductive disease group. Data were double-entered using EpiData and then analyzed by SPSS. RESULTS: Pregnancy and labor were correlated with postpartum sub-health conditions. The number of pregnancies was negatively correlated with women's postnatal health but was positively correlated with the incidence of postpartum reproductive diseases. CONCLUSION: The number of pregnancies and labors is probably an important factor leading to sub-health conditions and the occurrence of reproductive diseases in women. Avoiding or reducing unwanted pregnancies and labors, enhancing the awareness of health among childbearing-age women are effective measures for preventing sub-health conditions. (C) 2014 JTCM.

The genetic variability and population structure of eight populations (Mudong (MD), Hejiang (HJ), Wanzhou (WZ), Xishui (XS), Nantan (NT), Cangxi (CX), Tongjiang (Ti) and Wulong (WL)) were investigated based on mitochondrial DNA control region. According to the river dimensions, MD, HJ, WZ, WL and CX were defined as large river populations, while TJ, XS and NT were defined as small. The total genetic diversity level of rock carp was moderate (h = 0.858, pi = 0.0079). Genetic differentiations among populations in small rivers were greater than those among populations in large rivers, and small rivers showed significant differentiation from large rivers. Analysis from the coalescent-based method showed that there were asymmetric gene flows among four large river populations (CX, HJ, MD and WZ). Demographic analyses suggested that the species as a whole and the WZ population experienced population expansion, while the Hi, NT, and MD populations experienced bottlenecks. The analysis of genetic diversity and population structure suggested that the WL, TJ, CX, NT and XS populations should be protected and managed separately, and that the HJ, MD and WZ populations should be considered as a genetic management unit.

More than 130 types of herbal injections are used clinically for 400 million patients annually with total sales of over four billion US dollars per year. However, the current quality control (QC) methods relying mainly on chemical fingerprints (CF) can hardly ensure quality and safety of the herbal injections with complex chemical composition and have resulted in an increase in serious adverse drug reactions. In this study, a comprehensive approach for the QC of a controversial herbal injection Shuang-Huang-Lian lyophilized powder (SHL) was established based on the quality fluctuation detection by a combination of CF and biological fingerprint (BF). High-performance liquid chromatography and the impedance-based xCELLigence system were applied to establish the CF and BF, respectively. In addition, multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the discriminant ability of the two methods. The results showed that being subjected to environmental influence like oxygen/air, high temperature, and extreme illumination could lead to quality fluctuation of SHL. The combination of chemical and biological fingerprint method is a more powerful tool for the QC of SHL because it can clearly discriminate different groups of abnormal samples. This method can be used for the detection of quality fluctuation of SHL and can provide reference for the quality control of other herbal injections.

Altered structural covariance of the striatum in functional dyspepsia patients	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						functional dyspepsia; MRI; striatum; structural covariance	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; BRAIN-GUT AXIS; BASAL GANGLIA; GASTRIC DISTENSION; ABDOMINAL-PAIN; WORKING-MEMORY; RECTAL PAIN; DISORDERS	Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is thought to be involved in dysregulation within the brain-gut axis. Recently, altered striatum activation has been reported in patients with FD. However, the gray matter (GM) volumes in the striatum and structural covariance patterns of this area are rarely explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the GM volumes and structural covariance patterns of the striatum between FD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Methods T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained from 44 FD patients and 39 HCs. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was adopted to examine the GM volumes in the two groups. The caudate- or putamen-related regions identified from VBM analysis were then used as seeds to map the whole brain voxel-wise structural covariance patterns. Finally, a correlation analysis was used to investigate the effects of FD symptoms on the striatum. Key Results The results showed increased GM volumes in the bilateral putamen and right caudate. Compared with the structural covariance patterns of the HCs, the FD-related differences were mainly located in the amygdala, hippocampus/para-hippocampus (HIPP/paraHIPP), thalamus, lingual gyrus, and cerebellum. And significant positive correlations were found between the volumes in the striatum and the FD duration in the patients. Conclusions & Inferences These findings provided preliminary evidence for GM changes in the striatum and different structural covariance patterns in patients with FD. The current results might expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of FD.

A double-blind comparative study of Chinese herbal medicine Jinlianqingre Effervescent Tablets in combination with conventional therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated hand, foot, and mouth disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							ENTEROVIRUS 71; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SINGAPORE; CHILDREN; FEVER	Chinese herbal medicine Jinlianqingre Effervescent Tablets (JET) are the recommended control measure for uncomplicated hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) by the Ministry of Health of China. However, high-quality evidence to support this recommendation is limited. A total of 288 patients ranging in age from 1 to 13 years were randomly assigned to JET in combination with conventional therapy (mainly including the reduction of temperature by applying physical cooling paste or warm bathing), or conventional therapy with placebo group for 7 days. The objective was to test the hypothesis that JET combination therapy is more effective than conventional therapy for uncomplicated HFMD. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed. Our study showed that, compared with conventional therapy, the median time to fever resolution was significantly shorter in the JET combination therapy (8 vs. 80 h; p < 0.0001); the risk of fever resolution increased in the JET combination therapy [hazard ratio, 19.8; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 12.8 to 30.7]; the median healing time of rash or oral ulcer was significantly shorter in the JET combination therapy (14 vs. 74 h; p < 0.0001); and the median symptom score for skin or oral mucosa lesions improved more rapidly in the JET combination therapy during the follow-up period. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days in the JET combination therapy and 7 days in the conventional therapy (p < 0.0001). No significant adverse events and complications were found in both groups. The addition of JET to conventional therapy reduced fever clearance time, healing time of skin or oral mucosa lesions, and duration of hospital stay in children with uncomplicated HFMD.

Growing evidence suggests that maternal stress can induce an inflammatory environment on the fetal development. But people are not sure about the consequences of prenatal stress such as the inflammatory responses induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD). In the present study, we investigated the effects of MSD on long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences in offspring and its underlying inflammatory response pathway. The pregnant Wistar rats received prolonged sleep deprivation (72 h) on gestational day (GD) 4, 9, and 18, respectively. The post-natal day (PND) 21 offspring showed impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze task and anhedonia in sucrose preference experiment. Quantification of BrdtU(+) and DCX+ cells revealed a significant decrease in hippocampus neurogenesis in prepuberty offspring, especially for the late MSD (GD 18) group. Real-time RT-PCR showed that after MSD, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha) increased in the hippocampus of offspring on PND 1, 7, 14 and 21, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 reduced at the same time. Immunofluorescence found that the cells of activated microglia were higher in the brains of MSD offspring. Taken together, these results suggested that the MSD-induced inflammatory response is an important factor for neurogenesis impairment and neurobehavioral outcomes in prepuberty offspring.

However, the notion that de qi must be achieved for maximum benefit has not been confirmed by modern scientific evidence. This study aims to compare the efficacy of acupuncture with either strong (intended to elicit de qi) or weak stimulation among patients with allergic rhinitis. Methods/Design: This study compares real versus sham acupuncture in 140 patients with a history of persistent allergic rhinitis (PER) or intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) and with a positive skin prick test (SPT). The trial will be conducted in the Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (China). In the study, patients will be randomly assigned into two groups by computer-generated randomization and assessed prior to treatment. They will then receive 12 sessions of treatments for 4 consecutive weeks and have a follow-up phase lasting 12 weeks. The main outcome measures include the primary and secondary indicators. Primary indicators are subjective symptoms scores as evaluated by visual analogue scales (VAS), rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaires (RQLQ), and the Modified Massachusetts General Hospital acupuncture sensation scale, Chinese version (C-MMASS). The secondary indicators are the results of laboratory examinations, such as serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) nasal inflammatory cells counts (mast cells, eosinophils, and T cells), and nitric oxide concentration in nasal excretion. The use of anti-allergic medication will also be recorded as one of the secondary indicators. Furthermore, adverse events will be recorded and analyzed. Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis will be performed to test and verify the results in this trial. Discussion: The results of this trial will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat allergic rhinitis and verify whether the effectiveness of acupuncture is related to the needle sensation de qi.

The expression levels of JMJD2C are associated with tumor development and clinical outcome. Here we identify JMJD2C as a new substrate for caspase-3. JMJD2C is cleaved by caspase-3 at DEVD396G motif and then loses its demethylase activity. Additionally, we uncover D396N polymorphism (rs2296067) in the cleavage site of JMJD2C and establish its influence on the resistant to the cleavage by caspase-3. Importantly, we determined that D396N polymorphism is significantly associated with the prognosis of human breast cancer. We further found that the basal levels of DSB (double strand DNA break) repair proteins gamma-H2AX (gamma-H2AX) increased when cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) which activates caspase-3 activity. We also show that knockdown of JMJD2C expression results in up-regulation of basal gamma-H2AX. We propose that D396N polymorphism of JMJD2C affects the prognosis of human breast cancer via altering the cleavage by caspase-3 and the ability of DSB repair which may contribute to therapy resistance.

These herbs come from different plant species resulting in the variety of bioactive components and medical efficacy. A method combing tri-step IR macro-fingerprinting techniques with statistical pattern recognition was therefore employed discriminate the five herbs in order to assure their genuineness. A total of 26 samples were collected and identified by conventional Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, second derivative infrared (SD-IR) spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation infrared (2D-COS IR) spectroscopy. CDG and KDG were easily differentiated from others herbs by FTIR and SD-IR spectra. The characteristic peaks of CDG were located at 1068, 1051, 990, 909 and 867 cm(-1), whilst KDG contained the peaks located at 1628, 1565, 1392, 1232 and 1136 cm(-1). By 2D-COS IR spectra, the bands in the range of 950-1110 cm(-1) could be a characteristic range to identify the five herbs. There were six auto-peaks located at 978, 991, 1028 (strongest), 1061, 1071 and 1097 cm(-1) for CDG, six auto-peaks at 975, 991, 1026, 1053, 1070 (strongest) and 1096 cm(-1) for KDG, five auto-peaks at 970, 1009, 1037, 1070 and 1096 (strongest) cm(-1) for JDG, five auto-peaks at 973 (strongest), 1009, 1033, 1072 and 1099 cm(-1) for LR, and five auto-peaks at 974 (strongest), 1010, 1033, 1072 and 1099 cm(-1) for AR. Classification analysis of FTIR showed that these species located in different clusters. The results indicate the tri-step infrared macro-fingerprinting combines with principle component analysis (PCA) is suitable to rapidly and nondestructively differentiate these herbs.

Here we report the biological and pharmacological activity of the protein extracts from P. erosus seeds. A novel ribosome-inactivating protein, pachyerosin, from P. erosus seeds was successively purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-sepharose FF, and Sephacryl S-200. Pachyerosin showed to be a type I ribosome-inactivating protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.19. It strongly inhibited protein synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with an IC50 of 0.37 ng/mL and showed N-glycosidase activity on rat liver ribosomes with an EC50 of 85.9 pM. The N-terminal 27 amino acids of pachyerosin revealed a 60.71% sequence identity with abrin A from the seeds of Abrus precatorius. With the aim of targeting the delivery of pachyerosin, immunotoxin was prepared by conjugating pachyerosin with anti-human AFP monoclonal antibodies SM0736. The immunotoxin pachyerosin-SM0736 efficiently inhibited the growth of the human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 with an IC50 of 0.050 +/- 0.004 nM, 2360 times lower than that of pachyerosin and 430 times lower than that of the immunotoxin against human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. These results imply that pachyerosin may be used as a new promising anticancer agent.

Ohwi, which is well known as Gegen (Chinese name) in traditional Chinese medicine. As the most abundant secondary metabolite, puerarin was isolated from Gegen in the late 1950s. Since then, its pharmacological properties have been extensively investigated. It is available in common foods and is used in alternative medicine. It has been widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes and diabetic complications, osteonecrosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, endometriosis, and cancer. The beneficial effects of puerarin on the various medicinal purposes may be due to its wide spectrum of pharmacological properties such as vasodilation, cardioprotection, neuroprotection, antioxidant, anticancer, antiinflammation, alleviating pain, promoting bone formation, inhibiting alcohol intake, and attenuating insulin resistance. However, the direct molecular mechanisms and targets remain unclear. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the pharmacological effects of puerarin.

The aim of this study was to characterize longitudinal changes in brain activity between repeated observations within a short time interval in a group of female migraine patients, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Methods Nineteen patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional interregional connectivity were assessed to determine the focal and global features of brain dysfunction in migraine. The relationship between changes in headache parameters and longitudinal brain alterations were also investigated. Results All patients reported that their headache activity increased over time. Abnormal ReHo changes in the patient group relative to the HC were found in the putamen, orbitofrontal cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, brainstem, and thalamus. Moreover, these brain regions exhibited longitudinal ReHo changes at the 6-week follow-up examination. These headache activity changes were accompanied by disproportionately dysfunctional connectivity in the putamen in the migraine patients, as revealed by functional connectivity analysis, suggesting that the putamen plays an important role in integrating diverse information among other migraine-related brain regions. Conclusions The results obtained in this study suggest that progressive brain aberrations in migraine progress as a result of increased headache attacks.

Rhein, the active metabolite of diacerein, possesses anti-inflammatory ability with a gastrointestinal protective effect. However, in a preliminary study, we accidentally found that rhein showed both anti- and proinflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. Thus, in this study, we explored the underlying molecular mechanisms of the dual effects of rhein. In LPS-activated macrophages, rhein inhibits NF-kappa B activation and sequentially suppresses its downstream inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) transcription and supernatant nitric oxide and IL-6 levels by inhibiting IKK beta (IC50 approximate to 11.79 mu M). But in the meantime, rhein enhances the activity of caspase-1 by inhibiting intracellular (in situ) IKK beta, in turn increasing the IL-1 beta and high-mobility-group box 1 release, which can be amplified by rhein's reductive effect on intracellular superoxide anion. Unexpectedly, it is because of IKK beta inhibition that rhein significantly enhances TNF-alpha secretion and phagocytosis in macrophages with or without LPS. These results indicate that rhein exerts anti- and proinflammatory activities by targeting IKK beta inhibition, providing a molecular mechanism for the unanticipated role of rhein in macrophages. Furthermore, our study also highlights the potential complications of IKK beta inhibitor (e.g., rhein, diacerein, etc.) application in inflammation disorders, for the overall effects of IKK beta inhibition in various organ systems and disease processes are not easily predictable under all circumstances.

METHODS: Seventy-two patients with adult abdominal obesity with spleen deficiency and exuberant dampness were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group with 36 patients in each group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with acupuncture at hour-prescriptive points from 9 to 11 AM every day on the principle of taking points along channels in time. Patients in the control group were treated with acupuncture at any time beyond 9 to 11 AM. Patients in both groups were treated for three courses of treatment. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 87.5% in the treatment group and 78.8% in the control group. The total curative effect in the treatment group was significantly better than that in the control group in reducing body weight, body mass index, waistline, obesity level, and clinical symptoms (P<0.05). After treatment, t-test was used on two independent samples to analyze the ratio of waistline to hipline and hipline. A value of 0.01<P<0.05 expressed a weaker outcome and similar curative effect between the two groups in reducing ratio of waistline to hipline and hipline of patients. This value indicates that the treatment group has no obvious superiority to that of the control group for curative effect. CONCLUSION: Because it was superior in reducing waistline and body weight of female adult patients suffering from abdominal obesity with spleen deficiency and exuberant dampness, acupuncture at hour-prescriptive points, a method of midnight-noon ebb-flow, is an effective method to treat obesity.

The objectives of this study were to compare the differences in brain activities evoked by active acupoints and inactive acupoints and to investigate the possible correlation between clinical variables and brain responses. Methods and Results: A randomized controlled trial and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted. A total of eighty migraineurs without aura were enrolled to receive either active acupoint acupuncture or inactive acupoint acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks, and twenty patients in each group were randomly selected for the fMRI scan at the end of baseline and at the end of treatment. The neuroimaging data indicated that long-term active acupoint therapy elicited a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response compared with acupuncture at inactive acupoints. Most of the regions were involved in the pain matrix, lateral pain system, medial pain system, default mode network, and cognitive components of pain processing. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in the visual analogue scale (VAS) was significantly related to the increased average Regional homogeneity (ReHo) values in the anterior cingulate cortex in the two groups. Moreover, the decrease in the VAS was associated with increased average ReHo values in the insula which could be detected in the active acupoint group. Conclusions: Long-term active acupoint therapy and inactive acupoint therapy have different brain activities. We postulate that acupuncture at the active acupoint might have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and the pain circuitry for migraine, and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis.

METHOD: A systematic screening was conducted to investigate the dynamic response of HepG2 cells to the PAs using the impedance-based xCELLigence system. Cisplatin was selected as the positive control. The real time, concentration-response curves and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were acquired to evaluate the anticancer activity of the PAs. RESULTS: All of the six PAs inhibited cell growth and induce death in HepG2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values of cisplatin, berberine, columbamine, coptisine, epiberberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine were 5.13, 42.33, 226.54, 36.90, 302.72, 383.54, and 456.96 mu g.mL(-1), respectively. The results obtained using the xCELLigence system corresponded well with those of the conventional methods. CONCLUSION: The xCELLigence system is a reliable and efficient tool for real-time screening of the cytotoxic effect of compounds in cell-based in vitro assays. Coptisine and berberine, with methylenedioxy group at C2 and C3 on the phenyl ring showed stronger effect than the other four PAs. However, compared with cisplatin, the six PAs didn't show obvious cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells.These results provided some useful data for the evaluation of the anticancer compounds, and the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine.

Eighteen extracts of Chinese herbs were prepared complying with the standard protocol. Each of the solutions was then mixed with 1% H2O2. The mixtures were handled with two approaches: autoclaved daily for one, two or three times; stored at room temperature from one through five years. Then the bactericidal activity were evaluated by assaying the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC25923) and Gram negative (Escherichia coli, ATCC12421) bacteria. While mixed with 1% H2O2, 10 out of 18 kinds of assessed Chinese herbs displayed MBC values at 1:12800 or higher after three times of autoclaving, and 8 of them preserved such level of MBC value after stored at room temperature for three years. Some Chinese herbs, i.e. R. Scutellariae, R. Coptidis, R. Bupleuri, H. Epimedii, C. Phelledendri and F. Chrysanthemi, can significantly maintain the bactericidal activity of diluted H2O2 Certain Chinese herbs can effectively stabilize the bactericidal activity of H2O2 undergoing autoclave or long-term storage. This paper reported a brandnew pharmaceutical function of Chinese herbs and provided experimental data for the potential enhancement of H2O2 usage while its stability level is promoted.

In this article, we report the protocol of a randomized controlled trial using acupuncture to treat perimenopausal syndrome, aiming to answer this controversy. Design: A multicenter randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms is underway in China. Two hundred and six women with perimenopausal syndrome will be randomly assigned to a treatment group using acupuncture plus auricular acupressure (AA group) and a control group using Climen (R) (Bayer Healthcare Company Limited, Guangzhou, China), a 28-day sequential hormone replacement therapy, in a 1: 1 ratio. Participants in the AA group will receive three acupuncture sessions per week in the first 4 weeks and two sessions per week in the following 8 weeks, for a total of 28 sessions over 12 weeks. Auricular points will be plastered by Semen Vaccariae twice per week for a consecutive 12 weeks, with both ears used alternately. The Climen (R) control group is prescribed a tablet containing estradiol valerate 2 mg/day for the first 11 days, and a tablet containing estradiol valerate 2 mg/day plus cyroterone acetate 1 mg/day for the following 10 days. The total treatment period of the control group is three cycles. The post-treatment follow-up period will last 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) assessed at baseline and 4, 12, 16, 24 and 36 weeks after randomization. The secondary outcomes are Menopause-Specific Quality of Life, average hot flash score during 24 hours, serum estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone level. The first two secondary outcomes are measured at the same point as the MRS. Other secondary outcomes are measured at baseline and 12, 24 weeks after randomization. Discussion: The results of this trial, which will be available in 2015, will clarify whether acupuncture is effective to relieve perimenopausal syndrome.

Hughes leaves in diabetic mice and rats	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Tibetan folk medicine; Malus toringoides (Rehd.) Hughes; Flavonoids; Hypoglycemic; Antioxidant	BLOOD-GLUCOSE LEVELS; IN-VITRO; WISTAR RATS; STREPTOZOTOCIN; EXTRACT; MECHANISMS; ALLOXAN; L.	Ethnopharmacological relevance: The leaf of Malus toringoides (Rehd.) Hughes is a traditional folk medicine in Tibet, China, which is called "E Se" in Tibetan language. This original plant grows on snow mountains at an attitude of 3000 to 3700 m. It is primarily used to treat hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, indigestion and other diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of flavonoids extracted from E Se (ESF) and to explore the potential mechanism in streptozotocin (STZ) or alloxan (ALX) induced diabetic mice and STZ-induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: 72 h after the establishment of a diabetic model, STZ or ALX induced diabetic mice and STZ-induced diabetic rats were treated daily with ESF at doses of 45, 90,180 mg/kg and 37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg, respectively. Both mice and rats were fasted for 5 h before administration and the blood glucose (BG) levels were tested 1 h after treatment. Body weight was determined every other day. For STZ-induced rats, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac), serum insulin and c-peptide, hepatic glycogen, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver were assessed on the fourth day after BG level detection. Results: Compared with the model group, the general behavior of mice treated with ESF (90, 180 mg/kg) and rats treated with ESF (75, 150 mg/kg) became better and BG levels were significantly reduced (P <0.05). Significant decrease (P <0.05) in Hb1Ac level was observed in ESF-treated rats compared with diabetic rats. Significant increase (P < 0.05) in serum insulin and c-peptide were detected in ESF-treated rats. The treatment also significantly (P <0.05) elevated SOD activity and reduced MDA level in the liver of diabetic rats. Besides, ESF 150 mg/kg had a trend of rising hepatic glycogen content of diabetic rats. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that flavonoids from the Malus toringoides (Rehd.) Hughes leaves may possess an antidiabetic activity in animals with established diabetes. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Aim of the study: To explore the different effects of Fuzi and its processed products on energy metabolism, with mitochondria as the model with the aim of guiding the clinical use of Fuzi and its products. fingerprints of Fuzi, Yanfuzi, Heishunpian and Paofupian were established by Ultra-high Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and effects of Fuzi and its processed products on rat's liver's mitochondrial metabolism were studied by microcalorimetry. Spectrum-effect relationships between UPLC fingerprints and energy metabolism of mitochondria were investigated using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Results: Because of their inherent differences in chemical compositions, the main activities of energy metabolism of mitochondria were different among Fuzi and its processed products. The potential bioactivity sequence of the tested products was Fuzi > Heishunpian > Paofupian > Yanfuzi. Results of CCA showed that compounds mesaconitine, benzoylaconitine, and benzoylhypacoitine might be the principal active components. Conclusion: Altogether, this work provides a general model of combination of UPLC and microcalorimetry to study the spectrum-effect relationships of Fuzi and its processed products which can offer some references for detecting principal components of traditional Chinese medicine on bioactivity to mitochondrial growth.

However, the mechanism underlying the antiinflammatory activity of this medicinal plant is not fully understood. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of anthraquinones, the major constituents in rhubarb, and the molecular mechanism involved in their anti-inflammatory effects. Materials and methods: RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of the compounds examined. The proliferation of RAW264.7 cells was assayed by the AlamarBlue method. The quantity of nitric oxide (NO) was determined by Griess assay. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time PCR. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (l kappa B alpha), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERR), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (INK), and Akt/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) protein expression levels were determined by Western blotting. Results: Aloe-emodin markedly suppressed the production of NO, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin1 beta (IL-1 beta) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with no apparent cytotoxicity. The mRNA expression levels of iNOS, IL-6, and IL-1 beta genes were also significantly inhibited by aloe-emodin. Western blot analysis showed that aloe-emodin suppressed LPS-induced iNOS protein expression, IkB alpha degradation, and the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, JNK, and Akt Conclusions: These results demonstrate that aloe-emodin is the bioactive component of rhubarb that confers an anti-inflammatory effect through a likely mechanism involving a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages via inhibition of NF-kappa B, MAPK, and PI3K pathways.

Because of differences in the chemical composition, this species has been classified into two major chemotypes, i. e. the patchouliol-type and the pogostone-type; however, no quick and effective method is presently available for the precise identification of these two chemotypes. DNA barcoding, using a standardized DNA fragment, is a promising molecular diagnostic method for species identification. We have established a reliable and quick method for the identification of the P. cablin chemotypes. Of five potential barcodes [rbeL, psbA-trnH, rpoB, ITS (internal transcibed spacer), and ndhJ], tested among 103 samples, ITS was the best candidate, as comparative studies between patchouliol-type and pogostone-type P. cablin revealed that ITS had more variable regions among these five barcodes. We suggest that ITS can serve as the most suitable barcode for differentiating between the chemotypes of P. cablin.

However, the chemical fingerprint analysis of Radix isatidis is dominantly based on RPLC, from which it is difficult to obtain fingerprint information of hydrophilic compounds. Here, we developed the separation of Radix isatidis by RPLC and hydrophilic interaction chromatography, comparing the traditional RPLC fingerprint with the hydrophilic interaction chromatography fingerprint. Besides, an anti-viral assay of Radix isatidis was conducted to evaluate its efficacy. The fingerprint-efficacy relationships between the fingerprints and the anti-viral activity were further investigated with principal component regression analysis. The results showed that the anti-viral activity correlated better with the hydrophilic interaction chromatography fingerprint than with the RPLC fingerprint. This study indicates that hydrophilic interaction chromatography could not only be a complementary method to increase the fingerprint coverage of conventional RPLC fingerprint, but also can better represent the efficacy and quality of Radix isatidis.

More than one third of these genes carry nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) binding motifs that coincide with STAT5 in vivo binding, suggesting functional synergy between these two transcription factors. The role of NFIB in this governance was investigated in mice from which Nfib had been inactivated in mammary stem cells or in differentiating alveolar epithelium. Although NFIB was not required for alveolar expansion, the combined absence of NFIB and STAT5 prevented the formation of functional alveoli. NFIB controlled the expression of mammary-specific and STAT5-regulated genes and chromatin immunoprecipitation- sequencing established STAT5 and NFIB binding at composite regulatory elements containing histone H3 lysine dimethylation enhancer marks and progesterone receptor binding. By integrating previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data sets, the presence of NFIB-STAT5 modules in other cell types was investigated. Notably, genomic sites bound by NFIB in hair follicle stem cells were also occupied by STAT5 in mammary epithelium and coincided with enhancer marks. Many of these genes were under NFIB control in both hair follicle stem cells and mammary alveolar epithelium. We propose that NFIB-STAT5 modules, possibly in conjunction with other transcription factors, control cell-specific genetic programs.

White matter microstructural changes in psychogenic erectile dysfunction patients	ANDROLOGY			English	Article						tract-based spatial statistics; white matter; diffusion tensor imaging; erectile dysfunction	VISUAL SEXUAL STIMULI; BRAIN ACTIVATION; SPATIAL STATISTICS; INTERNATIONAL INDEX; HETEROSEXUAL MALES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; EROTIC STIMULI; FUNCTION IIEF; SELF-ESTEEM; MEN	Brain dysfunction in erectile dysfunction (ED) has been identified by multiple neuroimaging studies. A recent MRI study indicated grey matter alterations in ED patients. This study aims to investigate the microstructural changes of cerebral white matter (WM) in psychological ED patients and their possible correlations with clinical variables. Twenty-seven psychological ED patients and 27 healthy subjects (HS) were included and underwent a magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan. The tract-based spatial statistics were employed to identify the WM structure alterations in psychological ED patients. The multiple DTI-derived indices ' [fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD)] correlations with the symptoms and their durations, respectively, were analysed. The IIEF-5, quality of erection questionnaire (QEQ) and the self-esteem and relationship (SEAR) questionnaire were used to assess the symptoms of psychological ED patients. Compared with HS, the psychological ED patients showed increased FA values, reduced MD values and reduced AD values in multiple WM tracts including the corpus callosum (genu, body and splenium), corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, external capsule and superior longitudinal fasciculus (p<0.05, threshold-free cluster enhancement corrected). Both of the IIEF scores and QEQ scores of ED patients showed a significantly negative correlation with the average FA values, and positive correlation with average AD values and MD values in the splenium of the corpus callosum (p<0.05). The results provided preliminary evidence of WM microstructural changes in patients with psychological ED. The morphological alterations in the splenium of the corpus callosum were related to the symptom severity.

Methods: Drug nanosuspensions produced from high pressure homogenization were transformed into oral fast dissolving film containing drug nanoparticles by casting methods. Herpetrione (HPE), a novel and potent antiviral agent with poor water solubility that was extracted from Herpetospermum caudigerum, was studied as the model drug. The formulations of oral fast dissolving film containing HPE nanoparticles (HPE-NP-OFDF) were optimized by employing Box-Behnken design-response surface methodology and then systematically characterized. Results: The optimized HPE-NP-OFDF was disintegrated in water within 20 s with reconstituted nanosuspensions particle size of 299.31 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that well-dispersed HPE nanoparticles with slight adhesion to each other were exposed on the surface of film or embedded in film. The X-ray diffractogram (XRD) analysis suggested that HPE in the HPE-NP-OFDF was in the amorphous state. In-vitro release study, approximate 77.23% of HPE was released from the HPE-NP-OFDF within 5 min, which was more than eight times compared with that of HPE raw materials (9.57%). Conclusion: The optimized HPE-NP-OFDF exhibits much faster drug release rates compared to HPE raw material, which indicated that this novel NP-OFDF may provide a potential opportunity for oral delivery of drugs with poor water solubility.

Hydrogel-grafted fabric was prepared by graft copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and alginate using ceric ammonium nitrate as initiator. Berberine nanosuspension was prepared and embedded in the hydrogel-grafted fabrics to achieve sustained drug release. The prepared hydrogel-grafted fabrics embedding of berberine nanosuspension was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and swelling degree studies. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that berberine was embedded into the matrix of hydrogel-grafted fabrics, rather than on the surface. Scanning electron microscopy showed that a thin hydrogel layer was formed on the surface of nonwoven fibers. The swelling study showed that hydrogel-grafted fabric had water absorbing characteristic with reversible temperature sensitivity. The drug release study demonstrated that hydrogel-grafted fabrics can be used as a sustained drug delivery system of hydrophobic compounds. The berberine nanosuspension embedded hydrogel-grafted fabric was further investigated in an animal infected wound model and was found to be a very promising wound healing dressing for the treatment and healing of infected wounds.

Altered intrinsic regional activity and corresponding brain pathways reflect the symptom severity of functional dyspepsia	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						brain; brain-gut interaction; fMRI; functional dyspepsia; resting state	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING TEAM REPORT; RESTING-STATE FMRI; GASTRIC DISTENSION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HOMOGENEITY; DISORDERS; ACTIVATION; DEPRESSION	BackgroundIncreasing evidence shows central abnormalities in functional dyspepsia (FD) patients, but whether the symptom severity is directly reflected in altered brain patterns remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore how FD affected the resting functional brain patterns for different degrees of symptom severity. MethodsFunctional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 40 FD patients and 20 healthy controls. The resting-state brain changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed correlation analysis were investigated in patients relative to controls. To what degree the brain changes reflected the severity of the disease was assessed by a pattern classification technique. Key ResultsAltered ReHo values (p<0.05, FDR corrected) were discovered in multiple brain areas in FD patients, and only the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and thalamus exhibited significant correlation with the severity of dyspepsia symptoms. Compared with controls, the neural signal changes of the thalamus were not found in the less severe FD patient group but in the relatively more severe group, while the ACC showed aberrations in both groups. Seed-based correlation analysis revealed ACC- and thalamus-related functional connectivity differences between FD patients and controls at a voxel-wise level, and the altered thalamic circuits provided the best performance in distinguishing FD patients with different levels of symptom severity. Conclusions & InferencesOur results indicated that the functional abnormalities of the ACC and thalamus may occur at different clinical courses in FD. This may help us better understand the progression of FD.	[Nan, J.; Liu, J.; Yan, X.; Yin, Q.; Xiong, S.; Von Deneen, K.

METHODS: This was a single center, prospective cohort study. Eligible, consecutive hospitalized patients received either entecavir 0.5 mg/d or lamivudine 100 mg/d. All patients were given standard comprehensive internal medicine. The primary endpoint was survival rate at day 60, and secondary endpoints were reduction in hepatitis b virus (HBV) DNA and alanine amino-transferase (ALT) levels, and improvement in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores at day 60 and survival rate at week 52. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen eligible subjects were recruited from 176 patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B: 65 were included in the entecavir group and 54 in the lamivudine group (full analysis set). No significant differences were found in patient baseline clinical parameters. At day 60, entecavir did not improve the probability of survival (P = 0.066), despite resulting in faster virological suppression (P < 0.001), higher rates of virological response (P < 0.05) and greater reductions in the CTP and MELD scores (all P < 0.05) than lamivudine. Intriguingly, at week 52, the probability of survival was higher in the entecavir group than in the lamivudine group [42/65 (64.6%) vs 26/54 (48.1%), respectively; P = 0.038]. The pretreatment MELD score (B, 1.357; 95% CI: 2.138-7.062; P = 0.000) and virological response at day 30 (B, 1.556; 95% CI: 1.811-12.411; P = 0.002), were found to be good predictors for 52-wk survival. CONCLUSION: Entecavir significantly reduced HBV DNA levels, decreased the CTP and MELD scores, and thereby improved the long-term survival rate in patients with spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B presenting as ACLF.

Angiogenesis mediated by VEGF gene expression and its modification through histone acetylation has been considered a target in treating myocardial ischemia. This study aims to exam whether modulation of angiogenesis through H3K9 acetylation regulation at VEGF gene is one possible cardioprotective mechanism of acupuncture. Results: We generated rat MI models by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery and applied electroacupuncture (EA) treatment at the Neiguan (PC6) acupoint. Our results showed that acupuncture reversed the S-T segment change, reduced Q-wave area, decreased CK, CK-MB, LDH levels, mitigated myocardial remodeling, and promoted microvessel formation in the MI heart. RNA-seq analysis showed that VEGF-induced angiogenesis signaling was involved in the modulation of EA. Western blot results verified that the protein expressions of VEGF, Ras, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-SAPK/JNK and Akt, were all elevated significantly by EA treatment in the MI heart. Furthermore, increased H3K9 acetylation was also observed according with the VEGF. ChIP assay confirmed that EA treatment could notably stimulate the recruitment of H3K9ace at the VEGF promoter. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates for the first time that acupuncture can effectively up-regulate VEGF expression through H3K9 acetylation modification directly at the VEGF promoter and hence activate VEGF-induced angiogenesis in rat MI models. We employed high throughput sequencing in this study and, for the first time, generated genome-wide gene expression profiles both in the rat MI model and in acupuncture treatment.

On the basis of chemical and spectroscopic methods, the two ellagic acids were identified as 3,3', 4-tri-O-methylellagic acid-4'-O-beta-D-xyloside and 3,3', 4-tri-O-methylellagic acid. Stimulation of cell proliferation was assayed in hematopoietic progenitor cells using the Cell Counting kit-8 method. The megakaryocyte differentiation was determined in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells using Giemsa staining and flow cytometry analysis. The ellagic acids significantly stimulated the proliferation of Baf3/Mpl cells. Morphology analysis and megakaryocyte specific-marker CD41 staining confirmed that the ellagic acids induced megakaryocyte differentiation in HEL cells. This is the first time that 3,3', 4-tri-O-methylellagic acid or 3,3', 4-tri-O-methylellagic acid-4'-O-beta-D-xyloside are reported to induce megakaryopoiesis, suggesting a class of small molecules which differ from others non-peptidyl, and appears to have potential for clinical development as a therapeutic agent for patients with blood platelet disorders.

Compound danshen dripping pill (CDDP; Fufang Danshen Diwan in Chinese), namely cardiotonic pill, is extensively used for CVDs medication in China and some other countries. Here, we sought to investigate the effect of CDDP on leukocytes binding to vascular endothelial cells and elaborate the possibly underlying mechanism. Using seropharmacological method, rabbit sera containing CDDP were shown to mitigate the adhesiveness of monocytes and neutrophils to tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells in dose and time-dependent manners, alleviate the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 messenger RNA and protein dose dependently and also encumber I kappa B alpha degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) DNA-binding activity, and NF-kappa B-responsive gene transcription in tumor necrosis factor alpha-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This study suggests that CDDP protects against CVDs potentially by attenuation of leukocytes-endothelium adhesion cascade via lessening endothelial cell adhesion molecules expression and NF-kappa B signaling pathway activity.

The four extracts are PE fraction, CHCl3 fraction, EtOAc fraction, and n-BuOH fraction. The heat flow power-time (HFP-time) curves of E. coli growth in the presence of the four extracts were measured using an ampoule method. Then the nine thermal kinetic parameters were obtained from the curves. From the result of principal component analysis, it can be seen that parameters k (1), k (2), P (1), and Q (p2) might be the main parameters in evaluating the anti-E. coli effects. In the presence of CHCl3 fraction, EtOAc fraction, and n-BuOH fraction, k (2), Q (p2) of E. coli decreased with increasing concentrations of the extracts. The EtOAc fraction was observed to have the strongest anti-bacterial activity with half-inhibitory concentration IC50 of 98.5 mu g mL(-1). So, it can be concluded that EtOAc fraction can be further developed as anti-bacterial bioactive fraction of leaves of Dracontomelon dao.

Twenty male mice were randomly divided into two groups. In vivo experiments, one group of animals were orally administrated with YGW decoction and another group administered with saline for 14days. Afterwards, the animals were mated with their female partners. Percentages of retrieved zygotes were then compared. In vitro experiments, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) assay, sperm acrosome reaction and acrosin activity were used to compare sperm fertilising ability between the two groups. The YGW-treated group had a significantly higher percentage of zygotes than the saline controls (P=0.005). The IVF rates induced by spermatozoa from the herb-treated mice were also significantly higher than those from the control animals (P=0.015). The sperm acrosin activity of the herb-treated group was significantly higher than that of the saline-treated group (P=0.048), although there was no significant difference in testicular weight, sperm count and sperm motility. These data suggest that YGW decoction has a significant effect on normal sperm fertilising ability both in vivo and in vitro, which may be due to, at least in part, increments in the sperm acrosin activity.

Dapagliflozin is a novel treatment choice for type 2 diabetes. ObjectiveA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin treatment. Data SourcesMedline (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and the Cochrane Library (up to August 2012) were searched, and RCTs were collected. Study SelectionStudies included type 2 diabetic subjects, who had been treated with dapagliflozin, and recorded HbA(1c) as outcomes. Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently assessed articles and study quality. Patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes were collected. Data SynthesisTen RCTs were included. Risk of bias for outcomes was low. Fixed or random effects models were used to pool the results. Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a reduction in HbA(1c) [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.53%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.58% to -0.47%; p<0.00001], fasting plasma glucose (WMD: -1.06mmol/L; 95% CI: -1.20, -0.92; p<0.00001), and body weight (WMD: -1.63kg; 95% CI: -1.83, -1.43; p<0.00001). Dapagliflozin monotherapy did not lead to hypoglycaemia [relative risk (RR): 1.44; 95% CI: 0. 86, 2.41; p=0.17], although hypoglycaemic risk increased (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.29; p=0.005) when dapagliflozin was combined with other hypoglycaemic drugs. Dapagliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion (WMD: 26.98; 95% CI: 21.72, 32.24; p<0.00001) and was associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (RR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.60; p=0.004) and genital tract infections (RR: 3.23; 95% CI: 2.50, 4.18; p=0.00001). ConclusionsDapagliflozin appears to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, although it may increase the risk of urinary tract infections and genital tract infections.

Both the FTIR spectra and second derivative spectra of these various parts and tissues of SQ samples were found to be similar. Their dominant component is starch resulting from the characteristic peaks of starch observed at 3 400, 2 930, 1 645, 1 155, 1 080 and 1 020 cm(-1) on the spectra of all these SQ samples. However, the varieties of peaks were found on the spectra among these specific samples. The rhizome contains more saponins than others on the basis of the largest ratio of the peak intensity at 1 077 cm-1 to that at 1 152 cm(-1). The peaks located at 1 317 and 780 cm(-1) on the FTIR spectra of the rhizome and its epidermis indicate that the two parts of SQ samples contain large amount of calcium oxalate, and its content in the latter is relative larger than that in former. The fibrous root contains much amount of nitrate owing to the obvious characteristic peaks at 1 384 and 831 cm(-1). For the difference among the various tissues of SQ samples, the peaks at 2 926, 2 854 and 1 740 cm(-1) on the FTIR spectra of epidermis is the strongest among the various tissues of main root indicating the largest amount of esters in epidermis. Protein was also found in the cambium of the main root based on the relative strong peaks of amide I and II band at 1 641 and 1 541 cm(-1), respectively. The results indicate that FTIR spectra with its second derivative spectra can show the characteristic of the various parts and tissues of SQ samples in both the holistic chemical constituents and specific chemical components, including organic macromolecule compounds and small inorganic molecule compounds. FTIR spectroscopy is a useful analytical method for the genuine and rapid identification and quality assessment of SQ samples.

Much has known about plastic changes in resting state on global level; however, how training/expertise-related effect affects patterns of local spontaneous activity in resting brain remains elusive. We investigated the homogeneity of local blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations in the resting state using a regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis among 16 acupuncturists and 16 matched nonacupuncturists (NA). To prove acupuncturists' expertise, we used a series of psychophysical tests. Our results demonstrated that, acupuncturists significantly outperformed NA in tactile-motor and emotional regulation domain and the acupuncturist group showed increased coherence in local BOLD signal fluctuations in the left primary motor cortex (MI), the left primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex (VMPFC/OFC). Regression analysis displayed that, in the acupuncturists group, ReHo of VMPFC/OFC could predict behavioral outcomes, evidenced by negative correlation between unpleasantness ratings and ReHo of VMPFC/OFC and ReHo of SI and MI positively correlated with the duration of acupuncture practice. We suggest that expertise could modulate patterns of local resting state activity by increasing regional clustering strength, which is likely to contribute to advanced local information processing efficiency. Our study completes the understanding of neuroplasticity changes by adding the evidence of local resting state activity alterations, which is helpful for elucidating in what manner training effect extends beyond resting state.

In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, two sets of analgesia ACs were utilized, including Waiguan (TE5) and Qiuxu (GB40) for Group A, and Neiguan (PC6) and Taichong (LR3) for Group B, which are the most commonly adopted in clinical treatment. Each group had 20 healthy subjects. An experimental design was proposed, which consisted of a pre-needling resting phase, a needling phase and a post-needling resting phase. This paradigm optimally mimics the clinical protocol as well as focuses on both the stimulation and the resting periods. The results were subjected to general linear model analysis, conjunction analysis and the functional connectivity analysis. The rostral anterior cingulated cortex was engaged in the initiative period of the acupuncture effect in both groups, and it was chosen as the seed region for the functional connectivity analysis for the following resting period. The results showed that several shared brain regions were involved in both groups, in particular the insula, amygdala and hypothalamus. Moreover, significant differences were located at the posterior cingulated cortex as revealed by a two sample -test (P < 0.05, corrected). Other regions showed no significant differences. This finding was further supported by the spatial correlation analysis that the two groups were significantly correlated (r =0.51, P < 0.01).

This systematic review was carried out in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0 and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Extensive literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Excerpta Medical Databases, the Cochrane Library, the China National Infrastructure, Wanfang Chinese Digital Periodical and Conference Database, and the Weipu Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database. The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center was also searched for ongoing trials up to September 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias. Five RCTs with 285 participants were found from 49 relevant studies, but there was just one RCT which met the inclusion criteria for this review. The study showed that treatment of catgut implantation at acupoints could lead to a better alleviation of the signs and symptoms of AR than the crude herb moxibustion. No adverse events were reported in this study. Because of the methodological shortcoming and the risk of bias of the included trial, catgut implantation was proved with only limited evidence for the treatment of AR. Robust RCTs with high quality and larger sample size in this field are hoped to be carried out in the future.

The heat flow power-time curves of MRSA and E. coli growth in the presence of pxCECA1 were recorded using the 3114/3115 Thermal Activity Monitor Air Isothermal Calorimeter based on ampoule mode at 37 A degrees C. Some parameters including growth rate constant k, maximum power output P (max), total heat output Q(t), generation time t (g), growth inhibitory ratio I, and half-inhibitory concentration of the drugs IC50 were obtained to elucidate the antibacterial activity of pxCECA1. The results showed that k, P (max), and Q (t) decreased, but I and t (g) increased or delayed with the increase in pxCECA1 concentration. The IC50 of pxCECA1 on E. coli was 6.122 mu g mL(-1) and MRSA was 7.809 mu g mL(-1). It could be concluded that pxCECA1 had stronger inhibitory effect on E. coli than MRSA. In vivo test was simultaneously performed using an E. coli and MRSA infection model to validate the antibacterial activity of pxCECA1. The results revealed that pxCECA1 with broad spectrum antimicrobial activities hopefully represented a class of promising substitute of antimicrobial agents.

The mycotoxin contamination levels were also determined by an optimized HPLC-FLD method. 124 fungal isolates belonging to four different genera were recovered with Aspergillus and Penicillium as predominant fungi, with an incidence of 66.1% and 15.3%, respectively. In functional foods Aspergillus niger section (57.1%) was isolated more frequently, followed by Aspergillus flavi section (50.0%) and Aspergillus ochraceus section (21.4%), with the most contaminated samples being Coix seeds. Similar fungal presence and frequency were encountered in spice with A. niger section group (60.0%) and A. flavi section (40.0%) as main fungi. Cumin and Pricklyash peel samples showed the highest fungal contamination. Four functional foods and three spices were found to be positive at low levels for mycotoxins including aflatoxin B-1 (up to 0.26 mu g/kg) and ochratoxin A (OTA) (5.0 mu g/kg). The more frequently detected mycotoxin was AFB(1) (16.7%). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have found that miR-181a were dysregulated in several types of cancers, however, the function of miR-181a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study we assessed the potential association between miR-181a, HBV and HCC. Methods: The expression of miR-181a in HBV-expressing cells was determined by using qRT-PCR. Dual-Luciferase reporter Assay, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to investigate the target genes of miR-181a. The effects of miR-181a on HCC proliferation were analyzed by MTS and colony formation assay. Tumor growth assay was used to analyze the effect of miR-181a on tumor formation. Results: HBV up-regulated miR-181a expression by enhancing its promoter activity. Overexpression of miR-181a in hepatoma cells promoted cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Conversely, inhibition of miR-181a suppressed the proliferation of HBV-expressing cells. Mechanism investigation revealed that miR-181a inhibited the expression of transcription factor E2F5 by specifically targeting its mRNA 3'UTR. Moreover, E2F5 inhibition induced cell growth and rescued the suppressive effect of miR-181a inhibitor on the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Interestingly, we also discovered that HBV could down-regulate E2F5 expression. Conclusions: Those results strongly suggested that HBV down-regulated E2F5 expression, in part, by up-regulating the expression of miR-181a. Up-regulation of miR-181a by HBV in hepatoma cells may contribute to the progression of HCC possibly by targeting E2F5, suggesting miR-181a plays important role in HCC development.

As demonstrated in several clinical trials, acupuncture is attested to be effective for CSAP. Current trials are not adequate enough to provide high-quality evidence for clinical decision making, as a result of inadequate methodology design and small sample size. Notably, stark controversy toward acupoint specificity also exists in the clinical acupuncture trials for CSAP. Therefore, we designed the present study as a randomized controlled trial primarily to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in addition to routine care among patients with CSAP. Meanwhile, we examined whether acupoint on the disease-affected meridian (DAM) is superior to either acupoint on the non-affected meridian (NAM) or non-acupoint (NA), to further investigate the meridian-based characteristics of acupoint specificity. Methods/Design: This study was a multicenter, assessor and statistician blinded, randomized controlled trial in China. In this study, 404 participants in sum will be randomly assigned to four groups through central randomization in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The whole study period is 20 weeks including a 4-week baseline period, a 4-week treatment period and a 12-week follow-up. Participants in the DAM group receive acupuncture stimulation at acupoints on the disease-affected meridian, and three different control groups will undergo acupuncture stimulation at the NAM, the non-acupoint and no intervention respectively, in addition to basic treatment. Participants in the acupuncture groups will receive 12 sessions of acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks, while the wait-listed (WL) group would receive free acupuncture treatment after the completion of the study. The outcome measures in this trial include the frequency of angina attack during 4 weeks as the primary outcome and eight other secondary outcomes. Discussion: This trial will provide new and relatively high-quality evidence in acupuncture treatment for CSAP. Moreover, this trial may further validate the meridian-based characteristics of acupoint specificity by comparing the strength of acupoints on the disease-affected meridian versus that of the non-affected meridian, to further inspire optimization of acupuncture therapy for CSAP.

BENTH; QUINOLONE ALKALOIDS; FRUITS	A simple and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography method with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of six bioactive components, rutaevine, limonin, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, N-formyldihydrorutaecarpine and dihydroevocarpine, in the traditional Chinese medicine Evodiae Fructus (Wuzhuyu in Chinese). HPLC separation was conducted on an Agilent Eclipse C18 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 mm) at 35 degrees C with a mixture of mobile phase A [tetrahydrofuran-0.02% phosphoric acid (16 : 35)] and mobile phase B (acetonitrile) (gradient elution as follows: 0 min, 22% B; 23 min, 22% B; 24 min, 75% B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and the DAD detection wavelength was set at 220 nm. A linear relationship within the range of investigated concentrations was observed for the six compounds, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.999. The average recovery yields of the six compounds ranged from 98.39 to 104.96%. The HPLC-DAD method was validated by its repeatability [relative standard deviation (RSD) < 2.0%] and intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD < 2.0%). The method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of the six previously mentioned components in Evodiae Fructus. It is the first report of a simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis for three classes of bioactive components in Wuzhuyu, including the indolequinazoline alkaloids, quinolone alkaloid and limonoids. Based on these results, it is suggested, for possible future revision of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, that the total contents of evodiamine and rutaecarpine are not less than 0.15% and the total contents of rutaevine and limonin are not less than 0.50%.

Inhibition of eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article						TRAIL; eIF2 alpha; apoptosis; CHOP; GADD34	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; CARCINOMA-CELLS; ER-STRESS; ALPHA-SUBUNIT; LIGAND; DEATH; TRANSLATION; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an inducer of cancer cell death that holds promise in cancer therapy. Cancer cells are more susceptible than normal cells to the cell-death-inducing effects of TRAIL. However, a variety of cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL through complex mechanisms. Here, we investigate the effects of inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit a (eIF2 alpha) dephosphorylation on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Treatment of hepatoma cells with salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation, enhances TRAIL-induced eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expression and caspase activation. Salubrinal enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which could be abrogated by caspase inhibitor. Overexpression of phosphomimetic eIF2 alpha (S51D) enhances TRAILinduced CHOP expression, caspase 7 and PARP cleavage and apoptosis. By contrast, overexpression of phosphodeficient eIF2 alpha (S51A) abrogates the stimulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by salubrinal. Moreover, knockdown of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), which recruits protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2 alpha, enhances TRAILinduced eIF2a phosphorylation, CHOP expression, caspase activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the sensitization of hepatoma cells to TRAIL by salubrinal is dependent on CHOP. Knockdown of CHOP abrogates the stimulation of TRAIL-induced caspase activation and apoptosis by salubrinal. Combination of salubrinal and TRAIL leads to increased expression of Bim, a CHOP-regulated proapoptotic protein. Bim knockdown blunts the stimulatory effect of salubrinal on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibition of eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation may lead to synthetic lethality in TRAIL-treated hepatoma cells.

Data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) methods provide an opportunity for researchers to discover TCM regularities buried in the large volume of clinical records. There has been some work on this problem. Existing methods have been validated on a limited amount of manually well-structured data. However, the contents of most fields in the clinical records are unstructured. As a result, the previous methods verified on the well-structured data will not work effectively on the free-text clinical records (FCRs), and the FCRs are, consequently, required to be structured in advance. Manually structuring the large volume of TCM FCRs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but the development of automatic methods for the structuring task is at an early stage. Therefore, in this paper, symptom name recognition (SNR) in the chief complaints, which is one of the important tasks to structure the FCRs of TCM, is carefully studied. The SNR task is reasonably treated as a sequence labeling problem, and several fundamental and practical problems in the SNR task are studied, such as how to adapt a general sequence labeling strategy for the SNR task according to the domain-specific characteristics of the chief complaints and which sequence classifier is more appropriate to solve the SNR task. To answer these questions, a series of elaborate experiments were performed, and the results are explained in detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Online Detection for Notoginseng Ingredients in Macroporous Resin Purification Process Using Near Infrared Technology in Combination with Partial Least Squares	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Online detection; Near infrared technology; Notoginseng ingredients; Partial least squares	SINENSIS L.; SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE	In this work, we have developed new prediction models for online detection of notoginseng ingredients (Ginsenoside Rg1, Ginsenoside Re and Notoginsenoside R1) during the macroporous resin purification process by near infrared technology in combination with partial least squares. In the experiments, calibration models were generated based on min max normalization (MMN) for Ginsenoside Rg1, Ginsenoside Re and First derivative + vector normalization for notoginsenoside R1. Finally, the root mean square errors of cross-validation (RMSECV) of Rg1 Re and R1 were 0.952, 0.106, 0.214 mg/mL, respectively; the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) were 1.132, 0.121 and 0.381 mg/mL, respectively; the correlation coefficients (R-2) of cross-validation were 0.9858, 0.9787 and 0.9793, respectively; the correlation coefficients (R-2) of prediction were 0.9884, 0.9898 and 0.9709, respectively. In conclusion, this research indicated that NIR technology can be used for rapid analysis and online quality control of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in production process.	[Zhong, R.

As this herb has bacteriostatic properties and is used to treat bacterial diarrhea, we examined the effects of individual constituents (berberine, palmatine, coptisine, epiberberine, jateorrhizine and columbamine) on the growth of Shigella dysenteriae with microcalorimetry. The removing and adding procedures revealed that berberine and coptisine were the main antibacterial constituents of R. coptidis, with bacteriostatic activities of 54.10% and 39.75%, respectively. The relative levels of berberine and coptisine in R. coptidis were 8.08%-31.92% and 4.05%-14.45%, respectively. On the basis of whole effect, the method of constituents removing and adding, coupled with a bioassay, is a useful strategy to identify the active constituents and measure their levels in herbal medicines, which may provide reference to other natural products.

Consequently, three peptide fragments (PFs) with certain sequence named PF-A1 _123, PF-Al24_298 and PF-A299_585 were obtained as candidates of renal targeting carrier. Then, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of three PFs was studied preliminarily. The results showed that three PFs had no adverse effects on the HeLa and MDCK cell even up to 5.00 mg/mL and PF-A299_585 exhibited highest affinity to MDCK cells. After that, we found that PFs selectively accumulated in the kidneys, especially in the renal tubules after intravenous injection in mice by optical imaging study. Finally, Tissues distribution in vivo was utilized to verify the renal targeting profiles of PFs. Three PFs exhibited renal accumulation characteristics. In particular, about 40% injected doses of PF-A299_585 were specifically distributed into kidneys for 1 h. The mean area under the curve (AUC) of PF-A299_585 in kidneys increased 13 times compared with those of PF-A1_123 and PF-Al24_298. Therefore, PFs can be applied as prospective carriers for renal targeting and PF-A299_585 may be the optimal carrier. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More effective therapies are needed with fewer adverse effects than are seen with conventional medications. Acupuncture, as a traditional therapeutic method, has been widely used for functional gastrointestinal disorders in the East. Manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture have been recognized treatments for FD, but to date, no robust evidence has been found for the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in the treatment of this condition. Objectives This review was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture in the treatment of FD. Search methods Trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Chinese Biology Medicine Disc (CBMdisc), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Wanfang Database, the VIP Database, and six trial registries. Handsearching was done to screen the reference sections of potential trials and reviews. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if investigators reported efficacy and safety ofmanual acupuncture or electroacupuncture for patients with FD diagnosed by Rome II or Rome III criteria, compared with medications, blank control, or sham acupuncture. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by independent review authors. Study limitations were assessed by using the tool of The Cochrane Collabration for assessing risk of bias. For dichotomous data, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) would be applied, and for continuous data, mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. A fixed-effect model was applied in the meta-analysis, or a descriptive analysis was performed. The quality of evidence for the outcome measure was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. Main results Seven studies were included in the review, involving 542 participants with FD (212 males and 330 females). These studies generally had an unclear risk of bias based on inadequate descriptions of allocation concealment and a high risk of bias based on lack of blinding. None of the studies reported on outcomes of the Functional Digestive Disorder Quality of Life questionnaire (FDDQL), the Satisfaction With Dyspepsia Related Health scale (SODA), the Digestive Health Status Instrument (DHSI), or effective/inefficient rate and symptom recurrence six months from completion of acupuncture treatment. Four RCTs of acupuncture versus medications (cisapride, domperidone, and itopride) were included in the review. No statistically significant difference was noted in the reduction in FD symptom scores and the frequency of FD attack by manual acupuncture, manual-electroacupuncture, or electroacupuncture compared with medications. In three trials of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, all descriptive or quantitative analysis results implied that acupuncture could improve FD symptom scores and scores on the Neck Disability Index (NDI), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) more or as significantly as sham acupuncture. With regard to adverse effects, acupuncture was superior to cisapride treatment (one study; all minor events), but no statistically significant difference was reported between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. No adverse effects data were reported in studies examining manual acupuncture versus domperidone, manual-electroacupuncture versus domperidone, or electroacupuncture versus itopride. Nevertheless, all evidence was of low or very low quality. The body of evidence identified cannot yet permit a robust conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for FD. Authors' conclusions It remains unknown whether manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture is more effective or safer than other treatments for patients with FD.

This study was to explore whether YGW has an impact on mouse oocyte maturation in vitro and subsequent fertilization competence. Rat medicated serum containing YGW was prepared by orally administrating YGW. Mouse immature oocytes were cultured with YGW medicated serum and compared to those cultured with or without normal rat serum or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). YGW medicated serum significantly increased the percentages of matured oocytes when compared to the groups with or without normal rat serum (P < 0.01). Furthermore, YGW medicated serum increased the rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) when compared to the groups treated with FSH and with or without normal rat serum(P < 0.001). YGW medicated serum also had significant effects on the mRNA expressions of PKA, CREB, MAPK, PKC, PKG, and MPF and the concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, and NO in matured oocytes. These results indicate that YGW can promote mouse oocyte maturation and IVF in vitro. Signaling pathways, such as the cAMP/PKA/MAPK, the PKC-MAPK, and the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway, which are similar to those induced by FSH, may be responsible for this action.

In this study, a combination of the structure-based pharmacophore modeling and a hybrid protocol of virtual screening methods comprised of pharmacophore model-based virtual screening, docking-based virtual screening, and in silico ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) analysis were used to retrieve novel PKM2 activators from commercially available chemical databases. Tetrahydroquinoline derivatives were identified as potential scaffolds of PKM2 activators. Thus, the hybrid virtual screening approach was applied to screen the focused tetrahydroquinoline derivatives embedded in the ZINC database. Six hit compounds were selected from the final hits and experimental studies were then performed. Compound 8 displayed a potent inhibitory effect on human lung cancer cells. Following treatment with Compound 8, cell viability, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were examined in A549 cells. Finally, we evaluated the effects of Compound 8 on mice xenograft tumor models in vivo. These results may provide important information for further research on novel PKM2 activators as antitumor agents.

Studies have shown that saponins and flavonoids contained in semen can significantly decrease the content of excitatory neurotransmitter Glu in mice. And the total flavone of YinYangHuo can increase the release of GABA in the anterior periventricular system of rat and increase the affinity of GABA for the receptors GABAA. It can be inferred that their synergism may have effect on the neurotransmitter that causes behavioral sensitization and conditioned place preference in experimental animals and affects their drinking behaviors, which is the starting point of this research. The present study found that ASF can inhibit development and expression of behavioral sensitization induced by ethanol and the development of CPP in mice. We demonstrate the inhibition of ASF on behavioral sensitization partly due to its effect on the mesolimbic neurotransmitter system, including decreasing level of DA and Glu and increasing the content of GABA. It suggested that the ASF may have pharmacological effects in the treatment of alcohol addiction.

The entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the earliest affected brain regions in AD. Impairments of EC neurons are responsible for the cognitive deficits in AD. However, little effort has been made to investigate the effects of soluble A beta on the discharge properties of EC neurons in vivo. The present study was designed to examine the effects of soluble A beta(1-42) on the discharge properties of EC neurons, using in vivo extracellular single unit recordings. The protective effects of gastrodin (GAS) were also investigated against A beta(1-42)-induced alterations in EC neuronal activities. The results showed that the spontaneous discharge of EC neurons was increased by local application of soluble A beta(1-42) and that GAS can effectively reverse A beta(1-42)-induced facilitation of spontaneous discharge in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, whole-cell patch clamp results indicated that the protective function of GAS on abnormal hyperexcitability may be partially mediated by its inhibitory action on A beta(1-42)-elicited inward currents in EC neurons. Our study suggested that GAS may provide neuroprotective effects on A beta(1-42)-induced hyperactivity in EC neurons of rats.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the genetic risk of the -765G>C polymorphism in the COX-2 gene for digestive system cancer. Materials and Methods: A search was performed in Pubmed, Medline (Ovid), Embase, CNKI, Weipu, Wanfang and CBM databases, covering all studies until Feb 10, 2014. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman5.2. Results: A total of 10,814 cases and 16,174 controls in 38 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that C allele carriers (GC+CC) had a 20% increased risk of digestive system cancer when compared with the homozygote GG (odds ratio (OR)=1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.44 for GC+CC vs GG). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with C allele carriers (GC+CC) in Asians (OR =1.46, 95% CI=1.07-2.01, and p=0.02) and Africans (OR=2.12, 95% CI=1.57-2.87, and p<0.00001), but not among Caucasians, Americans and mixed groups. For subgroup analysis by cancer type (GC+CC vs GG), significant associations were found between the -765G>C polymorphism and higher risk for gastric cancer (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.03-2.61, and p=0.04), but not for colorectal cancer, oral cancer, esophageal cancer, and others. Regarding study design (GC+CC vs GG), no significant associations were found in then population-based case-control (PCC), hospital-based case-control (HCC) and family-based case-control (FCC) studies. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that the -765G>C polymorphism of the COX-2 gene is a potential risk factor for digestive system cancer in Asians and Africans and gastric cancer overall.

However, sulfur fumed Pinelliae Rhizoma will get a better appearance than naturally dried one. Sulfur fumed Pinelliae Rhizoma is potentially toxical due to sulfur dioxide and sulfites formed during the fuming procedures. The odor components in sulfur fumed Pinelliae Rhizoma is complex. At present, there is no analytical method available to determine sulfur fumed Pinelliae Rhizoma simply and rapidly. To ensure medication safety, it is highly desirable to have an effective and simple method to identify sulfur fumed Pinelliae Rhizoma. Materials and Methods: This paper presents a novel approach using an electronic nose based on metal oxide sensors to identify whether Pinelliae Rhizoma was fumed with sulfur, and to predict the fuming degree of Pinelliae Rhizoma. Multivariate statistical methods such as principal components analysis (PCA), discriminant factorial analysis (DFA) and partial least squares (PLS) were used for data analyzing and identification. The use of the electronic nose to discriminate between different fuming degrees Pinelliae Rhizoma and naturally dried Pinelliae Rhizoma was demonstrated. Results: The electronic nose was also successfully applied to identify unknown samples including sulfur fumed samples and naturally dried samples, high recognition value was obtained. Quantitative analysis of fuming degree of Pinelliae Rhizoma was also demonstrated. The method developed is simple and fast, which provides a new quality control method of Chinese herbs from the aspect of odor. Conclusion: It has shown that this electronic nose based metal oxide sensor is sensitive to sulfur and sulfides. We suggest that it can serve as a supportive method to detect residual sulfur and sulfides.

Chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) is a major syndrome of ischemic heart disease (IHD). CSAP manifests as chest pain or discomfort and affects patients' quality of life. Acupoint application (AP) has been reported to be effective for managing the symptoms of CSAP, but the evidence is not convincing. Therefore, we designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of AP in the treatment of CSAP. Methods and Analysis. Two hundred participants with CSAP will be randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio into 4 groups. All participants will receive 12 sessions of treatment in 4 weeks and the same basic treatment procedure. The participants will be visited and assessed for 12 weeks, including a 4-week screening, a 4-week treatment phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase. The primary outcome is the change in the total frequency of self-reported angina attack at 4th week compared with the baseline. The secondary outcomes include the intensity of angina pain, consumption of nitroglycerin or Suxiao Jiuxin pills, CCS angina classification, SAQ, SAS and SDS score. Ethics. The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Sichuan Regional Ethics Review Committee on TCM (number 2013kl-001). This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov NCT02029118.

Methods and analysis: Electronic searches will be performed in the Cochrane Library, OVID, EMBASE, etc, along with manual searches in the reference lists of relevant papers found during electronic search. We will identify eligible randomised controlled trials utilising multiple lifestyle modifications to lower blood pressure. The control could be drug therapy, single lifestyle change or no intervention. Changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure constitute primary end points, and secondary end points include the number of patients meeting the office target blood pressure, the number of patients reporting microvascular or macrovascular complications, etc. We will extract descriptive, methodological and efficacy data from identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We will calculate the relative risk for proportion of patients with a normal blood pressure in the experimental group. Dichotomous data will be analysed using risk difference and continuous data using weighted mean differences, both with 95% CI. We will use the chi(2) test and the I-2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. We will use the fixed effects model to compute the efficacy unless there is evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity of effect size persists with respect to blood pressure change, further metaregression will be performed within groups. We will examine the potential for publication bias by using a funnel plot.

Previous studies have suggested roles for microRNA-21 (miR-21) and microRNA-126 (miR-126) in asthma, although these relationships are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to further assess the relationship between miR-21, miR-126 and the occurrence and treatment of allergic asthma. Quantitative real-time PCR analyzed expression levels of miR-21 and miR-126 in bronchial epidermal cells from asthma patients treated with (treatment group, n = 19) or without (non-treatment group, n = 16) inhaled corticosteroids or from non-asthmatic healthy individuals (normal group, n = 12). Bronchial epidermal cells were cultured in vitro to determine if there was a relationship between IL-13 and miR-21 and miR-126 expression. Compared to the normal group, miR-21 and miR-126 expression was significantly upregulated in asthma patients regardless of treatment. miR-21 and miR-126 expression was significantly higher in the non-treatment group than the treatment group (P < 0.05). In vitro, miR-21 and miR-126 expression increased in bronchial epidermal cells with increasing IL-13 concentration. Because upregulation of miR-126 and miR-21 were associated with occurrence and therapy of allergic asthma, they may be indices of therapeutic effect that are valuable for the evaluation for asthma treatment.

These symptoms are similar to the overactive bladder syndrome. In our lab, we found that the 95% ethanol extract of the capsular fruits exhibited significant anti-muscarinic activity. Some constituents in capsular fruits including flavonoids (e. g., izalpinin and tectochrysin), diarylheptanoids (e. g., yakuchinone A and yakuchinone B) and sesquiterpenes (e. g., nootkatone), are regarded as representative chemicals with putative pharmacological activities. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antagonistic actions of izalpinin on carbachol-induced contraction of the rat detrusor muscle. Materials and Methods: In vitro inhibition of rat detrusor contractile response to carbachol was used to study the functional activity of izalpinin. The isolated detrusor strips of rats were mounted in organ baths containing oxygenated Krebs' solution. The cumulative consecutive concentration-response curves to carbachol-evoked contractions in strips of rat bladder were obtained. Results: Carbachol induced concentration-dependent contractions of isolated rat bladder detrusor strips. The vehicle DMSO had no impact on the contraction response. The contraction effects were concentration-dependently antagonized by izalpinin, with a mean EC50 value of 0.35 mu M. The corresponding cumulative agonist concentration-response curves shifted right-ward. Conclusions: Izalpinin exhibits inhibitory role of muscarinic receptor-related detrusor contractile activity, and it may be a promising lead compound to treat overactive bladder.

Methods: Forty-one aMCI participants from hospital and local communities in Beijing and randomly divided into treatment (16 patients with CCRC capsule treatment), placebo (12 patients with placebo capsules) and control group (13 patients with no treatment). The duration of intervention lasted for 3 months. Neuropsychological tests and fMRI were applied to assess cognitive ability and brain activation changes after three months treatment. Results: Drug group (n=16) presented increased significance in the MMSE (P=0.008) and digit span (P<0.001) tests, while other scores of neuropsychological tests showed no statistical significance. fMRI results showed an increased brain negative activation in drug group during performing the n-back working-memory task in posterior cingulate (PCC), inferior frontal gyrus and lingual gyrus regions after 3 months; placebo and control group did not show the same effect. Meanwhile, there were negative correlations between left PCC activation levels and changed values of MMSE and digit span separately since increased negative activation was associated with better performance on the scores of MMSE and Digit Span tests. Conclusions: CCRC can increase negative activation degree of PCC under performing working memory tasks while this modulation are associated with better performance on the MMSE and Digit Span.

The data on this syndrome in a Chinese community are limited. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken. Cluster-randomized sampling was used. Female residents of Chengdu aged between 12 and 44 were included according to the constituent ratio of the female population of Sichuan province. We used three diagnostic criteria to determine the prevalence: the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria of PCOS (NIH-1990), the revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria of PCOS (Rott-2003), and the recommended diagnostic criteria of PCOS by the Androgen Excess Society (AES-2006). Results: 1,645 participants were included. The prevalence of PCOS in women aged between 12 and 44 was 7.1, 11.2 and 7.4%, respectively, according to the three different criteria. After the onset of puberty, the prevalence of PCOS increased rapidly from 12 to 14 years of age, peaked between 15 and 24 and decreased gradually thereafter and reached its lowest point before menopause. Conclusions: The prevalence of PCOS in this study was in the PCOS prevalence range from existing studies. According to the trend of prevalence, PCOS might be a temporary condition. (C) 2014 S.

However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture on symptoms and content of HSV-1 DNA in FNP mice. Mice were randomized into four groups, an electroacupuncture treatment group, saline group, model animal group, and blank control group. Electroacupuncture was applied at Jiache (ST6) and Hegu (LI4) in electroacupuncture group once daily for 14 days, while electroacupuncture was not applied in model animal group. In electroacupuncture group, mice recovered more rapidly and HSV-1 DNA content also decreased more rapidly, compared with model animal group. We conclude that electroacupuncture is effective to alleviate symptoms and promote the reduction of HSV-1 in FNP.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of large dosage of Chishao in formulae for treatment of cholestatic hepatitis. Methods. The major databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database Wanfang, VIP medicine information system, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched until January 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of large dosage of Chishao in formulae that reported on publications in treatment of cholestatic hepatitis with total efficacy rate, together with the biochemical indices including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), and direct bilirubin (DBIL), were extracted by two reviewers. The Cochrane tool was used for the assessment of risk of bias included trials. Data were analyzed with RevMan 5.2.7 software. Results. 11 RCTs involving 1275 subjects with cholestatic hepatitis were included. Compared with essential therapy, large dosage of Chishao in formulae demonstrated more efficiently with down regulation of serum ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL. Meanwhile, there were no obvious adverse events. Conclusion. As a promising novel treatment approach, widely using large dosage of Chishao in formulae may enhance the curative efficacy for cholestatic hepatitis. Considering being accepted by more and more practitioners, further rigorously designed clinical studies are required.

However, the molecular mechanisms of THSWD associated with the cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury are largely unknown. The current study applied the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics to investigate the different protein profiles in PC12 cells with and without the treatment of THSWD. Twenty-six proteins affected by THSWD were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Gene ontology analysis showed that those proteins participated in several important biological processes and exhibited diverse molecular functions. In particular, six of them were found to be phase II antioxidant enzymes, which were regulated by NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Quantitative PCR further confirmed a dose-dependent induction of the six phase II enzymes by THSWD at the transcription level. Moreover, the individual ingredients of THSWD were discovered to synergistically contribute to the induction of phase II enzymes. Importantly, THSWD's protection against oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-Rep) induced cell death was significantly attenuated by antioxidant response element (ARE) decoy oligonucleotides, suggesting the protection of THSWD may be likely regulated at least in part by Nrf2-mediated phase II enzymes. Thus, our data will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of THSWD.

Therefore, we have tried to compare functional dyspepsia (FD) patients with healthy subjects (HS) to determine the different cerebral responses elicited by acupuncture stimulation at Zusanli (ST36). Patients and Methods: In this study, 24 FD patients and 24 HS were given acupuncture stimulation at ST36 while being monitored by an fMRI scan. Results: Compared with HS, FD patients showed an fMRI signal decrease in the right anterior cingulate cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right orbitofrontal cortex, left superior occipital gyrus, and right cuneus; but on the other hand, there was an fMRI signal increase in the right insula, right postcentral gyrus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Conclusion: Acupuncture stimulation at ST36 evoked pronounced changes, especially in the homeostatic afferent processing network of FD patients, compared to HS. We hypothesize that the cerebral responses elicited by acupuncture stimulation in certain diseases, such as FD are correlated to specific regions. The action of stimulating acupoints might be dynamic; the functional status is therefore an essential impact factor for cerebral responses to acupuncture stimulation.

NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor regulating antioxidant and cytoprotective responses to oxidative stress, has received particular attention as a molecular target for pharmacological intervention of ischemic diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of PTS on the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and the potential role in its protective effect. We found that PTS induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in PC12 cells via activating Nrf2 signaling pathway. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt kinase was involved in the upstream of this PTS activated pathway. Moreover, combination of the main components in PTS significantly enhanced the expression of Nrf2 mediated phase II enzymes. Importantly, the protective effect of PTS against oxygen-glucose deprivationreperfusion (OGD-Rep) induced cell death was significantly attenuated by PI3K inhibitor and antioxidant response element (ARE) decoy oligonucleotides, suggesting that both PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 signaling pathway are essential during this protective process. Taken together, our results suggest that PTS may activate endogenous cytoprotective mechanism against OGD-Rep induced oxidative injury via the activation of PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 signaling pathway.

As a nonpharmacologic and free of relevant side effects intervention, moxibustion is considered as a safe treatment and has long been recommended for dysmenorrhea in China. However, the exact effects of moxibustion in PD have not been fully understood. Therefore we designed this random clinical trial aiming to (1) investigate whether moxibustion is safe and effective for pain relief in primary dysmenorrhea when compared to conventional pain-killers and (2) assess the acceptability and side effects associated with moxibustion. The results of this trial will contribute to a better understanding of the different effects of moxibustion in pain relief in primary dysmenorrhea when compared to conventional pharmacologic pain treatment.

The sample preparation procedure, chromatographic and mass spectrographic conditions were optimized. By using a Kinetex C18 100A column, the five compounds were separated within 8.0 min by gradient elution using methanol containing 0.1% acetic acid and 0.1% aqueous acetic acid. The precursor and product ions of the analytes were monitored on a hybrid quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray interface in negative ionization mode (ESI-) and were simultaneously characterized and quantified based on the multiple reaction monitoring-information-dependent acquisition-enhanced product ion (MRM-IDA-EPI) mode. All standard calibration curves expressed satisfactory linearity (r >= 0.9954) within a relatively wide range. The precision was evaluated by intra-and inter-day tests, which revealed relative standard deviation (RSD) values within the ranges of 1.15-4.56% and 0.81-3.95%, respectively. The recovery assays for the quantified compounds were between 97.33 and 100.4% with RSD values less than 4.27%. The proposed method was demonstrated to be simple, rapid, specific and reliable and was successfully applied for identification and quantification of 5 active compounds in 10 batches of licorice. The results showed that the contents of the 5 compounds in licorice from different sources were widely varied.

MESC 1B10 was used as the model cell. 1B10 was cultured, and embryoid bodies (EBs) were produced from 1B10. The EBs were allowed to attach to the bottoms of culturing disks and grow. OA was added into the medium to induce the EBs to differentiate. Retinoic acid (RA) was used as the positive drug. After 72 h, total RNA was extracted, cDNA was synthesized, and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was performed to measure the transcriptional expression profiles of 11 reproduction-related genes affected by OA and RA, respectively. When the data were compared, it was found that OA up-regulated the transcriptional levels of Oct-4, GDF-9, Stra8, Mvh, ZP2, ZP3, Itga6, and TP2, and down-regulated transcriptional levels of SCP3, ZP1, and Itgb1; RA up-regulated the transcriptional levels of GDF-9, Stra8, Mvh, ZP2, ZP3, Itga6, Itgb1, and TP2, and down-regulated the transcriptional levels of Oct-4, SCP3, and ZP1. The data showed that OA and RA had similar effects in inducing differentiation of MESC towards GC.

The compound is believed to act on a range of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. In this study, the effect of curcumin on ERK-1/2 pathway protein expression and on proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells was investigated. CNE-2Z nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells were cultured with 10, 20, 40, or 80 mu M curcumin for 24 h before proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetry. Cell proliferation was increasingly inhibited as the concentration of curcumin increased (P<0.005). Additionally, Western blotting revealed that expression of p-ERK-1/2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 was altered following curcumin treatment, also in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of p-ERK-1/2 and MMP-9 decreased, while expression of TIMP-1 increased (P<0.05). Finally, CNE-2Z cells were xenografted under the skin of 18 nude mice. Mice were treated with vehicle only (control), 24 mg/kg curcumin (low-dose group), or 50 mg/kg curcumin (high-dose group) every other day for 40 days beginning 24 h after xenografting. Compared to tumors from the control group, the volume and weight of xenograft tumors was significantly lower in both curcumin groups, with a higher magnitude of difference in the high-dose curcumin group (P<0.05). These results indicate that curcumin treatment can inhibit proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and alter expression of proteins in the ERK-1/2 signaling pathway. Therefore, curcumin warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.

We therefore investigated the effects of barbigerone on all three in the B16F10 tumor model established in both zebrafish and mouse models, and explored underlying molecular mechanisms. In vitro, barbigerone inhibited B16F10 cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion and suppressed human umbilical vascular endothelial cell migration, invasion and tube formation in concentration-dependent manners. In the transgenic zebrafish model, treatment with 10 mu M barbigerone remarkably inhibited angiogenesis and tumor-associated angiogenesis by reducing blood vessel development more than 90%. In vivo, barbigerone significantly suppressed angiogenesis as measured by H and E staining of matrigel plugs and CD31 staining of B16F10 melanoma tumors in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, it exhibited highly potent activity at inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis to the lung of B16F10 melanoma cells injected into C57BL/6 mice. Western blotting revealed that barbigerone inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, FAK and MAPK family members, including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, in B16F10 cells mainly through the MEK3/6/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These findings suggested for the first time that barbigerone could inhibit tumor-angiogenesis, tumor growth and lung metastasis via downregulation of the MEK3/6/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The findings support further investigation of barbigerone as a potential anti-cancer drug.

METHODS: A tandem, ultrasonic-homogenization-fluid bed drying technology was applied to prepare baicalin-nanocrystal dried powders, and the physicochemical properties of baicalin-nanocrystals were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, photon correlation spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, physical stability, and solubility experiments. Furthermore, in situ intestine single-pass perfusion experiments and pharmacokinetics in rats were performed to make a comparison between the microcrystals of baicalin and pure baicalin in their absorption properties and bioavailability in vivo. RESULTS: The mean particle size of baicalin-nanocrystals was 236 nm, with a polydispersity index of 0.173, and a zeta potential value of -34.8 mV, which provided a guarantee for the stability of the reconstituted nanosuspension. X-Ray diffraction results indicated that the crystallinity of baicalin was decreased through the ultrasonic-homogenization process. Physical stability experiments showed that the prepared baicalin-nanocrystals were sufficiently stable. It was shown that the solubility of baicalin in the form of nanocrystals, at 495 mu g.mL(-1), was much higher than the baicalin-microcrystals and the physical mixture (135 and 86.4 mu g.mL(-1), respectively). In situ intestine perfusion experiments demonstrated a clear advantage in the dissolution and absorption characteristics for baicalin-nanocrystals compared to the other formulations. In addition, after oral administration to rats, the particle size decrease from the micron to nanometer range exhibited much higher in vivo bioavailability (with the AUC((0-t)) value of 206.96 +/- 21.23 and 127.95 +/- 14.41 mg.L-1.h(-1), respectively). CONCLUSION: The nanocrystal drug delivery system using an ultrasonic-homogenization-fluid bed drying process is able to improve the absorption and in vivo bioavailability of baicalin, compared with pure baicalin coarse powder and micronized baicalin.

Nowadays, acupuncture is gradually accepted as an alternative and complementary method in western countries for its undeniable therapeutic effects. However, its central mechanism is still unclear. It is especially difficult to reveal how different regions in the brain influence one another and how the relationship is among these regions responding to acupuncture treatment. Recently, by applying neuroimaging techniques and network theory, acupuncture studies can make further efforts to investigate the influence of acupuncture on regional cerebral functional connectivity (FC) and themodulation on "acupuncture-related" networks. Connectomics appears to be a new direction in research to further understand the central mechanism underlying acupuncture. In this paper, an overview of connectomics application in acupuncture research will be discussed, with special emphasis on present findings of acupuncture and its influence on cerebral FC. Firstly, the connectomics concept and its significance on acupuncture will be outlined. Secondly, the commonly used brain imaging techniques will be briefly introduced. Thirdly, the influence of acupuncture on FC will be discussed in greater detail. Finally, the possible direction in forthcoming research will be reviewed by analyzing the limitation of present studies.

Development of non-deqi control is still a challenge. This study aims to set up a potential approach to non-deqi control by using lidocaine anesthesia at ST36. Methods. Forty healthy volunteers were recruited and they received two fMRI scans. One was accompanied with manual acupuncture at ST36 (DQ group), and another was associated with both local anesthesia and manual acupuncture at the same acupoint (LA group). Results. Comparing to DQ group, more than 90 percent deqi sensations were reduced by local anesthesia in LA group. The mainly activated regions in DQ group were bilateral IFG, S1, primary motor cortex, IPL, thalamus, insula, claustrum, cingulate gyrus, putamen, superior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. Surprisingly only cerebellum showed significant activation in LA group. Compared to the two groups, bilateral S1, insula, ipsilateral IFG, IPL, claustrum, and contralateral ACC were remarkably activated. Conclusions. Local anesthesia at ST36 is able to block most of the deqi feelings and inhibit brain responses to deqi, which would be developed into a potential approach for non-deqi control. Bilateral S1, insula, ipsilateral IFG, IPL, claustrum, and contralateral ACC might be the key brain regions responding to deqi.

The synthesized intermediates and final products were characterized and confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (H-1 NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR). The paclitaxel- (PTX-) loaded liposomes based on RGD-PEG-Chol were then prepared by film formation method. The liposomes had a size within 100 nm and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel to B16F10 cell as demonstrated by MTT test (IC50 = 0.079 mu g/mL of RGD-modified PTX-loaded liposomes compared to 9.57 mu g/mL of free PTX). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cellular uptake of coumarin encapsulated in the RGD-PEG-Chol modified liposome was increased for HUVEC cells. This work provides a reasonable, facile, and economic approach to prepare peptide-modified liposome materials with controllable performances and the obtained linear RGD-modified PTX-loaded liposomes might be attractive as a drug delivery system.

Its toxicity and processed products should be taken into account and effectively evaluated. In this study, a non-invasive and non-destructive microcalorimetric method was employed to evaluate and compare the toxicity of Fuzi and its three processed products including Yanfupian, Heifupian, and Danfupian on Escherichia coli (E. coli). Some important metabolic information, such as the power-time curves and some quantitative thermokinetic parameters including growth rate constant k, heat output power P, inhibitory ratio I, and half inhibitory concentration IC50, of E. coli growth affected by various concentrations of Fuzi and its processed products were obtained. Combined with chemometric techniques including multivariate analysis of variance and principal component analysis on this information, it could be seen that Fuzi and its processed products could be distinguished according to their toxic effects on E. coli. The IC50 values of 14.6 mg/mL for Fuzi, 59.2 mg/mL for Yanfupian, 118.3 mg/mL for Heifupian, and 182.7 mg/mL for Danfupian illustrated that the sequence of toxicity on E. coli was Fuzi > Yanfupian > Heifupian > Danfupian. This study provided a useful method and idea of the combination of microcalorimetry and chemometrics for studying the toxic effects of TCMs and other substances.

SUPPRESSION OF OUTWARD K+ CURRENTS BY WIN55212-2 IN RAT RETINAL GANGLION CELLS IS INDEPENDENT OF CB1/CB2 RECEPTORS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cannabinoid receptor; CB1/CB2 receptor agonist; TEA-sensitive K+ current; anandamide; patch-clamp	CB1 CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS; ION CHANNELS; MEDIATED INHIBITION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; DELAYED RECTIFIER; GLYCINE CURRENTS; CALCIUM INFLUX; MESSENGER-RNA	Cannabinoid CBI receptor (CB1R) signaling system is extensively distributed in the vertebrate retina. Activation of CB1Rs regulates a variety of functions of retinal neurons through modulating different ion channels. In the present work we studied effects of this receptor signaling on K+ channels in retinal ganglion cells by patch-clamp techniques. The CB1R agonist WIN55212-2 (WIN) suppressed outward K+ currents in acutely isolated rat retinal ganglion cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 4.7 mu M. We further showed that WIN mainly suppressed the tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive K+ current component. While CB1Rs were expressed in rat retinal ganglion cells, the WIN effect on K+ currents was not blocked by either AM2511SR141716, specific CB1R antagonists, or AM630, a selective CB2R antagonist. Consistently, cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways were unlikely involved in the WIN-induced suppression of the K+ currents because both PKA inhibitors H-89/Rp-CAMP and MAPKIERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 failed to block the WIN effects. WIN-induced suppression of the K+ currents was not observed when WIN was intracellularly applied. Furthermore, an endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid receptor anandamide, the specific CB1R agonist ACEA and the selective CB2R agonist CB65 also suppressed the K+ currents, and the effects were not blocked by AM251/SR141716 or AM630 respectively. All these results suggest that the WIN-induced suppression of the outward K+ currents in rat retinal ganglion cells, thereby regulating the cell excitability, were not through CB1R/CB2R signaling pathways.

Optimized voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistical analyses were used to evaluate changes in GM and WM by using 3-dimensional T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging, respectively. At the 1-year follow-up examination, GM reduction was observed in the dorsolateral and medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, precuneus, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. No significant differences were found in the fractional anisotropy and longitudinal, radial, and mean diffusivity of WM in migraine patients without aura within a year. Negative results were found for the association between changes in headache activity parameters and GM. Our results indicated that the GM and WM changed in different pathophysiological conditions of migraine patients without aura. The WM probably evolves slowly in the course of migraine chronicity.

A simple, sensitive, and reproducible method based on immunoaffinity column clean-up coupled with HPLC and on-line postcolumn photochemical derivatization with fluorescence detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins (AFs) B-1, B-2, G(1), G(2), and ochratoxin A (OTA) in 25 batches of gingers and related products marketed in China for the first time. The samples were first extracted by ultrasonication with methanol/water (80:20, v/v) and then cleaned up with immunoaffinity columns for analysis. Under the optimized conditions, the LODs and LOQs for the five mycotoxins were 0.03-0.3 and 0.1-0.9 g/kg, respectively. The average recoveries ranged from 81.3-100.8% for AFs and from 88.6-99.5% for OTA at three spiking levels. Good linearity was observed for the analytes with correlation coefficients all >0.9995. All moldy gingers were contaminated with at least one kind of the five investigated mycotoxins, while none of them were found in normal gingers. Ginger powder samples were contaminated slightly with the contamination levels below the LOQs, while ginger tea bags were mainly contaminated by OTA at 1.05-1.19g/kg and ginger black tea bags were mainly contaminated by AFs at 3.37-5.76g/kg. All the contamination levels were below the legally allowable limits.

However, whether acupuncture is efficacious for hypertension is still controversial. Therefore, this trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for patients with mild hypertension. Methods/Design: This is a large scale, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial with four parallel arms. We will recruit 428 hypertensive patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 159 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 90 and 99 mmHg. The participants will be randomly assigned to four different groups (three acupuncture groups and one waiting list group) (1). The affected meridian acupuncture group (n = 107) is treated with acupoints on the affected meridians (2). The non-affected meridian acupuncture group (n = 107) is treated with acupoints on the non-affected meridians (3). The invasive sham acupuncture group (n = 107) is provided with sham acupoints treatment (4). The waiting-list group (n = 107) is not offered any intervention until they complete the trial. Each patient allocated to acupuncture groups will receive 18 sessions of acupuncture treatment over 6 weeks. This trial will be conducted in 11 hospitals in China. The primary endpoint is the change in average 24-hSBP before and 6 weeks after randomization. The secondary endpoints are average SBP and average DBP during the daytime and night-time, and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and so on. Discussion: This is the first large scale, multicenter, randomized, sham controlled trial of acupuncture for essential hypertension in China. It may clarify the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for mild hypertension.

Some quantitative information, such as k, P-max etc. was obtained from the HFP-time curves. The results revealed that crude Radix Aconiti Lateralis and Yanfuzi had inhibitory effect on mice splenic lymphocytes growth: crude Radix Aconiti Lateralis with IC50 of 18 mg mL(-1) showed stronger inhibitory effect than Yanfuzi with IC50 of 32 mg mL(-1). Danfupian and Baifupian promoted splenic lymphocytes growth: Baifupian with EC50 of 25 mg mL(-1) showed a little stronger promotion effect than Danfupian with EC50 of 28 mg mL(-1). The result may be related to their toxicity and we could evaluate different bioeffects of crude Radix Aconiti Lateralis and its processed products on splenic lymphocytes growth from microcalorimetric measurement.

Nanosuspensions were prepared by high pressure homogenization and then transformed into ODF containing drug nanoparticles by mixing with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution containing microcrystalline cellulose, low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose and PEG-400 followed by film casting and drying. Herpetrione, a novel and potent antiviral agent with poor water solubility that extracted from Herpetospermum caudigerum, was chosen as a model drug and studied systematically. The uniformity of dosage units of the preparation was acceptable according to the criteria of Japanese Pharmacopoeia 15. The ODF was disintegrated in water within 30 s with reconstituted nanosuspensions particle size of 280 +/- 11 nm, which was similar to that of drug nanosuspensions, indicating a good redispersibility of the fast dissolving film. Result of X-ray diffraction showed that HPE in the ODF was in the amorphous state. In the in vitro dissolution test, the ODF containing HPE nanoparticles showed an increased dissolution velocity markedly. In the pharmacokinetics study in rats, compared to HPE coarse suspensions, the ODF containing HPE nanoparticles exhibited significant increase in AUC(0-24h), C-max and decrease in T-max, MRT. The result revealed that the ODF containing drug nanoparticles may provide a potential opportunity in transforming drug nanosuspensions into a solid dosage form as well as enhancing the dissolution rate and oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs.

This plate-based assay was also used for screening against complex matrices, specifically, in the present study screening for CB1/CB2 receptor activity of extracts for several species of the plant genus Zanthoxylum. The objective of this screen was to identify novel antagonists of the 031 receptor, which simultaneously displayed agonist activity against the CB2 receptor, since compounds matching this criterion could be potential candidates for the treatment of type-1 diabetes. As a result, two Z. bungeanum extracts were deemed active, leading to the identification of eight compounds, of which compound 7 [(2E,4E,8E,10E,12E)-N-isobutyl-2,4,8,10,12-tetradecapentaenamide, gamma-sanshool] was obtained as a promising lead compound.

The novel gene encodes a protein of 382 amino acid residues with close homology to fatty acid thioesterase type B (FATB) enzymes of other plants, with two essential residues (His285 and Cys320) for thioesterase catalytic activity. The gene was transcribed in all tissues of C. longepaniculatum, the highest being in seeds. Recombinant ClFATB1 in Escherichia coli had higher specific activities against saturated 16:0- and 18:0-ACPs than on unsaturated 18:1-ACP. Overexpression of ClFATB1 in transgenic tobaccos upregulated thioesterase activities of crude proteins against 16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP by 20.3 and 5.7%, respectively, and resulted in an increase in the contents of palmitic and stearic acids by 15.4 and 10.5%, respectively. However, ectopic expression of this gene decreased the substrate specificities of crude proteins to unsaturated 18:1-ACP by 12.7% in transgenic tobacco and lowered the contents of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids in transgenic leaves. So ClFATB1 would potentially upregulate the synthesis of saturated fatty acids and downregulate unsaturated ones in the fatty acid synthesis pathway of plants.

Because the clinical efficacy is closely related to the quality of medicines, the implementation of an effective quality control (QC) process is vital. Chemical methods based on content determination and chromatographic fingerprints (CFs) have been recommended as powerful tools. In spite of advances in QC, it is still difficult to determine that which of the chemical compositions can best reflect the correlation with the desired biological activity. Herein, we have focused on the biological activities of multi-source herbal medicines to establish an analytical method. By looking for correlations between the biological activities and their chemical compositions, the method can identify reasonable chemical indicators or chemical methods with biological activity information. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microcalorimetry are combined as a useful method for evaluating the quality of Rhizoma coptidis from different sources. The results of biological fingerprints (BFs) showed that the antibacterial activity sequence of R. coptidis of different sources was Coptis teeta Wall. (CT)> Coptis chinensis Franch. (CC)> Coptis deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao (CD). The "spectrum-activity" relationships between CFs and BFs were investigated using the canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Compared with the CCA result of CFs and BFs, the canonical correlation coefficient r (1) and r (2) were 0.9974 and 0.9752, respectively. It revealed that there are a close correlation between the spectrum-activity relationships and several of the major anti-bacterial components in the CFs, including jatrorrhizine, coptisine, palmatine, and berberine. Of course, R. coptidis was only a representative of multi-source medical plants. The result of the current study will provide an effective reference for evaluating the quality of multi-source herbal medicines.

(Polygonaceae), but is also detected in grape, peanut, hop cones, red wines, hop pellets, cocoa-containing products, chocolate products and many daily diets. There are numerous investigations reported of PD in the past 22 years, but they are usually scattered across various publications, which may block further research and clinical use of PD. Objective: The article summarizes and evaluates the published scientific information of PD pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics since 1990. Materials and methods: The information from 98 cases included in this review was compiled using major databases such as MEDLINE, Elsevier, Springer, PubMed, Scholar and CNKI. Results: Numerous pharmacological investigations of PD mainly focus on cardiovascular effects, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, liver and lung protection, etc. Conclusion: A great number of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic investigations in the past 22 years have demonstrated that PD has favorable therapeutic properties, indicating its potential as an effective material. However, further research is needed to explore its molecular mechanisms of action and definitive target proteins.

The aim of the current study was to explore the possible mechanisms underlying this effect. Following OVX, 37 Sprague Dawley female rats were randomly divided into three groups which were orally administered with YGW decoction, saline or estrogen for 11 weeks. In parallel with this, 19 normal and 17 rats with sham-surgery were used as controls. The effects of these treatments on estrogen receptors (ER) and various angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), angiopoietin (Ang) 1 and 2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the vagina were compared using immunohistochemistry or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). OVX was found to induce significant vaginal atrophy and decrease the expression of ER and various angiogenic factors when compared with the normal and sham-surgery animals (all P<0.05). Estrogen replacement and the administration of YGW decoction reversed the vaginal atrophic process. The hormonal replacement and YGW treatment recovered the protein expression of ER-alpha and -beta, VEGF and VEGFR-1 and the mRNA levels of ER-alpha, VEGF, VEGFR-1, Ang1 and 2, and bFGF when compared with OVX-rats with saline, normal and sham-surgery treatments (all P<0.05). Thus, it may be concluded that a possible mechanism underlying the effect of YGW on OVX-induced vaginal atrophy may be the upregulated expression of ER and various angiogenic factors in the vaginal tissue.

However, most diseases are chronic and tend to recur, so the long-term effect of acupuncture can verify the existence of sustained efficacy or the placebo effect. Evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the prophylaxis of migraine without aura (MWoA) in China is also important because such studies are lacking. Methods: This trial is a multicenter, prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial. We will randomly allocate 249 participants to three groups of 83. Patients in the individualized acupoint group will be treated with individualized acupuncture point prescriptions. The non-acupoint control group will undergo insertion of acupuncture needles at four bilateral non-points in locations not corresponding to acupuncture points. The waiting-list control group will not undergo treatment but instead will receive 20 acupuncture treatments for free after a waiting period of 24 weeks. Participants in the individualized acupoint group and non-acupoint control group will receive 20 sessions over four weeks and then all participants will receive 20 weeks of follow-up. Discussion: The results of our trial will help to supply evidence for the long-term acupuncture effect for MWoA in a long follow-up period, and special attention will be paid to comparison with the placebo effect.

This study aims to examine resting-state abnormalities in migraine without aura (MWoA) patients stratified by disease duration, and to explore the neuroimaging markers for reflecting the disease duration. 40 eligible MWoA patients and 20 matched healthy volunteers were included in the study. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis was used to identify the local features of spontaneous brain activity in MWoA patients stratified by disease duration, and analysis was performed to investigate the correlation of overlapped brain dysfunction in MWoA patients with different disease duration (long-term and short-term) and course of disease. Compared with healthy controls, MWoA patients with long-term disease duration showed comprehensive neuronal dysfunction than patients with short-term disease duration. In addition, increased average ReHo values in the thalamus, brain stem, and temporal pole showed significantly positive correlations with the disease duration. On the contrary, ReHo values were negatively correlated with the duration of disease in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, posterior cingulate cortex and superior occipital gyrus. Our findings of progressive brain damage in relation to increasing disease duration suggest that migraine without aura is a progressive central nervous disease, and the length of the disease duration was one of the key reasons to cause brain dysfunction in MwoA patients. The repeated migraine attacks over time result in resting-state abnormalities of selective brain regions belonging to the pain processing and cognition. We predict that these brain regions are sensitive neuroimaging markers for reflecting the disease duration of migraine patients without aura.

A reliable and sensitive method has been developed to determine seven mycotoxins (aflatoxins B-1, B-2, G(1), G(2), zearalenone, alpha-zearalenol, and beta-zearalenol) simultaneously in 10 batches of Coix seed marketed in China. The method is based on a rapid ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction (USLE) using methanol/water (80/20) followed by immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up, on-line photochemical derivatization (PCD), and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). Careful optimization of extraction, clean-up, separation and detection conditions was accomplished to increase sample throughput and to attain rapid separation and sensitive detection. Method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at three different concentrations for the seven mycotoxins. Recoveries were from 73.5% to 107.3%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 7.7%. The intra-and inter-day precisions, expressed as RSDs, were lower than 4% for all studied analytes. Limits of detection and quantification ranged from 0.01 to 50.2 mu g kg(-1), and from 0.04 to 125.5 mu g kg(-1), respectively, which were below the tolerance levels for mycotoxins set by the European Union. Samples that tested positive were further analyzed by HPLC tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for confirmatory purposes. This is the first application of USLE-IAC-HPLC-PCD-FLD for detecting the occurrence of multi-class mycotoxins in Coix seed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, few studies investigated resting state abnormalities affected by depressive symptoms in migraine patients without aura (MWoA). Materials and Methods: According to their self-rating depression scale (SDS) score, MWoA were divided into twenty in the SDS (+) (SDS > 49) group and 20 in the SDS (-) (SDS <= 49) group. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) method were employed to assess local features of spontaneous brain activity between 1) all MWoA and healthy controls, 2) each subgroup and healthy controls, and 3) SDS (-) group and SDS (+) group. Results: Compared with healthy controls, decreased ReHo in similar regions were shown in the MWoA group and subgroups. It is noteworthy that the caudate showed increased ReHo in the SDS (-) group compared with healthy controls and the SDS (+) group. Moreover, the average ReHo values of the caudate in SDS (-) group were significantly positively correlated with duration of migraine. Conclusions: Our results suggested that ReHo patterns in migraine patients may be affected by depressive symptoms and serve as a biomarker to reflect depression severity in MWoA.

Recently, a series of potent and specific small-molecule spiro-oxindole inhibitors of the MDM2 were reported. In the current study, the interaction modes between 21 spiro-oxindole MDM2 inhibitors and the protein were studied by using the combination of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships (3D-QSAR). The QSAR predictive models were established by using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) techniques. The predictive power of the 3D-QSAR models were determined from external test sets that were excluded during model development. The inhibitors in test sets were given exactly the same pretreatment as the inhibitors in the corresponding training sets. The correlation between the experimental and predicted activity for all models was calculated as a predictive r(2) value. With the CoMFA model, the cross-validated value (q(2)) was 0.573, the non-cross-validated value (r(2)) was 0.948. And with the CoMSIA model, the corresponding q(2) and r(2) were 0.651 and 0.98, respectively. The interaction mode obtained by molecular docking was in agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction mode revealed that the hydrophobic interaction and H-bond played an important role in the binding of spiro-oxindole derivatives and MDM2. Compounds designed by our group were synthesized and tested their in vitro cytotoxic activities against the MDM2 positive prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cell line. Two compounds, namely 5 and 6, with favorable scores from the CoMFA and CoMSIA models, showed potent cytotoxic activities with IC50 values lower than 1.0 mu g.mL(-1). The result was corresponding with that in experiment. And it was very significance to discover novel spiro-oxindole inhibitors which are mainly aimed at the MDM2-p53 interaction. It was expected that the information provided here was helpful for the study toward more accurate structure based on 3D-QSAR modeling and anti-tumor drug design and discovery.

METHODS: The studies concerning TCM courses designed with CBL were included by searching the databases of EBSCO, Pubmed, Science Citation Index, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP database. The valid data was extracted in accordance with the included criteria. The quality of the studies was assessed with Gemma Flores-Masteo. RESULTS: A total of 22 articles were retrieved that met the selection criteria: one was of high quality; two were of low quality; the rest were categorized as moderate quality. The majority of the studies demonstrated the better effect produced by CBL, while a few studies showed no difference, compared with the didactic format. All included studies confirmed the favorable effect on learners' attitude, skills and ability. CONCLUSION: CBL showed the desirable results in achieving the goal of learning. Compared to didactic approach, it played a more active role in promoting students' competency. Since the quality of the articles on which the study was based was not so high, the findings still need further research to become substantiated. (C) 2013 JTCM. All rights reserved.

Here, employing the diffusion tensor imaging and graph theory approaches to construct white matter networks in 26 patients with migraine (PM) and 26 gender-matched healthy controls (HC), we investigated relationships between structural connectivity, cortical network architecture and anatomical distance in the two groups separately. Compared with the HC group, the patients showed longer global distance connection in PM, with proportionally less short-distance and more medium-distance; correspondingly, the patients showed abnormal global topology in their structural networks, mainly presented as a higher clustering coefficient. Moreover, the abnormal association between these two network features was also found. Intriguingly, the network measure that combined the nodal anatomical distance and network topology could distinguish PM from HC with high accuracy of 90.4%. We also demonstrated a high reproducibility of our findings across different parcellation schemes. Our results demonstrated that long-term migraine may result in a abnormal optimization of a trade-off between wiring cost and network topology in white matter structural networks and highlights the potential for combining spatial and topological aspects as a network marker, which may provide valuable insights into the understanding of brain network reorganization that could be attributed to the underlying pathophysiology resulting from migraine.

However, the central analgesic mechanism remains poorly understood. Studies have demonstrated that single stimulus of the verum acupuncture in healthy subjects can induce significant connectivity or activity changes in pain-related central networks compared with sham acupuncture. However, these findings are not indicative of the central analgesic mechanism of acupuncture at Shaoyang acupoints. Thus, we recruited 100 migraine sufferers and randomly assigned them into five groups: Shaoyang uncommon acupoint, Shaoyang common acupoint, Yangming uncommon acupoint, non-acupoint control, and blank control groups. Subjects were subjected to evaluation of curative effects and functional MRI prior to and after 10 and 20 acupuncture treatments. All subjects were diagnosed by physicians and enrolled following clinical physical examination. Subjects were observed during 1-4 weeks after inclusion. At the fifth week, the first clinical evaluation and resting functional MRI were conducted. The Shaoyang uncommon acupoint, Shaoyang common acupoint, Yangming uncommon acupoint, and non-acupoint control grousp then were treated with acupuncture, five times per week, 20 times in total over 4 weeks. The second and third clinical evaluations and resting functional MRI screenings were conducted following 10 and 20 acupuncture treatments. The blank control group was observed during the 5 to 8 week period, followed by clinical evaluation and resting functional MRI. The aim of this study was to examine changes in brain functional activity and central networks in subjects with migraine undergoing acupuncture at Shaoyang uncommon acupoints. This study provides a further explanation of the central analgesic mechanism by which acupuncture at Shaoyang acupoints treats migraine.

In the current study, a combination of structure-based pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR methods are used to clarify the essential quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of known CrtM inhibitors; the multicomplex-based pharmacophore (MCBP) guided method has been suggested to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of CrtM based on twenty crystal structures of CrtM inhibitor complex. Performances of the MCBP-based virtual screening approach were applied to screen specs chemical databases (202, 408 compounds). Thirty-eight compounds were selected from the final hits and should be shifted to experimental studies. The MCBP model has been successfully used to identify the bioactive conformation and align 24 structurally diverse CrtM inhibitors. The QSAR analyses have been performed on these CrtM inhibitors based on MCBP guided alignment. These results may provide important information for further design and discovery of novel CrtM inhibitors.

As seropharmacology possesses the advantages of experiments in vitro and in vivo, it is increasingly applied in pharmacological research on Chinese medicine. However, some issues of seropharmacology remain controversial and need to be clearly defined. San Huang Yi Gan Capsule (SHYGC) is a Chinese herbal formula with antiviral property against hepatitis B virus (HBV), but little is known about the mechanism underlying its anti-HBV activity. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the action mechanism of SHYGC using seropharmacological method and systematically address the methodology of preparing drug-containing serum. Methods: New Zealand rabbits were orally administrated SHYGC with various regimens, followed by preparation of SHYGC-containing rabbit sera with a variety of methods. After HBV-producing HepG2 2.2.15 cells were treated with SHYGC-containing sera or entecavir for 9 days, the levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA and the activity of DNA Polymerase were determined in HepG2 2.2.15 cells-conditioned media. Results: An optimally standardized method of preparing drug-containing serum was raised for seropharmacology, with which SHYGC was demonstrated to suppress HBsAg expression, HBV DNA replication and DNA Polymerase activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Conclusions: This seropharmacological study shows SHYGC is a potentially powerful anti-HBV agent. Additionally, seropharmacology is a promising pharmacological method with a broad range of advantages, and it can be widely used in biomedical research, if combined with pharmacokinetics.

Cinnamomum cassia barks, known as Chinese cinnamon or Chinese cassia, is one of the most popular natural spices and flavoring agents in many parts of the World. Since previous reports indicated that Chinese cinnamon extract could be used for the treatment of diabetes, we proposed that this spice may be beneficial for the prevention of DN. However, the responsible compounds need to be further identified. In this study, we isolated three new phenolic glycosides, cinnacassosides A-C (1-3), together with fifteen known compounds from the water soluble extract of Chinese cinnamon. The structures of the new compounds were identified by comprehensive spectroscopic evidence. Eleven compounds (6-9, 11, 13-18) were isolated from this spice for the first time, despite extensive research on this species in the past, which added new facets for the chemical profiling of this spice. These isolates were purposely evaluated for their inhibitory effects on IL-6 and extracellular matrix production in mesangial cells which are definitely implicated in DN. The results showed that compounds 4-8 could inhibit over secretion of IL-6, collagen IV and fibronectin against high-glucose-induced mesangial cells at 10 mu M, suggesting that Chinese cinnamon could be used as a functional food against DN.

Pericarpium citri reticulatae viride and Pericarpium citri reticulatae were collected once a month during July-December in 2011 from the identical area and the cultivar as Citrus reticulata Dahongpao of C. reticulata blanco. The oil components were identified by their purified mass spectra and Kovats retention indices (RIs). A total of 67, 77, 66, 51, 46 and 59 compounds representing 89.856, 92.151, 97.881, 97.738, 97.229 and 97.897 % of their total relative contents, respectively in the oils of Pericarpium citri reticulatae viride and Pericarpium citri reticulatae were discerned. The oils from Pericarpium citri reticulatae viride and Pericarpium citri reticulatae varied considerably both qualitatively and quantitatively. Chemical changeability of six samples differed with each other, to a degree. The chemotype as D-limonene/gamma-terpinene/linalool (55.111-77.659 %/6.579-7.841 %/1.197-7.773 %) was differentiated for essential oils of Pericarpium citri reticulatae viride and Pericarpium citri reticulatae from C. reticulata Dahongpao. The study manifests automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system can efficiently enhance the accuracy of quantitative and qualitative analyses by extracting information from chromatograms and mass spectra. The results have some meanings to clarify the similarities and differences in bioactive compounds as volatile oils of Pericarpium citri reticulatae viride and Pericarpium citri reticulatae and to expound the scientific essence of one material used as two kinds of Chinese materia medica such as Pericarpium citri reticulatae viride and Pericarpium citri reticulatae in the end.

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that JiuHuangLian (JHL, Rhizoma Coptidis steamed with rice wine) is an effective agent on diabetes treatment. In present study, we evaluated the antioxidant and lightening beta-cell injury of JHL in streptozotocin and a high-glucose/high-fat diet-induced diabetic rats. After 30 days treatment with JHL, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance of diabetic rats were improved significantly. JHL also could decrease fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, increase insulin level and insulin sensitivity index. Moreover, lipid metabolism disorder also adjusted, which manifested as decreased total cholesterol, total glyceride and free fatty acid levels. Meanwhile, a significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content were observed in JHL treated rats, oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide also were decreased by JHL treatment. Furthermore, low expression of caspase-3 were shown in pancreatic immunohistochemistry of JHL treated rats, which exhibited anti-apoptosis effect of beta-cell. The histological evidence suggests that JHL effectively rescues the islet atrophied from oxidative stress-mediated beta-cell damage. These findings demonstrate the beta-cell functional protective nature of JHL by attenuating oxidative stress and inhibiting beta-cell damage. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

And some research results have been accepted in Chinese Pharmacopeia. In a recent study, phillygenin was found to be a potential "metabolite" of phillyrin and the effective material of phillyrin may be changed according to the in vivo pharmacokinetic process. Therefore, a sensitive, specific, accurate, and reproducible reversed phase HPLC method for the determination of phillygenin in rat plasma was developed. Separation was achieved on a Hypersil ODS C-18 column with UV detection at 277 nm. The good linear calibration curves ranged from 0.039 to 20 mu g/mL with the limit of quantification estimated as 0.026 mu g/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions were in the range of 98-103 %. The average recoveries of phillygenin were 90.54, 92.47, and 92.15 % for phillygenin of 0.156, 1.25, and 10.0 mu g/mL. And the Ruggedness of HPLC method was evaluated. The analytical method was also successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of phillygenin in rat for the first time. A rapid distribution was observed from the plasma concentration-time curves, and was followed by a quick elimination for phillygenin. The mean t (1/2z) was 6.02, 5.62, and 5.79 min for 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 mg/kg, respectively. The AUC ((0-t)) increased linearly from 166.29 to 332.48 mg/L min. All results indicated that, in the range of the doses examined, the pharmacokinetics of phillygenin in rat was based on first-order kinetics.

Although a large amount of scientific research has been reported on plants as a natural source of treatment agents for cervical cancer, it is currently scattered across various publications. A systematic summary and knowledge of future prospects are necessary to facilitate further plant studies for anti-cervical cancer agents. Areas covered: This review generalizes and analyzes the current knowledge on the anti-cervical cancer properties and mechanisms involved for plants, and discusses the future prospects for the application of these plants. Expert opinion: This review mainly focuses on the plants which have been scientifically tested in vitro and/or in vivo and proved as potential agents for the treatment of cervical cancer. The failure of conventional chemotherapy to reduce mortality as well as serious side effects involved makes natural products ideal candidates for exerting synergism and attenuation effects on anticancer drugs. Although the chemical components and mechanisms of action of natural plants with anti-cervical cancer potential have been investigated, many others remain unknown. More investigations and clinical trials are necessary to make use of these medical plants reasonably.

Eighteen MwoA patients and 18 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited in the current study. Baseline cerebral alterations were investigated using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity (FC) analyses. Compared with HC, MwoA patients showed decreased ALFF values in the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as increased ALFF values in the right thalamus. FC analysis also revealed abnormal FCs associated with these ROIs. In addition, ALFF values of the left rACC correlated with duration of disease in MwoA. Our findings could lead to a better understanding of intrinsic functional architecture of baseline brain activity in MwoA, providing both regional and brain circuit spontaneous neuronal activity properties.

However, few studies have investigated white matter (WM) integrity affected by depressive symptoms in patients suffering from migraine without aura (MWoA). Forty patients with MWoA were divided into two groups according to their self-rating depression scale (SDS) score in the present study, including 20 in the SDS (+) (SDS>49) group and 20 in the SDS (-) (SDS49) group. Forty healthy participants were also recruited as the control group. Tract-based spatial statistics analyses with multiple diffusion tensor imaging-derived indices [fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD)] were employed collectively to investigate WM integrity between all patients with MWoA and all healthy controls, between each subgroup (SDS (-) group and SDS (+) group) and healthy controls, and between the SDS (-) and SDS (+) groups. Compared with healthy controls, decreased AD was shown in several WM tracts of the whole MWoA group, SDS (-) group and SDS (+) group. In addition, compared with the SDS (-) group, the SDS (+) group showed decreased FA and increased MD and RD, with conserved AD, including the genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, the right anterior corona radiata and some other WM tracts, similar to previous findings in depression disorder. Furthermore, mean FA and RD in some of the above-mentioned WM tracts in the SDS (+) group were correlated significantly with SDS scores, including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, the right anterior corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculi. Our results suggest that WM integrity may be affected by both depression symptoms (more sensitive as RD) and migraine (more sensitive as AD). The findings may serve as a sensitive biomarker of depression severity in MWoA. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

METHODS: A rat model of airway inflammation was generated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Tanreqing injection was given by intratracheal instillation, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the right lung was collected. BALE total cell and neutrophil counts were then determined. In addition, BALE levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta, cytokine-induced neutrophil chennoattractant-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The middle lobe of the right lung was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and histological changes examined. RESULTS: LPS increased airway inflammation, decreased BALF inflammatory cell count, inflammatory cytokine levels, and suppressed leukocyte influx of the lung. The LPS-induced airway inflammation peaked at 24 h, decreased beginning at 48 h, and had decreased markedly by 96 h. CONCLUSION: Tanreqing injection contains anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibits airway inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. (C) 2013 JTCM. All rights reserved.

In this study, the multicomplex-based pharmacophore (MCBP)-guided method was used to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of PKM2 kinase based on a collection of crystal structures of PKM2-activator complex. This model was successfully used to identify the bioactive conformation and align 62 structurally diverse aryl-sulfamide derivatives. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses were performed on these PKM2 activators based on MCBP-guided alignment. With the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model, the cross-validated value (q(2)) was 0.545, and the non-cross-validated value (r(2)) was 0.966. With the comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) model, q(2) and r(2) were 0.653 and 0.987. These results may provide important information for further design of novel PKM2 activators.

The volume of the subsets in the BG was compared between 40 MWoA and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The resting-state functional connectivity of BG subsets with abnormal volume was also investigated. Reduced volume in the left caudate and the right nucleus accumbens (NAc) was detected in the migraine group compared with healthy controls; meanwhile, increased functional connectivity between the BG and several brain regions within nociceptive and somatosensory processing pathways was observed. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between the volume of the bilateral caudate and right NAc and disease duration. In addition, an increased monthly frequency of migraine attack was associated with increased functional connectivity between the bilateral caudate and left insula, and longer disease duration was correlated with increased functional connectivity between the right NAc and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex. Our results revealed abnormal volume of BG and dysfunctional dynamics during interictal resting state within pain pathways of the BG in MWoA, which validated the association between the BG and migraine. Perspective: Our findings revealed the presence of reduced volume in NAc and caudate of the BG and interictal dysfunctional dynamics within BG networks in MWoA. The abnormal structure and function within the pain-related pathways of the BG were possibly associated with impaired pain processing and modulatory processes in MWoA.

Currently, the treatment for proteinuria is mainly limited to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, Chinese medicinals 'securing essence and tonifying the kidney' may be appropriate for proteinuria. The most promising Chinese medicinals and formulae are introduced in the present study to form a potent formula for DN proteinuria. To make oral administration convenient, the formula will be processed in the form of granules. Methods/design: A randomized, multi-center pilot trial will be conducted. Forty eight participants with DN will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1. A granule group, at 10 grams, three times daily (G10 group, n = 12); 2. A granule group, at 20 grams, three times daily (G20 group, n = 12); 3. A decoction group (D group, n = 12); and 4. An irbesartan group (Aprovel group, n = 12). The following outcome measures will be used: the percentage change of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio; and the changes in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobulin from baseline to the end of the trial. Discussion: It is notable that most published clinical trials which assessed the efficacy of TCM on DN were of poor methodology and, therefore, their results have been invalidated. It is necessary to carry out well-designed clinical trials to provide sound evidence. The present trial is a study with potentially great value, for it will provide the parameters for future randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials with large sample sizes.

The main purpose of the current study was thereby to characterize the distinct patterns of resting-state function between FD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty FD patients and thirty HCs were enrolled and experienced 5-mintue resting-state scanning. Based on the support vector machine (SVM), we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate the differences of resting-state function mapped by regional homogeneity (ReHo). A classifier was designed by using the principal component analysis and the linear SVM. Permutation test was then employed to identify the significant contribution to the final discrimination. The results displayed that the mean classifier accuracy was 86.67%, and highly discriminative brain regions mainly included the prefrontal cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), temporal pole (TP), insula, anterior/middle cingulate cortex (ACC/MCC), thalamus, hippocampus (HIPP)/parahippocamus (ParaHIPP) and cerebellum. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between ReHo values in certain regions of interest (ROI) and the FD symptom severity and/or duration, including the positive correlations between the dmPFC, pACC and the symptom severity; whereas, the positive correlations between the MCC, OFC, insula, TP and FD duration. Conclusions: These findings indicated that significantly distinct patterns existed between FD patients and HCs during the resting-state, which could expand our understanding of the neural basis of FD. Meanwhile, our results possibly showed potential feasibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic assay for FD.

This study aims to investigate the regional gray matter density (GMD) changes in meal-related FD patients and their correlations with clinical variables, and to explore the possible influence of the emotional state on FD patients's brain structures. Methods: Fifty meal-related FD patients and forty healthy subjects (HS) were included and underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was employed to identify the cerebral structure alterations in meal-related FD patients. Regional GMD changes' correlations with the symptoms and their durations, respectively, have been analyzed. Results: Compared to the HS, the meal-related FD patients showed a decreased GMD in the bilateral precentral gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and midcingulate cortex (MCC), left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and right insula (p<0.05, FWE Corrected, Cluster size>50). After controlling for anxiety and depression, the meal-related FD patients showed a decreased GMD in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left MCC, right precentral gyrus and insula (p<0.05, FWE Corrected, Cluster size>50). Before controlling psychological factors, the GMD decreases in the ACC were negatively associated with the symptom scores of the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) (r = -0.354, p = 0.048, Bonferroni correction) and the duration of FD (r = -0.398, p = 0.02, Bonferroni correction) respectively. Conclusions: The regional GMD of meal-related FD patients, especially in the regions of the homeostatic afferent processing network significantly differed from that of the HS, and the psychological factors might be one of the essential factors significantly affecting the regional brain structure of meal-related FD patients.

In the current study, the structure-based pharmacophore (SBP)-guided method has been suggested to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of MetRS based on fourteen crystal structures of MetRS-inhibitor complexes. In this investigation, a hybrid protocol of a virtual screening method, comprised of pharmacophore model-based virtual screening (PBVS), rigid and flexible docking-based virtual screenings (DBVS), is used for retrieving new MetRS inhibitors from commercially available chemical databases. This hybrid virtual screening approach was then applied to screen the Specs (202,408 compounds) database, a structurally diverse chemical database. Fifteen hit compounds were selected from the final hits and shifted to experimental studies. These results may provide important information for further research of novel MetRS inhibitors as antibacterial agents.

In in vitro screening experiments, MIL showed strong antiproliferation activity in several human cancer cell lines, especially in HepG2 cells with an IC50 of 1.51 M. Therefore, we chose HepG2 and SK-HEP-1 cells to study MILs antitumor mechanism. Flow cytometry showed that MIL induced a G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot demonstrated that MIL-induced G(2)/M arrest was correlated with the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity, including a remarkable decrease in cell division cycle (cdc) 2 synthesis, the accumulation of phosphorylated-Thr14 and decrease of phosphorylation at Thr161 of cdc2. This effect was associated with the downregulation of cdc25C and upmodulation of checkpoint kinase 2 in response to DNA damage. MIL also activated caspase 9 and caspase 3, and significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and stimulated the release of cytochrome c into cytosol, suggesting MIL induced apoptosis via mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Associated with those effects, MIL also induced the generation of reactive oxygen species. In HepG2 tumor-bearing mice models, MIL remarkably and dose dependently inhibited tumor growth. Treatment of mice with MIL (20mg/kg intravenous [i.v.]) caused more than 65% tumor inhibition without cardiac damage compared with 47.57% tumor reduction by 5mg/kg i.v. doxorubicin with significant cardiac damage. These effects suggested that MIL and its easily modified structural derivative might be a potential lead compound for antitumor drug.

More specifically, abnormal brain activities in patients with FD during the resting state have been proven by several positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is also a valuable tool in investigating spontaneous brain activity abnormalities in pathological conditions. In the present study, we examined the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional (f)ALFF changes in patients with FD by using fMRI. Twenty-nine patients with FD and sixteen healthy controls participated in this study. Between-group differences in ALFF/fALFF were examined using a permutation-based nonparametric test after accounting for the gender and age effects. The results revealed a significant between-group difference in fALFF but not in ALFF in multiple brain regions including the right insula, brainstem and cerebellum. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that FD patients have increased correlations between the right cerebellum and multiple brain regions including the bilateral brainstem, bilateral cerebellum, bilateral thalamus, left para-/hippocampus, left pallidum and left putamen. Furthermore, fLAFF values in the right insula were positively correlated with the severity of the disease. These findings have provided further evidence of spontaneous brain activity abnormalities in FD patients which might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.

Use/training serves as an instrumental factor to influence brain neuroplasticity. Parallel to acquisition of behavioral expertise, extensive use/training is concomitant with substantial changes of cortical structure. Acupuncturists, serving as a model par excellence to study tactile-motor and emotional regulation plasticity, receive intensive training in national medical schools following standardized training protocol. Moreover, their behavioral expertise is corroborated during long-term clinical practice. Although our previous study reported functional plastic brain changes in the acupuncturists, whether or not structural plastic changes occurred in acupuncturists is yet elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: Cohorts of acupuncturists (N = 22) and non-acupuncturists (N = 22) were recruited. Behavioral tests were delivered to assess the acupuncturists' behavioral expertise. The results confirmed acupuncturists' tactile-motor skills and emotion regulation proficiency compared to non-acupuncturists. Using the voxel-based morphometry technique, we revealed larger grey matter volumes in acupuncturists in the hand representation of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the right lobule V/VI and the bilateral ventral anterior cingulate cortex/ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Grey matter volumes of the SI and Lobule V/VI positively correlated with the duration of acupuncture practice. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, this study provides first evidence for the anatomical alterations in acupuncturists, which would possibly be the neural correlates underlying acupuncturists' exceptional skills. On one hand, we suggest our findings may have ramifications for tactile-motor rehabilitation. On the other hand, our results in emotion regulation domain may serve as a target for our future studies, from which we can understand how modulations of aversive emotions elicited by empathic pain develop in the context of expertise. Future longitudinal study is necessary to establish the presence and direction of a causal link between practice/use and brain anatomy.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether FD disrupts the patterns of whole-brain networks and the abnormal functional connectivity could reflect the severity of the disease. The dysfunctional interactions between brain regions at rest were investigated in FD patients as compared with 40 age-and gender-matched healthy controls. Multivariate pattern analysis was used to evaluate the discriminative power of our results for classifying patients from controls. In our findings, the abnormal brain functional connections were mainly situated within or across the limbic/paralimbic system, the prefrontal cortex, the tempo-parietal areas and the visual cortex. About 96% of the subjects among the original dataset were correctly classified by a leave one-out cross-validation approach, and 88% accuracy was also validated in a replication dataset. The classification features were significantly associated with the patients' dyspepsia symptoms, the self-rating depression scale and self-rating anxiety scale, but it was not correlated with duration of FD patients (p>0.05). Our results may indicate the effectiveness of the altered brain functional connections reflecting the disease pathophysiology underling FD. These dysfunctional connections may be the epiphenomena or causative agents of FD, which may be affected by clinical severity and its related emotional dimension of the disease rather than the clinical course.

Eight conformers have been located by conformational search and optimization. Our results indicate that the titled compound has planar structures, and five intramolecular hydrogen bonds are found in the lowest-energy structure, including three OH center dot center dot center dot O and two CH center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. The electronic spectra in methanol have been determined by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) approach, showing that the first singlet exited state of the title compound arises from pi -> pi* electron transition. The antioxidant activity of aurantio-obtusin is evaluated by means of calculating O-H bond dissociated enthalpy (BDE) and the adiabatic ionization energy (IE). The calculated BDE and IE values of aurantio-obtusin are 341.8 and 732.3 kJ mol(-1), respectively, lower than the corresponding values of phenol (348.4 and 801.7 kJ mol(-1)) and purpurin (360.4 and 747.8 kJ mol(-1)), suggesting that aurantio-obtusin is a better antioxidant.

The molecular mechanism for this reduction in fertility is unknown. In the present study, we used a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy to specifically knock down the Clock gene expression in the testes of male mice and determined its effect on male fertility. Clock knockdown led to smaller litter size, a lower in vitro fertility rate, lower blastula formation rate, and lower acrosin activity of the knockdown sperm. Locomotor activity analysis of the Clock knockdown mice revealed that Clock knockdown in testes did not alter their circadian rhythm. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that Clock gene expression in round spermatids is essential for maintaining male reproductivity and suggest that acrosin may be a novel regulatory target of the Clock gene that would regulate the fertilization and early embryonic development to blastula. These findings may provide new clues for development of novel male contraceptive strategies.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the poly(A) polymorphism in the VDR gene and cancer risk by meta-analysis. We searched PubMed database, EMBASE database, CNKI database, and Wanfang database, covering all studies until January 22, 2013. Statistical analysis was performed by using the software Revman4.2 and STATA 10.0. A total 8,186 cancer cases and 8,685 controls in 19 case-control studies from 15 studies were identified for data analysis. The results suggested that the S allele carriers (SS + SL) did not have an increased or decreased risk of cancer when compared with the homozygote LL carriers (odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95 % CI = 0.87-1.06, P = 0.43 for SS + SL vs. LL). In addition, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity and cancer type, no significant association was found among Caucasians, African-Americans, prostate cancer, or breast cancer. This current meta-analysis suggested that the poly(A) polymorphism in the VDR gene may not contribute to the risk of cancer. Future studies are needed to validate our findings.

We aim to examine factors associated with utilization of TCM in patients with depression and to test whether the use of TCM would impact the use of psychiatric services with a subsequent impact on healthcare costs. Methods: Adult patients (n=216,557) who received antidepressant treatment for depression in 2003 was identified in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A Two-Part model was conducted. A multivariate logistic regression was employed to explore factors associated with the use of TCM, with a particular focus on baseline comorbidities, painful physical symptoms (PPS), and frequency of psychiatric service contacts over the ensuing 12-month study period. Multivariate generalized linear modeling was then applied to examine factors associated with healthcare costs for TCM users. Results: More than 40% of individuals prescribed with antidepressant treatments for depression used TCM services. Younger age, female gender, the presence of certain comorbid mental/physical illnesses or PPS, as well as having fewer psychiatric service contacts were found to be associated with the use of TCM services. These factors also affected TCM costs for users; the TCM costs equaled to 30% of costs of psychiatric out-patient services for TCM users. Conclusions: The current study suggested a set of significant factors which could influence use and cost of TCM services for patients with depression. Utilization of TCM services could have a substantial impact on use of psychiatric services and healthcare costs for patients with depression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alterations of the default mode network in functional dyspepsia patients: a resting-state fmri study	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						fMRI; functional dyspepsia; independent component analysis; resting-state	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ANXIETY DISORDERS; NEURAL RESPONSES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PAIN; MRI; VALIDATION; MODULATION	Background Increasing brain imaging studies have emphasized the role of regional brain activity abnormalities in functional dyspepsia (FD) during the resting state. The goal of this study was to investigate the default mode network (DMN) in FD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning was carried out on 49 patients and 39 HCs. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to isolate the DMN in each subject. Group topography of the DMN was compared to study significant alteration in FD. A correlation analysis was then performed in the FD group to investigate the effects of symptom severity and the psychological factors on the DMN. Key Results Significant spatial differences with the DMN in FD patients, compared with HCs, were mainly found in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, parietal cortex, and temporal pole. Meanwhile, Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) scores were positively correlated with the pACC, and was negative correlated with the OFC. However, both the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were not correlated with any regions of interest showing differences between the FD patients and the HCs. Conclusions & Inferences These findings suggested that the DMN might indeed undergo dysfunctional changes due to the abnormal persistent activity in FD patients. To a certain extent, the changes in the DMN were related to the FD-related symptom severity.	[Liu, P.; Zhou, G.; Wang, J.; Wen, H.; Von Deneen, K.

Intermedin (IMD), a multi-functional peptide, plays important roles in cardiovascular protection. In this study, we revealed an autophagy-dependent mechanism involved in IMD's protection against cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocyte death in heart hypertrophy. We observed that transverse aortic contraction (TAC) induction, Ang II or ISO exposure induced remarkable increase in the expression of endogenous IMD and its receptor components, CRLR, RAMP1 and RAMP3, in mouse hearts and H9c2 cell cultures, respectively. Furthermore, the heart size, heart weight/body weight ratios, cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis, interstitial collagen, hypertrophic markers including ANP and BNP expression were also significantly increased, which were effectively suppressed by IMD supplementation. In addition, IMD induced capillary angiogenesis and improved functions in hypertrophic hearts. We further observed that IMD induced strong autophagy in hypertrophic hearts and cultured cells, which was paralleling with the decrease in cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis. Furthermore, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, was used to block the IMD-augmented autophagy level, and then the protection of IMD on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis was almost abrogated. We also observed that IMD supplementation stirred intracellular cAMP production, and augmented the ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by Ang II/ISO exposure in H9c2 cells. In addition, we inhibited PI3K, PKA and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways by using wortamannin, H89 and PD98059, respectively, in H9c2 cells co-incubating with both IMD and Ang II or ISO, and observed that these inhibitors effectively reduced IMD-augmented autophagy level, but only H89 and PD98059 pre-incubation abrogated the anti-apoptotic action of IMD. These results indicate that the endogenous IMD and its receptor complexes are induced in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, and the autophagy stirred by IMD supplementation is involved in its protection against cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis through the activation of both cAMP/PKA and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways.

The samples were pre-concentrated and purified using solid-phase extraction, which provided satisfactory results. The separation was performed on a Waters Xbridge (TM) C18 column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile - water containing 5 mM ammonium acetate. The MS spectrum was acquired in positive mode with both single quadrupole (Q1) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The optimised method offered a good linear correlation (r(2) > 0.9967), excellent precision (RSD < 2.83%) and acceptable recovery (from 92.78 to 105.37%). The limits of detection (LOD) and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were less than 0.024 mu g/kg and 0.095 mu g/kg, respectively. The validated method was successfully applied to the rapid screening for AFB(1) and OTA in licorice roots and fritillary bulbs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(Fuzi in Chinese) has been widely clinically used to treat heart failure and rheumatism. Whereas its serious toxicity, Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae (Gancao in Chinese) was combined with it as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herb-pair for toxicity reduction and pharmacological effect improvement. Though some previous viewpoints about that has been reported, the underlying interaction mechanism of two herbs remain unknown and definitely worthy of investigating. Aim of study: In present study, we focus on Fuzi-Gancao herb-pair precipitation (FGP), considering it related to the compatibility mechanism of Fuzi-Gancao herb-pair. The intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetic characters of 3 diester diterpenoid alkaloids in the precipitation were investigated. Materials and methods: Both everted gut sac model and in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model were used to investigate rat small intestinal permeability and transport mechanism of aconitine, hypaconitine and mesaconitine. Moreover, by means of determination of the plasma concentration, the pharmacokinetic characters of 3 alkaloid compounds in rats have been developed. Results: In everted gut sac permeability experiment, the permeability of hypaconitine appeared best in ileum. Furthermore, their uptakes were increased in the presence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. In situ single-pass intestinal perfusion uptake experiment, results revealed that the transport mechanism may fit the active transport mechanism. And 3 alkaloids in FPG could be absorbed well in rats, fitting 2-compartment model with 1st order absorption and lag time. Conclusions: Our results in present study indicated that 3 diester diterpenoid alkaloids in FGP could be dissolved out in gastrointestinal tract firstly and then absorbed in blood after oral administration, which could result in prolonging their mean residence time and adding their absorbed doses, avoiding dose dumping. The current study has significant enlightenments for further investigation on the interaction mechanisms of other acid-base herb-pairs as well as Fuzi-Gancao herb-pair. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study is to investigate whether or not HLA-G is associated with sacroiliitis stages of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a systemic autoimmune disease. Plasma levels of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) and HLA-G expression on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured in 55 AS patients and 49 healthy controls by using a specific HLA-G ELISA and flow cytometric (FCM) analysis, respectively. Association of HLA-G expression with sacroiliitis stages of the patients was statistically analyzed. The plasma sHLA-G concentrations were noticeably lower in the AS patients when compared to the healthy controls while the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the HLA-G expression on the surface of PBMCs was significantly higher in the AS patients than in the healthy controls (both P < 0.0001). The HLA-G expression on the surface of PBMCs, plasma sHLA-G levels and HLA-B27 expression were significantly correlated to each other. Moreover, the plasma sHLA-G was inversely associated with the sacroiliitis stages (P = 0.008), while the HLA-G expression on the surface of PBMCs increased from stage 0 to II but decreased in stage III (P = 0.001). The significant association of HLA-G expressions with AS sacroiliitis stages suggests that HLA-G is possibly involved in the pathology of the disease. The detection of HLA-G expression may therefore be a useful laboratory test to reveal disease process in AS patients. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
