Tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) is a key enzyme of serotonin synthesis. In the current study, the interaction mechanism of phenylalanine derivative TPH1 inhibitors was investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy calculations, free energy decomposition analysis and computational alanine scanning. The predicted binding free energies of these complexes are consistent with the experimental data. The analysis of the individual energy terms indicates that although the van der Waals and electrostatics interaction contributions are important in distinguishing the binding affinities of these inhibitors, the electrostatic contribution plays a more crucial role in that. Moreover, it is observed that different configurations of the naphthalene substituent could form different binding patterns with protein, yet lead to similar inhibitory potency. The combination of different molecular modeling techniques is an efficient way to interpret the interaction mechanism of inhibitors and our work could provide valuable information for the TPH1 inhibitor design in the future.

Objective: The present study investigated the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial effects and serum pharmacochemistry of XYT. Methods: The dimethylbenzene-induced inflammation test, the acetic acid-induced vascular permeability test and the carrageenan-induced paw edema test were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of XYT (200, 100 and 50 mg/kg); minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests were used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of XYT. Additionally, serum pharmacochemistry was performed to study the biologically active substances. Results: All the tests for anti-inflammatory effects were shown active with these test systems; the anti-inflammatory effects at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg were significant (p < 0.05); MIC and MBC tests indicated that XYT showed a broader antimicrobial spectrum and stronger toxicity to the tested microbes. Additionally, calycosin-7-glucoside, sennoside A, aloeemodin and rhein were detected as the predominant components in rat serum which may play the key role in the anti-inflammatory activities of XYT. Conclusions: This is the first report of the pharmacological activities and serum pharmacochemistry of XYT, and the first evidence of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the extracts of XYT. The results of our work demonstrated that XYT has significant anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, and calycosin-7-glucoside, sennoside A aloeemodin and rhein may be the biologically active substances of XYT. XYT can be utilized as an effective and safe disease preventive or therapeutic agent.

The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activities against a spectrum of pathogens. Preliminary studies identified compound 5c as a potent antimicrobial agent against drug-resistant bacteria. In addition, molecular docking studies indicated that compound 5c showed strong interactions with the active sites of lanosterol demethylase, dihydrofolate reductase, and topoisomerase II. This study provides an effective entry to the rapidly construction of a chemical library of heterocycles and compound 5c is one potent antibacterial lead for subsequent optimization.

Wogonin, a flavonoid originated from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been shown to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in malignant cells in in vitro studies. However, whether wogonin enhances TRAIL's antitumor activity in vivo has never been studied. In this study, the effect of combination of TRAIL and wogonin was tested in a non-small-cell lung cancer xenografted tumor model in nude mice. Consistent with the in vitro study showing that wogonin sensitized A549 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, wogonin greatly enhanced TRAIL-induced suppression of tumor growth, accompanied with increased apoptosis in tumor tissues as determined by TUNEL assay. The expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins including long form of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP(L)), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP-1 and cIAP-2) were markedly reduced in both cultured cells and xenografted tumor tissues after co-treatment with wogonin and TRAIL. The down-regulation of these antiapoptotic proteins was likely mediated by proteasomal degradation that involved intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), because wogonin robustly induced ROS accumulation and ROS scavengers butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored the expression of these antiapoptotic proteins in cells co-treated with wogonin and TRAIL. These results show for the first time that wogonin enhances TRAIL's antitumor activity in vivo, suggesting this strategy has an application potential for clinical anticancer therapy.

The spectrum-effect relationships between UPLC fingerprints and bacterial metabolism were investigated using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Because of their inherent differences of chemical compositions, the main actives of bacterial metabolism were different among five Aconitum L plants. The potency bioactivity sequence of the tested five Aconitum L products on E. coli was obtained that were RAB > RALP > RAK > RAS > RA.

Effectiveness of additional self-care acupressure for women with menstrual pain compared to usual care alone: using stakeholder engagement to design a pragmatic randomized trial and study protocol	TRIALS			English	Article						Comparative effectiveness research; Stakeholder engagement; Acupressure; Menstrual pain; Smartphone application	PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA	Background: Self-care acupressure might be successful in treating menstrual pain, which is common among young women. There is a need for comparative effectiveness research with stakeholder engagement in all phases seeking to address the needs of decision-makers. Our aim was to design a study on the effectiveness of additional self-care acupressure for menstrual pain comparing usual care alone using different methods of stakeholder engagement. Methods: The study was designed using multiple mixed methods for stakeholder engagement. Based on the results of a survey and focus group discussion, a stakeholder advisory group developed the study design. Results: Stakeholder engagement resulted in a two-arm pragmatic randomized trial. Two hundred and twenty women aged 18 to 25 years with menstrual pain will be included in the study. Outcome measurement will be done using electronic questionnaires provided by a study specific mobile application (App). Primary outcome will be the mean pain intensity at the days of pain during the third menstruation after therapy start. Conclusion: Stakeholder engagement helped to develop a study design that better serves the needs of decision makers, including an App as a modern tool for both intervention and data collection in a young target group.

In order to evaluate the genetic quality and provide available genetic management strategy, seven polymorphism microsatellite loci were applied to assess the genetic variation of the Miyaluo forest musk deer. The results indicated that a total of 168 alleles were detected from these seven microsatellite loci in 361 individuals, and the number of the alleles per locus ranged from 12 to 41 with a mean of 24. The average observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity, and PIC were 0.782, 0.854, and 0.837, respectively. Considering the results of the loci Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, the comparison of the common allele frequency as well as the private allele between the adults and juveniles, we concluded that the heterozygosity and the genetic diversity of the Miyaluo captive breeding population are increasing due to the input of new individuals from other populations. However, the frequency of some alleles declined sharply, and some were even lost indicating that there is a risk for diversity loss. Thus, we proposed an improved management and breeding strategy for the captive breeding population of the forest musk deer. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether the functional connectivity between brain regions is changed, especially between the cerebral hemispheres, in patients with FD remains unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) changes in patients with FD. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) was performed in 26 patients with FD and in 20 matched healthy controls. An interhemispheric RSFC map was obtained by calculating the Pearson correlation (Fisher Z transformed) between each pair of homotopic voxel time series for each subject. The between-group difference in interhemispheric RSFC was then examined at global and voxelwise levels separately. The global difference in interhemispheric RSFC between groups was tested using the independent two-sample t-test. Voxelwise comparisons were carried out using a permutation-based nonparametric test, and multiple comparisons across space were corrected using the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method. The results showed that patients with FD had higher global interhemispheric RSFC than healthy controls (p<0.01). Furthermore, voxelwise analysis revealed that patients with FD had increased interhemispheric RSFC in brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and thalamus (p<0.01, TFCE corrected). Our findings provide preliminary evidence of interhemispheric correlation abnormalities in patients with FD and contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the M/V polymorphism in the PRNP gene and the risk of AD. Methods: A meta-analysis was carried out to analyze the association between the M/V polymorphism in the PRNP gene and the risk of AD. Results: A total of 4228 cases and 4324 controls in 16 case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that the variant V allele carriers (VV + MV) had a 13% decreased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote MM (VV+ MV vs. MM: OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79-0.96, P = 0.004). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant decreased risks of AD were found in the Caucasian V allele carriers (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77-0.94, P = 0.002), but not in Asian V allele carriers (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.78-1.57, P = 0.57). In the subgroup analysis by age of onset, significant decreased risks of AD were associated with V allele carriers in late-onset Alzheimer disease (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.93, P = 0.007) but not in early-onset Alzheimer disease (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.70-1.06, P = 0.17). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the M/V polymorphism in the PRNP gene contributes to the susceptibility of Alzheimer disease. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some qualitative and quantitative information, such as the metabolic power-time curves, growth rate constant k, maximum heat-output power P (max), appearance time for the highest peak t (max), total heat production Q (t) for all the metabolic progress of mice splenic lymphocytes were obtained to present the effects of Panax ginseng and American Ginseng on these cells. Coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) on these quantitative thermokinetic parameters, the effects of the two Panax species on mice splenic lymphocytes could be quickly evaluated by analyzing the change of the main parameter k. From the values of k, it could be concluded quickly and accurately that Panax ginseng and American Ginseng both showed strong inhibitory effects on mice splenic lymphocytes, and the inhibitory effects was strengthened with increasing concentration of the two Panax species in the concentration range of 0-3.2 mg mL(-1). Panax ginseng with IC (50) of 1.38 mg mL(-1) showed stronger inhibitory effect on mice splenic lymphocytes growth than American Ginseng with IC (50) of 2.08 mg mL(-1). This study indicates that microcalorimetry is a powerful tool for evaluating the drugs' efficiency on living system, providing some useful references for the application of Panax ginseng and American Ginseng in practice.

There is still a lack of specific remedies against CrNT. We primarily screened Chinese herbal medicines with a potential protective effect against CrNT, e.g., rhubarb (Rheum palmatum L). However, the active constituents in rhubarb and its mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the total rhubarb extract (TR) was successively separated into three parts: total anthraquinone extract (TA), total tannin extract (TT) and remaining component extract (RC). The effects of each extract on the potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)-induced nephrotoxicity in rats were comparatively assessed. The results showed that only the administration of TT protected the kidney function in wK(2)Cr(2)O(7)-injured rats. Besides, TT showed significant activity to scavenge hydroxyl radicals, which is considered to be the dominant lesion product generated by hexavalent chromium. TT also showed a reduced ability to transform toxic high valence chromium ions into nontoxic low valence ions. And TT was able to further precipitate chromium ions. These results suggested that rhubarb tannins treat CrNT as a free radical scavenger, reductant, and metal precipitant. The multiple protective routes of the plant tannins reveal a superior option for development into a promising natural remedy against CrNT. In addition, the opposite effects of rhubarb anthraquinones in treating CrNT were observed compared to rhubarb tannins, which suggested the duo-directional effects (Yin and Yang) of herbal medicines should be addressed.

However, the mechanism behind the antiosteoporotic activity of this medicinal plant is not fully understood. Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of five widely used antiosteoporotic medicinal plants (Epimedium brevicornum, Cuscuta chinensis, Rhizoma drynariae, Polygonum multiflorum, and Ligustrum lucidum) on the production of estrogen, and identify the bioactive compounds responsible for the estrogen biosynthesis-promoting effect. Materials and methods: Human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells were used to evaluate estrogen biosynthesis, and the production of 17 beta-estradiol was quantified by a magnetic particle-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Further, the mRNA expression of aromatase was determined by a quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the protein expression of aromatase was detected by western blotting. The activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in rat osteoblastic UMR-106 cells was measured using p-nitrophenyl sodium phosphate assay. Results: Among the 5 antiosteoporotic medicinal plants, the extract of Epimedium brevicornum was found to significantly promote estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells. Icariin, the major compound in Epimedium brevicornum, was identified to be the active compound for the estrogen biosynthesis-promoting effect. Icariin promoted estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells in a concentration- and time-dependant manner and enhanced the mRNA and protein expressions of aromatase, which is the only enzyme for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in vertebrates. Further study showed that icariin also promoted estrogen biosynthesis and ALP activity in osteoblastic UMR-106 cells. Conclusions: These results show that the promotion of estrogen biosynthesis is a novel effect of Epimedium brevicornum, and icariin could be utilized for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

The transportation of AA in brain is mainly mediated by the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT(1)) and the Ne-dependent vitamin C transporter SVCT2. While L-ascorbic acid C6-O conjugation has been investigated as a tool to enhance brain drug delivery, C5-O conjugation and C5-O & C6-O conjugation as brain targeting tools have not been reported. In this letter, ibuprofen was linked directly to C5-O, C6-O and C5-O 82 C6-O positions of ',ascorbic acid with eater bonds, providing prodrug 1, 2 and 3, respectively, to improve their targeting abilities in the brain. Prodrug 1, 2 and 3 were synthesized in facile ways with good yields. And the preliminary evaluation in vivo illustrated that prodrug 2 had a better targeting ability than prodrug I. Moreover, prodrug 3, whose C5-O & C6-O positions were both modified, had good targeting ability for brain which will provide an important evidence for our further study on C5-O & C6-O- di-derivatives of L-ascorbic acid.

However, whether the microstructure is changed in patients with postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) remains elusive. Therefore, the present study was aimed to examine the white-matter (WM) microstructural changes in patients with PDS. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on 36 PDS patients recruited according to the Rome III criteria and 36 healthy controls. Tract-based spatial statistics were adopted to examine the between-group differences in DTI measures including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity (RD). The correlations between DTI measures and clinical variables were evaluated using a non-parametric permutation-based test. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the threshold-free cluster enhancement method. RESULTS: The patient group showed increased FA along with reduced MD and RD in multiple WM tracts, including the corona radiata, internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, corpus callosum, external capsule, sagittal stratum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (P < 0.05, corrected). The inclusion of anxiety and depression as covariates abolished the between-group difference in these tracts with the exception of the corona radiata. The DTI measures were not found to be correlated with the severity of symptoms or the duration of disease (P > 0.05, corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have provided preliminary evidence of WM microstructural changes in patients with PDS. Part of the changes could be accounted for by a higher level of psychosocial distress in the patient group.

To exploit this traditional medicine that adequately fits modern drugs, however, a comprehensive review about its pharmacy research and market performance is extremely necessary. Areas covered: This article reviews various components extracted from this plant as well as the biological activities derived from those chemical compositions. The authors summarize the quality evaluation and highlight the therapeutic effects of P. cablin, such as antiviral activities, antioxidation effect, antiinflammatory, analgesic activities, and intestinal barrier function protection. The preparation profile of P. cablin and some future related research were also described in this review. Last but not least, a market performance analysis was conducted. Expert opinion: P. cablin has beneficial therapeutic potential as an effective adaptogenic herbal remedy in clinic. Molecular mechanisms and active targets of P. cablin compounds, the qualitative and quantitative standard of P. cablin, as well as novel drug delivery systems of P. cablin, would be developed.

Materials and methods: A 3 x 3 Latin square single heavy design was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics influence of total Rh and BC after combination of Be by treating plasma samples with beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase both in beagle dogs and Wistar rats. In vitro and in situ experiment models including in situ rat intestinal perfusion, Caco-2 cell monolayer transport and small intestinal flora incubation system were used to discuss the possible mechanism. Results: The results of pharmacokinetic interactions showed that combination significantly reduced the system exposures of total Rh and BG. Compared with Rh or BC alone, the mean area under concentration-time curves (AUC(0-t)) of total Rh and BC reduced by 31% and 77% in beagle dog experiment. In Wistar rat experiment, the AUC(0-t) of total Rh and BC reduced by 22% and 21%. Subsequently, the results of in situ rat intestinal perfusion and small intestinal flora incubation system tests revealed that combination may decrease the absorption and metabolism of BC. However, combination could not affect the transport profile of BC across the Caco-2 cell. Moreover, combination did not affect the absorption or metabolism profile of Rh in all three in situ/in vitro experiments. Conclusions: It was deduced that the possible mechanism of the reduction of the system exposures of total Rh and BC was related to that combination decreased the metabolism of BC to B or the phase II conjugates of Rh/BG excreted from liver/bile duct to their free aglycones in vivo by inhibiting intestinal flora. The potent effects of combination on the phase II conjugates of Rh and B in pharmacokinetics, shown in this paper, indicated that more attention should be paid to the phase II conjugates metabolites of these polyphenols (undergo extensive phase II conjugation reactions in vivo) when applied herbal products composed of these coexist compounds.

However, its efficacy and safety in the treatment of AR is controversial due to the poor quality of the clinical trial of this therapy. This study aims to identify whether catgut implantation at acupoints is indeed an effective and safe treatment for patients with persistent or intermittent allergic rhinitis (PER or IAR) by comparing with sham catgut implantation treatment. Methods and design: This study compares real versus sham catgut implantation at acupoints in 242 patients with a history of PER or IAR and with a positive skin prick test (SPT). The trial will be conducted in the Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the study, patients will be randomly assigned by computer-generated randomization list into two groups and assessed prior to treatment. Then, they will receive two sessions of treatments (once per 2 weeks) for 4 consecutive weeks and have a follow-up phase of 12 weeks. The administration of catgut implantation (or sham-control) at acupoints follows the guidelines for clinical research on acupuncture (WHO Regional Publication, Western Pacific Series No. 15, 1995), and is performed double-blindly by a well-trained physician in acupuncture. The main outcome measures include the primary and secondary indicators. Primary indicators are subjective symptoms scores evaluated by visual analogue scales (VAS) and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaires (RQLQ). The secondary indicators are the results of laboratory examinations, such as serum allergen-specific IgE, nasal inflammatory cells counts (mast cells, eosinophils, and T cells) and nitric oxide concentration in nasal excretion. The use of anti-allergic medication will also be recorded as one of the secondary indicators. Furthermore, adverse events will be recorded and analyzed. If any participants withdraw from the trial, intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis will be performed. Discussion: The important features of this trial include the randomization procedures, large sample, and a standardized protocol of catgut implantation at acupoints. This trial will be the first study with a high evidence level in China in order to assess the efficacy and safety of catgut implantation at acupoints in treatment of AR following a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled method.

BMJ OPEN			English	Article							DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; RIO-DE-JANEIRO; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SCHOOL OUTBREAK; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; ATTITUDES; BRAZIL	Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) control in schools is a concern in low-income and middle-income countries with high TB burdens. TB knowledge is recognised as important for TB control in China, which has one of the highest TB prevalence in the world. Accordingly, National TB Control Guideline in China emphasised TB-health education in schools as one of the core strategies for improving TB knowledge among the population. It was important to assess the level of TB knowledge in schools following 5-year implementation of the guideline, to determine whether the information was reaching the targets. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods and study setting: This survey assessed TB knowledge and access to TB-health information by questionnaire survey with 1486 undergraduates from two medical universities in Southwest China. Results: Overall, the students had inadequate TB knowledge. Only 24.1%, 27.2% and 34.1% of the students had knowledge of TB symptoms of cough/ blood-tinged sputum, their local TB dispensaries and free TB treatment policy, respectively. Very few (14.5%) had heard about the Directly Observed Therapy Short Course (DOTS), and only about half (54%) had ever accessed TB-health education information. Exposure to health education messages was significantly associated with increased knowledge of the five core TB knowledge as follows: classic TB symptoms of cough/ blood-tinged sputum (OR (95% Cl) 0.5(0.4 to 0.7)), TB modes of transmission (OR (95% Cl) 0.4(0.3 to 0.5)), curability of TB (OR (95% Cl) 0.6(0.5 to 0.7)), location and services provided by TB local dispensaries (OR (95% Cl) 0.6(0.5 to 0.8)) and the national free TB treatment policy (OR (95% Cl) 0.7(0.5 to 0.8)). Conclusions: The findings pose the question of whether it is time for a rethink of the current national and global approach to TB-health education/promotion which favours promotion of awareness on World TB Days rather than regular community sensitisation efforts.

The history of acupuncture research was initiated in the eighteenth century and developed rapidly since then. In the past, physicians tried hard to apply acupuncture into clinical practice, while scientists were focused on the possible characteristics of acupoints and meridians. In the modern time, scientists have strived hard to evaluate the real effectiveness of acupuncture and the underlying physiological and biological mechanisms of acupuncture. Reviewing research history from past to present, we are delighted to witness this wonderful development. Accumulated evidences that acupuncture is beneficial in various conditions significantly enhanced our understanding the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment. However, there is still no conclusive evidence in acupuncture clinical studies. The clinical research still needs great improving, while the basic research results need to be appropriately transformed into clinical outcomes. Based on current achievements, we believe that although the challenges and difficulties exist, a more collaborative, innovative, and integrated approach will help us to achieve further progress in future acupuncture research.

Recently, there has been intensive debate about the efficacy of acupuncture therapy due to the conflicting outcome of clinical trials. Acupoint specificity was regarded as one of the core scientific issues with respect to acupuncture practice at the Society for Acupuncture Research international symposium held in 2007. In this chapter, we reviewed the recent development in basic science and clinical studies on the role of acupoint specificity. The evidence cumulated from brain imaging and many biological studies showed that the point specificity in acupuncture does exist, although acupoint specificity-related issues such as sham acupoint and placebo phenomenon need to be seriously considered. How to optimize the efficacy of acupoint and minimize the impact of sham acupuncture is an urgent issue faced by acupuncture community, and more studies are warranted on the subjects.

So we designed a randomised controlled trial to settle the problem. Methods and analysis We designed a multicentre, two-arm, sham-controlled clinical trial. 200 participants with functional dyspepsia will be randomly assigned to the true acupuncture (TA) group and sham acupuncture (SA) group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the TA group will receive acupuncture at points selected according to syndrome differentiation. Participants in the sham acupuncture group will receive penetrations at sham points. Participants in both groups will receive 20 sessions of electroacupuncture in 4weeks, five times continuously with a 2day rest in a week. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients reporting the absence of dyspeptic symptoms at 16weeks after inclusion.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the differences in brain activities elicited by acupuncture between FD patients and healthy controls (HC) so as to explore the possible mechanism. Eighteen FD patients and eighteen HC received 10 sessions of acupuncture treatment at ST25 acupoints. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were, respectively, performed before and after acupuncture. The defecation frequency, Bristol stool form scale (SBFS), and MOS 36-item Short Healthy Survey (SF-36) were employed to evaluate the clinical efficacy. After acupuncture, the FD patients showed a significant decrease in defecation frequency and BSFS score. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) map showed a decrease in the paracentral lobule and postcentral gyrus, and an increase in the angular gyrus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus in the FD group. Moreover, the changes in ReHo values in the ACC were correlated with the reduction in defecation frequency. Decreasing functional connectivity among the ACC, insula, thalamus, and orbital frontal cortex only existed in the FD group. Conclusively, acupuncture alleviated defecation frequency and improved stool formation in FD patients. The efficacy might result from the regulation of the homeostasis afferent processing network.

Patients and methods: Between January 2010 and November 2012, an electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL to find studies related to the diagnostic performance of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA in patients with inflammatory synovitis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the adopted gold standards. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria were extracted or calculated. Summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the differences between the 2010 and 1987 criteria. Results: We found 10 studies which were eligible for inclusion. Based on the 2010 criteria, the pooled information showed a sensitivity of 0.804 (95% confidence interval [CI]; range 0.737 to 0.857) and a specificity of 0.556 (95% CI; range 0.417 to 0.687) in the methotrexate (MTX) group, a sensitivity of 0.706 (95% CI; range 0.585 to 0.803) and a specificity of 0.691 (95% CI; range 0.583 to 0.782) in the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) group, and a sensitivity of 0.901 (95% CI; range 0.856 to 0.933) and a specificity of 0.539 (95% CI; range 0.429 to 0.645) in the expert group. The sensitivity and specificity were pooled under the bivariate binomial mixed model in this review due to the heterogeneous nature of the data. Compared to the 1987 criteria, the 2010 criteria showed a higher sensitivity, lower specificity and similar accuracy rate with more accuracy rate in the MTX group, compared the DMARD and expert groups. Conclusion: The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA have a better discriminative and diagnostic ability, higher sensitivity, and lower specificity than the 1987 criteria; therefore, we believe that it cannot be substituted for the 1987 criteria.

For obtaining preferable clinical effectiveness, Deqi is commonly regarded as efficacy predictor and parameter which is necessary to be achieved. Influential factors for acupuncture efficacy, like Deqi sensation as well as propagated sensation along channels (PSCs), enjoyed a long history in acupuncture basic research. Concerning this study, taking into account different positions on acupuncture Deqi sensation and PSCs, we would like to attest whether different body positions for subjects during needling procedure yield differed acupuncture Deqi sensation, particularly in terms of intensity, and PSCs. Methods. We used self-controlled method and selected 30 healthy subjects to perform needle insertion at Futu point (ST32) bilaterally. Then they were instructed to record the value of intensity of acupuncture sensation and the length and width of PSCs after removing the needle. Results. In regard to intensity of Deqi, kneeling seat position is stronger than supine position, accounting for 90% of the total number of subjects. In length of PSCs, kneeling seat position is greater than supine position, accounting for 56.7%. In width of PSCs, kneeling seat position is greater than supine position, accounting for 66.7%. Conclusion. Our findings show that needle inserting at Futu point (ST32) in kneeling seat position achieve better needle sensation and provide reference for clinical.

However, what would happen at the moxibustioned site remained unclear. To answer this question, we performed a microarray analysis with skin tissue taken from the moxibustioned site also Zusanli acupoint (ST36) where 15-minutemoxibustion stimulation was administrated. The results exhibited 145 upregulated and 72 downregulated genes which responded immediately under physiological conditions, and 255 upregulated and 243 downregulated genes under pathological conditions. Interestingly, most of the pathways and biological processes of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under pathological conditions get involved in immunity, while those under physiological conditions are involved in metabolism.

The present study observed the effect of moxibustion on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in the CD rat. The result shows that the phosphorylation of the Ras, Raf-1, MEK-1, and ERK-1/2 proteins and the expression of the corresponding mRNAs in the colon tissue of CD rat were significantly higher than the normal control group. Both treatments with mild moxibustion and with herb-separated moxibustion significantly reduced the expression of the Ras, Raf-1, MEK-1, and ERK-1/2 proteins and Ras and Raf-1 mRNA. MEK-1 and ERK-1/2 mRNA expression in each treatment group showed a downward trend, and the ERK-1/2 mRNA levels were significantly lower in the mild moxibustion group. It indicates that Ras, Raf-1, MEK-1, and ERK-1/2 are involved in the process of intestinal fibrosis in CD rats. Moxibustion can downregulate the abnormal expression of colonic Ras, Raf-1, MEK-1, and ERK-1/2 protein and mRNA levels in CD intestinal fibrosis in rats. Moxibustion may play a role in the treatment of CD intestinal fibrosis by regulating ERK signaling pathway.

In this study, the impact of acupuncture on the protein expressions of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) and CLC-2 CL- channel of the rats with myocardial ischemia were tested and its mechanism was explored. The rats for experiment were distributed randomly into 5 groups: blank control group, modeling control group, Neiguan (PC-6) treatment group, Lieque (LU-7) control group, and Non-acupoint control group. The rats of all groups, except the blank control group, had myocardial ischemia via multiple subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO). Electroacupuncture treatment was given to Neiguan (PC-6) treatment group, Lieque (LU-7) control group, and Non-acupoints control group, respectively, once a day for 7 days. The results show that acupuncture can alleviate the myocardial ischemia of cardiac tissue, decrease significantly the activities of serum SOD and MDA, and thereby influence the protein expressions of CFTR and CLC-2 in CL- channels. The results of the study implies that acupuncture suppresses the pathological changes of cardiac tissue of rats with myocardial ischemia and regulates the protein expression of CFTR and CLC-2 CL- channels, which may serve as one possible mechanism to reduce myocardial ischemia.

Recent visualized research on Deqi using modern technologies has demonstrated possible central mechanism towards it. However, there is a conspicuous paradox underway in the research of cerebral response to acupuncture Deqi. This paper provided a view of up-to-date studies using visualized tools to characterize the brain response to acupuncture Deqi, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The paradox was extruded to highlight certain reasons from a TCM view. It is hypothesized that acupoints located at different dermal sites, state of participant, and needling manipulation can all contribute to the current paradox. Hence, further studies on acupuncture Deqi should pay more attention to the strategy of experiment design with generalized measurement, valid sham control methods, and more to subjects in diseased condition.

Ginsenoside Rb1 was given to the rats by intragastric administration either before or after the MCAO surgery to study its preventive and therapeutic effects. Ginsenoside Rb1-treated rats had a smaller infarct volume than the positive control. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), neurofilament (NF) and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) were measured to determine brain damage and the recovery of nerves. These findings suggest that ginsenoside Rb1 has neuroprotective effects in rats, and the protection efficiency is higher than Edaravone. The protective mechanism is different from Edaravone. The preventive ability of ginsenoside Rb1 is higher than its repair ability in neuroprotection in vivo.

Fructus Mume Formula in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALDOSE REDUCTASE; GLUCOSE-UPTAKE; PANAX-GINSENG; BERBERINE; STREPTOZOTOCIN; RATS; EFFICACY; MEDICINE; INSULIN	Background. "Fructus Mume or Dark Plum" (pilule form) has been used for many years in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and may be a valid treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Aim. One aspect toward efficacy validation is the evaluation of the blood glucose-lowering effect of Fructus Mume (FM) with T2DM patients in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods. This pilot study uses a RCT procedure to assess efficacy of FM and Metformin. The trial was for 12 weeks, with 80 T2DM subjects. Both groups were standardized in their diet and exercise routine. Comparisons of several variables were analyzed. Results. No significant differences were found between groups in the fasting and postprandial glucose levels although both had significant decreases. The values of glycosylated hemoglobin were significantly reduced in both groups. For patients whose body mass index (BMI) was <23, neither FM nor Metformin had an effect on BMI; for those with a BMI between 23 and 25 or the BMI was >25, both FM and Metformin significantly reduce the BMI. Conclusions. In this pilot study, it was demonstrated that Fructus Mume formula may reduce the levels of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.

In order to investigate the effects of high-dose Qinggan Huoxue Recipe on acute liver failure and explore the potential mechanism, we had built acute liver failure models in rats by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (D-GalN). High-dose Qinggan Huoxue Recipe was delivered by gavage. After treatment, the blood alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), cholinesterase (CHE), and prothrombin time (PT) were determined. The pathological score of liver tissue was recorded. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry staining and fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and Caspase-3 were performed. The survival curve was also depicted. Our results demonstrated that high-dose Qinggan Huoxue Recipe could significantly improve liver function and increase survival rates in rats with acute liver failure. These effects were supposed to be mediated by suppressing inflammatory reaction and apoptosis.

However, the experimental data in support of this combination strategy are lacking. In this study, we investigated the anti-HBV activity of the combination of 3TC and either oxymatrine or matrine on HepG2 2.2.15 in vitro. The activities of the combination and the solo compound, each in different concentrations, were compared on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th experimental days. The cytotoxicity results showed that the nontoxic concentrations of both oxymatrine and matrine to HepG2 2.2.15 cells were 800 mu g/mL. We found that the single use of oxymatrine below 100 mu g/ml, matrine below 200 mu g/ml, and 3TC below 30 mu g/ml showed weak inhibitory effects on the secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV-DNA in culture media; the combination of 3TC (30 mu g/ml) with oxymatrine (100 mu g/ml) or matrine (100 mu g/ml) showed significant inhibitory effects that were higher than or equivalent to the single use of 3TC at 100 mu g/ml. The results provide a new impetus to develop novel, multicomponent anti-HBV drugs through the combination of natural products with nucleoside analogs to enhance their activity.

The components of the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation were investigated by GC-MS. The antibacterial activity of the essential oils was determined by micro-dilution assay. The results showed large variations in the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the oils. The oil of "Yimucao" showed antibacterial activity against various Gram-positive bacteria and consisted mainly of sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, with phytone, phytol, caryophyllene oxide and beta-caryophyllene being the most significant constituents, whereas the oil of "Chongweizi", mainly made up of bornyl acetate and aliphatic hydrocarbons, was inactive in the antibacterial assay. Further study of the main compounds in "Yimucao oil" showed that beta-caryophyllene had wide-spectrum activity against Gram-positive bacteria.

Previous studies have detected structural deficits and functional impairments in migraine patients. However, researchers have failed to investigate the functional connectivity alterations of regions with structural deficits during the resting state. Twenty-one migraine patients without aura and 21 age-and gender-matched healthy controls participated in our study. Voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis and functional connectivity were employed to investigate the abnormal structural and resting-state properties, respectively, in migraine patients without aura. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, migraine patients showed significantly decreased gray matter volume in five brain regions: the left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), right occipital lobe, cerebellum and brainstem. The gray matter volume of the dACC was correlated with the duration of disease in migraine patients, and thus we chose this region as the seeding area for resting-state analysis. We found that migraine patients showed increased functional connectivity between several regions and the left dACC, i.e. the bilateral middle temporal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, the functional connectivity between the dACC and two regions (i.e. DLPFC and OFC) was correlated with the duration of disease in migraine patients. We suggest that frequent nociceptive input has modified the structural and functional patterns of the frontal cortex, and these changes may explain the functional impairments in migraine patients.

Incorrect drug combination is a major cause. Recently, insoluble particulate matter test, pH measurement, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint have been recommended as potential strategies for prediction of drug-incompatible reactions. However, these methods were complex to manipulate, subjective to judge, or were of poor relevance and low sensitivity. In this study, a novel application for the detection of compatibility of combination of CMIs based on isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been proposed. Qingkailing Injection (QKL) was selected as a representative drug to blend with Potassium Chloride Injection (KCl) and Calcium Chloride Injection (CaCl2). The type of reactions between them was intuitively manifested by the thermodynamic parameters including Gibbs free energy change (Delta G), enthalpy change (Delta H), and entropy change (Delta S). The results indicated that when QKL mixed with CaCl2, Delta G < 0, and |Delta H| > T|Delta S|, which meant chemical changes happened between them and ADRs might happen in clinic. On the contrary, the reactions between QKL and KCl existed solely as physical processes, indicating that it was relatively safe. Meanwhile, HPLC fingerprint was also applied, but no significant difference was found. It is hard to distinguish whether incompatible reactions have happened during HPLC. The study suggested that with the advantages of convenience, sensitivity, and reliability, ITC could serve as an essential tool in the detection of incompatible reactions of drug combination. The described method could be used for early prediction of adverse drug reactions, which would be helpful to ensure the rationality of drug combination.

Methods: Twenty MWoA and 20 age-, education-and gender-matched healthy volunteers participated in this study. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was employed to investigate the WM abnormalities in MWoA by integrating multiple indices, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). Results: Compared with healthy controls, MWoA showed significantly lower FA, MD and AD in multiple brain regions, whereas no difference in RD was observed. Specifically, the overlap among the lower FA, MD, and AD was found in the genu, body, and splenium part of the corpus callosum (CC), the right anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) in MWoA compared with healthy controls. Additionally, some of the above WM findings were significantly correlated with duration and headache frequency in MWoA. Conclusion: Given that decreased AD may suggest axonal loss, our findings may reveal axonal loss in MWoA.

We sought to explore whether and how repeated migraine attacks influence intrinsic brain connectivity, as well as how activity in these networks correlates with clinical indicators of migraine. Methods/Principal Findings: Resting-state fMRI data in twenty-three patients with migraines without aura (MwoA) and 23 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), in combination with a "dual-regression'' technique to identify the group differences of three important pain-related networks [default mode network (DMN), bilateral central executive network (CEN), salience network (SN)] between the MwoA patients and HC. Compared with the HC, MwoA patients showed aberrant intrinsic connectivity within the bilateral CEN and SN, and greater connectivity between both the DMN and right CEN (rCEN) and the insula cortex - a critical region involving in pain processing. Furthermore, greater connectivity between both the DMN and rCEN and the insula correlated with duration of migraine. Conclusions: Our findings may provide new insights into the characterization of migraine as a condition affecting brain activity in intrinsic connectivity networks. Moreover, the abnormalities may be the consequence of a persistent central neural system dysfunction, reflecting cumulative brain insults due to frequent ongoing migraine attacks.

The previous study has proved that Radix Angelicae Dahuricae extract could enhance the intestinal absorption of puerarin in Pueraria. But the underlying compatibility mechanism of the two herbs remains unknown. In this study we tried to further evaluate the improvement of Radix Angelicae Dahuricae extract on the puerarin using the Caco-2 cell model and explore the transport properties of puerarin through the above research to discuss the possible effect mechanism of Radix Angelicae Dahuricae extract on the transport of puerarin and the underlying compatibility mechanism of the two herbs. Aim of study: The aim of this work was to study the transport properties of puerarin in Radix Pueraria across Caco-2 cell membrane and to explore how the Radix Angelicae Dahuricae extract affected the transport of puerarin using the well-characterized, human-based intestinal Caco-2 cell model as a platform. Materials and methods: The bidirectional transport, and the effects of time, drug concentration, pH, P-gp inhibitors (Verapamil, Cyclosporin A), MRP inhibitor (MK-571) and EDTA-Na-2 (tight junction modulator) on the absorption of puerarin were observed. Then the influence of extract of Radix Angelicae Dahuricae on the transport of puerarin was studied. Drug concentration was measured by HPLC and the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) and apparent permeability ratio (PDR) were calculated. Results and conclusions: The results showed that the transport (Papp) of puerarin in Caco-2 cell monolayer model had time and concentration dependence, and the transport showed saturation characteristics with the time and concentration of puerarin to a certain degree. The Papp of puerarin transported on Caco-2 cell monolayer model was significantly changed when the specified inhibitors of P-gp were added to the model and the PDR decreased from 1.74 to 0.43. The absorption of puerarin was improved when combined with Radix Angelicae Dahuricae. The intestinal absorption of puerarin is by passive diffusion as the dominating process and active transportation was mediated by P-gp and MRP transporter in Caco-2 cell monolayer model, and Radix Angelicae Dahuricae could enhance the intestinal absorption of puerarin.

(Umbelliferae) is a plant used as medicine and food in China. The essential oil (EO) extracted from its rhizomes possesses many pharmacological activities. However, there have been no scientific reports in the modern literature on the safety of EO. Aims of the study: The objective of this study was to conduct a chemical composition analysis and evaluate acute toxicity and skin sensitivity of EO from rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong. Materials and methods: The chemical composition of hydrodistilled EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and was evaluated in animals for acute toxicity, skin irritation and sensitization tests. Results: Dozens of compounds were detected and the major components of EO were ligustilide and butylidenephthalide with relative contents of 67.46 and 5.06%, respectively. The oral and intraperitoneal lethal doses of 50% (LD50) in mice were 7.23 g/kg (approximately 14,606 times of clinical dose used) and 2.25 g/kg (approximately 5091 times of clinical dose used), respectively. The doses of 0.115 and 0.23 g/kg EO (approximately 232.5 and 465 times of the respective clinical doses used) revealed slight irritation effects on rabbit skin, but 1 g/kg EO (approximately 2020 times of clinical dose used) had no observable effect on guinea pig skin in the skin sensitization test. Conclusions: These experimental results indicate that short term application of EO is probably safe within the range of its clinical doses, but the dose should be controlled for external use due to its slight skin irritation.

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerned with acupuncture treatment of angina pectoris were identified by searching Academic Source Premier, MEDLINE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and three Chinese databases (China biology medicine database, China national knowledge infrastructure, and VIP database for Chinese technical periodicals). The valid data were extracted in accordance with our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main outcomes of the included studies were synthesized using Revman 5.1. RESULTS: Twenty-one articles on 16 individual studies were included and evaluated as having high or moderate risk of bias according to the standards of the Cochrane Collaboration. Meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture combined with conventional drugs (ACCD) was superior to conventional drugs alone in reducing the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [OR=0.18, 95%0 (0.04, 0.84), P=0.03]. Moreover, ACCD was superior to conventional drugs in the relief of angina symptoms [OR=4.23, 95% CI (2.73, 6.56), P<0.00001], and improvement of electrocardiography (ECG) [OR=2.61, 95%0 (1.83, 3.73), P<0.00001]. Acupuncture by itself was also superior to conventional drugs for angina symptoms [OR=3.59, 95%CI (1.76, 7.92), P=0.0004] and ECG improvement [OR=3.07, 95%CI (1.54, 6.10), P=0.001]. ACCD was superior to conventional drugs in shortening the time to onset of angina relief [WMD-1.40, 95% CI (-1.65, -1.15), P< 0.00001]. However, the time to onset was significantly longer for acupuncture treatment than for conventional treatment alone [WMD=2.43, 95%CI (1.63, 3.23), P<0.000 01]. CONCLUSION: ACCD reduced the occurrence of AMI, and both acupuncture and ACCD relieved angina symptoms and improved ECG. However, compared with conventional treatment, acupuncture showed a longer delay before its onset of action. This indicates that acupuncture is not suitable for emergency treatment of heart attack. Owing to the poor quality of the current evidence, the findings of this systematic review need to be verified by more RCTs to enhance statistical power. (C) 2012 JTCM. All rights reserved.

METHODS: A rat model of UC was established by local stimulation of the intestine with supernatant from colonic contents harvested from human UC patients. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following groups: normal (sham), model (UC), herb-partition moxibustion (HPM-treated), and positive control sulfasalazine (SA-treated). Rats treated with HPM received HPM at acupuncture points ST25 and RN6, once a day for 15 min, for a total of 8 d. Rats in the SA group were perfused with SA twice a day for 8 d. The colonic histopathology was observed by hematoxylin-eosin. The levels of intestinal flora, including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis), were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect bacterial 16S rRNA/DNA in order to determine DNA copy numbers of each specific species. Immunohistochemical assays were used to observe the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-12 in the rat colons. RESULTS: HPM treatment inhibited immunopathology in colonic tissues of UC rats; the general morphological score and the immunopathological score were significantly decreased in the HPM and SA groups compared with the model group [3.5 (2.0-4.0), 3.0 (1.5-3.5) vs 6.0 (5.5-7.0), P < 0.05 for the general morphological score, and 3.00 (2.00-3.50), 3.00 (2.50-3.50) vs 5.00 (4.50-5.50), P < 0.01. for the immunopathological score]. As measured by DNA copy number, we found that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are associated with a healthy colon, were significantly higher in the HPM and SA groups than in the model group (1.395 +/- 1.339, 1.461 +/- 1.152 vs 0.045 +/- 0.036, P < 0.01 for Bifidobacterium, and 0.395 +/- 0.325, 0.851 +/- 0.651 vs 0.0015 +/- 0.0014, P < 0.01 for Lactobacillus). On the other hand, E coli and B. fragilis, which are associated with an inflamed colon, were significantly lower in the HPM and SA groups than in the model group (0.244 +/- 0.107, 0.628 +/- 0.257 vs 1.691 +/- 0.683, P < 0.01 for E. coli, and 0.351 +/- 0.181, 0.416 +/- 0.329 vs 1.285 +/- 1.039, P < 0.01 for B. fragills). The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-12 was decreased after HPM and SA treatment as compared to UC model alone (4970.81 +/- 959.78, 6635.45 +/- 1135.16 vs 12333.81 +/- 680.79, P < 0.01 for TNF-alpha, and 5528.75 +/- 1245.72, 7477.38 +/- 1259.16 vs 12550.29 +/- 1973.30, P < 0.01 for IL-12). CONCLUSION: HPM treatment can regulate intestinal flora and inhibit the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-12 in the colon tissues of UC rats, indicating that HPM can improve colonic immune response.

We aimed to investigate how the cortical network reorganization is altered by frequent cortical overstimulation associated with migraine. Methodology/Principal Findings: Gray matter volumes and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal correlations were employed to construct structural and functional networks between brain regions in 43 female patients with migraine (PM) and 43 gender-matched healthy controls (HC) by using graph theory-based approaches. Compared with the HC group, the patients showed abnormal global topology in both structural and functional networks, characterized by higher mean clustering coefficients without significant change in the shortest absolute path length, which indicated that the PM lost optimal topological organization in their cortical networks. Brain hubs related to pain-processing revealed abnormal nodal centrality in both structural and functional networks, including the precentral gyrus, orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, temporal pole of the middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal gyrus. Negative correlations were found between migraine duration and regions with abnormal centrality. Furthermore, the dysfunctional connections in patients' cortical networks formed into a connected component and three dysregulated modules were identified involving pain-related information processing and motion-processing visual networks. Conclusions: Our results may reflect brain alteration dynamics resulting from migraine and suggest that long-term and high-frequency headache attacks may cause both structural and functional connectivity network reorganization. The disrupted information exchange between brain areas in migraine may be reshaped into a hierarchical modular structure progressively.

In the current study, the multicomplex-based pharmacophore (MCBP)-guided method has been suggested to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of FAK kinase based on seven crystal structures of FAK-inhibitor complexes. In this investigation, a hybrid protocol of virtual screening methods, comprising of pharmacophore model-based virtual screening (PB-VS) and docking-based virtual screening (DB-VS), is used for retrieving new FAK inhibitors from commercially available chemical databases. This hybrid virtual screening approach was then applied to screen several chemical databases, including the Specs (202,408 compounds) database. Thirty-five compounds were selected from the final hits and should be shifted to experimental studies. These results may provide important information for further research of novel FAK inhibitors.

PC12 neuroendocrine cells were used as a model target. Anoxic damage or oxidative damage in PC12 cells were induced by adding sodium dithionite or hydrogen peroxide respectively in cultured medium. Survival ratios of different groups were detected by an AlamarBlue assay. At the same time, the apoptosis of PC12 cells were determined with flow cytometry. The putative neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside R0 is thought to be exerted through enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes Superoxide dismutases (SOD). The activity of SOD and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), were measured to evaluate the protective and therapeutic effects of ginsenoside R0. Ginsenoside R0 treated cells had a higher SOD activity, lower MDA level and lower ROS, and their survival ratio was higher with a lower apoptosis rate. It is suggested that ginsenoside R0 has a protective effect in the cultured PC12 cells, and the protection efficiency is higher than Edaravone. The protective mechanisms of these two are different. The prevent ability of ginsenoside R0 is higher than its repair ability in neuroprotection in vitro.

Rats were divided into a normal group and a model group, after modeled by 4% ANIT (75 mg/kg) for 48 h, they were orally administrated with YCHD extract at the dose of 0.324 g/kg, and then blood was collected from their orbital sinus after different intervals. Changes in liver function were monitored by the levels of liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] and bilirubins [total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL)], the concentration of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin in plasma were measured by UPLC, and the pharmaceutical parameters were calculated with DAS2.1.1 software. The concentration-time curve of both normal and modeled rats after oral administration of YCHD was obtained. Their time to maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) were both 0.25 h, the maximum concentration (C-max) were 4.533 mu g/mL and 6.885 mu g/mL, and their area under concentration-time curve (AUC)(0 -> 24h) were 16.272 and 32.981, respectively. There was a 51.88% and 100.46% increase in C-max and AUC(0-t) (P < 0.05), but there showed a 45.52% and 92.93% reduction in clearance of drug and volum of distribution (P < 0.05), respectively. Hepatic injury could significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin after oral administration of YCHD, the absorption and distribution process was accelerated in liver injured rats, but the metabolism and elimination process was slowed. And this may lead to a significant accumulation of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin in the body.

Cheng et Hsiao and Coptis teeta Wall. Quantitative determination of protoberberine alkaloids in R. coptidis is critical for controlling its quality. In this study, a rapid, simple and accurate quantitative H-1 NMR (qNMR) method was developed for simultaneous determination of berberine, jatrorrhizine, epiberberine, coptisine, palmatine and columbamine in R. coptidis from the three species. Method validation was performed in terms of selectivity, precision, repeatability, stability, accuracy, robustness and linearity. The average recoveries obtained were in the range of 96.9-102.4% for all the six alkaloids. In addition, the qNMR data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), and the results showed that the contents of the active alkaloids have significant difference among the three species. Compared with the conventional HPLC approach, the proposed qNMR method was demonstrated to be a powerful tool for quantifying the six alkaloids due to its unique advantages of high robustness, rapid analysis time and no need of standard compounds for calibration curves preparation. These findings indicate that this method has potential as a reliable method for quality evaluation of herb medicines, especially for protoberberine alkaloid-containing ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Which research is needed to support clinical decision-making on integrative medicine?-Can comparative effectiveness research close the gap?	CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						comparative effectiveness research; decision making; integrative medicine; Chinese medicine; acupuncture	ACUPUNCTURE; TRIALS; COMPLEMENTARY; PROPHYLAXIS; HEADACHE; EFFICACY; MIGRAINE; HEALTH; POLICY	In clinical research on complementary and integrative medicine, experts and scientists have often pursued a research agenda in spite of an incomplete understanding of the needs of end users. Consequently, the majority of previous clinical trials have mainly assessed the efficacy of interventions. Scant data is available on their effectiveness. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) promises to support decision makers by generating evidence that compares the benefits and harms of the best care options. This evidence, more generalizable than the evidence generated by traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), is better suited to inform real-world care decisions. An emphasis on CER supports the development of the evidence base for clinical and policy decision-making. Whereas in most areas of complementary and integrative medicine data on comparative effectiveness is scarce, available acupuncture research already contributes to CER evidence. This paper will introduce CER and make suggestions for future research.

HLA-G expression was immunohistochemically investigated in 104 patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma, in which 56 were luminal A, 17 were luminal B, 19 were HER-2, and 12 were basal-like/normal breast-like subtype classified according to immunohistochemical staining results of ER, HER-2, CK5/6, and EGFR. Host immune response status was assessed by estimating the density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). For comparison, other biomarkers such as Ki67, p53 and VEGF were also investigated. Associations of these biomarkers and TIL with molecular subtypes were statistically analyzed. We found that there were more cases with high expressions of HLA-G in non-luminal than in luminal subtypes (P = 0.035). In contrast, more cases with high density of TIL was found in luminal than in non-luminal subtypes (P = 0.023). Compared to all the biomarkers studied, only HLA-G expression was found to be inversely associated with the density of TIL (P = 0.004). Furthermore, patients with HLA-G(high)/TILlow status had a higher risk of recurrence than those with HLA-G(low)/TILhigh status, regardless of the molecular subtypes. Therefore, a combination of the status of HLA-G and TIL could improve the prognostic prediction for patients with various molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

The possible hepatoprotective effects of polydatin on acute liver injury mice induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and the mechanisms involved were investigated. Intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 (50 ml/kg) resulted in a significant increase in the levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), also a marked enhancement in the expression of hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclearfactor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). On the other hand, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and activities of glutathione transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were observed following CCl4 exposure. Nevertheless, all of these phenotypes were evidently reversed by preadministration of polydatin for 5 continuous days. The mRNA and protein expression levels of hepatic growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta(1)) were enhanced further by polydatin. These results suggest that polydatin protects mice against CCl4-induced liver injury through antioxidant stress and antiinflammatory effects. Polydatin may be an effective hepatoprotective agent and a promising candidate for the treatment of oxidative stress-and inflammation-related diseases.

In this work, fast and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with multivariate analysis was utilized to evaluate the metabolic profiling of Jatropha curcas seed and screen the marker compounds of phorbolesters (PEs), which significantly contributed to the metabolic profiling for quality control of PEs in J. curcas seed. Thirty-two peaks were separated and detected in J. curcas seed on a fused-core C-18 column between 2 and 25 mm. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the chromatographic data demonstrated that 12 batches of J. curcas seed could be well-differentiated and categorized into 5 groups. Especially, one sample obtained from Lijiang Yunan was significantly different from the others. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the metabolic profiling differentiation might be explained by 9 components including J.factors C-1-C-5 of PEs, peak 21 (similar to J.factor C-1) and 3 peaks (peaks 1, 9, and 10) significantly different in retention time from the PEs. The observation that the content levels of J.factors C-1 and C-2 plus peak 21 (equivalent to J.factor C-1) were more relevant to the multivariate chromatographic data than the ones of J.factors C-3-C-5 was confirmed by the PLS prediction models. The results of the present study indicated not only that J.factors C-1 and C-2 were the more rational markers representing the comprehensive quality of PEs in J. curcas seed but also that peak 21 (similar to J.factor C-1) was a rational marker, too.

Abnormalities in white matter integrity, particularly in the CC, may affect interhemispheric resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the alterations in functional interactions between the cerebral hemispheres during resting state in migraine patients without aura, and even less about how the inter-hemispheric RSFC are affected by the abnormalities of the CC. Methods and findings: Twenty-one migraine patients without aura and 21 healthy controls participated in this study, age-, sex-, and education-matched. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was employed to investigate the white matter alterations of the CC. Meanwhile, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) was used to compare the inter-hemispheric RSFC differences between the patients and controls. TBSS analysis revealed reduced FA values in the genu and the splenium of CC in patient group. VMHC analysis showed decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in migraine patients without aura relative to that of the controls. Furthermore, in migraine patients without aura, the reduced FA values of the genu of CC correlated with the decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC of the ACC. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the migraine patients without aura showed reduced FA values of the genu of CC and decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC of the ACC. The correlation between the above structural and functional changes suggested that the reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of CC modulates inter-hemispheric VMHC in migraine patients without aura. Our results demonstrated that the VMHC alterations of ACC can reflect the FA changes of the genu of CC in migraine patients without aura.

In this paper, we examined the implicit prescription patterns behind the Chinese medicinal formulae, so as to explore the Chinese medicinal compatibility patterns or rules in the treatment or control of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis. Methods: This study was based on the herbs recorded in Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, and the literature sources from Chinese Journal Net and China Master Dissertations Full-text Database (1990 - 2010) to analyze the compatibility rule of the prescription. Each Chinese herb was listed according to the selected medicinal formulae and the added information was organized to establish a database. The frequency and the association rules of the prescription patterns were analyzed using the SPSS Clenmentine Data Mining System. An initial statistical analysis was carried out to categorize the herbs according to their medicinal types and dosage, natures, flavors, channel tropism, and functions. Based on the categorization, the frequencies of occurrence were computed. Results: The main prescriptive features from the selected formulae of the mining data are: (1) warm or cold herbs in the Five Properties category; sweet or bitter herbs in the Five Flavors category and with affinity to the liver meridian are the most frequently prescribed in the 96 medicinal formulae; (2) herbs with tonifying and replenishing, blood-activating and stasis-resolving, spleen-strengthening and dampness-resolving or heat-clearing and detoxicating functions that are frequently prescribed; (3) herbs with blood-tonifying, yin-tonifying, spleen-strengthening and dampness-resolving, heat-clearing and detoxicating, and blood-activating with stasis-resolving functions that are interrelated and prescribed in combination with qi-tonifying herbs. Conclusions: The results indicate that there is a close relationship between recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer with liver dysfunctions. These prescriptions focus on the herbs for nourishing the yin-blood, and emolliating and regulating the liver which seems to be the key element in the treatment process. Meanwhile, the use of qi-tonifying and spleen-strengthening herbs also forms the basis of prescription patterns.	[He, Yanhua; Zheng, Xiao; Loo, Wings T.

However, few studies focus on HIV-related heterosexual risk behaviours among the majority Yi population. The objectives of this study were to explore the characteristics of an egocentric sexual network and estimate the prevalence of casual sexual behaviour. Yi villagers (n=108), aged 15-35 years, who reported having had sex within the previous year were interviewed as to their sexual behaviours and networks. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions provided supplementary information on sexual norms. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Most of the respondents reported having had casual sex at some time in their life, and 66.7% reported multiple sexual partnerships. Only 21.3% reported ever having used a condom. During the study year, a total of 137 partners were involved in 153 sexual partnerships. Among the reported sexual partnerships, 67.3% originated from a casual sexual relationship. For network members in components of size >= 3, 56.9% were involved in concurrent sexual partnerships. Having never been married (OR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.03-4.33) and younger age (OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83-0.95) were both associated with being in a component of size >= 3. Size (OR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.17-7.66), pair (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39-0.74), the number of weak components of the egocentric sexual network (OR: 30.04; 95% CI: 6.47-139.46) and gender (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.67) were all associated with being in concurrent sexual partnerships. HIV-related interventions for the Yi ethnic minority in Sichuan province must therefore address concurrent sexual partnerships and promote condom use.

The mechanisms behind this low absorption had not yet been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of efflux transporters in the intestinal absorption of forsythiaside as a potential mechanism for its low small-intestinal absorption following oral administration. Polarized MDCKII cell lines stably transfected with human or murine complementary DNA encoding for various efflux transporters (P-gp/MDR1, MRP2 and Bcrp1) were used to study transepithelial transport of forsythiaside and compare results with the MDCKII-Wild type cells. The transportation inhibitors GF120918, MK571 and Ko143 were used to investigate the transport mechanism. The active transport of forsythiaside was found in MDCKII-WT cells. The MDCKII-MRP2 and MDCKII-Bcrp1 cells significantly increased forsythiaside efflux ratio compared with the parental cells due to the apically directed transport by MRP2 and Bcrp1, respectively. The efflux ratios in MRP2 and Bcrp1 transfected cell lines were greatly decreased in the presence of MK-571 and Ko143, respectively, which indicated that forsythiaside efflux by MRP2 and Bcrp1 were significantly inhibited by their selective inhibitors. MDCKII-MDR1 cells did not exhibit a significant reduction in the forsythiaside efflux compared with the parental cells, indicating that it was not a good substrate for MDR1. And the results were then validated by the in situ experiment. This study presents direct evidence that forsythiaside is effluxed by both MRP2 and Bcrp1, which may contribute to its poor oral bioavailability.

Several dietary flavonoids show aromatase inhibitory activity, but their tissue specificity and mechanism remain unclear. This study found that the dietary flavonoid luteolin potently inhibited estrogen biosynthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in KGN cells derived from human ovarian granulosa Cells, the major source of estrogens in premenopausal, women. Luteolin decreased aromatase mRNA and protein expression in KGN cells. Luteolin also promoted. aromatase protein degradation and inhibited estrogen biosynthesis in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells, but had no effect on :recombinant: expressed aromatase. Estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells was inhibited with differing potencies by extracts of onion and bird chili and by four other-dietary flavonoids: kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and isorhamnetin. The present study suggests that luteolin inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by decreasing aromatase expression and destabilizing aromatase protein, and it warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for estrogen-dependent cancers.

Diurnal Variation of Hepatic Antioxidant Gene Expression in Mice	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; MOUSE-LIVER; MOLECULAR-MECHANISM; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CLOCK; GLUTATHIONE; METALLOTHIONEIN; CADMIUM; TIME; HEPATOTOXICITY	Background: This study was aimed to examine circadian variations of hepatic antioxidant components, including the Nrf2-pathway, the glutathione (GSH) system, antioxidant enzymes and metallothionein in mouse liver. Methods and Results: Adult mice were housed in light-and temperature-controlled facilities for 2 weeks, and livers were collected every 4 h during the 24 h period. Total RNA was isolated, purified, and subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis. Hepatic mRNA levels of Nrf2, Keap1, Nqo1 and Gclc were higher in the light-phase than the dark-phase, and were female-predominant. Hepatic GSH presented marked circadian fluctuations, along with glutathione S-transferases (GST-alpha 1, GST-mu, GST-pi) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx1). The expressions of GPx1, GST-mu and GST-pi mRNA were also higher in females. Antioxidant enzymes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1), catalase (CAT), cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) showed circadian rhythms, with higher expressions of Cox-2 and CAT in females. Metallothionein, a small nonenzymatic antioxidant protein, showed dramatic circadian variation in males, but higher expression in females. The circadian variations of the clock gene Brain and Muscle Arnt-like Protein-1(Bmal1), albumin site D-binding protein (Dbp), nuclear receptor Rev-Erb alpha (Nr1d1), period protein (Per1 and Per2) and cryptochrome 1(Cry1) were in agreement with the literature. Furthermore, acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is more severe when administered in the afternoon when hepatic GSH was lowest. Conclusions: Circadian variations and gender differences in transcript levels of antioxidant genes exist in mouse liver, which could affect body responses to oxidative stress at different times of the day.

Furthermore, the majority of previous acupuncture neuroimaging studies have been performed using healthy subjects. In this study, patients with migraine were used to investigate acupoint specificity. Methods: Thirty patients with migraine were enrolled and randomized into three groups: Traditional Acupuncture Group (TAG), Control Acupuncture Group (CAG), and Migraine Group (MG). The TAG was treated by acupuncture stimulation at Waiguan (TE5), Yang Lingquan (GB34), and Fengchi (GB20). The CAG was treated at Touwei (ST8), Pianli (LI6), and Zusanli (ST36). The MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to test for differences in brain activation between the TAG and CAG versus MG, respectively. Results: Traditional acupuncture treatment was more effective for pain reduction than control acupuncture treatment. The TAG showed higher brain metabolism than the MG in the middle temporal cortex (MTC), orbital frontal cortex (OFC), insula, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, post-cingulate cortex (PCC), the precuneus, and the middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Metabolism decreased in the parahippocampus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum in the TAG compared with the MG. In the CAG, metabolism increased compared with the MG in the MTC, supratemporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and MCC, whereas metabolism decreased in the cerebellum. Conclusions: Acupuncture stimulation of different points on similar body regions in migraine patients reduced pain and induced different levels of cerebral glucose metabolism in pain-related brain regions. These findings may support the functional specificity of migraine-treatment-related acupoint. Trial registration: The number of our clinical trial registration is: ChiCTR-TRC-11001813, and the protocol and inclusion criteria have already been registered as ChiCTR-TRC-11001813.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the differences in cerebral glycometabolism changes evoked by acupuncture and sham acupuncture and to explore the possible correlations between brain responses and clinical efficacy. METHODS: In all, 72 FD patients were randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks. Ten patients in each group were randomly selected for fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography scans to detect cerebral glycometabolism changes. The Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) and Symptom Index of Dyspepsia (SID) were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. RESULTS: (i) The clinical data showed that after treatment the decrease in SID score in the acupuncture group was significantly greater than that in the sham acupuncture group (P<0.05). The increase in NDI score between the two groups did not differ (P>0.05), and only the improvement in NDI score in the acupuncture group was clinically significant. (ii) The neuroimaging data indicated that after treatment the acupuncture group showed extensive deactivation in cerebral activities compared with the sham acupuncture group. In the acupuncture group, the deactivations of the brainstem, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, thalamus, and hypothalamus were nearly all related to the decrease in SID score and the increase in NDI score (P<0.05, corrected). In the sham acupuncture group, the deactivations of the brainstem and thalamus tended to be associated with the increase in NDI score (P<0.1, corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture and sham acupuncture have relatively different clinical efficacy and brain responses. Acupuncture treatment more significantly improves the symptoms and quality of life of FD patients. The more remarkable modulation on the homeostatic afferent network, including the insula, ACC, and hypothalamus, might be the specific mechanism of acupuncture.

However, the underlying mechanism of acupuncture, especially whether there exists any difference between varies acupoints, remains largely unknown, which hinders its widespread use. Results: In this study, we develop a novel Linear Programming based Feature Selection method (LPFS) to understand the mechanism of acupuncture effect, at molecular level, by revealing the metabolite biomarkers for acupuncture treatment. Specifically, we generate and investigate the high-throughput metabolic profiles of acupuncture treatment at several acupoints in human. To select the subsets of metabolites that best characterize the acupuncture effect for each meridian point, an optimization model is proposed to identify biomarkers from high-dimensional metabolic data from case and control samples. Importantly, we use nearest centroid as the prototype to simultaneously minimize the number of selected features and the leave-one-out cross validation error of classifier. We compared the performance of LPFS to several state-of-the-art methods, such as SVM recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and sparse multinomial logistic regression approach (SMLR). We find that our LPFS method tends to reveal a small set of metabolites with small standard deviation and large shifts, which exactly serves our requirement for good biomarker. Biologically, several metabolite biomarkers for acupuncture treatment are revealed and serve as the candidates for further mechanism investigation. Also biomakers derived from five meridian points, Zusanli (ST36), Liangmen (ST21), Juliao (ST3), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Weizhong (BL40), are compared for their similarity and difference, which provide evidence for the specificity of acupoints. Conclusions: Our result demonstrates that metabolic profiling might be a promising method to investigate the molecular mechanism of acupuncture. Comparing with other existing methods, LPFS shows better performance to select a small set of key molecules. In addition, LPFS is a general methodology and can be applied to other high-dimensional data analysis, for example cancer genomics.

Therefore, we report the protocol of a randomized controlled trial of using acupuncture to treat functional constipation. Design: A randomized, controlled, four-arm design, large-scale trial is currently undergoing in China. Seven hundred participants are randomly assigned to three acupuncture treatment groups and Mosapride Citrate control group in a 1: 1: 1: 1 ratio. Participants in acupuncture groups receive 16 sessions of acupuncture treatment, and are followed up for a period of 9 weeks after randomization. The acupuncture groups are: (1) Back-Shu and Front-Mu acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (Shu-Mu points group); (2) He-Sea and Lower He-Sea acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (He points group); (3) Combining used Back-Shu, Front-Mu, He-Sea, and Lower He-Sea acupoints of Large Intestine meridians (Shu-Mu-He points group). The control group is Mosapride Citrate group. The primary outcome is frequency of defecation per week at the fourth week after randomization. The secondary outcomes include Bristol stool scale, the extent of difficulty during defecating, MOS 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The first two of second outcomes are measured 1 week before randomization and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after randomization. Other second outcomes are measured 1 week before randomization and 2 and 4 weeks after randomization, but SF-36 is measured at randomization and 4 weeks after randomization. Discussion: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2012) will confirm whether acupuncture is effective to treat functional constipation and whether traditional acupuncture theories play an important role in it.

PARENTAL SUPPORT FOR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES FOR UNMARRIED YOUTH IN CHENGDU, CHINA	SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						parental attitudes; unmarried youth; sexual and reproductive health; China	RISK BEHAVIORS; ADOLESCENT	The objective of the study was to explore parental perspectives and attitudes towards the provision of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services to unmarried youth in Chengdu, China. A representative sample of parents was drawn using multi-stage stratified cluster sampling technique, and information was collected using a structured questionnaire. The eligible respondents were parents (both fathers and mothers) who had at least one unmarried adolescent and/or youth aged 15 to 24 years old. A total of 2,871 fathers and mothers were interviewed. Parents' SRH-related knowledge was poor and dissonant attitudes of tolerance and ambivalence towards provision of SRH information and services to unmarried youth were found. About 80% of parents accepted and understood unmarried youth seeking SRH counseling service, but the percentages of such positive attitude was much lower for premarital contraceptive use. Over half of the parents were supportive of providing SRH education and information to unmarried youth; whereas on the provision of contraceptive services to sexually active unmarried youth, 27% were negative, 25% accepted, 36% indicated an understanding, and the rest 12% had no opinion. Parents' SRH-related knowledge and attitudes were associated with parental social-demographic characteristics. Findings from this study suggest that parent-oriented programs are needed to apprise them of the existing SRH conditions of the unmarried youth in China, to allay fears and misconceptions of parents, and to enhance family-based sex education in terms of increasing parents' SRH knowledge and their capacity and skills of providing such information to unmarried youth.

Given the unsatisfactory response rates of many Food and Drug Administration-approved ADs, research on acupuncture remains of potential value. Therefore, we sought to review the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment for depression in clinical applications. We conducted a PubMed search for publications through 2011. We assessed the adequacy of each report and abstracted information on reported effectiveness or efficacy of acupuncture as monotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) and as augmentation of ADs. We also examined adverse events associated with acupuncture, and evidence for acupuncture as a means of reducing side effects of ADs. Published data suggest that acupuncture, including manual-, electrical-, and laser-based, is a generally beneficial, well-tolerated, and safe monotherapy for depression. However, acupuncture augmentation in AD partial responders and nonresponders is not as well studied as monotherapy; and available studies have only investigated MDD, but not other depressive spectrum disorders. Manual acupuncture reduced side effects of ADs in MDD. We found no data on depressive recurrence rates after recovery with acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture is a potential effective monotherapy for depression, and a safe, well-tolerated augmentation in AD partial responders and nonresponders. However, the body of evidence based on well-designed studies is limited, and further investigation is called for.

HIV-1 continues to be a major global health problem. In this regard, new strategies are required for promoting a complete immune reconstitution and eradicating the virus from the body. The rationale for the use of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy against HIV infection is that, after transplantation, genetically modified HSCs carrying anti-HIV transgenes would engraft, divide and differentiate into large numbers of mature myeloid and lymphoid cells that express antiviral genes and thus are protected from HIV invasion or productive replication. HIV-1 attachment to susceptible cells involves binding of gp120 to CD4 receptor and subsequently to a HIV co-receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4. The pivotal role of CCR5 in HIV-1 acquisition and disease progression has been established by the discovery of a naturally occurring 32-bp deletion in CCR5 (CCR5 Delta 32) which generates a nonfunctional gene product. Homozygosity for CCR5 Delta 32 confers profound resistance against HIV infection, and heterozygous mutation that induces a decrease in CCR5 surface expression is associated with lower plasma viral load and delayed progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This, together with the fact of R5 dominance during the acute and asymptomatic phase, suggests that CCR5 is an attractive target for HIV gene therapeutics. The present review addresses recent advances of CCR5-targeted HSC gene approaches to treat HIV infection, discusses the future prospects and postulates potential strategies in the field.

In recent years this method has been replaced by sulphur-fumigation for the sake of improving its appearance and pest control. Correct identification of sulphur-fumigated Baizhi and rapid finding of appropriate chemical markers for the quality control of Baizhi are of very great importance. Objective To develop a rapid and efficient method of rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) combined with chemometrics for discriminating sulphur-fumigated Baizhi and controlling its quality. Methodology The samples were separated on a Zorbax SB-C18-column with a gradient elution programme using methanol and water. The optimal RRLC method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, stability and recovery test. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principle component analysis (PCA) were applied to differentiate the different samples. Results All the constituents were well separated within 18?min. The results of chemical fingerprinting and quantitative analysis showed that the sulphur-fumigated method obviously destroyed the phytochemical profiles of Baizhi. Moreover, the sun-dried and sulphur-fumigated Baizhi could be clearly separated by HCA and PCA, and the critical markers such as oxypeucedanin and imperatorin accountable for such differences were ultimately screened out. Conclusion This study revealed that sulphur-fumigation is an inappropriate approach for processing crude drugs and should be prohibited, and that the proposed RRLC method combined with chemometrics demonstrated an efficient strategy for quality control of Baizhi.

The power-time curves of the growth metabolism of B. subtilis affected by Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum, Cornu Cervi Elaphi, Cornu Saigae Tataricae, cornu caprae hircus, Cornu Bubali, Squama Manis, and Carapax Trionycis were determined using a thermal activity monitor (TAM) air isothermal microcalorimeter, ampoule mode, at 37 degrees C. By analyzing these curves and some quantitative parameters using principal component analysis, the effects of the seven animal drugs on B. subtilis could be quickly evaluated from the change of the two main parameters, the maximum heat-flow power P-m(2) and total heat output Q(t): Cornu Saigae Tataricae, cornu caprae hircus, Cornu Bubali, Squama Manis, and Carapax Trionycis inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, while Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum and Cornu Cervi Elaphi promoted the growth of B. subtilis. Further, the result of hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the drugs which promoted the growth of B. subtilis gathered in one cluster, the other drugs which inhibited the growth of B. subtilis gathered in the other cluster. All these illustrated that the internal characteristics of the seven animal drugs were different though they had similar resources and these drugs could be well clustered according the effects of them on B. subtilis growth with the help of chemometric methods. This study provided an useful idea of the combination of microcalorimetry and chemometric analysis for studying the effects of drugs on organisms.

This research was intended to investigate the antidepressant effect of SalB by forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Main methods: SalB was extracted from S. miltiorrhiza roots and followed by HPLC analysis. Thirty five male C57BL/6 mice were divided into five groups: three SalB groups of different doses, one imipramine group. and one control group. The SalB groups received intraperitoneally (i.p.) 5 mg/kg SalB, 10 mg/kg SalB, and 20 mg/kg SalB respectively. At the same time, the imipramine group received 20 mg/kg imipramine. and the control group saline only. The behavioral tests including FST, TST and locomotor activity test were done after administration of drugs for consecutively three times, at 24, 1, and 0.5 h before the tests. Key findings: SalB, from S. miltiorrhiza with purity of 95%, significantly reduced the immobility time in both the FST and TST tests (doses at 5, 10, 20 mg/kg, i.p.), without changing locomotion in spontaneous motor activity. Significance: This data suggests that besides neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. SalB has promising therapeutic potential in treatment of depressive disorders. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

According to traditional use, it was prepared as rectal suppositories for treating abdominal distention and constipation. The present study was carried out on the pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of muskmelon base. Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of the ethanol extract from muskmelon base (EMB) for abdominal distention and constipation. Materials and methods: In this study, we report the gastrointestinal prokinetic action of EMB following single rectal or large intestinal administration. Laxative activity, gastric emptying and small intestinal transit tests were examined in ICR mice. SD rats were used to determine changes in large intestinal transit and contractile effects of the proximal colon in vivo. Guinea pigs were used to evaluate the contractile effects of the proximal colon and the possible mechanism or mechanisms on proximal colon activity ex vivo. Moreover, the acute toxicity of EMB was evaluated. Results: In the in vivo experiments, the acute toxicity test showed that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EMB was 400 mg/kg. A laxative effect was observed in mice at different dosages (6.5, 13 and 26 mg/kg). EMB showed a dose-dependent acceleration of gastric emptying (13 and 26 mg/kg). It also promoted both small intestinal (6.5, 13 and 26 mg/kg) and large intestinal (4, 8 and 16 mg/kg) transit activity. In the SD rat model, single rectal administration of EMB (8 and 16 mg/kg) showed a significant increase in both the frequency and amplitude of proximal colon smooth muscle contractility. These increases in amplitude and frequency peaked 30-60 min after EMB administration and corresponded with the results of the laxative activity test. The ex vivo experiments showed that varying doses of EMB (11.5, 23 and 46 mg/kg) had a direct prokinetic effect that was sensitive to atropine. Conclusions: Our results show that EMB is a low dosage, fast acting drug with a large therapeutic window (4-400 mg/kg) and shows significant gastrointestinal prokinetic action after single rectal or large intestinal administration. This gastrointestinal prokinetic effect was stronger in the intestines than in the stomach. This effect was sensitive to atropine, suggesting that EMB acts mainly through cholinergic mechanisms.

Methods: Data were obtained from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of acupuncture treatment in patients with migraine. Four-hundred eighty migraineurs were randomly assigned to 3 arms of treatment with genuine acupoints and 1 arm of penetrating sham acupoints. The primary outcome measurement was the cost-effectiveness ratio (C/E), expressed as cost per 1 day reduction of headache days from baseline to week 16. Cost-comparison analyses, differences in the migraine-specific quality of life questionnaire (MSQ), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were taken as secondary outcome measurements. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: The total cost per patient was 1273.2 (95% CI 1171.3-1375.1) in the Shaoyang specific group, (sic)1427.7 (95% CI 1311.8-1543.6) in the Shaoyang non-specific group, (sic)1490.8 (95% CI 1327.1-1654.6) in the Yangming specific group, and (sic)1470.1 (95% CI 1358.8-1581.3) in the sham acupuncture group. The reduced days with migraine were 3.972 +/- 2.7, 3.555 +/- 2.8, 3.793 +/- 3.6, and 2.155 +/- 3.7 in these 4 groups (P < 0.05 for each genuine acupoints group vs the sham group), respectively, at week 16. The C/Es of the 4 groups were 320.5, 401.6, 393.1, and 682.2, respectively. Results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with that of the cost-effectiveness analysis. The Shaoyang specific group significantly improved in all 3 MSQ domains compared with the sham acupuncture group. Conclusions: Treatment of specific acupoints in Shaoyang meridians is more cost-effective than that of non-acupoints, representing a dramatic improvement in the quality of life of people with migraine and a significant reduction in cost. Compared with the other 3 groups, Shaoyang-specific acupuncture is a relatively cost-effective treatment for migraine prophylaxis in China.

However, little is known about the specific role of the Met/Met genotype on brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and Chinese brain morphology has not been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study investigated brain structural differences among three genotypes of BDNF (rs6265) for the first time in healthy young Chinese adults via cortical thickness analysis and VBM. Brain differences in Met carriers using another grouping method (combining Val/Met and Met/Met genotypes into a group of Met carriers as in most previous studies) were also investigated using VBM. Dual-approach analysis revealed less gray matter (GM) in the frontal, temporal, cingulate and insular cortices in the Met/Met group compared with the Val/Val group (corrected, P<0.05). Areas with less GM in the Val/Met group were included in the Met/Met group. VBM differences in Met carriers were only found in the middle cingulate cortex. Conclusions/Significance: The current results indicated a unique pattern of brain morphologic differences caused by BDNF (rs6265) in young Chinese adults, in which the Met/Met genotype markedly affected the frontal, temporal, cingulate, and insular regions. The grouping method with Met carriers was not suitable to detect the genetic effect of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on brain morphology, at least in the Chinese population, because it may hide some specific roles of Met/Met and Val/Met genotypes on brain structure.

METHODS: Differences in the thermotropism behaviors of mice treated either with Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Praeparata), Ganjiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis) or the combination of the two given intragastrically were investigated using the Animal Thermotropism Behavior Surveillance System. The water intake volume, oxygen consumption volume, adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity were determined during the investigation. RESULTS: When Fuzi and Ganjiang were administered together, the rate at which mice remained on a warm plate ("remaining rate") and the times and distances of their movement were all significantly reduced (P<0.05). Compared with the Normal group, the reduction was 55.1%, 48.3% and 44.8%, while compared with the Fuzi group, the reduction was 57.6%, 34.3% and 36.0%, indicating that "cold" tropism was significantly increased. Compared with the Normal and Fuzi groups, the ATPase activity and the respiratory oxygen consumption volume of the Fuzi + Ganjiang group were significantly increased (P<0.05), suggesting an improvement in energy metabolism and showing a "hot" characteristic when Fuzi and Ganjiang are present together. Additionally, the T-AOC and T-SOD activity were significantly enhanced (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The behavior of mice tending toward "cold" tropism can be regarded as a quantitative reflection of Fuzi having fewer characteristics consistent w ith a "hot" nature when not used with Ganjiang, the functional mechanism of which may be a change in the ATPase activity in liver tissue.

This study was aimed to elucidate the chemical characteristics of Paris fargesii var. brevipetala (PFB) that may be administrated as alternate resource of legal RP. A HPLC-ELSD method was established to characterize the steroid saponins in rhizomes of PFB and two legal Paris species [Paris polyphylla var. chinensis (PPC) and P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis (PPY)] in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP). Ten saponins (Paris saponins I. II, V, VI, VII, H, gracillin and other three paris saponins) were involved as standards. The results indicated that PFB contained pennogenyl saponins as the main components with small amounts of diosgenin saponins. The total contents of the detected saponins in PFB ranged from 9.12 mg/g to 85.33 mg/g. Nine of the twelve PFB samples own a total content of paris saponins I, II, VI, and VII more than 6.0 mg/g (meeting the standard of CP 2010 edition). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA) both confirmed the fact that saponin profiles of PFB, PPC and PPY were different from each other.

The calculated results show the same changed trend of the interplanar distance of two slabs, the reduced band gaps of two slabs by comparison with those of bulk system, the weakened covalent surface in the HfO2-terminated slab and the weakened ionic surface in the SrO-terminated slab. The calculated surface energies indicate the cleavability of the orthorhombic (001) surface is harder than that of cubic (001) surface. The grand thermodynamic potential shows the SrO-terminated slab is more stable. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is attributed to synergistic effects, where two or more components are required to be present together for full activity of the sample. Our previous study showed that a volatile oil of Angelica sinensis radix (VOAS) inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in culture. Here we have used a bioactivity-guided fractionation method to preserve any synergistic effects of VOAS combining countercurrent chromatography (CCC), the MTS cell viability assay and gas chromatography (GC). Using a two-phase CCC solvent system (heptane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water at a volume ratio of 27:23:27:23%), forty-five fractions were isolated, nine of which exhibited anti-endothelial properties. GC analysis showed two bioactive alkylphthalides,Z-ligustilide and n-butylidenephthalide (BP) were the major compounds detected in the bioactive fractions, and were absent in non-bioactive fractions. Our results indicate that Z-ligustilide and BP are the main constituents responsible for the anti-endothelial properties of VOAS. This rapid and reliable approach in preserving sample activity while isolating and identifying its active compounds suggests that this protocol can be a powerful tool for drug discovery from natural products.

As a neurotransmitter, serotonin plays important physiological roles both peripherally and centrally. In this study, a combination of ligand-based and structure-based methods is used to clarify the essential quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of known TPH1 inhibitors. A multicomplex-based pharmacophore (MCBP) guided method has been suggested to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of TPH1 kinase based on three crystal structures of TPH1-inhibitor complex. This model has been successfully used to identify the bioactive conformation and align 32 structurally diverse substituted phenylalanine derivatives. The QSAR analyses have been performed on these TPH1 inhibitors based on the MCBP guided alignment. These results may provide important information for further design and virtual screening of novel TPH1 inhibitors.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the chromatographic data demonstrated that 10 batches of RREs could be well-differentiated and categorized into three groups which were closely related to the origins of RREs. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the quality differentiation might be explained by at least 6 components, in which rosavin was characterized by an external reference, rosiridine was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the mass spectra of the others were provided. The observation that the level of rosavin was more relevant to the multivariate chromatographic data than the ones of salidroside and tyrosol, the other two components commonly used to standardize RREs, was confirmed by the PLS prediction models. Results of the present study not only indicated that rosavin was a rational marker to represent the quality of RREs, but also demonstrated the power of HPLC-based metabolic profiling in the quality assessment of herbal extracts.

Preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis displayed that compound 8t with a 5,6-difluorosubstituted benzothiazole was found to be a potent inhibitor of Gram-positive pathogens, and exhibited some potential against drug-resistant bacteria and without cytotoxicity in therapeutic concentrations. In addition, molecular docking studies indicated that Staphylococcus aureus methionyl-tRNA synthetase might be the possible target of these compounds. Taken together, the present study provides an effective entry to the synthesis of a good lead for subsequent optimization and a new small molecule candidate drug for antibacterial therapeutics.

Resting-state brain activity in patients with migraine provides clues to the pathophysiology of the disease. However, few studies have focused on the resting-state abnormalities in patients with migraine without aura. In the current study, we employed a data-driven method, regional homogeneity (ReHo), to analyze the local features of spontaneous brain activity in patients with migraine without aura during the resting state. Twenty-six patients with migraine without aura and 26 age-, education- and gender-matched healthy volunteers participated in this study. Compared with healthy controls, patients with migraine without aura showed a significant decrease in ReHo values in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). In addition, we found that ReHo values were negatively correlated with the duration of disease in the right rACC and PFC. Our results suggest that the resting-state abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in patients with migraine without aura. We hope that our results will improve the understanding of migraine. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Besides its benefits for human consumption, tartary buckwheat is also an important folk medicine in China for its antioxidant, antitumour, hypotensive, hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic activities. Phytochemical investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of tartary buckwheat roots led to the isolation of seven new phenylpropanoid glycosides, tatarisides A-G (1-7), together with a known phenylpropanoid glycoside, diboside A (8). Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic methods. All compounds (1-8) were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines (A-549, HCT116, ZR-75-30 and HL-60). Tatariside C (3) was the most active compound with IC50 values of 6.44-7.49 mu g/ml against the four tested cell lines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we describes a rapid and efficient separation method of combining three-step gradient elution and two-step flow-rate gradient elution using high-performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC) to separate 8 diterpene compounds simultaneously within 80 min in a single run from the alcohol extract of Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon. This separation process produced 166 mg pseudolaric acid B O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (PABGly), 152 mg pseudolaric acid C (PAC), 8 nrig deacetylpseudolaric acid A (deacetylPAA), 5 mg pseudolaric acid A O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (PAAGly), 484 mg pseudolaric acid B (PAB), 33 mg pseudolaric acid B methyl ester (PAB methyl ester), 10 mg pseudolaric acid A (PAA) and 18 mg pseudolaric acid H (PAN) from 1.0 g crude sample with purities of 98.6%, 99.6%, 92.3%, 92.2%, 99.2%, 99.4%, 98.3%, 91.0%, respectively. Our study indicates that the suitable combination of step-wise gradient elution and flow-rate gradient elution using HPCCC is an effective strategy to separate complex components from natural products.

Over recent decades the natural drying process for bulbus of Fritillariae has been replaced by sulfur-fumigation for reducing the drying duration and pest control. We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with evaporative light scattering detection (UPLC-ELSD) fingerprinting analysis and major alkaloids determination to investigate the potential damaging effect of the sulfur-fumigating process. The experimental conditions were as follows: Chromatography was proceeded on Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C-18 column; the linear gradient elution was conducted with mobile phase prepared from acetonitrile-0.02% triethylamine; the drift tube temperature was set at 40 degrees C with a nitrogen flow-rate of 30 psi, and the spray parameter was set 40%. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (R>0.9991) within the tested range. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, limit of detection and quantification. The study also has shown that sulfur-fumigated samples had significant loss of the main active compounds and a more destructive fingerprint profile when compared to the sun-dried samples.

Characterizing Acupuncture Stimuli Using Brain Imaging with fMRI - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CARPAL-TUNNEL-SYNDROME; IMPLICATED ACUPOINTS; ELECTROACUPUNCTURE STIMULATION; NEURONAL SPECIFICITY; CORTICAL ACTIVATIONS; MANUAL ACUPUNCTURE; PLACEBO ANALGESIA; SHAM ACUPUNCTURE; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS	Background: The mechanisms of action underlying acupuncture, including acupuncture point specificity, are not well understood. In the previous decade, an increasing number of studies have applied fMRI to investigate brain response to acupuncture stimulation. Our aim was to provide a systematic overview of acupuncture fMRI research considering the following aspects: 1) differences between verum and sham acupuncture, 2) differences due to various methods of acupuncture manipulation, 3) differences between patients and healthy volunteers, 4) differences between different acupuncture points. Methodology/Principal Findings: We systematically searched English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese databases for literature published from the earliest available up until September 2009, without any language restrictions. We included all studies using fMRI to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the human brain (at least one group that received needle-based acupuncture). 779 papers were identified, 149 met the inclusion criteria for the descriptive analysis, and 34 were eligible for the meta-analyses. From a descriptive perspective, multiple studies reported that acupuncture modulates activity within specific brain areas, including somatosensory cortices, limbic system, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. Meta-analyses for verum acupuncture stimuli confirmed brain activity within many of the regions mentioned above. Differences between verum and sham acupuncture were noted in brain response in middle cingulate, while some heterogeneity was noted for other regions depending on how such meta-analyses were performed, such as sensorimotor cortices, limbic regions, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Brain response to acupuncture stimuli encompasses a broad network of regions consistent with not just somatosensory, but also affective and cognitive processing. While the results were heterogeneous, from a descriptive perspective most studies suggest that acupuncture can modulate the activity within specific brain areas, and the evidence based on meta-analyses confirmed some of these results. More high quality studies with more transparent methodology are needed to improve the consistency amongst different studies.

Cheng et Hsiao, and Coptis teeta Wall. In this study, a novel approach using H-1 NMR spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis was introduced to differentiate the three species and identify potential metabolic markers for better controlling the quality of Rhizoma Coptidis. A broad range of metabolites including alkaloids, sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and fatty acids present in Rhizoma Coptidis were detected by means of H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the H-1 NMR data set showed a clear separation between all samples by PC1 and PC3, and some metabolites that could be responsible for the discrimination of the three species were identified. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to statistically verify the significance of differences in metabolite levels between species. By combining PCA and ANOVA, significantly higher contents of palmatine, coptisine, epiberberine, columbamine, and fatty acids together with lower contents of jateorrhizine were found in Coptis chinensis, whereas Coptis deltoidea and Coptis teeta showed the highest levels of sucrose and chlorogenic acid, respectively. This study indicates that metabolites of Rhizoma Coptidis vary with the species and the proposed method is suitable for metabolic fingerprinting analysis to check the genuine origin of Rhizoma Coptidis.

Recent research revealed the toxicity of Rhizoma Coptidis, but studies focusing on the relationships between the structures of PAs and their toxicities are lacking. The toxic effects of four PAs from Rhizoma Coptidis on the growth of Tetrahymena thermophila BF5 were investigated by microcalorimetry. The power-time curves of T. thermophila BF5 with and without PAs were obtained; the extent and duration of toxic effects on the metabolism of this organism were evaluated by studying thermokinetic parameters and the half-inhibitory ratio (IC50). All the thermokinetic parameters showed regular variations with alteration of PA concentrations. The magnitude of the toxic effects of PAs was ascertained from IC50 values: palmatine > jateorhizine > berberine approximate to coptisine. The structure-function relationship of PAs indicated that the C2 and C3 positions contributed more to the toxic effect of PAs. That is, when substituted with methoxyl groups, the toxic effect would be increased.

Most of the previous researches are based on well-structured datasets which are manually collected, structured and normalized by TCM experts. However, the obtained results of the former work could not be directly and effectively applied to clinical practice, because the raw free-text clinical records differ a lot from the well-structured datasets. They are unstructured and are denoted by TCM doctors without the support of authoritative editorial board in their routine diagnostic work. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework of automatic diagnosis of TCM utilizing raw free-text clinical records for clinical practice is proposed and investigated for the first time. A series of appropriate methods are attempted to tackle several challenges in the framework, and the Naive Bayes classifier and the Support Vector Machine classifier are employed for TCM automatic diagnosis. The framework is analyzed carefully. Its feasibility is validated through evaluating the performance of each module of the framework and its effectiveness is demonstrated based on the precision, recall and F-Measure of automatic diagnosis results.

It has been demonstrated that DNA barcoding is a molecular diagnostic method for species identification, which uses a single standardized DNA fragment. In this study, we tested five DNA barcoding candidates (matK, ITS, ITS2, rbcL, and psbA-trnH), and we found that ITS was the best candidate to authenticate the famous-region drug of A. anomala. Moreover, through comparative analysis of these five DNA barcodes between A. anomala and Angelica dahurica, we found that ITS had the most and ITS2 had more variable regions, but the psbA-trnH, rbcL, and matK regions were identical. Hence, we suggest ITS as the DNA barcoding to identify A. anomala and A. dahurica. Moreover, we are determined to adopt the A. anomala as the accurate Latin name of Chuanbaizhi.

We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture. Methods: We performed a multicentre, singleblind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyangspecific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5 8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migrainespecific quality of life. Results: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference 1.06 [95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.77 to 0.51, p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference 1.22 [95% Cl 1.92 to 0.52], p < 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference 0.91 [95% Cl 1.61 to 0.21], p = 0.011). We found that there was a significant, but not clinically relevant, benefit for almost all secondary outcomes in the three acupuncture groups compared with the control group. We found no relevant differences between the three acupuncture groups. Interpretation: Acupuncture tested appeared to have a clinically minor effect on migraine prophylaxis compared with sham acupuncture.

METHODS: Five hundred patients with herpes zoster were randomly divided into group A (surrounding acupuncture plus electric acupuncture), group B (cotton-sheet moxibustion), group C (puncturing with red-hot needles), group D (tapping plus cupping), and group E (Western medicine). The treatment was carried out twice a day in group E and once a day in the other four groups. The curative effect was observed on the 10th day of treatment; the cost was calculated for the five therapies, and the cost-effect ratio (C/E) and achievement ratio (Delta C/Delta E) were analyzed. RESULTS: After the 10-day treatment, there was no statistical difference (P>0.05) in the curative effect among the five groups. Pain being alleviated one day faster than in group E amounted to a saving of RMB 21.90 yuan in group A, a saving of RMB 21.87 yuan in group B, a saving of RMB 26.00 yuan in group C, and a saving of RMB 20.23 yuan in group D. Compared with group C, the values of Delta C/Delta E were RMB 1.55, 2.81, and 0.21 yuan in groups A, B, and D, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The curative effect in groups A, B, C, and D was similar to that in group E, but the C/E was better than in group E. (C) 2012 JTCM. All rights reserved.

UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was employed to determine the level of paeoniflorin and albiflorin in rat plasma using geniposide as the internal standard (IS). Unpaired Student's t-test was used for the statistical comparison. The investigation showed that there were significant differences between the normal rats and the acute cholestasis hepatitis rat groups in calculated parameters, such as AUC(0-0) AUC(0-infinity) T-max and CLz/F. The results indicated that acute liver injury in rats could alter the pharmacokinetics of drug. Since patients are the final users of the drug, it is essential to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the drug in disease status. Therefore, we used normal rats and the acute cholestasis hepatitis rats to study pharmacokinetics of Radix Paeoniae Rubra with the purpose of examining the influence of disease on the metabolic course.

Randomised clinical trial: an assessment of acupuncture on specific meridian or specific acupoint vs. sham acupuncture for treating functional dyspepsia	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							OF-LIFE SCALE; NEPEAN DYSPEPSIA; GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; INDEX; ITOPRIDE; CHINA; FMRI	Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common disease without an established optimal treatment. Aim To determine (i) the effect of acupuncture in relieving FD symptoms and improving life quality; (ii) the effect difference between acupoint and non-acupoint; and (iii) the effect difference among different acupoints. Methods A total of 712 eligible patients were included and randomly assigned to six groups (Group A: specific acupoints of the stomach meridian; Group B: nonspecific acupoints of the stomach meridian; Group C: specific acupoints of alarm and transport points; Group D: specific acupoints of the gallbladder meridian; Group E: sham acupuncture of non-acupoints; and Group F: itopride). A treatment period of 4 weeks (continuous five sessions per week), and a follow-up period of 12 weeks were arranged. The outcomes were the (i) patients' response, (ii) symptoms improvement measured using the Symptom Index of Dyspepsia and (iii) quality-of-life improvement based on Nepean Dyspepsia Index. Results All groups had an improvement in dyspepsia symptoms and the QoL at the end of treatment, and the improvement was sustained for 4 weeks and 12 weeks. The overall response rate was significantly higher in acupuncture group A (70.69%), and lower in sham acupuncture group (34.75%), compared with itopride and other acupuncture groups. Similarly, the difference in symptoms and QoL improvement was significant between group A and the other acupuncture groups. Conclusions Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of functional dyspepsia, and is superior to non-acupoint puncture. The benefit of acupuncture relies on acupoint specificity.	[Ma, T.

Although treatment with surgical excision or steroid hormones can modify the symptoms, numerous treatment-related complications have been described. In view of this, we investigated the therapeutic effects of essential oil (EO) from rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (Umbelliferae) on formed hypertrophic scars in a rabbit ear model. EO was prepared as a liposomal formulation (liposome-enveloped essential oil, LEO) and a rabbit ear model with hypertrophic scars was established. LEO (2.5, 5, and 10%) was applied once daily to the scars for 28 days. On postoperative day 56, the scar tissue was excised for masson's trichrome staining, detection of fibroblast apoptosis, assays of the levels of collagens I and III, and analysis of the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), caspase-3 and -9, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta(1)). In addition, the scar elevation index (SEI) was also determined. As a result, LEO treatment significantly alleviated formed hypertrophic scars on rabbit ears. The levels of TGF-beta(1), MMP-1, collagen I, and collagen III were evidently decreased, and caspase-3 and -9 levels and apoptosis cells were markedly increased in the scar tissue. SEI was also significantly reduced. Histological findings exhibited significant amelioration of the collagen tissue. These results suggest that LEO possesses the favorable therapeutic effects on formed hypertrophic scars in the rabbit ear model and may be an effective cure for human hypertrophic scars.

The purpose of this study was to increase the water solubility of oridonin using monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) as drug carrier. The ORI-loaded MPEG-PCL micelles were prepared by thin film hydration method. The obtained ORI-micelles could be lyophilized into powder form, which could be re-dissolved in water to form homogeneous solution. This study showed that ORI was successfully incorporated in the core-shell structure of MPEG-PCL micelles and maintained its anticancer activity. The average particle size was 25.55 +/- 0.10 nm and the mean zeta potential was -4.71 +/- 0.05 mV. The actual drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 7.99 +/- 0.03% and 99.51 +/- 0.34%, respectively. ORI could be released from MPEG-PCL micelles in a sustained manner in vitro. The permeation profiles of ORI from ORI-micelles and ORI water saturated solution through excised mouse skin demonstrated that ORI-micelles showed much better transdermal penetration performance than ORI water saturated solution. The prepared ORI-micelles have great potential for both direct intravascular administration and being further developed as a transdermal drug delivery system in cancer chemotherapy.

The treatment course for all patients was 40 days. Changes before and after treatment in terms of scoring by the IA self-rating scale, short-term memory capacity, short-term memory span, and the latency and amplitude of P300 and MMN in patients were observed. Results: After treatment, in all groups, the IA score was lowered significantly (P<0.05) and scores of short-term memory capacity and short-term memory span increased significantly (P<0.05), while the decreased IA score in the CT group was more significant than that in the other two groups (P<0.05). ERP measurements showed that P300 latency was depressed and its amplitude raised in the EA group; MMN amplitude increased in the CT group (all P<0.05). Conclusion: The EA in combination with PI could improve the cognitive function of IA patients, and its mechanism might be related to the speedup of cerebral discrimination on external stimulus and the enhancement of effective resource mobilization during information processing of the brain.

It is also widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat nephropathy. We isolated 20 compounds from the fruit, including two new lignans, rosalaevins A and B (1 and 2), and 18 phenolic compounds isolated for the first time. Their antioxidant potentials were evaluated with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, and a beta-carotene linoleate model system. Several compounds exhibited powerful antioxidant capacities. No compound inhibited nitric oxide production in macrophage cells. These results provide new insights into the role of R. laevigata fruit in the prevention of nephropathy, and may lend support to the development of this fruit as a health-promoting food.

Aim of study: In the present work, we investigated the additive or synergistic effects of absorption behavior of Radix Angelicae dahuricae extracts on baicalin, and the absorption-enhancing mechanism of Radix Angelicae dahuricae extracts on baicalin. Materials and methods: Total coumarins (Cou) and volatile oil (VO), as the two main components of Radix Angelicae dahuricae, were extracted by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) further treated with liquid-liquid separation method. The absorption behavior was investigated by applying the everted gut sac technique and in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion method. Results and conclusions: The results showed that both the Cou and the VO could improve the intestinal absorption of baicalin in vivo, and had synergistic action the enhanced absorption of baicalin. Since verapamil did not affect the P-app and K-a of baicalin significantly, we concluded that the absorption of Baicalin could not be an active transportation in dependent of P-glycoprotein-Mediated efflux systems. Based on intestinal absorption of drug studying was one of the efficacious methods to clarify the compatibility of principles of herb-pairs. The everted gut sac technique and in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion technique model were the effective methods to study the absorption of drug, the application of the animal model to investigating the absorption of herb-drug interactions or other relevant research purposes is envisioned.

(Boraginaceae) has been used in folk medicine in china to treat acute nephritis, periodontitis, acute submandibular lymphadenitis, snake bite, etc. However, there have been no scientific reports in the modern literature on the diuretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of this plant. The objective of this study is to evaluate the above activities of the Cynoglossum lanceolatum extract (CLE) in animals. Materials and methods: The diuretic effect of CLE was assessed in rats and rabbits. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using fresh egg white-induced paw edema in rats, carrageenan-elicited paw edema in adrenalectomized rats, and dimethylbenzene-induced inflammation in mice. The analgesic action was estimated in mice using the acetic acid-induced writhing test and the hot-plate test. In addition, the acute oral toxicity of CLE was studied in mice. Results: CLE strikingly and dose-dependently increased urine output of rats and rabbits, suppressed fresh egg white-induced paw edema in rats and carrageenan-elicited paw edema in adrenalectomized rats, reduced dimethylbenzene-induced ear edema in mice, inhibited the writhing response in mice, but did not increased reaction time of mice in the hot-plate test. No death of mice was observed when orally administered CLE up to 12 g/kg. Conclusions: These findings propose that CLE has evident diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and non-central analgesic activities. Furthermore the anti-inflammatory action does not rely on endogenetic glucocorticoids regulated by hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. On the other hand, CLE also shows a favorable safety.

There is no consensus about the best therapeutics to produce complete and permanent improvement of scars with few side effects. To investigate the therapeutic effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on hypertrophic scars and explore the possible mechanism of action involved, a rabbit ear model with hypertrophic scars was established. OA (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) was given once daily to the scars for 28 consecutive days. As a result, OA significantly alleviated formed hypertrophic scars on rabbit ears. The levels of TGF-beta(1), MMP-1, TIMP-1, and collagens I and III were notably decreased, and the number of apoptosis cells and mRNA expression of MMP-2, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were markedly increased in the scar tissue. The scar elevation index (SEI) was also evidently reduced. Histological findings exhibited significant amelioration of the collagen tissue. These results suggest that OA has the favorable curative effects on formed hypertrophic scars in the rabbit ear model, and the possible mechanism of action is that OA decreases HSFs proliferation and increases HSFs apoptosis by reduction of P311 gene expression and TGF-beta(1) production, inhibition of TIMP-1 secretion, enhancement of MMP-2 activity, and subsequently facilitation of degradation of collagen types I and III.

The conjugate was denoted as LMWHC-Pre. The prednisolone content of the conjugate was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Kromasil C18 column. The results showed that the average coupling degree of prednisolone to LMWHC was 76.7 +/- 3.2 mu g.mg(-1). The stability and physicochemical characterization of LMWHC-Pre under various conditions were also investigated. To study the fate of LMWHC-Pre after intravenous (i.v.) administration, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was coupled to the conjugate to explore the renal targeting efficacy. The in vivo results showed that significant amount of the conjugate was accumulated into the kidneys while negligible signal could be detected when the mixture of FITC-LMWHC and prednisolone was co-administered. The preliminary pharmacodynamics study of LMWHC-Pre showed that the conjugate could effectively alleviate the nephrotic syndrome of rats induced by minimal change nephrosis (MCN) model. Toxicity study also revealed that there was little glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis by LMWHC-Pre upon 20 days of treatment. From this study, LMWHC-Pre may be employed as an effective potential drug candidate for the treatment of chronic renal disease.

The electro-acupuncture group was treated by scalp electro-acupuncture on Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Shenting (GV 24), and Fengchi (GB 20), and the paroxetine group was treated with simple oral administration of paroxetine. The efficacy and safety of the electro-acupuncture on treatment of 69 PTSD patients were evaluated using Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) according to clinical data. The total scores of CAPS, HAMD, and HAMA in the two groups after treatment showed significant efficacy compared to those before treatment. The comparison of reduction in the scores of CAPS, HAMD, and HAMA between the two groups suggested that the efficacy in the treated group was better than that in the paroxetine group. The present study suggested that the electro-acupuncture and paroxetine groups have significant changes in test PTSD, but the electro-acupuncture 2 group was more significant.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of CHM use in cancer patients in southwestern China. Cancer patients from eleven comprehensive cancer centers were asked to complete a structured questionnaire. Of 587 available replies, 53.0% used CHM. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that educational level, stage of disease, duration of cancer since diagnosis, marital status, and previous use of CHM were strongly associated with CHM use after cancer diagnosis. The source of information about CHM was mainly from media and friends/family. CHM products were used without any consultation with a TCM practitioner by 67.5% of users. The majority used CHM to improve their physical and emotional well-beings and to reduce cancer therapy-induced toxicities. About 4.5% patients reported side effects of CHM. This survey revealed a high prevalence of CHM use among cancer patients. However, these patients did not get sufficient consultation about the indications and contradictions of these drugs. It is imperative for oncologists to communicate with their cancer patients about the usage of CHM so as to avoid the potential side effects.

Methods: Thirty six Chinese osteoporotic fracture patients and 32 Chinese healthy subjects were included in the study. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine and total body were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in all subjects. Fasting blood samples were collected from all subjects and the serum concentrations of TRACP 5b, BAP, and osteocalcin were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoradiometric assay. Results: With lower BMD, the osteoporotic fracture patients had elevated levels of TRACP 5b and BAP, compared with the healthy controls. No difference in serum osteocalcin level was observed between the fracture patients and the control. Conclusions: Elevated serum TRACP 5b and BAP, combined with or without increased osteocalcin, are valuable tools for the assessment of osteoporotic fracture risk in Chinese patients. (Clin.

Here, we present a 64-year-old woman with metastatic thyroid follicular carcinoma presenting as a primary renal tumor. The renal tumor was removed and revealed the origin of thyroid follicular carcinoma. Six months after the treatment of renal tumor, the patient was readmitted for the enlarged thyroid gland. The follicular carcinoma was revealed in the resected thyroid gland. The serum thyroglobulin level and thyroid function tests were consistently normal. Although with metastasis to the kidney, thyroid follicular carcinoma is thought to have a good prognosis.

HPLC/ESI-Q-TOF-MS was used for the chemical profiling of samples of dosed plasma, control plasma, and Radix Aconiti Lateralis decoction. A comparison was made of the resulting chemical profiles, which totaled 20 compounds including 16 prototype compounds and 4 metabolites derived from SF decoction that were detected as potential bioactive components. Using MS/MS analysis and accurate molecular weight assessments of TOF, 17 components in 20 potential bioactive compounds were structurally identified. Moreover, the pretreated plasma samples were injected into venous sinus of isolated toad hearts to investigate the cardio-toxicity according to heart ratio (HR) situation and electrocardiograph (ECG) parameters, including PR interval, QRS interval, and QT interval. Finally, 4 compounds in these 20 potential bioactive components that had closest correlation with 4 cardio-toxic experimental indexes respectively were investigated by spectrum-effect relationship model for the first time. The 4 compounds were considered as the real cardio-toxic components. This study proposed a series of potential bioactive components in Radix Aconiti Lateralis and provided a general research pattern to identify the potential bioactivity compounds in Chinese herbs or natural pharmacy.

To achieve sustained and targeted delivery of paclitaxel to tumor sites, liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and distearolyphosphatidyl ethanolamine-N-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG(2000)) were prepared by a lipid film method. In addition, the liposomes also contained truncated fibroblast growth factor fragment-PEG-cholesterol as a ligand targeting the tumor marker fibroblast growth factor receptor. Physicochemical characteristics, such as particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and release profiles were investigated. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were evaluated in C57BL/6 J mice bearing B16 melanoma after intravenous injection of paclitaxel formulated in Cremophor EL (free paclitaxel), conventional liposomes (CL-PTX), or in targeted PEGylated liposomes (TL-PTX). Results: Compared with CL-PTX and free paclitaxel, TL-PTX prolonged the half-life of paclitaxel by 2.01-fold and 3.40-fold, respectively, in plasma and improved the AUC(0 -> t) values of paclitaxel by 1.56-fold and 2.31-fold, respectively, in blood. Biodistribution studies showed high accumulation of TL-PTX in tumor tissue and organs containing the mononuclear phagocyte system (liver and spleen), but a considerable decrease in other organs (heart, lung, and kidney) compared with CL-PTX and free paclitaxel. Conclusion: The truncated fibroblast growth factor fragment-conjugated PEGylated liposome has promising potential as a long-circulating and tumor-targeting carrier system.

Here, we describe a sensitive, reproducible and reliable analytical method for the quantitative determination of fumonisins B-1 (FB1) and B-2 (FB2) in 112 spices and aromatic and medicinal herbs marketed in China. This method is based on high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) coupled to a new on-line post-column derivatization using ortho-phthaldialdehyde with 2-mercaptoethanol and immunoaffinity column clean-up. Under the optimized experimental conditions, a complete separation of FB1 and FB2 was obtained using a Synergi C-18 column and a gradient elution at 0.8 mL min(-1) with methanol and 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 3.15. The limits of detection for FB1 and FB2 were both 40 mg kg(-1). Good recoveries were found for spiked samples with FB1 and FB2, ranging from 82.34% to 98.16% for FB1 and from 72.58% to 97.10% for FB2, with relative standard deviation (RSD) <7.0%. 5 spices, 11 aromatic herbs and 96 medicinal herbs including 93 normal samples and 19 visibly moldy samples, which were spoiled artificially, were analyzed. The results showed that 8 (42.1%) visibly moldy samples and 8 (8.6%) normal samples were contaminated with FB1 at mean contents of 129.0 and 165.9 mu g kg(-1), and with FB2 at 1745.0 and 256.8 mu g k(-1), respectively. Positive confirmation of detected samples was performed by liquid chromatography tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), using a triple quadrupole analyzer and operated in the multiple reaction monitoring mode.

There were 257 variation sites amounting to 40.8% of the total base pairs. All of the data revealed abundant genetic diversity in the genus Salvia. The results showed that the tested materials could be grouped into 3 clusters, and the 3 different occasions in Salvia were clustered into 1 clade, which suggests that the species from different occasions form independent lineages. We can easily distinguish S. miltiorrhiza from a variety of Salvia species in this manner. Moreover, according to cluster analysis, S. bowleyana, S. yunnanensis, and S. cavaleriei var. simplelefolia are good or potential germplasm resources for S. miltiorrhiza.

We investigated the time trends and geographic variations in the prevalence of hypospadias in China from 1996 to 2008. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the hospital-based birth defects monitoring system in China from 1996 to 2008. We used prevalence ratios (PRs) to describe the difference in prevalence of hypospadias between urban and rural areas, as well as among different regions. Poisson regression was used to explore the long time trend for the prevalence of hypospadias and its regional disparity. RESULTS: The prevalences of hypospadias for isolated anomalies, multiple anomalies, and overall cases were 7.64, 1.39, and 9.03 per 10,000 births, respectively. The national PRs (urban vs. rural) of hypospadias for overall and isolated cases were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.161.35) and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.171.38), respectively. The highest prevalence (12.10 per 10,000 births) was observed in the eastern region. A positive correlation was found between the prevalence of hypospadias and maternal age (p < 0.01). The average annual increase of 7.43% (95% CI, 5.529.38%) was observed in the overall prevalence of hypospadias in China; it was 5.28% (95% CI, 4.166.43%) in urban areas, 9.79% (95% CI, 7.7211.90%) in rural areas, 9.08% (95% CI, 6.3611.86%) in the eastern region, 4.76% (95% CI, 2.936.62%) in the central region, and 6.57% (95% CI, 4.448.74%) in the western region.CONCLUSION: The increasing trends and differences of hypospadias prevalence by urban-rural classification and geographical location suggest that environmental exposure and maternal age might have a critical role in the development of hypospadias.

To overcome this problem and improve the specificity of immunoassays, we produced anti-ZEN antibodies based on a ZEN-cationic protein conjugate. In this study, ZEN was coupled with cationic bovine serum albumin (cBSA) via a Mannich reaction. After BALB/c mice were immunized with ZEN-cBSA, an immunological response was rapidly induced. The titers of the polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibody were 30,000 and 20,000, respectively. Cross-reactivity (CR) values of the anti-ZEN polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibody with the 5 analogs were <7% and <2%, respectively. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on the monoclonal anti-ZEN antibody was established. The recovery rates of ZEN in spiked cereal and feed were in the range of 80%-120% with coefficients of variation <15%. The intra-assay variation and inter-assay variation in assay buffer were both <5%. Therefore, the results demonstrated a feasible approach for preparing highly specific, higher titer and more rapidly induced antibodies against ZEN by using a ZEN-cBSA conjugate as the immunogen instead of currently used immunogens.

The results showed that recycling CCC is a powerful tool for compounds that are difficult to separate with common elution mode. CCC was the better option for crude material while MPLC had advantage for the final tuning. The combination of recycling CCC and MPLC could simplify the method exploring process in the separation process. The structures of these compounds were identified according to their mass spectra, by H-1-NMR and compared with standard compounds.

Herein, we reported our investigations on the chemical compositions of the phenolic compounds-rich fraction from U. atrichocaulis (TFUA) and their antirheumatoid arthritis activities. We found that the TFUA significantly inhibited the adjuvant-induced rats arthritis, carrageenin-induced rats paw edema, cotton pellet-induced mice granuloma, and the acetic acid-induced mice writhing response. Our phytochemical investigations on the TFUA resulted in the first-time isolation and identification of 17 phenolic constituents and a bis (5-formylfurfuryl) ether. The extensive HPLC analysis also revealed the chemical compositions of TFUA. Our further biological evaluation of the main phenolic components, individually and collectively, indicated that the antirheumatoid arthritis activities of TFUA were the combined effect of multiple phenolic constituents.

Allergen micro-array detection of specific IgE-reactivity in Chinese allergy patients	CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						specific immuno globulin E; micro-array; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Dermatophagoides farinae; cross-reactivity		Background Allergen micro-arrays are powerful tools for screening of serum IgE-reactivity. In this study allergen micro-arrays were used to identify dominating IgE-binding allergens and cross-reactivity patterns among selected Chinese allergy patients. Methods The study was conducted using patient sera from the cities of Guangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu and Shenyang. In total 100 sera with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) specific IgE-levels higher than 50 kU/L were selected for testing against 103 individual allergens. Results Among 100 selected patients, 95% showed IgE-reactivity towards house-dust mite allergens Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) 1, Der f 2 and Der p 2 and 94% were IgE positive against Der p 1, and 60% of sera contained IgE reacting against allergen Euroglyphus maynei (Eur m) 2. IgE against cat allergen, Felisdomesticus (Eel d) 1, was seen in 20%. Only 2% showed specific IgE-reactivity to Der p 10, a panallergen belonging to the tropomyosin family. Serum IgE-reactivity towards other allergens was in general low. IgE-reactivity against pollen allergens showed geographic differences. Conclusions This study clearly confirms that group 1 and group 2 are major allergens of house dust mites. These selected house-dust mite allergy patients are close to being mono-sensitized. Der p 10 is not an important allergen for cross-reactivity. Specific IgE-sensitization towards pollen allergens is low in southern China compared to other regions. The prevalence of food and stinging insect allergens known to give rise to IgE-mediated cross-reactivity is 2% or less.

In this study, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry was used to investigate the main chemicals in the antidiarrhoeal fraction previously isolated from Rheum palmatum L In total 10 compounds were identified in the fraction as follows: gallic acid, galloyl glucose, di-O-galloyl-glucose, glucopyranosyl-galloyl-glucose, coumaroyl-O-galloyl-glucose, trimer of catechin, catechin gallate, catechin-glucopyranoside, carboxyl-chrysophanol-O-glucose and emodin-O-glucose. The predominant components identified in the fraction were rhubarb tannins, except for two anthraquinone glycosides of low contents. The polyphenolic analysis also showed the occurrence of abundant tannins. So, the antidiarrhoeal basis of rhubarb was primarily proposed as tannin-related compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The UPLC fingerprints were evaluated using hierarchical clustering analysis. Some quantitative parameters obtained from the thermogenic curves of S. aureus growth affected by artificial C. bovis extracts were analyzed using principal component analysis. The spectrumeffect relationships between UPLC fingerprints and anti-bacterial activities were investigated using multi-linear regression analysis. The results showed that peak 1 (taurocholate sodium), peak 3 (unknown compound), peak 4 (cholic acid), and peak 6 (chenodeoxycholic acid) are more significant than the other peaks with the standard parameter estimate 0.453, -0.166, 0.749, 0.025, respectively. So, compounds cholic acid, taurocholate sodium, and chenodeoxycholic acid might be the major anti-bacterial components in artificial C. bovis. Altogether, this work provides a general model of the combination of UPLC chromatography and anti-bacterial effect to study the spectrumeffect relationships of artificial C. bovis extracts, which can be used to discover the main anti-bacterial components in artificial C. bovis or other Chinese herbal medicines with anti-bacterial effects.

Among the newly derivatives, compound 7k was the most potent one and two other compounds (7e and 7f) also exhibited greater anti-inflammatory activity than bifendate. Further in vivo studies confirmed that 7k significantly and dose-dependently inhibited carrageenan-induced paw edema and decreased the serum levels of alanine aminotransaminase, and aspartate aminotransaminase in concanavalin A-induced hepatitis model. Histopathological evaluation demonstrated that 7k has better hepatoprotective effect on acute liver injury induced by concanavalin A than bifendate, suggesting that 7k is a potential drug candidate for the treatment of hepatic injuries.

Thirty-four OVX Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three sets, and orally administrated with YGW decoction, saline or estrogen for 11 weeks, respectively. Histomorphological changes of the uterus and vagina, and serum estradiol levels were then compared. Results showed that OVX caused a dramatic atrophy of the uterus and vagina in the rats. Estrogen replacement reversed the effect of OVX, but with a side effect of endometrial hyperplasia. YGW had no significant effect on blood estradiol concentration or uterine histology, but it significantly overturned the atrophic processes of the vaginal fold and blood vessels in the lamina propria. In order to initially explore the mechanisms underlying these effects, immunostaining of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and -beta in the vagina was performed. It was shown that OVX reduced expressions of ER while YGW and estrogen replacement reversed this reduction. Our findings suggest that YGW can reverse the atrophic effect of OVX on rat vaginal plica and blood vessels in the lamina propria with little adverse effect on endometrial hyperplasia. This indicates the herbal formula as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy in the management of menopausal vaginal atrophy. Recovery of ER expressions in the vagina might be one of mechanisms underlying the effects of YGW.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentrations of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium and iron in the urine at different exposure times, as well as their levels in the renal cortex and serum at the end of treatment. Compared with the control group, exposure to lead and/or cadmium resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of these five elements during the experiment, whereas significant decreased levels of these elements were found in kidney and serum. In conclusion, increased urinary loss of antioxidant trace elements due to lead and/or cadmium exposure induced the deficiency of antioxidants in the body, which could result in further oxidative damage. Moreover, there was an obvious synergistic effect of lead combined with cadmium on the distribution patterns of these essential trace elements, which may be related to the severity of co-exposure to these two metals.

However, little is known about gender-related differences in dysfunctional brain organization, which may account for gender-specific vulnerability and characteristics of migraine. In this study, we considered gender-related differences in the topological property of resting functional networks. Methodology/Principal Findings: Data was obtained from 38 migraine patients (18 males and 20 females) and 38 healthy subjects (18 males and 20 females). We used the graph theory analysis, which becomes a powerful tool in investigating complex brain networks on a whole brain scale and could describe functional interactions between brain regions. Using this approach, we compared the brain functional networks between these two groups, and several network properties were investigated, such as small-worldness, network resilience, nodal centrality, and interregional connections. In our findings, these network characters were all disrupted in patients suffering from chronic migraine. More importantly, these functional damages in the migraine-affected brain had a skewed balance between males and females. In female patients, brain functional networks showed worse resilience, more regions exhibited decreased nodal centrality, and more functional connections revealed abnormalities than in male patients. Conclusions: These results indicated that migraine may have an additional influence on females and lead to more dysfunctional organization in their resting functional networks.

Although a considerable amount of scientific research was reported on LC in the last decade, it is currently scattered across various publications. The present review comprises the chemical and pharmacological research on LC in the last decade. Objective: The objective of this review is to bring together most of the scientific research available on LC and evaluate its effects and mechanisms. Methods: The information for 82 cases included in this review was compiled using major databases such as Medline, Elsevier, Springer, Pubmed, and Scholar. Results: The compounds contained in LC can be divided into five kinds, essential oil (EO), alkaloids, phenolic acids, phthalide lactones, and other constituents. A great deal of pharmacological research has been done, which mainly focuses on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects, antioxidation, neuroprotection, antifibrosis, antinociception, antiinflammation, and antineoplastic activity. Conclusion: A large number of pharmacological and chemical studies during the last 10 years have demonstrated the vast medicinal potential of LC. It is still very clear that LC is a plant with widespread use now and also with extraordinary potential for the future. The documents strongly support the view that LC has beneficial therapeutic properties and indicates its potential as an effective adaptogenic herbal remedy.

The rapid and reliable methods for detecting are imperative for reduction in hazard of infection. In this study, we selected primers, optimized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions, and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex PCR assay to screen raw milk from these enteric bacteria. Furthermore, EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and 11 non-targeted pathogenic strains were performed for the specificity of the multiplex PCR. Specific bands showed in EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp. but no bands showed in other 11 pathogenic strains. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR was relatively high, was rounded to 200 CFU/ml (Shigella spp. and EIEC), 320 CFU/ml (Salmonella spp.), and 100 CFU/ml (LT-E. coli). This method for simultaneous and rapid detection of enteric pathogens (EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp.) in raw milk showed high sensitivity and specificity, and led to faster track to report results.

Materials and methods: The total rhubarb extract (14.49 g kg(-1) of body weight per day based on the quantity of crude material) was administrated orally to normal and model rats for 12 weeks. The concentrations of free AQs in tissues were quantitated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). After drug withdrawal for 4 weeks, tissue distributions were again determined. Results: The five free AQs-aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion-were detected in the liver, kidney and spleen, while only rhein, aloe-emodin and emodin reached the quantitative limit. The tissue distributions of rhein (p < 0.001), aloe-emodin (p < 0.001) and emodin (p < 0.05) in normal rats were higher than those in model rats with rhein > aloe-emodin > emodin in kidney and spleen tissues and aloe-emodin > rhein > emodin in liver tissues. Free AQs were not detected in the tissues after drug withdrawal for 4 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that the tissue toxicity of AQs in normal animals is higher than that in pathological model animals with little accumulative toxicity of rhubarb. The results are concordant with the traditional Chinese theory of You Gu Wu Yun recorded first in Su Wen, a classical Chinese medical treatise. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Salidroside, with its strong antioxidative and cytoprotective actions, is of particular interest in the development of antioxidative therapies for oxidative injury in cardiac diseases. We examined the pharmacological effects of salidroside on H9c2 rat cardiomyoblast cells under conditions of oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) challenge. Salidroside attenuated H2O2-impaired cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, and effectively inhibited cellular malondialdehyde production, lethal sarcolemmal disruption, cell necrosis, and apoptosis induced by H2O2 insult. Salidroside significantly augmented Akt phosphorylation at Serine 473 in the absence or presence of H2O2 stimulation; wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, abrogated salidroside protection. Salidroside increased the intracellular mRNA expression and activities of catalase and Mn-superoxide dismutases in a PI3K-dependent manner. Our results indicated that salidroside protected cardiomyocytes against oxidative injury through activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and increasing the expression and activities of endogenous PI3K dependent antioxidant enzymes.

However, the quality control (QC) of these formulations is difficult to establish. Recently, chemical fingerprinting (CF) has been recommended as a potential strategy for the QC of herbal injections. However, some constituents cannot be detected by chromatographic methods. To establish a comprehensive QC process, biological fingerprinting (BF) was combined with CF to detect the fluctuation in quality of a herbal injection from chemical and biological aspects. Yinzhihuang injection was selected as a representative herbal injection. Ten batches of normal samples and six batches of artificially abnormal samples were collected. High-performance liquid chromatography and thermal activity monitoring were applied to develop CF and BF, respectively. The CF and BF of normal samples were similar, with good stability and consistency, but the abnormal samples were not. The results were analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis: all abnormal samples could be correctly distinguished when CF and BF were combined. The recognition ratio was higher for CF (87.5%) than for OF (93.75%). The key factors of quality fluctuation were bacterial contamination, high temperature, lighting, and sterilizing conditions. The described method could be used for early prediction of adverse drug events, which could help improve the safety of herbal injections. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pattern Recognition for the Paradoxical Effect of the Chinese Herb Rheum palmatum L. in Treating Rat Liver Injury	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CARBON-TETRACHLORIDE; GROWTH-FACTOR; HEPATITIS; MEDICINE; FIBROSIS; RHUBARB; EXPRESSION; CIRRHOSIS; EMODIN; ACID	The hepatotoxicity of some Chinese herbs has been a cause for concern in recent years. However, some herbs, such as rhubarb, have been documented as having both therapeutic and toxic effects on the liver, leading to the complex problem of distinguishing the benefits from the risks of using this herb. To comparatively analyze the dose-response relationship between rhubarb and hepatic health, we administrated total rhubarb extract(RE) to normal and carbon tetrachloride(CCl(4))-treated rats for 12 weeks at 4 dosage levels(2.00, 5.40, 14.69 and 40.00 g.kg(-1), measured as the quantity of crude material), followed by biochemical and histopathological tests of the rats' livers. A composite pattern was extracted by factor analysis, using all the biochemical indices as variables, into a visual representation of two mathematically obtained factors, which could be interpreted as the fibrosis factor and the cellular injury factor, according to the values of the variable loadings. The curative effect of administering the two lowest dosages of RE to CCl(4)-treated rats was mainly expressed as a decrease in the extent of cellular injury. The hepatoprotective mechanism of RE might be related to its antioxidant effect, the antagonism of the free radical damage to hepatocytes caused by CCl(4). By contrast, the RE-induced liver damage was mainly expressed as a significant increase in the amount of fibrosis in both normal rats at all dosage levels and CCl(4)-treated rats at the two highest dosage levels. Therefore, the hepatotoxic potential of RE could be attributable to the liver cell fibrosis induced by high doses of the herb. This study illustrates the bidirectional potential of rhubarb and demonstrates the feasibility of using factor analysis to study the dose-response relationships between herbal medicines and hepatotoxicity or the healing effects of these herbs by extracting the underlying interrelationships among a number of functional bio-indices in a holistic manner.

Their amino acid sequences are KSLRPRCWIKIKFRCKSLKF and RPRCWIKIKFRCKSLKF, respectively. One intra-molecular disulfide bridge is formed by these two half-cysteines in both piceain 1 and 2. Antimicrobial activities of synthesized piceains against several kinds of microorganisms were tested. They showed antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and fungus Candida albicans but little antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis. The results of nematicidal test showed they exerted strong nematicidal activities against Caenorhabditis elegans, following exposure for 5 h at concentrations as low as 10 mu g/ml. They had weak hemolytic abilities against human and rabbit red cells. At the concentration of 250 mu g/ml, they induced red cell hemolysis of less than 5%. Circular dichroism spectra of the two antimicrobial peptides were investigated in several solutions. Their main secondary structure components are beta-sheet and random. The current work provides a novel family of antimicrobial and nematicidal peptides with unique disulfided loop containing nine amino acid residues.

The present study attempted to establish a screening system for detecting estrogenic activity of compounds, which probably have anti-osteoporosis effects. For this purpose, we established osteoblastic-like MG63 cells stably transfected with the PGL3 reporter gene driven by a promoter consisting of three estrogen response elements (EREs). Using this system, we screened numerous plant extracts, and found several which displayed bioactivity. We conclude that the MG63 cells with estrogen-specific reporter plasmids (MG63-pERE) are useful for high-throughput screening of estrogen receptor agonists from plants which may have favorable potency and could be developed into novel anti-osteoporosis drugs.

METHODS: The rat models with persistently elevated TOP were established by the method of Akira. Then, erigeron breviscapus extract was given for one month to observe the effect on mfERG in persistently elevated TOP in rats. RESULTS: As elevated TOP went on, the mfERG changes were mainly in weaken of reaction density with progressive development. After intervention of erigeron breviscapus extract, the total peak latency of 131 wave had recovered to some extent and the difference was significant when compared with control group (P <0.05); the total response density and P1 wave response density in second circle had risen noticeably, which had significant differences than those of control group (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Erigeron breviscapus extract can improve the impaired visual function of persistently elevated TOP in rats, suggesting that this extract is the effective part of erigeron breviscapus for optic neuroprotection.

We therefore, conducted an investigation in the identification of the Angelica anomala cultivars collected in Sichuan using the ITS universal primers. About 700 bp fragments were initially obtained from the famous-region drugs sample of Zhongji village, Chuanshan County (ZJCS), depending on the ITS sequence of ZJCS, the identification results suggested that 7 samples are famous-region drugs, but the others cannot count as famous-region drugs. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate their molecular phylogenetic analysis with other 17 Angelica L. species. Our analysis revealed that A. anomala and Angelica dahurica are closely related and nested in this phylogeny tree. A. dahurica was shown the high similarity with A. anomala than any other species.

However, compared with studies of stimulation-related changes in brain activity, few studies have focused on resting brain activity, which also is important in pathogenesis. We mapped changes in resting brain glucometabolism of patients with functional dyspepsia, compared with healthy subjects, and attempted to correlate abnormal brain activity with symptom severity. METHODS: We performed fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography on 40 patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects who were in resting states. The symptom index of dyspepsia and the Nepean dyspepsia index were used to determine symptom severity. The positron emission tomography-computed tomography data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping software. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects, patients with functional dyspepsia had higher levels of glycometabolism in the bilateral insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle cingulate cortex (MCC), cerebellum, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, putamen, right parahippocampal gyrus, claustrum, and left precuneus (P < .001). The signal increase in the ACC, insula, thalamus, MCC, and cerebellum was correlated with symptom index of dyspepsia scores and Nepean dyspepsia index scores (P < .01). The glycometabolism in ACC, insula, thalamus, MCC, and cerebellum of patients with more severe functional dyspepsia was significantly higher than that of patients with less severe functional dyspepsia (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with functional dyspepsia, resting cerebral glycometabolism differs significantly from that of healthy subjects. The ACC, insula, thalamus, MCC, and cerebellum might be the key regions that determine the severity of symptoms.

Plasma soluble HLA-G is a potential biomarker for diagnosis of colorectal, gastric, esophageal and lung cancer	TISSUE ANTIGENS			English	Article						cancer diagnosis; colorectal cancer; esophageal squamous cell cancer; gastric cancer; non-small cell lung cancer; plasma; soluble HLA-G	G EXPRESSION; G MOLECULES; CLASS-I; PROTEIN; PROGNOSIS; CARCINOMA; CELLS; SERUM; TRANSCRIPTS; INDICATOR	Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a novel tumor marker and its soluble isoforms produce secretory proteins. Increased soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels have been reported in patients with melanoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoproliferative disorders, breast, ovarian and colorectal carcinoma when compared to healthy controls or subjects with benign neoplasms. The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not plasma sHLA-G can be used as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis. We measured plasma sHLA-G levels in 166 patients with early stages of colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 37), gastric cancer (GC, n = 28), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 58) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n = 43), and compared them to healthy controls (n = 260) by using a specific HLA-G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that plasma sHLA-G levels were significantly higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls (all P < 0.0001). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for sHLA-G were 0.97, 0.91, 0.98 and 0.80 for healthy controls vs CRC, GC, ESCC and NSCLC, respectively. At 100% specificity, the highest sensitivity achieved to detect CRC, GC, ESCC and NSCLC was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 89-99], 85% (95% CI, 76-94), 91% (95% CI, 88-94) and 51% (95% CI, 43-59) at a cutoff value of 49 U/ml, respectively. These findings suggest that plasma sHLA-G may be a useful molecule in the differential diagnosis of these malignancies against healthy controls.

Chemical fingerprints of artificial C. bovis samples from ten different sources were determined by UPLC-ELSD and investigated by similarity analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Antibacterial effects of these samples on Escherichia coli growth were measured using microcalorimetry. The fingerprint-efficacy relationship of chemical fingerprint and antibacterial effect of artificial C. bovis were established by multi-linear regression analysis. Our results showed that the sources and places of production of artificial C. bovis had some important influence on the chemical fingerprints and antibacterial effects of this CMM. These artificial C. bovis could be grouped into four clusters according to their chemical fingerprints and antibacterial effects. Compounds cholic acid, taurocholate sodium, hyodeoxycholic acid and one unknown compound might be the major effective components for quality control of this CMM. Fingerprint-efficacy study provided a powerful way and some insight for the quality control of artificial C. bovis and other CCMs. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Three different methods were tested: modified SDS acid phenol, modified CTAB and SDS-LiCl. Compared with the modified CTAB and SDS-LiCl methods, the method of modified SDS acid phenol would obtain initial, abundant and high-quality intact RNA from F. unibracteata. Meanwhile, the RNA-containing bands are clear and light, and the lightness of 28S rRNA is two times than 18S rRNA. The ratio of A(260)/A(280) is approximately 1.85, and the yield of total RNA is 73 mu g per g starting tissue. The specific band of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) gene by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that RNA extraction using the modified SDS acid phenol method can provide fundamental materials for further study of genetic modification in this precious Chinese medicinal plant F. unibracteata.

In this paper, we proposed a nonparametric maximum likelihood method for estimating and comparing the accuracy of different doctors in detecting a particular symptom without a gold standard when the true symptom status had an ordered multiple class. In addition, we extended the concept of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to a hyper-dimensional overall accuracy for diagnostic accuracy and alternative graphs for displaying a visual result. The simulation studies showed that the proposed method had good performance in terms of bias and mean squared error. Finally, we applied our method to our motivating example on assessing the diagnostic abilities of 5 TCM doctors in detecting symptoms related to Chills disease.

Methods A prevalence-based, disease-specific approach was used to estimate smoking-attributable direct and indirect economic costs. The primary data source was the 2003 and 2008 China National Health Services Survey, which contains individual participant's smoking status, healthcare use and expenditures. Results The total economic cost of smoking in China amounted to $17.1 billion in 2003 and $28.9 billion in 2008 (both measured in 2008 constant US$). Direct smoking-attributable healthcare costs in 2003 and 2008 were $4.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. Indirect economic costs in 2003 and 2008 were $12.9 billion and $22.7 billion, respectively. Compared to 2000, the direct costs of smoking rose by 72% in 2003 and 154% in 2008, while the indirect costs of smoking rose by 170% in 2003 and 376% in 2008. Conclusions The economic burden of cigarette smoking has increased substantially in China during the past decade and is expected to continue to increase as the national economy and the price of healthcare services grow. Stronger intervention measures against smoking should be taken without delay to reduce the health and financial losses caused by smoking.

Therefore, it is important and interesting to investigate the analgesic effect and mechanism of drugs which are used to treat migraine. Tou Feng Yu pill (TFY) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, consisting of the three Chinese herbal drugs Radix Angelicae dahuricae (Baizhi), Rhizome Ligustici (Chuanxiong) and Folium Camelliae sinensis (green tea) for the treatment of migraine. In this study, we found that TFY could significantly reduce the writhing times induced by acetic acid and licking foot response induced by formalin, and extend the writhing latent period. But the analgesic effect was not observed at hot-plate test. Meanwhile, experimental migrainous model induced by nitroglycerin was used to investigate the therapeutic effect of TFY. Compared with the control group, the levels of plasma calcitonin gene related to peptide (CGRP), serum nitric oxide (NO) and contents of brain dopamine (DA) in TFY administration groups were significantly decreased, and the levels of plasma endothelin (Er) and contents of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) were remarkably increased, also the ratio of ET/NO was clearly corrected. Furthermore, the improving effect of behavior abnormality was observed in TFY administration rats. Meanwhile, isolated vascular ring test indicated that TFY had an significant effect on vasomotion, and antagonize vasospasm; moreover TFY also could increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduce cerebrovascular resistance index (RI) in normal rabbits, which verified the effect of TFY on vasomotion and abnormal hemorheology. All the results indicate that TFY has an effective therapeutical action on migraine, which may be related to three aspects as following: firstly, adjusting the level of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and vasoactive substances, relieving neurogenic inflammation; secondly, improving vasomotion, increase cerebral blood flow, then improving hemorheology; finally, increasing pain threshold, relieving or preventing headache. These findings provide additional pharmacological information and may contribute for the further study and use of TFY as a phytomedicine. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

However, few studies have investigated the effects of internet addiction on the microstructural integrity of major neuronal fiber pathways, and almost no studies have assessed the microstructural changes with the duration of internet addiction. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the morphology of the brain in adolescents with IAD (N = 18) using an optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique, and studied the white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) changes using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method, linking these brain structural measures to the duration of IAD. We provided evidences demonstrating the multiple structural changes of the brain in IAD subjects. VBM results indicated the decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cerebellum and the left rostral ACC (rACC). DTI analysis revealed the enhanced FA value of the left posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and reduced FA value in the white matter within the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Gray matter volumes of the DLPFC, rACC, SMA, and white matter FA changes of the PLIC were significantly correlated with the duration of internet addiction in the adolescents with IAD. Conclusions: Our results suggested that long-term internet addiction would result in brain structural alterations, which probably contributed to chronic dysfunction in subjects with IAD. The current study may shed further light on the potential brain effects of IAD.

Three concentrations of phillyrin (0.2, 0.4 and 1.5 mg) were tested and the results showed that phillyrin cannot be absorbed in the digestive tract. The absorption rates of forsythiaside in stomach were 7.773, 7.228 and 6.751% h(-1) for 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg, and no significant difference was found in different concentrations. The absorptions of forsythiaside in intestine were investigated in different concentrations and different absorption sites. The mean P% were 6.618, 7.199, 9.210 and 9.747% h(-1) of forsythiaside in intestine for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5 mg dosage, and the statistical analysis showed that the absorption had no relation with concentration. In addition, in different digestive segments, the mean P% were 7.528, 8.382, 8.191, 9.109 and 6.908% h(-1) for the gastric, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, respectively. No statistical differences of absorption were found for forsythiaside among different digestive segments indicated no specific absorption site was found.

Human plasma protein binding ability of honokiol was also investigated. PEGylated liposomal honokiol was prepared by thin film evaporation-sonication method. Its mean particle size was 98.68 nm, mean zeta potential was -20.6 mV and encapsulation efficiency were 87.68 +/- 1.56%. The pharmacokinetics of PEGylated liposomal honokiol was studied after intravenous administration in Balb/c mice. There were significant differences of parameters T(1/2 beta) and AUC(0 ->infinity) between them and liposome lengthened T(1/2 beta) and AUC(0 ->infinity) values. The mean T(1/2 beta) value of PEGylated liposomal honokiol and free honokiol were 26.09 min and 13.46 min, respectively. The AUC(0 ->infinity) ratio of PEGylated liposomal honokiol to free honokiol was about 1.85-fold (219.24 mu g/mL min/118.68 mu g/mL min) (P = 0.000). Examination of protein binding ability showed that honokiol with 0.5, 8.0 and 20 mu g/mL concentrations in human plasma achieved the percent of bound between 60% and 65%. The results suggested that PEGylated liposomal honokiol improved the solubility, increased the drug concentration in plasma, and withstanded the clearance. Besides, the percent of protein bound of honokiol in human plasma was between 60% and 65%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The advantages of this method have been well documented such as reducing the separation time and solvent consumption. In the EECCC method, the time point of the extrusion step is very important during the whole separation process as it directly affects the resolutions, separation time and solvent consumption. However, how to choose a suitable time point to perform the extrusion step without decreasing the resolution has not been studied yet. In the present study, a strategy for systematically calculating the time point for extrusion was developed in theory and five bioactive compounds from the extract of Dendrobium chrysototxum Lindl. were separated and compared using normal CCC and EECCC method. Our results demonstrated that the accurate time point to perform the extrusion could be calculated and reduced both separation time and solvent consumption without losing separation performance. Using this EECCC method, five bioactive compounds were separated and purified with high purity. The separation time and solvent consumption were decreased from 200 min to 100 min and 5-2.5L during the separation process while the resolutions were still acceptable. Finally, 63 mg, 48 mg, 97 mg, 162 mg and 43 mg of hydroxyl phenanthrenes and bibenzyls with the purity of 98.7%, 98.0%, 98.2%, 99.0% and 98.7%, respectively were isolated from 1.2g crude extract of D. chrysototxum Lindl. initially purified by column chromatography in one step separation. The purities of compounds were determined by HPLC. Their structures were identified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and NMR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: The rats were treated by intraperitoneal injection of 10% CCl4 for 12 weeks. At the end of week 4, rhubarb at doses of 40 g kg(-1) (high-dose group), 20g kg(-1) (medium-dose group) and 10 g kg(-1) (low-dose group) was intragastrically administered to CCl4-treated rats once a day for three weeks. At the end of week 16, all rats were maintained for 1 month without any administration. At the end of weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20, the general status of rats, histopathology of liver, serum alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels were observed, respectively. Combined with clustering analysis and correspondence analysis, the "dose-time-response" relationships of rhubarb on the liver injury rats were synthetically investigated. Results: High dose (40 g kg(-1)) of rhubarb exhibited a significant protective effect on injured liver by reversing the biochemical parameters and histopathological changes. But, this hepatoprotective effect will be weakened, even be transferred to toxicity with increasing the administration dose and time of rhubarb. These results were consistent with the histopathological observation and the determination of serum levels. Conclusions: The safety should be considered simultaneously in the long-term and high dose use of rhubarb, the liver function and change should be regularly detected. This study provided some useful references for the clinical rational use of rhubarb and other herbal medicinal products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, the toxicities of three ISE were evaluated by dynamic parameters of thermal metabolic curves. In addition, the irritative effects of the ISE on myoblast L-6 cells were investigated to show their cytotoxicities by biochemical method. The results indicated that the effects of the ISE on T. thermophila BF5 varied for different ISE. 5% inhibition concentration values (IC5) of the ISE were 1.33, 1.83 and 1.64 mg/mL for tween 80, HP-beta-CD and poloxamer 188, respectively. By the principal component analysis (PCA), the total quantity of heat (Q), growth rate constant (k) and second maximum power (P-2) were selected as the main characteristic parameters to present their toxicities, there were good linear relationships between Q, k, P-2 and concentrations c, suggesting that the toxicities of the ISE on T. thermophila BF5 were closely linked to their concentrations. The results of creatine kinase (CK) bioassay of myoblast L-6 cells indicated that the sequence of irritative effects of the ISE was HP-beta-CD<poloxamer 188<tween 80, which added to the results obtained from microcalorimetry.

In the present study, we report three novel avian cathelicidin orthologs cloned from a constructed spleen cDNA library of Coturnix coturnix, using a nested-PCR-based cloning strategy. Three coding sequences containing ORFs of 447, 465 and 456 bp encode three mature antimicrobial peptides (named Cc-CATH1, 2 and 3) of 26, 32 and 29 amino acid residues, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that precursors of Cc-CATHs are significantly conserved with known avian cathelicidins. Synthetic Cc-CATH2 and 3 displayed broad and potent antimicrobial activity against most of the 41 strains of bacteria and fungi tested, especially the clinically isolated drug-resistant strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration values in the range 0.3-2.5 mu m for most strains with or without the presence of 100 mm NaCl. Cc-CATH2 and 3 showed considerable reduction of cytotoxic activity compared to other avian cathelicidins, with average IC(50) values of 20.18 and 17.16 mu m, respectively. They also exerted a negligible hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes, lysing only 3.6% of erythrocytes at a dose up to 100 mu g center dot mL-1. As expected, the recombinant Cc-CATH2 (rCc-CATH2) also showed potent bactericidal activity. All these features of Cc-CATHs encourage further studies aiming to estimate their therapeutic potential as drug leads, as well as coping with current widespread antibiotic resistance, especially the new prevalent and dangerous 'superbug' that is resistant to almost all antibiotics.

However, chemotherapy is obstructed by the physical obstacle formed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Honokiol has been known to possess potent activities in the central nervous system diseases, and anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties. Here, we hypothesized that honokiol could cross the BBB and BCSFB for the treatment of gliosarcoma. Methodologies: We first evaluated the abilities of honokiol to cross the BBB and BCSFB by measuring the penetration of honokiol into brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid, and compared the honokiol amount taken up by brain with that by other tissues. Then we investigated the effect of honokiol on the growth inhibition of rat 9L gliosarcoma cells and human U251 glioma cells in vitro. Finally we established rat 9L intracerebral gliosarcoma model in Fisher 344 rats and human U251 xenograft glioma model in nude mice to investigate the anti-tumor activity. Principal Findings: We showed for the first time that honokiol could effectively cross BBB and BCSFB. The ratios of brain/plasma concentration were respectively 1.29, 2.54, 2.56 and 2.72 at 5, 30, 60 and 120 min. And about 10% of honokiol in plasma crossed BCSFB into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In vitro, honokiol produced dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of rat 9L gliosarcoma cells and human U251 glioma cells with IC(50) of 15.61 mu g/mL and 16.38 mu g/mL, respectively. In vivo, treatment with 20 mg/kg body weight of honokiol (honokiol was given twice per week for 3 weeks by intravenous injection) resulted in significant reduction of tumor volume (112.70 +/- 10.16 mm(3)) compared with vehicle group (238.63 +/- 19.69 mm(3), P = 0.000), with 52.77% inhibiting rate in rat 9L intracerebral gliosarcoma model, and (1450.83 +/- 348.36 mm(3)) compared with vehicle group (2914.17 +/- 780.52 mm(3), P = 0.002), with 50.21% inhibiting rate in human U251 xenograft glioma model. Honokiol also significantly improved the survival over vehicle group in the two models (P < 0.05). Conclusions/Significance: This study provided the first evidence that honokiol could effectively cross BBB and BCSFB and inhibit brain tumor growth in rat 9L intracerebral gliosarcoma model and human U251 xenograft glioma model. It suggested a significant strategy for offering a potential new therapy for the treatment of gliosarcoma.

The results showed that thermokinetics parameters of PHA titrated with 20% rabbit RBC were: K (3.24X10(5) L.mol(-1)) Delta(r)G(m)(circle minus) (-32.722 kJ.mol(-1)), Delta(r)H(m)(circle minus) (-238.548 kJ.mol(-1)), Delta(r)S(m)(circle minus) (-0.664 kJ.mol(-1).K(-1)). The hemoagglutination is exothermic reaction for Heat>0, and it could progress spontaneously for Gibbs free energy was negative (Delta G<0), and the reaction was entropy decreasing and driven by enthalpy (Delta H<0, Delta S<0, vertical bar Delta H vertical bar>vertical bar T Delta S vertical bar), the driving force may be chemical bonding force, Van der Waals force and hydrogen bond interaction, the reaction system kept in stable and ordered condition after agglutination. In conclusion, the admix ampoule microcalorimetry established in this study could be adopted as an effective technique for sensitive, precise, quantitative and consecutive detection of hemoagglutination and other antigen-antibody reactions.

In present study, we proposed a drug delivery system formulated with biocompatible and biodegradable cholesterol-block-poly (ethylene glycol) (Chol-PEGz(000)-COOH) polymer. And the surface of the polymer was chemically linked with truncated bFGF fragments (tbFGF). The tbFGF could recognize fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) that are highly expressed by a variety of human cancer cells. The micelles had a size distribution of about 10-50 nm and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel to LL/2 cells as demonstrated by KIT test (IC(50)=0.21 mu g/mL for tbFGF conjugated Chol-PEG(2000)-COOH micelles (tbFGF-M-PTX) versus 26.43 mu g/mL for free paclitaxel, respectively). Flow cytometry revealed the cellular uptake of rhodamine B encapsulated in the tbFGF-conjugated micelles was increased by 6.6-fold for HepG2, 6.2-fold for A549, 2.9-fold for C26 and 2.7-fold for LL/2 tumor cells, respectively, compared with micelles without tbFGF. The fluorescence spectroscopy images further demonstrated that the tbFGF conjugated micelles could specifically bind to the tumor cells that over-expressed FGFRs and then release rhodamine B into the cytoplasm. Our results suggest the tbFGF conjugated Chol-PEG(2000)-COOH micelles have great potential application for tumor targeting therapy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, the total anti-oxidant capability (T-AOC) activity were detected. Results: After administration of MHD, the mice showed increased oxygen consumption (P<0.01). Compared with MHD group, the remaining rate of MXSGD mice on the hot pad was found to be significantly increased with the cold-hot pad differentiating assay (P<0.05). There was no significant difference (P>0.05) among the remaining rates of MXSGD, MXSGD with high dose Gypsum Fibrosum (MXHGF) group, and MXSGD with low dose Gypsum Fibrosum (MXLGF) group mice. Compared with the MHD group, T-AOC activity of the mice in the Consensus Compositons group was significantly decreased (P=0.0494). Compared with the MXSGD group, T-AOC activity of Gypsum Fibrosum (GF) group was increased significantly (P=0.0013). Conclusions: The differences in cold and hot nature could be represented objectively between MHD with a hot nature and MXSGD with a cold nature. The reason may be the Gypsum Fibrosum which decreased the efficacy of the consensus compositions. However, increasing or decreasing the dose of Gypsum Fibrosum will not change the cold and hot nature of MXSGD.

Materials and methods: The dried roots of Coptis chinensis Franch, Coptis deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao, and Coptis teeta Wall (Ranunculaceae) were identified by Prof. Xiao-He Xiao. The herbs were tested using thermal activity monitor (TAM) air isothermal microcalorimeter, ampoule mode, to evaluate the biological activity. The dynamic energy metabolism information about the Staphylococcus aureus growth at 37 degrees A degrees C was analyzed with principal component analysis. Results: From the principle component analysis on quantitative parameters, the action of various R. coptidis on S. aureus growth at 37 degrees A degrees C could be easily evaluated by analyzing the change of values of the two main parameters: the growth rate constant of first stage (k(1)) and the maximum heat rating of the first stage (P(1)). And the results of paired t-test show that there were no notable differences between inhibitory ratios calculated with k(1) and that of P(1). Using microdilution method, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of C. chinensis, C. deltoidea, and C. teeta were detected, and they were 77.8 +/-+/- 2, 116.6 +/-+/- 4, 93.3 +/-+/- 2 mu mu g/mL, respectively. Discussion and conclusion: This work provided a useful method for the evaluation of antibacterial activity of various R. coptidis.

Rhizoma and the fraction(s) with the strongest antibacterial activity. Methods: Using microcalorimetry, the influence of different extraction fractions of C. Rhizoma obtained by decoction, reflux, and ultrasound techniques on Escherichia coli growth was investigated by analyzing the power--time curves and some thermokinetic parameters. Then the antibacterial activities of each fraction of C. Rhizoma were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Meanwhile, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the strongest antibacterial fraction was determined by 2-fold dilution method. Results and conclusion: The petroleum ether (PE), chloroform (CHCl(3)), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and n-butyl alcohol (n-BuOH) fraction, water extract, and the residue after extraction all inhibited the growth of E. coli. The potency of the inhibitory effects was as follows: n-BuOH fraction > EtOAc fraction > CHCl(3) fraction > PE fraction > residue after extraction > water extract. The decoction technique was regarded as the optimum extraction technique. The n-BuOH fraction from the decoction technique was observed to have the strongest antibacterial fraction with half-inhibitory concentration IC(50) of 1.68 mg/mL and MIC of 200 mu mu g/mL.

Materials and methods: The analgesic effect of DCE was measured in mice using the acetic acid-induced writhing test and the hot-plate test. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model and the dimethylbenzene-induced mouse inflammation model. The antipyretic effect was estimated using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat fever model. In addition, the acute oral toxicity of DCE was studied. Results: DCE significantly and dose-dependently inhibited the writhing responses in mice, increased reaction time in mice in the hot-plate test, reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and the dimethylbenzene-induced ear edema in mice, and attenuated LPS-induced fever in rats. Furthermore, no death was observed when mice were orally administered DCE up to 40 g/kg. Discussion and conclusion: DCE possesses evident analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities, and has a favorable safety, which supports the use of D. caudatum as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug in folk medicine.

In this study, an attempt was made to access the safety of rhubarb to both immature and aged rats to provide some references for its clinical usage. Materials and methods: The total extract of rhubarb was administered intragastricly to both immature and aged rats once a day and lasted for 5 weeks. Then histopathologic and biochemical examinations were performed. Results: No death was observed in immature rat groups, while 23.3% (21/90) subjects in aged rat groups died and most of the death cases were observed in the high-dosage (40 g kg(-1) of body weight per day od, counted on the quantity of crude material) group. The death rate between aged and immature rats was found of significantly statistical difference. Dosage-dependent histopathologic changes in kidney were observed in all the rhubarb-treated rats, principally involving the proximal tubules. Kidney changes in aged rats were severer than those observed in immature ones. Hepatic cells necrosis was occasionally observed in the middle- and high-dosage aged rat groups and minimal biliary hyperplasia was found in all the rhubarb-treated aged rats. Increased incidences of activated Kupffer cells and lymphocytic infiltration were found in all the rhubarb-treated rats. And dosage-dependent increase of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and notable increase of IL-8 was found in aged rat groups. Conclusions: The immature and aged rats showed reversed responses to the toxic potential of rhubarb extract. Elderly subjects were susceptible to the toxicity of high-dosage rhubarb, which drove rigorous consideration on rational use of rhubarb to aged people. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Screening for novel antifungal agents is in great demand, but traditional microbiological techniques are far from sufficient to meet that requirement. In this study, a non-invasive and non-destructive microcalorimetric method was performed to investigate the antifungal activities of cholic acid (CA) and its derivatives, glycocholic acid (GCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA) on the multiplying and non-multiplying metabolism of Candida albicans. Then, the heat-flow power-time curves of C. albicans growth affected by different concentrations of CA, GCA and TCA were studied by similarity analysis (SA), the quantitative thermokinetic parameters from these curves were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA). By comparing the values of two main parameters, P(2) (the heat-flow output power of the highest peak) and Q(2) (the heat output of the second exponential growth phase) of C albicans, it could be found that CA had the strongest antifungal activity among the three steroid compounds, which might be used as a potential antifungal agent in the future. This study provided a useful method and idea of microcalorimetry with chemometrics to efficiently evaluate the antifungal activities of bile acid derivatives, giving some references for screening out new antifungal agents. However, it has to be stressed that all these experiments are carried out in vitro and they still require clinical validation. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mutations in ATP2C1, which encoding the human secretory pathway Ca(2+)/Mn(2+)-ATPase protein 1 (hSPCA1), have been identified as the pathogenic gene of HHD. We found a novel, distinct, heterozygous mutation during study of a Chinese patient with HHD. We identified a C -> T transition at nucleotide 1235 (p.Thr352IIe), in exon 13 of ATP2C1. This observation would be useful for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for affected families and in expanding the repertoire of ATP2C1 mutations underlying HHD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Brain repair following HIBD is closely associated with cellular processes such as cell survival, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. In recent years, many studies have suggested that ginsenoside Rg1, one of the major active ingredients of ginseng, may increase neural viability, promote angiogenesis, and induce neurogenesis. However, there are few reports on roles of Rg1 in HIBD repair, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Recently, a Chinese drug consisting of Rg1 has been shown to be a potential regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha expression in HIBD. Since it has been shown that HIF-1 alpha is a key transcription factor involved in the neuroprotective response to HIBD, it is possible that Rg1 could facilitate the process of brain repair, possibly modulating cell survival, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis after HIBD by targeting HIF-1 alpha.

Three concentrations of phillyrin were tested in transport studies. The absorptive transports of phillyrin in the two cell models were not concentration-dependent which indicated passive diffusion as the dominating process in the test concentrations. The absorptive P(app) were 7.15, 6.39 and 10.03 x 10(-6) cm s(-1), respectively, for different concentrations (2.2, 4.8 and 8.4 mu g ml(-1)) in Caco-2 cells. And the low absorptive P(app) was consistent with the low oral bioavailability of phillyrin observed in pharmacokinetic experiments. In transport inhibition experiment, the efflux inhibitors, verapamil and GF120918 can increase the absorption of phillyrin in Caco-2 cells which suggested the involvement of efflux transporters.

Methods: The growth-thermogram curves of Escherichia coli (E. coli) affected by Shexiang (Moschus) and Bingpian (Borneolum Synthcticum) at different concentrations were determined with microcalorimetry, and the power-time curves (thermogram curves) of E. coli metabolism and characteristic parameters, such as growth rate constant (k), maximum output power (P-m), peak time (t(p)), total heat-output (Q(t)), etc. were analyzed with the principal component analysis (PCA) to find the close correlative parameters, so as to objectively reflect the drug property differences of Shexiang (Moschus) and Bingpian (Borneolum Synthcticum). Results: The values of P-2 in the second exponential growth phase increased with the increase of the concentrations of Shexiang (Moschus) and Bingpian (Borneolum Synthcticum), and the P-2 of Shexiang (Moschus) was larger than that of Bingpian (Borneolum Synthcticum); Q(2) increased with the increase of the concentrations of Shexiang (Moschus), but for Bingpian (Borneolum Synthcticum) it was opposite. It is indicated that they have different effects on P-2 and Q(2) of E. coli in the second exponential growth phase, and have differences in warm and cold natures. Conclusion: The microcalorimetry can accurately and objectively appraise differences of the drug property of Shexiang (Moschus) and Bingpian (Borneolum Synthcticum) and verify the objectivity and authenticity of the drug property, so as to provide a new and useful method for studies of the drug property of Chinese drugs.

METHODS A Sprague-Dawley to Wistar rat transplant kidney-sclerosis accelerated model was constructed and transfected with short hairpin RNA-TGF-beta 1 based on the hydromechanics. Kidney and blood samples were collected at the first, second, and third months after transplantation. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of TGF-beta 1, phosphorylated Smad3/7, E-cadherin, and type I collagen. The fibrosis extent was assessed using Masson staining. The immunohistochemical staining of E-cadherin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were used to label the tubular epithelial cells and fibroblast, respectively. RESULTS The blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were lower in the plasmid group than in the control groups (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). The expression of TGF-beta 1 was significantly inhibited by the plasmid and its target gene type I collagen (P < .05 or P < .01), in which the signal proteins of phosphorylated Smad3 was downregulated and phosphorylated Smad7 was upregulated. Also, the fibrosis of the renal allograft was improved and milder fibrosis was present in the plasmid group. In addition, short hairpin RNA-TGF-beta 1 plasmid maintained the expression of E-cadherin on tubular epithelial cells, resulting in inhibition of cell transdifferentiation from epithelial cells to fibroblast. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that short hairpin RNA-TGF-beta 1 plasmid could prevent the fibrosis of renal allografts. The mechanism might be associated with its effects of downregulating phosphorylated Smad3 and upregulating phosphorylated Smad7, leading to the suppression of epithelial-myofibroblast transdifferentiation and extracellular matrix synthesis.

Its main functions in physiological conditions are to abolish maternal immune cell activity against fetus and to establish immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. In oncology, HLA-G molecules are aberrantly expressed in a variety of human neoplastic diseases and play an important role in the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance. In the past few years, making use of HLA-G protein expression in tissues and circulating levels in body fluids as a tumor marker have been the focus of extensive research in the diagnosis and prognosis of several human malignancies. In addition, this molecule might be a promising target for future immune therapeutic approaches based on its immune tolerant functions and its highly specific expression for malignant transformation. In this review, we will summarize available literature data as well as our own works on HLA-G in cancer, and address some of the issues concerning its application in human neoplasia.

Materials and methods: The total extract of rhubarb (TR) was extracted with 60% ethanol and the total anthraquinones extract (TA), total tannins extract (TT) and remaining components extract (RC) of rhubarb were separated from TR using macroporous resin. The pharmacological effects of each extract on the intestinal function of mice were evaluated by defecation test and the antidiarrhoeal activity of rhubarb tannins as well as its mechanism was studied by different animal models and histopathological examination. Results: Both TR and TA produced purgative activities, but the purgative activity of TA was stronger than that of TR. Successive administration of TT produced an antidiarrhoeal activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Besides, successive administration of RC showed no significant effect on the intestinal function of mice. The antidiarrhoeal activity of rhubarb tannins was confirmed directly for the first time and its mechanism was probable that rhubarb tannins generated protein-precipitating reaction to the gastrointestinal mucosa due to its protein-precipitating action. Conclusions: The results confirmed that rhubarb had the diarrhoeogenic and antidiarrhoeal bidirectional effects due to the coexistence of anthraquinones and tannins. The bidirectional effects might be the reason or one of the reasons for the adverse effects of long-term use of rhubarb as a purgative. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Plasma samples were pre-purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with Oasis MAX cartridge. Separation of emodin and 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (internal standard) was performed on an Acquity BEH UHPLC C-18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m) with gradient elution of methanol and 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution. The LC/MS system was operated under multiple reaction monitoring mode using electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative ion mode. The results showed that this established method was valid and sensitive for ernodin within 0.04-16.4 mu g/mL, with low limits of detection and quantification of 0.6 ng/mL and 2.4 ng/mL, respectively and upper limit of quantification of 220.0 ng/mL. The intra- and interday variations were below 4.9% of RSD. The extraction recoveries were 98.9-106.1% with RSD of 1.9-3.2%. The plasma concentration-time relationship showed that the absorption of emodin in stomach was faster than in intestine segments. The sequence of absorption amount was: ileum > jejunum > colon approximate to duodenum > stomach. Most of emodin was absorbed in ileum, and the absorption amount was increased with prolonged retention of drug form in intestine, especially in ileum and jejunum. The developed UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was appropriate for determining the in vivo absorption of emodin in other herbal medicines or preparations containing this compound.

Twenty-two peaks appeared in the HPLC-MS base peak chromatogram of CP detected by the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, and the alkaloids were identified according to the MSn data, the known MS fragmentation rules and the literature data. Five alkaloids including berberine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine, phellodendrine and magnoflorine were simultaneously determinated by the HPLC-DAD. Berberine was the primary component in all CP samples, and the contents of berberine and palmatine were exploited to be two critical parameters for effective discrimination between the two species of CP. The average content of berberine in CPC(58.75 mg/g) was higher than that in CPA(9.16 mg/g), while the content of palmatine was less, only 0.25 mg/g in CPC and 4.19 mg/g in CPA. With the use of PCA, samples datasets were separated successfully into two different clusters corresponding to the two species, and berberine, palmatine, phellodendrine and magnoflorine contribute most to the above mentioned calssifying. The proposed method proved to be a useful tool in the quality control of Chinese herbal medicines.

Screening for novel antibacterial agents targeting not only multiplying but also non-multiplying bacteria using appropriate approach is in great demand. In this study, the microcalorimetric method was used to measure the metabolic curves of E. coli growth affected by chenodeoxycholic acid (COCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). By analyzing the metabolic curves and thermo- kinetic/dynamic parameters, the antibacterial activities of COCA and UDCA on multiplying and non-multiplying bacteria of Escherichia coli (E. coli) were evaluated. The results illustrated that, for the multiplying metabolism of E. coli, the two compounds controlled the anaerobic fermentative, with IC50(1) (half-inhibitory concentration) of 566.2 mu g/mL for CDCA and 573.6 mu g/mL for UDCA, respectively, but had no effective action on aerobic metabolism of the bacteria. The action of the two compounds on the non-multiplying metabolism was studied by taking the heat output of E. coli in the stationary phase as the additive guideline of the activity. The values of IC50(2) were 543.4 and 547.5 mu g/mL,and MSC50 (minimum stationary-cidal concentration 50) were 532.6 and 537.3 mu g/mL for COCA and UDCA, respectively. So, COCA had more powerful antibacterial activity on E. coli than UDCA either for multiplying bacteria or non-multiplying metabolism, and they both showed stronger activities on non-multiplying metabolism than on multiplying metabolism of the bacteria. The microcalorimetric method should be strongly suggested in screening novel antibacterial agents for fighting against multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Background: Cancer chemoprevention is a proven effective strategy for oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). The present study was designed to investigate the effects of crocin, a potential chemopreventive agent, on growth and DNA and RNA content in a human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line, Tca8113. Methods: Tca8113 cells were treated with crocin for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mM. Tumor cell viability was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, Tca8113 cells were treated with 0.4 mM crocin and cytotoxic effects as an inducer of apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Furthermore, acridine orange (AO) staining and observation using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to determine the effects of the drug on nucleic acid synthesis. Results: Crocin decreased Tca8113 cell viability and growth remarkably at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05). In addition, 0.4 mM crocin significantly induced both early and late apoptosis of Tca8113 cells. Moreover, the cellular DNA and RNA content was significantly downregulated by 0.4 mM crocin compared with the negative control (P<0.01). Conclusions: Our observations support the feasibility of applying crocin as a chemoprophylactic agent and treatment for OSCCs.

Twelve KDS subjects and three healthy spouses from this family were included in this study. Genomic DNA samples were genotyped utilizing an Affymetrix 100 K single nucleotide polymorphism array, and CNVs were identified by Copy Number Algorithm (CNAT4.0, Affymetrix). Our results demonstrate that 447 deleted and 476 duplicated CNVs are shared among KDS subjects within the family. The homologus ratio of deleted CNVs was as high as 99.78%. One-copy-duplicated CNVs display mid-range homology. For two copies of duplicated CNVs (CNV4), a markedly heterologous ratio was observed. Therefore, with the important exception of CNV4, our data shows that CNVs shared among KDS subjects display typical Mendelian inheritance. A total of 113 genes with established functions were identified from the CNV flanks; significantly enriched genes surrounding CNVs may contribute to certain adaptive benefit. These genes could be classified into categories including: binding and transporter, cell cycle, signal transduction, biogenesis, nerve development, metabolism regulation and immune response. They can also be included into three pathways, that is, signal transduction, metabolic processes and immunological networks. Particularly, the results reported here are consistent with the extensive impairments observed in KDS patients, involving the mass-energy-information-carrying network. In conclusion, this article provides the first set of CNVs from KDS patients that will facilitate our further understanding of the genetic basis of KDS and will allow novel strategies for a rational therapy of this disease.

To explore the genetic traits of Kidney-yang deficiency syndrome (KDS). Design. Twelve KDS subjects and three spouses from a typical KDS family were recruited. Their genomic DNA samples were genotyped by Affymetrix 100K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) SNPs were generated using GeneChip DNA analysis software (GDAS, Affymetrix). Genes located within 100 bp of the flanks of LDSNPs were mined via GeneView. 29 exons of the doublecortin domain containing 5 (DCDC5), a representative gene within the flank of an LD SNP, were resequenced. Results. Five LD SNPs display midrange linkage with KDS. Two genes with established functions, DCDC5 and Leucyl-tRNA synthetase, were mined in the flanks of LD SNPs. Resequencing of DCDC5 revealed a nonsynonymous variation, in which 3764T/A was replaced by C/G. Accordingly, the Ser(1172) was substituted by Pro(1172). The S1172P substitution effect was evaluated as "possibly damaging" by PolyPhen. Conclusion. We have identified a genomic variation of DCDC5 based on the LD SNPs derived from a KDS family. DCDC5 and other genes surrounding these SNPs display some relationships with key symptoms of KDS.

It has three progressive stages with complex metabolic deregulations in the holistic system of Western medicine. Chinese medicine classifies DR into two different syndrome types; integrating Western and Chinese medicine to treat DR is a validated therapeutic approach in China. In this research, the systemic metabolite change of DR was investigated from the viewpoint of both Western and Chinese medicine, using metabolomics based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data revealed both perspectives can reflect the metabolic patterns, development and differentiation of DR, and the data also had good correlation and complementarity in characterizing the process of DR. Potential biomarkers of DR based on the two perspectives indicated the alterative modes of metabolites and metabolic pathways in the disease, e. g. the disturbance in fatty acids, amino acids and glucose, etc. The results showed the usefulness and validity of combining both Western and Chinese medicine to study the subtypes of DR and the mechanisms involved.

Using a TAM Air Isothermal Calorimeter, ampoule method, the power-time curves of E. coli growth at 37 degrees C affected by Benzoinum and Styrax were measured. By analysing some quantitative thermokinetic parameters, such as growth rate constants k, the maximum heat-out power P(m), the time of the maximum heat-out power t(m), the total heat production Q(t) and inhibitory ratio I, one could find that low concentrations (0-3.9 mg mL(-1)) of Benzoinum and Styrax had stimulation effects on E. coli growth, and high concentrations (7.8-125.0 mg mL(-1)) of these two drugs would inhibit the growth of the bacteria. The antibacterial effects of Benzoinum and Styrax can also be expressed as half inhibitory concentration IC(50). The IC(50) values for Benzoinum and Styrax are 78.5 and 88.0 mg mL(-1), respectively, which suggests that the antibacterial effect of Benzoinum on E. coli was much stronger than that of Styrax. This study provides a useful method to investigate the effects of herbal medicines on microbes. It also supplies some references for the application of Benzoinum and Styrax in clinical treatment.

In the context of the brain, gene manipulation is best targeted to specific subsets of cells in order to achieve a physiologically relevant outcome. Polymerase II-based viral expression systems can be used to cell-specifically express constructs incorporating flanking and loop sequences from endogenous microRNA (miRNA), which directs the designed hairpins into the endogenous gene silencing machinery. While many studies have documented non-cell-selective gene knock-down in the brain, it has not been tested whether different cell types or different areas of the central nervous system (CNS) are equally amenable to this approach. We have evaluated this issue using a tetracycline (Tet)-controllable and cell-specific miRNA 30 (miR30)-based short hairpin (shRNA) interference system. Results: To achieve targeted expression two cell type-specific promoters were used; the enhanced compact glial fibrillary acidic protein (GfaABC(1)D) promoter and the enhanced human synapsin-1 (SYN) promoter. Powerful luciferase (Luc) and the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene knock-down were achieved both in vitro and in vivo. Administration of doxycycline (Dox) abrogated gene silencing. However, the efficacy of gene knock-down in both neurones and astrocytes in the hippocampus (HIP) was lower than that in the dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem (DVC). This was not due to regional differences in the expression of the the key enzymes involved in miRNA processing. Conclusions: The results from the presented experiments demonstrated that selective gene knock-down in subsets of brain cells is achievable. However, there are some presently unknown regional factors which affect either the processing of miRNA-based cassettes or their potency for gene silencing.	[Liu, Beihui; Xu, Haibo; Paton, Julian F.

Composite formulae containing mixtures of CMM are prescribed for treatment and prevention of diseases in the practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Some of the well-known CMM formulae (Fufang in Chinese) are manufactured and marketed as proprietary Chinese medicines (PCM). Quality assessment and assurance of these products are difficult; they are a challenging task. Mid-infrared spectroscopy, a classic molecular structure analysis method, has been innovatively applied in the quality control of TCM, and has gained significant impact and advancement in analytical fields. Infrared fingerprinting features appear particularly suitable for the identification of multicomponent matrices in samples whose chemical integrity has not been altered or destroyed because no extraction procedure is needed. This review summarizes and gives an overall view on the application of mid-infrared and two-dimensional correlation infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy as well as chemometric techniques in the identification of CMM, investigation of TCM processing procedures, and analysis of herb extracts and preparations.

Chinese Rhubarb has been claimed to have a therapeutic value as a bacteriostatic drug. It is also known that total rhubarb anthraquinone mixture and its individual components such as emodin are the effective components. However, the catechins component in Chinese Rhubarb such as catechin has not been characterized. In the present study, the power-time curves of Escherichia call growth were obtained and the action on them by addition of catechin in different concentrations in vitro were studied by microcalorimetry. The results suggest E. coli growth is inhibited by catechin in a dose-dependent manner starting from the concentration of 0.05 to 1.6 mg mL(-1). The correspondence analysis reveals k(2) and P-2 are the significant parameters to evaluate the anti-microbial effect. Microcalorimetry is a useful tool to evaluate the anti-microbial effect with its sensitive and significant quantitative information. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By reviewing published data on the effects of BH and BHG and the control of blood glucose in treating SIRS and sepsis, we found that (1) BH and BHG were beneficial in the treatment of SIRS and sepsis in humans and animals; (2) BH and BHG also had great effect in lowering blood glucose level; and (3) the tight control of blood glucose during critical illness substantially improved the outcome. Considering these data together, we hypothesize that one of the major mechanisms of BH and BHG in treating SIRS and sepsis is to lower the blood glucose level. The findings also suggest that the application of BH and BHG can extend to many acute illnesses and injuries, which commonly cause hyperglycemia.

Signaling through the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) has been shown to stimulate the growth and motility of a wide range of cancer cells. gamma-Synuclein (SNCG) is primarily expressed in peripheral neurons but also overexpressed in various cancer cells. Overexpression of SNCG correlates with tumor progression. In the present study we demonstrated a reciprocal regulation of IGF-I signaling and SNCG expression. IGF-I induced SNCG expression in various cancer cells. IGF-IR knockdown or IGF-IR inhibitor repressed SNCG expression. Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase were involved in IGF-I induction of SNCG expression. Interestingly, SNCG knockdown led to proteasomal degradation of IGF-IR, thereby decreasing the steady-state levels of IGF-IR. Silencing of SNCG resulted in a decrease in ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and its downstream signaling components, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Akt, and ERK1/2. Strikingly, SNCG physically interacted with IGF-IR and IRS-2. Silencing of IRS-2 impaired the interaction between SNCG and IGF-IR. Finally, SNCG knockdown suppressed IGF-I-induced cell proliferation and migration. These data reveal that SNCG and IGF-IR are mutually regulated by each other. SNCG blockade may suppress IGF-I-induced cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, IGF-IR inhibitors may be of utility in suppressing the aberrant expression of SNCG in cancer cells and thereby block its pro-tumor effects.

The thermogenic power-time curves of S. aureus growth in the presence of the two drugs were determined by a thermal activity monitor (TAM) air isothermal microcalorimeter, ampoule mode, at 310 K. Some quantitative metabolic parameters, such as growth rate constant k, the heat-flow power P, the appearance time for the heat power t, and the heat production Q were obtained from these curves. By analyzing these curves and some quantitative parameters using principal component analysis (PCA), the antibacterial effects of Benzoinum and Styrax on S. aureus growth were accurately evaluated from the change of the two main parameters, the heat-flow power for the second peaks P (2nd) and total heat production Q (t): the antibacterial effects of the two drugs at concentrations of 0-125 mg mL(-1) were both enhanced with increasing the concentration, and Benzoinum with IC(50) of 132.2 mg mL(-1) had stronger antibacterial effect than Styrax with IC(50) of 179.8 mg mL(-1). This study provides some useful references for the application of Benzoinum and Styra as potential antibacterial agents.

Heat flow power (HFP)-time curves of the growth metabolism of S. dysenteriae affected by berberine were determined using the thermal activity monitor (TAM) air isothermal microcalorimeter, ampoule mode, at 37 A degrees C. By analyzing these curves and some quantitative parameters using multivariate analytical methods, similarity analysis (SA) and principal component analysis (PCA), the antibacterial activity of berberine on S. dysenteriae could be accurately evaluated from the change of the two main parameters, the maximum heat flow power P (m) (2) and total heat output Q (t): berberine at low concentration (25 mu g mL(-1)) began to inhibit the growth of S. dysenteriae, high concentrations (50-200 mu g mL(-1)) of berberine had strong antibacterial activity on S. dysenteriae, when the concentration of berberine was higher (250-300 mu g mL(-1)), this antibacterial activity was stronger. All these illustrated that the antibacterial activity of berberine on S. dysenteriae was enhanced with the increase of the concentration of this compound. Berberine can be used as potential novel antibacterial agent for treating multidrug-resistant Shigella. This work provided a useful idea of the combination of microcalorimetry and multivariate analysis for studying the activity of other compounds or drugs on organisms.

The compounds were identified on the basis of the comparison of their mass spectra with literature data and those of standard samples and quantified by the HPLC-DAD method. Baseline separation was achieved on an XTerra C-18 column(5 pm, 250 mmx4.6 mm i. d.) with linear gradient elution of formate buffer(consisting of 0.5% formic acid, adjusted to pH=4.5 with ammonia) and acetonitrile(consisting of 0.2% formic acid and 0.2% triethylamine). The method was validated for linearity(r(2)>0.9995), repeatability(RSD<3.1%), intra- and inter-day precision(RSD<1.8%) with recovery(99.9%-105.1%), limits of detection(0.15-0.35 mu g/mL), and limits of quantification(0.53-0.82 mu g/mL). The similarities of 32 batches of Rhizoma Coptidis and their classification according to their manufacturers were based on the retention time and peak areas of the characteristic compounds. The five compounds were selected for quality assessment of Rhizoma coptidis via partial least squares analysis(PLS).

(C. longa) using a Waters BEH Shield RP C(18), 2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 mu m column. The runtime was 2 min. The influence of column temperature and mobile phase on resolution was investigated. The method was validated according to the ICH guideline for validation of analytical procedures with respect to precision, accuracy, and linearity. The limits of detection were 40.66, 49.38 and 29.28 pg for C, DMC and BDMC, respectively. Limits of quantitation for C, DMC and BDMC, were 134.18, 164.44 and 97.50 pg. respectively. Linear range was from 3.28 to 46.08 mu g/ml. The mean +/- SD percent recoveries of curcuminoids were 99.47 +/- 1.66, 99.50 +/- 1.99 and 97.77 +/- 2.37 of C, DMC and BDMC, respectively. Comparison of system performance with conventional HPLC was made with respect to analysis time, efficiency and sensitivity.

The similarity of thermogenic curves and thermodynamics parameters were investigated as evaluation index, such as the growth rate constant in the first exponential phase (k (1)), maximum power in the first exponential phase (P (1)), maximum power in the secondary exponential phase (P (2)), peak time in the first exponential phase (T (1)), peak time in the stationary phase (T (2)) and the total heat production in stage 1 (Q (1)), and the total heat production in stage 2 (Q (2)). Chemometric analysis was used as a reference for the bioactivity evaluation of medicinal animal horns. The results indicated that the similarity between CST and the control was smaller than that between CCP, CC and the control. Both CCP and CC could increase the heat in the microbial growth, whereas CST decreased it. The biotic thermal activity of different medicinal animal horns was objectively, qualitatively, and quantitatively evaluated by the similarity of thermogenic curves and thermodynamics parameters analysis.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and CT images of 42 consecutive patients with surgically and pathologically proven retroperitoneal neoplasms within the perirenal space. The patients were divided into renal tumors group (n = 16) and non-renal tumors group (n = 26). The former included nephroblastoma (n = 15) and renallymphoma (n = 1), while the latter included neuroblastoma (n = 12), retroperitoneal teratoma (n = 6), adrenal ganglioneuroma (n = 4), retroperitoneallymphoma (n = 2), ectopic pheochromocytoma (n = 1) and adrenal cortical carcinoma (n = 1). The clinical information of these patients and the major CT imaging findings which were related to lesion localization in the two groups were compared and statistically analyzed using Pearson Chi-Square Test and Risk Estimate. Results: The mean diameter of tumors was 9.82 +/- 6.13 cm (n = 42 range: 2.3-32 cm). The demographic data and chief clinical symptoms between the renal tumor group and the non-renal tumor group showed no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05). 30.8% (8/26) of non-renal tumor patients presented elevated urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) level, while no patient showed elevated VMA in renal tumor group (P < 0.05). Some CT imaging signs of the renal tumors including "crescent sign" (odds ratio, OR = 52), "beak sign" (OR = 84), "embedded organ sign" (OR = 84), and "prominent feeding artery sign" (OR = 36) showed significantly higher incidence when compared to the non-renal tumors (P < 0.001). The sign of "renal displacement and renal axis rotation" (OR = 0.059) was seen in 23 of 26 (88.5%) non-renal tumors, but in only 5 of 16 (31.3%) renal tumors (P < 0.001). The sign of "extra-renal central plane of tumor" (OR = 0.038) was displayed in 24 of 26 (92.3%) non-renal tumors, but in only 5 of 16 (31.3%) renal tumors (P < 0.001). The CT findings such as "pseudocapsule" (OR = 38.5), "necrosis and cystic change" (OR = 11.2), "vascularity" (OR = 16.867), "distant metastasis" (OR = 5.96), and "inferior vena cava tumor thrombus" which were thought to be characteristic of renal tumors were observed with significant higher incidence in renal tumors group than in the non-renal tumors group (P < 0.05); while CT signs of "irregular mass" (OR = 0.045) and "intratumoral calcifications" (OR = 0.065) were observed with lower incidence in renal tumors group than in the non-renal tumors group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The "crescent sign", "beak sign", "embedded kidney sign" and "renal arteries feeding" are the most specific CT signs suggestive of renal tumors and distinguish them from non-renal origin tumors within the perirenal space. Other CT signs, such as "pseudocapsule", "hypervascular tumors" and "Inferior vena cava tumor thrombus", when present, tumors of renal origin are strongly suggested. On the other hand, CT signs of "irregular mass", "intratumoral calcifications", and associated elevated urinary vanillylmandelic acid strongly suggest the non-renal tumors.

By microcalorimetry, the power-time curves of the metabolism of T. thermophila BF5 at 28 degrees C were measured and some quantitative parameters were obtained from these curves. Then the action of berberine on this microbe was investigated. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of berberine against T. thermophila BF5 growth was obtained by tube dilution method. Berberine of different concentrations had various actions on T. thermophila BF5 growth: a low concentration (25 mu g/ml) of berberine began to inhibit the growth of T. thermophila BF5 and a high concentration (450 mu g/ml) of berberine completely inhibited T. thermophila BF5 growth. The toxic action of berberine could also be expressed as half-inhibitory concentration IC50, i.e., 50% effective in this inhibition. The value of IC50 was 175.60 mu g/ml, while the MIC of this compound against T. thermophila BF5 was 20.76 mg/ml. Berberine has strong toxic action on T. thermophila BF5 growth. The microcalorimetric method for the assay of toxic action is quantitative, inexpensive and versatile.

The main characteristic absorption peaks of musk represented the key components such as macrocyclic ketone (2 923, 2 851 cm(-1)), polypeptides(1 655, 1 546 cm(-1)) and steroids (1 400, 1 038 cm(-1)) respectively. Ensuing from the researches artificial musk and natural musk resemble the exemplar of market nature musk. Particularly, the infrared spectra of samples of natural musk and artificial musk are more similar and hard to be distinguished. In virtue of derivative spectra analysis, the resolution of spectra is advanced; several kinds of standard musk have been differentiated directly and effectively. This method was fast, sensitive, direct and nondestructive, and could he used to identify the source of rare materia medica and distinguish the counterfeits of musk successfully.

This study aims to examine the effect of concurrently using rosiglitazone (RSG) on inhibiting glucosamine (GlcN)-induced islet beta cell apoptosis and dysfunction. Using an islet beta cell line, HIT-T15 cells, as a study platform, the inhibitory effect of RSG on GlcN-induced pathophysiological changes in islet beta cells was examined. The results showed that treatment with GlcN induced HIT-T15 cell death via apoptotic pathway, inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, enhanced the expression of Bax, Bid and caspase-3, reduced the production of ATP and decreased in insulin secretion. The changes were in a GlcN dose-dependent manner. Concurrently using RSG with GlcN, the induced pathogenic changes in HIT-T15 cells were abrogated. We conclude that concurrently using RSG can be useful in reducing the GlcN-induced side effects on islet beta cells that has potential to prevent the complications caused by GlcN in the treatment of diabetes.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIALS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DIETARY-SUPPLEMENTS; PREVALENCE; FORMULAS	Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) as an adjunctive method to standard therapy for patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CHM to treat DFU were searched in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (R); EMBASE; Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Allied & Complementary Medicine Resources (AMED); and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Two (2) researchers independently assessed the quality and validity of included trials and extracted outcome data for synthesis. Results: Six (6) trials were included for analysis. Compared to using standard therapy alone, CHM combined with standard therapy significantly increased the number of patients whose ulcers healed (risk ratio [RR], 0.62, [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-0.97]) and number of patients with at least a 30% reduction in the ulcer area (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71-0.92]). In addition, the two therapies combined significantly decreased the number of patients without any improvement (RR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.21-0.53]). However, with respect to blood flow volume in the dorsal artery of the foot, no significant difference between the two therapies was observed (standardized mean difference, 1.71 [95% CI - 1.25-4.67]), but the result favored the CHM combined with standard therapy group. Only 2 of 6 trials reported adverse events, which included nausea, epigastric pain, and dry mouth. Conclusions: CHM may be effective and safe as an adjunctive therapy for treating DFU. However, a firm conclusion could not be reached because of the poor quality of the included trials. Further trials with higher quality are justified.

Previous studies have shown that Valeriana jatamansi Jones extract exhibits clear anxiolytic effects, but it is unclear about the mechanism underlying regulation of the HPA axis dysfunction in these anxiolytic effects. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Valeriana jatamansi Jones (Zhizhu Xiang) extract on HPA axis function in a rat model of anxiety, and to compare these effects with positive control estazolam. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: Randomized, controlled, animal experiment was performed at Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China, between February and September in 2006. MATERIALS: Estazolam was purchased from Shanghai Jiufu Pharmaceutical, China; Valeriana jatamansi Jones was purchased from the Lotus Pond Market for Chinese Herbal Medicine in Chengdu. It consisted of iridoids and flavonoid components. METHODS: A total of 72 Sprague Dawley rats, aged 2 months, were randomly assigned to 6 groups: low-, medium-, and high-dose Valeriana jatamansi Jones groups intragastrically injected with 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 g/kg per day Valeriana jatamansi Jones extract, respectively; estazolam group intragastrically injected with 1.5 mg/kg per day estazolam; model and normal groups administered 5 mL physiological saline. Anxiety was established in all groups, except the normal group, through the use of elevated plus-maze test at 7 days following drug administration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood 3-endorphin and corticosterone levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following treatment with Valeriana jatamansi Jones extract. Expressions of HPA axis-related genes were measured by cDNA microarray. RESULTS: Blood 3-endorphin and corticosterone levels were significantly greater in the model group than in the normal group. Compared with the model group, levels decreased with Valeriana jatamansi Jones extract or estazolam treatment, particularly in the low-dose Valeriana jatamansi Jones group (P < 0.01). cDNA microarray results demonstrated that corticotropin-releasing hormone and Orexin, which are associated with HPA axis function, were differentially expressed; expression increased in the model group, but decreased in rats treated with Valeriana jatamansi Jones extract. CONCLUSION: Valeriana jatamansi Jones extract plays a role in regulating HPA axis function in a rat model of anxiety, and this effect was superior to estazolam.

The heat power (HP)-time curves of S. aureus growth affected by CA and DCA were studied by similarity analysis (SA), respectively. Then the quantitative thermo-kinetic parameters obtained from these curves were investigated by the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA). By analyzing the two main parameters, growth rate constant k(2) of the second exponential phase and the heat power P(2) of the second highest peak, together with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10 mu g/mL for CA and 20 mu g/mL for DCA, it could be concluded that the antibacterial effect of CA was stronger than that of DCA. The existence of alpha-OH at C-7 position of steroid nucleus of bile acid derivatives enhanced the hydrophilicity of compound CA and its inhibitory effect on S. aureus. This study provides a useful method and idea to accurately evaluate the antibacterial effects of bile acid derivatives, which provides some references for screening out new antibacterial agents with high efficacy and low toxicity.

Microcalorimetric assay on the antimicrobial property of five hydroxyanthraquinone derivatives in rhubarb (Rheum palmatum L.) to Bifidobacterium adolescentis	PHYTOMEDICINE			English	Article						Hydroxyanthraquinone; Antibacterial activity; Bifidobacterium adolescentis; Microcalorimetry; Structure-function relationship	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; DIETARY MODULATION; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; RADIX-ISATIDIS; FERMENTED MILK; GROWTH; MICROBIOTA; BACTERIA; TRIAL	It was found that the intestinal bacteria balance would be deteriorated by rhubarb especially in long term treatment. Bifidobacteria is one of the most common species of probiotics in human intestine. The suppression of this particular probiotic, such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis, one of the dominant anaerobes in the intestines of humans, might lead to imbalance of intestinal flora and is considered to be potentially riskful for human health. Hence, the inhibitory effects of the five main components of hydroxyanthraquinones (HAQs) contained in rhubarb on B. adolescentis growth were investigated by microcalorimetry to discover the suppression potential of rhubarb and the structure-function relationship of such HAQs. The value of the maximum power- output (P(max)) and slope (k) of the thermogenic growth curves of B. adolescentis were found of decrease in the presence of the five HAQs, while the peak time (T(p)) of the thermogenic curves were found to be delayed. The sequence of antimicrobial activity of the five HAQs is rhein > emodin > aloe-emodin > chrysophanol > physician. The functional groups carboxyl, hydroxyl and hydroxylmethyl on phenyl ring in HAQs could improve the antimicrobial activity. The influence of substituent groups on anti- B. adolescentis activity might be related with the polarity and the sequence was carboxyl > hydroxyl > hydroxylmethyl > methyl and methoxyl.

However, since the 1990s the prevalence of vasectomy in Sichuan, has declined significantly compared to female sterilization in Sichuan and national prevalence of male/female sterilization during the same period. To explore possible reasons for this decline, 27 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 8 in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in four strata of Sichuan. Procedures for qualitative data analysis were used. The findings reveal the decline in vasectomy in Sichuan Province is influenced by multiple factors, including shifts in demographics, changes in family planning working approach and people's perceptions of reproduction, lack of information and misunderstandings about vasectomy, the stereotype of male dominance, bias and preference of program and provider, and the impact of a market economy. Several implications arise from the study for future program development.

The rheological properties of polymer solutions, including Gelrite, alginate, and Gelrite/alginate solution, were evaluated. In addition, the effect of formulation characteristics on in vitro release and in vivo precorneal drug kinetic of matrine was investigated. It was found that the optimum concentration of Gelrite solution for the in situ gel-forming delivery systems was 0.3% (w/w) and that for alginate solution was 1.4% (w/w). The mixture of 0.2% Gelrite and 0.6% alginate solutions showed a significant enhancement in gel strength at physiological condition. On the basis of the in vitro results, the Gelrite formulations of matrine-containing alginate released the drug most slowly. For each tested polymer solution, the concentration of matrine in the precorneal area was higher than that of matrine-containing simulated tear fluid (STF) almost at each time point (p < 0.05). The area under the curve of formulation 16 (0.2%Gelrite/0.6%alginate) was 4.65 times greater than that of containing matrine STF. Both the in vitro release and in vivo pharmacological studies indicated that the Gelrite/alginate solution had the better ability to retain drug than the Gelrite or alginate solutions alone. The tested formulation was found to be almost non-irritant in the ocular irritancy test. The overall results of this study revealed that the Gelrite/alginate mixture can be used as an in situ gelling vehicle to enhance ocular retention.

The extent and duration of toxic effects on metabolism were evaluated by studying the growth rate constant (k), maximum heat-output power (P-max) and half inhibitory concentration (IC50). Experimental results showed that the values of k and P-max decreased as the concentrations of BD increased. Furthermore, the growth rate constant (k) was linked to the concentration of BD: r(cinobufagin)=0.9910 (IC50=119.2 mu g.mL(-1)); r(bufalin)=0.9923 (IC50=106.14 mu g.mL(-1)); r(bufotalin)=0.9977 (IC50=73.80 mu g.mL(-1)); r(gamabufotalin)=0.9923 (IC50=54.75 mu g.mL(-1)). The sequence of toxicity for the four BDs was: gamabufotalin>bufotalin>bufalin>cinobufagin. The alpha-hydroxy group at C11, beta-hydroxy group at C14, beta-acetoxy at C16 and the non-dehydrolysis between C14 and C15 can possibly improve the toxicity of BD towards Tetrahymena thermophila BF5.

J	Qiao, SJ; Tang, CJ; Jin, HD; Peng, J; Davis, D; Han, N				Qiao, Shaojie; Tang, Changjie; Jin, Huidong; Peng, Jing; Davis, Darren; Han, Nan			KISTCM: knowledge discovery system for traditional Chinese medicine	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Traditional Chinese medicine; Knowledge discovery; Data mining; Herbal formula	TEXT	Objective: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) provides an alternative method for achieving and maintaining good health. Due to the increasing prevalence of TCM and the large volume of TCM data accumulated though thousands of years, there is an urgent need to efficiently and effectively explore this information and its hidden rules with knowledge discovery in database (KDD) techniques. This paper describes the design and development of a knowledge discovery system for TCM as well as the newly proposed KDD techniques integrated in this system. Methods: A novel Knowledge dIscovery System for TCM (KISTCM) is developed by incorporating several data mining techniques, primarily including a medicine dependency relationship discovery algorithm, an efficacy dimension reduction algorithm based on neural networks, a method for exploring the relationships between formulae and syndromes using gene expression programming (GEP), and an approach for discovering the properties in terms of nature, taste and meridian based on the herbal dosage by employing the effect degree function to calculate the effect of each property. Results: Representative experimental cases are used to evaluate the system performance. Encouraging results are obtained, including rules previously unknown to algorithm designers and experiment runners. Experiments demonstrate that KISTCM has powerful knowledge discovery and data analysis capabilities, and is a useful tool for discovering the underlying rules in formulae. Our proposed techniques successfully discover hidden knowledge from TCM data, which is a new direction in knowledge discovery. From TCM experts' perspective, the accuracy of data analysis for KISTCM is an improvement, and these results compare favorably to other existing TCM data mining techniques. The system could be expected to be useful in the practice of TCM, e.g., assisting TCM physicians in prescribing formulae or automatically distinguishing between minister and assistant herbs in a formula.

The contents of Ber, Jat and Pal were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and the compatibility imitation recipes were prepared according to the content proportion of three kinds of alkaloid in the herb. The power-time curves of Bacillus shigae growth affected by Coma chinensis Franch, Ber, Jat, Pal and these compatibility imitation recipes were monitored by microcalorimetry. Meanwhile, the bio-thermo-kinetics parameters obtained from these curves were analyzed using correspondence analysis. Coptis chinensis Franch, Ber, Jat, Pal and compatibility imitation recipes had different inhibitory effect on Bacillus shigae growth. The antibacterial effects of Copia chinensis Franch and the compatibility imitation recipes were stronger than single alkaloids in this herb, and the compatibility imitation recipes did not showed obvious synergistic effect. It could be concluded that the antibacterial effect of Coptis chinensis Franch was due to the integrated action of its many components.

In order to clarify the influence of sulfur fumigation on pharmacokinetics of the main monoterpene glucoside components in white peony root, an investigation was carried out to compare the pharmacokinetics of sodium paeoniflorin sulfonate (1) and paeoniflorin (2), benzoylpaeoniflorin sulfonate (3) and benzoylpaeoniflorin (4), as well as 1 in sulfur fumigated white peony root extract (SWPE) and 2 in white peony root extract (WPE). Materials and methods: A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was developed to determine the plasma concentrations of the four analytes. Kunming species of mice were orally administered the four compounds and the two extracts with approximately the same dose. Results: It was found that C x and AUC of 1 and 3 were increased (P < 0.05), and the T(max) and t(1/2) were prolonged (P < 0.05) by comparison with that of 2. Similar results were also observed for the pharmacokinetics parameters of 1 in SWPE and 2 in WPE. However, benzoylpaeoniflorin (4) was not detected in plasma collected at certain intervals after administered orally to mice. Conclusions: These results indicate that sulfonation of the monoterpene components could improve the bioavailability and delay the absorption of them in mice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

On a Waters Acquity UPLC (R) BEH C(18) column, seven analytes were efficiently separated using 0.2% aqueous formic acid acetonitrile as the mobile phase in a gradient program. The evaporator tube temperature of ELSD was set at 100 degrees C with the nebulizing gas flow-rate of 1.9 L/min. The results showed that this established UPLC-ELSD method was validated to be sensitive, precise and accurate with the LODs of seven analytes at 2-11 ng, and the overall intra-day and inter-day variations less than 3.0%. The recovery of the method was in the range of 97.8-101.6%, with RSD less than 3.0%. Further results of PCA on the contents of seven investigated analytes suggested that compounds of cholic acid, deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid or cholesterol should be added as chemical markers to UPLC analysis of C. bovis samples for quality control and to discriminate natural C. bovis sample and its substitutes or some spurious breeds, then normalize the use of natural C. bovis and ensure its clinical efficacy.

Nine types of FZ decoction pieces, including one raw slice and eight processed forms, were therefore prepared, each in 7 to 10 batches, to assess for their toxicity. Altogether 84 FZ samples were quantified on the amount of highly toxic diester diterpenoid alkaloids, i.e., aconitine, mesaconitine and hypaconitine by a newly developed HPLC method with HPLC-DAD and LC-MS techniques. The comparison of the processed FZ to raw slices of the root showed that the amount of each analyte in the processed FZ was drastically decreased. The sum of the three toxic compounds in the 8 types of processed FZ was only 3.91-34.80% of this value in the FZ raw slice. This implies that the toxicity of processed FZ was decreased significantly. The amounts of toxic components in the 8 types of processed FZ varied significantly, often by a power of ten, indicating that the dosage of these herbs, when prescribed for clinical uses, should be cautiously set in order to avoid poisoning incidents.

Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DS1 is one of the activating receptors of NK cell and is implicated in slowing disease progression in HIV infection. KIR3DS1 play an important role in the outcome of multiple diseases associated with viral infections. In contrast to the inhibitory receptor, much less is known about the ligands of KIR3DS1. In order to achieve a better understanding of the biology of KIR3DS1 and its ligand systems, it is necessary to identify the ligands of KIR3DS1. In this work, we utilized recombinant HLA-B2705 molecules and DsbA-KIR3DS1 fusion protein to monitor the interaction between HLA-B2705 complexes and DsbA-KIR3DS1 using BIAcore 3000 SPR sensor and found that the specific binding between KIR3DS1 and HLA-B2705 existed and the affinity was 6.95 x 10(-6) mol//L. So we concluded that HLA-B2705 is a possible ligand of KIR3DS1.

As recorded, the origins of Caulis clematidis armandii are the dried stems of Clematis armandii Franch. and C. montana Buch. -Ham. But due to the similarity in morphology, it is difficult to distinguish C. armandii and C. montana from other Clematis species. As a result, some Clematis species were mistakenly used as Caulis clematidis armandii, and caused potentially dangerous consequences. To overcome the limitation of the traditional morphological methods, an efficient molecular method was developed to better distinguish Caulis clematidis armandii from its common adulterants. Two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments specific for C. armandii and C. montana were sequenced and primers were designed for sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. The two obtained SCAR markers were specific to both C. armandii and C. montana, but were absent from other Clematis species. The protocol developed in this study can be further applied to rapid authentication of Caulis clematidis armandii and its common adulterants.

Rapid detection and characterization of foodborne pathogen S. aureus is crucial for epidemiological investigations and food safety surveillance. It is still a challenge to detect and identify bacterial pathogens quickly and accurately according to the samples. In this study, we have amplified 16S rRNA of S. aureus by specific primers, designed oligonucleotide probes, detected the sensitivity and specificity of the microarray assay, and also identified S. aureus in the raw milk samples by hybridization. The S. aureus and 2 control pathogens (Streptococcus suis in pigs and Shigella) were used for specificity of the microarray assay. Based upon the hybridization results, universal probes for bacterial pathogens, S. aureus probe, Staphylococcus spp. probe, nucleic acid fixture positive controls and positive experimental control showed positive signals with targeted S. aureus. The samples were diluted from 10(1) to 10(6) cfu per ml for evaluating the sensitivity of the microarray assay. The levels were as high as 10(3) cfu per ml, all of the samples showed positive signals. This method for rapid and effective detection and identification of S. aureus in raw milk demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity.

Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure harms pregnant women and the fetus. China has the world's largest number of smokers and a high male smoking prevalence rate. Objective. To compare exposure to SHS among rural and urban Chinese non-smoking pregnant women with smoking husbands, and analyze factors associated with the level of SHS exposure and hair nicotine concentration Setting. Sichuan province, China. Population. In all 1,181 non-smoking pregnant women with smoking husbands recruited from eight district/county Women and Children's hospitals. Methods. The women completed a questionnaire in April and May 2008. Based on systematic sampling, 186 pregnant women were selected for sampling the nicotine concentration in their hair. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine correlates with self-reported SHS exposure ( total and at home); linear regression was conducted for the sub-sample of hair nicotine concentrations. Main outcome measures. Secondhand smoking exposure rates, hair nicotine levels. Results. About 75.1% of the non-smoking pregnant women with smoking husbands reported regular SHS exposure. The major source of exposure was through their husband. In the multivariate analysis, the risk of greater SHS exposure ( total and at home) and hair nicotine concentration was increased for women who were rural, had a husband with greater cigarette consumption, less knowledge about SHS, less negative attitudes about SHS, and no smoke-free home rules. Conclusions. The high prevalence rate of SHS exposure suggests that it is important for non-smoking pregnant women, especially rural women, to establish smoke-free home rules and increase knowledge and negative attitudes towards SHS.

A mixture of acetonitrile-water(0.2% formic acid) was selected as the mobile phase with the flow rate of 1 mL/min using gradient elution program. An All-tech 2000ES evaporative light scattering detector(ELSD) was connected to this HPLC equipment with the drift tube temperature of 100 degrees C and nitrogen gas flow-rate of 1.9 L/min. Under the selected chromatographic condition, cholesterol, bile acids and its sodium salts had ideal resolutions and good peak shapes. The experimental results showed that the logarithm of peak area of each standard component was linearly correlated to the logarithm of injected mass within an acceptable range(r > 0.9972) with the recoveries of 98.8% - 112.7% and the limits of detection of 0.001 - 0.007 g/L. The established HPLC-ELSD method is simple, quick and could be used for the simultaneous determination of multicomponent contents in Calculus Bovis, further to reflect the differences of internal quality and provide more references for the quality control of this rare medical material.

Methodology: The history of wasting-thirst was classified into four periods: (1) the nomenclature of wasting-thirst; (2) the monograph of wasting-thirst; (3) the understandings of sweet urine and its extensive development; and (4) the integration of wasting-thirst and diabetes. Results: By mining and reviewing the literature in the 2000-year history of wasting-thirst, it is believed that TCM has a profound understanding of, and effective management on, diabetes and its complications. For period one, wasting-thirst was first recorded in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine. For period two, it was elaborated in Treatise on Febrile and Miscellenous Disease, and its "pathology" was summarized as "three wasting-thirsts (upper, middle, lower)" from the perspectives of spatial locations of organs, which serves as a guide in clinical practice. For period three, a self-contained system, including diagnosis, treatment, prevention, nursing, and education, had been established. For period four, wasting-thirst was intimately integrated into diabetes in The Integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine. Discussion: Traditional Chinese Medicine harbors a long history of treating wasting-thirst/diabetes. With its unique therapeutic approaches, TCM is an effective system of understanding and managing diabetes as proven by medical literatures, clinical benefits and basic research studies.

METHODS: A total of 167 patients with high myopes were categorized into four groups: group 1, age 10-29 years; group 2, age 30-49 years; group 3, age 50-69 years and group 4, age 70-89 years. The refractive errors of all patients were measured without cycloplegia with an autorefractometer. Data of the spherical equivalent (SE) of the refractive errors in diopters (D) and fundus examined by direct ophthalmoscope were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: The number of female was statistically larger than that of male (P < 0.01), also the disease course was correlated to the age. The visual acuity of high myopes significantly decreased as they grew older including the higher incidence of lacquer cracker, submacular hemorrhage, Fuchs spots, chorioretinal atrophy. CONCLUSION: Female maybe a risk factor of high myopia, advanced age is an important factor of visual acuity decreased. High myopes ought to be treated early to delay the progress of myopia and development of macular degeneration.

This study was designed to determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the Yun-chang capsule, a Chinese herbal formula, in the treatment of patients with functional constipation. Methods: In our multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, patients with functional constipation received 70 mg of Yun-chang capsule plus 35 mg placebo (group A), 105 mg of Yun-chang capsule (group B), or 105 mg placebo (group C), three times daily for 2 weeks. The primary end-points were the changes in main symptom score and cumulative symptom score 2 weeks after the treatment. The secondary end-points were adverse events. Results: A total of 140 patients were recruited and 132 met the inclusion criteria; 44 patients constituted each of the three treatment groups. Compared with patients in group C, patients in groups A and B had significant improvement in the main symptom score, cumulative symptom score, the change from baseline of the main symptom score, and the change from baseline of the cumulative symptom score at week 1 and week 2. The scores showed slight superiority of group B over group A at week 1 and week 2, although these differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in adverse events. Conclusions: The Yun-chang capsule is efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with functional constipation. Larger and longer-term trials are required to fully assess the benefits and safety of this treatment for functional constipation.

The extent and duration of toxic effects on the metabolism were evaluated by studying the growth rate constant (k), half inhibitory ratio (IC(50)), maximum heat-output power (P(max)), peak time of maximum heat-output power (t(p)) and total heat production (Q). Experimental results showed that the value of t(p) increased with increasing the concentration of DDA. Moreover, the value of k and P(max) were reduced with increasing the concentrations of the three drugs. Furthermore, the growth rate constant (k) was linked to the concentration of DDA: r(aconitine)=0.9910 (IC(50)=207.7 mu g.mL(-1)); r(mesaconitine)=0.9923 (IC(50)=412.5 mu g.mL(-1)), r(hypaconitine) = 0.9977 (IC(50) = 1497 mu g.mL(-1)). The sequence of toxic effects of the three DDA is aconitine>mesaconitine >hypaconitine. It was suggested that the hydroxy group at C(3) and ethyl group connectted with nitrogen could possibly improve the toxic effects of DDA on Tetrahymena thermophila BF5 growth.

A systematic review of available randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for migraineurs was conducted in the five following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. Information of selected acupoints and treatment course was extracted from the included trials. Then we analyzed the treatment methods used in these trials, to identify any similarities of therapeutic approaches. Additionally, quality of all the included trials was assessed. At last, the extracted information of acupuncture protocols was analyzed, and the similarities of therapeutic approaches were summed up. Bilateral use of the following points is recommended: Fengchi (GB20), Taiyang (EX-HN5), etc. De-qi sensation is requested in acupuncture manipulating procedure, and manual stimulation is suggested. The optimal treatment frequency is twice a week with one week rest between the first 10 and the last 10 sessions. Additionally, the duration of one treatment session ought to be 30 minutes, while it is recommended to use about 20 needles in one session. The total duration of an acupuncture treatment should be at least 10 weeks. The protocol analyzed from trials with positive results is different from trials with negative in number of treatment sessions. Therefore in future trials, enough acupuncture treatment sessions should be fully considered.

However, resistance to paclitaxel is frequently encountered in the clinic. There is increasing interest in identifying compounds that may increase the sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated whether green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) could sensitize breast carcinoma to paclitaxel in vivo. Methods: Breast cancer cells were treated with or without EGCG and paclitaxel followed by detection of cell survival and apoptosis. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression were detected by Western blotting. For in vivo study, 4T1 breast cancer cells were inoculated into Balb/c mice to establish a transplantation model. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with or without EGCG (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and paclitaxel (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Tumor growth was monitored. Apoptosis in tumor tissues was detected. Cell lysates from tumors were subjected to Western blot analysis of GRP78 expression and JNK phosphorylation. Results: EGCG synergistically sensitized breast cancer cells to paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo. EGCG in combination with paclitaxel significantly induced 4T1 cells apoptosis compared with each single treatment. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with paclitaxel in combination with EGCG, tumor growth was significantly inhibited, whereas the single-agent activity for paclitaxel or EGCG was poor. EGCG overcame paclitaxel-induced GRP78 expression and potentiated paclitaxel-induced JNK phosphorylation in 4T1 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: EGCG may be used as a sensitizer to enhance the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel.

The protective effects of EA were evaluated in rat models with acute myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol and vasopressin. In the electrocardiogram of anesthetized rats, EA prevented the ST-segment depression induced by isoproterenol or vasopressin in a dose-dependently manner. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 was analyzed by RT-PCR. EA shows an elevation of Bcl-2 mRNA level in infarcted tissue induced by isoproterenol in rats. These results demonstrated for the first time EA has a cardioprotective effect and may be a natural drug. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous separation of five alkaloids was achieved on a Kromasil C18 analytical column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) with the isocratic elution of acetonitrile : water (30 : 70, v/v, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with 0.2 moL L-1 trichloroacetic acid). The drift tube temperature of the ELSD system was set at 115 degrees C and the nitrogen flow rate was 2.8 L min-1. All the five calibration curves showed a good linear relationship (r2 0.9991) within the test ranges. The limit of detections and quantifications for the five alkaloids in ELSD were less than 0.88 and 2.73 ng, respectively. The established method was successfully applied to quantify the five ingredients in different C. rhizoma samples and evaluate the internal quality of C. rhizoma samples from various sources by analysing the chemical fingerprints using similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), which provided a useful basis of overall evaluation of the quality of C. rhizoma.

Methods: Monkey retinal vascular endothelial cells (RF/6A) were cultured in vitro and different concentrations of protamine sulfate were added to the vascular endothelial cells after three passages. VEGF expression level was examined by ELISA and immunohistochemistry after the cells were treated with protamine sulfate. Results: VEGF expression decreased in a dose-dependent pattern in 10-80 mu g/ml of protamine sulfate. We also found that protamine sulfate could inhibit VEGF to bind to its receptor, VEGFR. Conclusion: Protamine sulfate could inhibit VEGF expression and VEGF-VEGFR binding in vitro. Protamine sulfate may be used for inhibiting neovascularization in angiogenic eye diseases. Angiogenic eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinal vein occlusion are the main blindness-causing diseases. Previous studies indicated that VEGF and its receptor were involved in the pathogenesis, development and prognosis of these diseases. VEGF inhibition drugs have been used successfully in clinical treatment, but the cost is prohibitive.

Methods and Findings: We utilized the birth records at Du Jiang Yan and Peng Zhou counties to investigate the birth outcomes as a consequence of a major earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, China on May 12, 2008. Totally 13,003 of neonates were recorded, with 6638 and 6365 for pre- and post-earthquake, respectively. Significant low birthweight, high ratio of low birthweight, and low Apgar scores of post-earthquake group were observed. In contrast, the sex ratio at birth, birth length and length of gestation did not show statistical differences. The overall ratio of birth-defect in the post-earthquake (1.18%) is statistically high than that of pre- earthquake (0.99%), especially for those in the first trimester on earthquake day (1.47%). The birth-defect spectrum was dramatically altered after earthquake, with the markedly increased occurrences of ear malformations. The ratio of preterm birth post-earthquake (7.41%) is significant increased than that of pre- earthquake (5.63%). For the birth outcomes of twins, significant differences of the ratio of twins, birth weight, ratio of low birthweight and birth-defect rate were observed after earthquake. Conclusion: A hospital-based study of birth outcomes impacted by the Wenchuan earthquake shows that the earthquake was associated with significant effects on birth outcomes, indicating it is a major monitor for long-term pregnant outcomes.

Methods: Clinical observation was performed on 60 ICP children suffering from acute diarrhea, who were randomly assigned to two groups equally. The Mox group was treated with warming moxibustion on Shenque acupoint (RN8) and the control group treated with Smecta. The efficacy was evaluated by markedly effective rate and total effective rate after a 6-day treatment, diarrhea arresting time as well as stool examination normalization rate and rotavirus negative reversion rate after a 3-day treatment. Results: The total effective rate in the two groups was insignificantly different (P>0.05), but the markedly effective rate was significantly higher in the Mox group than in the control group (P<0.01); a significant difference was also seen between groups in terms of diarrhea arresting time, stool examination normalization rate and rotavirus negative reversion rate (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Warming moxibustion on Shenque acupoint is an effective treatment for acute diarrhea in ICP children, with advantages of simple manipulation and rapid effect initiation.

DATA SOURCES: A computer-based online search was conducted in Medline (1966-2008), Embase (1986-2008), the Cochrane Library (up to 2008), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1975-2008), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1994-2008), VIP Database (1989-2008), Wanfang Database (1980-2008) and the National Research Register for ongoing trials. DATA SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials addressing acupuncture treatment for patients with optic atrophy were included in this review. Inclusion criteria evaluated all forms of acupuncture therapy, such as filiform needle, electro-acupuncture, laser-acupuncture, acupressure, and auricular-acupuncture. Comparisons between acupuncture therapy and no treatment (blank) or placebo or Chinese medicine or Western medicine, as well as between acupuncture as an adjuvant and other treatments, were included. Exclusion criteria included studies comparing different forms of acupuncture therapy, different manipulations of acupuncture, and different acupuncture prescriptions, as well as non-randomized, controlled trials and animal studies. The domain-based evaluation criteria recommended by the guidelines in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.1 was used to assess quality of the included studies. According to the type of outcome index, measurement data as assessed by weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference and 95% confidence interval; numeration data was estimated by relative risk and 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity was analyzed by Meta-analysis using RevMan 5.0 software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improved visual acuity and visual field was sought between treatment and control groups in the included articles. RESULTS: Seven randomized, controlled trials were included after screening and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the studies were of low methodological quality and lacked comparisons between acupuncture and no treatment or placebo. Applying visual acuity as the outcome index, meta-analysis indicated: the effect of medicine combined with acupuncture was superior to the medicine alone (relative risk = 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.70, P < 0.01), the efficacy of acupuncture was better than medicine alone (relative risk = 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.77, P < 0.01). Using visual field as the other outcome index, meta-analysis revealed: effectiveness of acupuncture or acupuncture in combination with medicine was superior to medicine alone (relative risk = 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.69, P < 0.01). The 7 included articles were incorporated in a sensitivity analysis, and the overall effect showed a significant difference (relative risk = 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.56, P < 0.01). Acupuncture was not associated with any adverse events in any of the studies. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy was determined to be superior to medicine in terms of improved visual acuity and visual field. However, well-designed, randomized, controlled trials with adequate controls and scientific rigor are urgently needed.

A novel, self-designed cold/hot plate differentiating instrument, with methodological study, was used to investigate the intervention of Strobal and Rhubarb on the temperature tropism of mice. Compared with the ICR and BALB/c mice, it was found that KM mice on the cold/hot plate were more sensitive to the change of temperature, within the tolerant temperature range of 15-40 A degrees C The temperature tropism behavior of mice is influenced by treatment with Rhubarb and Strobal, as is the activity of ATPase in liver tissue. These trends are consistent with the definition of the Cold/Hot nature of Chinese medicines based on traditional Chinese medicinal theory. This study showed that the differences of the Cold/Hot nature of traditional Chinese medicines. might be objectively represented by the temperature tropism of animal by means of cold/hot differentiating assay.

The results showed that the anti-C. albicans effect of this compound was mainly influenced by the growth rate constant (k(2)) and maximum power output P(m)(2) of phase II, and could be easily, quickly and exactly evaluated by analyzing the change of these two quantitative parameters. This work provides a useful method and idea for further evaluating the anti-bacterial effect of other drugs and compounds.

The uniform design and MTT method were applied to study the effect of aconitine with different concentrations at scheduled time. The influence of aconitine at the maximal toxicity concentration was observed using optical microscope and electron microscope. The influences of aconitine on neuron cells membrane, neuron cells' inner balance, energy metabolism and neurotransmitters were observed to investigate the action mechanisms of aconitine. The results indicated that the maximal toxicity-concentration was 2% and the critical time were 30 s, 1 min and 20 min respectively. The effects of aconitine on neuron cells' morphology included cells synapse's fracture, cells membrane fragment, mitochondria's swell, cytoplasmic vacuoles, nuclear chromatin's condensation and accumulation. The stability of biomembrane, the internal milieu and the energy metabolism were also disturbed with the increase of activity of LDH and concentration of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, opioid, catecholamine and SP) in culture medium, the increase of the activity of ACP and [Na(+)], [Ca(2+)] concentration, and the decrease of Na(+)-K(+)-ATP, [K(+)], [Mg(2+)] and glycogen concentration in the cells. Toxic mechanisms of aconitine damaging neuron cells may be because it inhibited the activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATP, influenced the concentrations of [Na(+)], [K(+)], [Ca(2+)], [Mg(2+)] and neurotransmitters in the cells, which resulted in the injuries of cells' morphology and function.

HPLC-DAD-ELSD was employed for the determination at the optimal wavelength (255 nm). Fifteen samples of QKL at different batches from different factories were analyzed by the means. The results show that the method is corresponding with specified standard. The contents from different samples (QKL from different factories and different batches) have great disparity (The RSD values range from 2. 17% to 65.54%). It is concluded that the method is reliable and convenient for the quality control of QKL. The key point of QKL quality control is to control the chief activity components as much as possible.

Methods: In a multi-center, randomized, parallel controlled clinical trial, patients with DR were randomly assigned to the control group (calcium dobesilate capsule) and the test group (Qiming Granule). Changes in the retinal blood circulation time were recorded by FFA after 3 months of medication. Results: Significant reduction was observed in the retinal arterio-venous circulation time (AVCT) in both groups (P<0.01), the value was 7.635 +/- 3.149 s before treatment and 5.165 +/- 3.382 s after treatment in the treated group, and 7.737 +/- 3.413 s and 5.313 +/- 3.472 s in the control group respectively. Qiming Granule also reduced the arm-to-retinal circulation time (ARCT, P<0.05). The value was 17.867 +/- 3.872 s before treatment and 15.643 +/- 4.648 s after treatment in the treated group, and 17.217 +/- 3.833 s and 16.312 +/- 3.613 s in the control group (P>0.05) respectively. The ARCT in the tested group was reduced, with a statistically significant difference post-medication (P<0.01). Conclusion: As a Chinese medicine complex prescription, Qiming Granule may alleviate retinal hypoxia and ischemia by increasing retinal blood flow and improving the blood circulation.

J	Zhang, RQ; Li, YX; Jiang, XH; Wang, L				Zhang, Ruoqi; Li, Yunxia; Jiang, Xuehua; Wang, Ling			Pharmacokinetics and Tolerability of Multiple-Dose Rosuvastatin: An Open-Label, Randomized-Sequence, Three-Way Crossover Trial in Healthy Chinese Volunteers	CURRENT THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL			English	Article						rosuvastatin; pharmacokinetics; multiple doses; tolerability; Chinese	DOUBLE-BLIND; HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA	BACKGROUND: Rosuvastatin has been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of dyslipidemia. The C(max), and AUC(0-t) of rosuvastatin were reported to be similar to 2 to 4 times higher in Chinese subjects compared with white Subjects after administration of a single 1-mg/kg dose. OBJECTIVES: The alms of this study were to assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of multiple doses of rosuvastatin in healthy Chinese volunteers. METHODS: This open-label, randomized-sequence, 3-way crossover trial consisted of three 7-day treatment periods and two 10-day washout periods. Healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 daily treatment regimens: rosuvastatin 5, 10, or 20 mg. To assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of rosuvastatin, blood samples were drawn before dosing (hour 0) on days 5, 6, and 7 and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 1.5, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the final dose was administered on day 7. A validated HPLC-MS/MS method was used to determine rosuvastatin levels. A 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the plasma concentration-time profiles obtained for each volunteer. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study via subject inter-view, vital signs, and blood sampling. Serious AEs were those requiring hospitalization, treatment discontinuation, or resulting in death. RESULTS: Twelve healthy Chinese volunteers (6 men: mean [SD] age, 21.8 [1.7] years; weight, 62.3 [5.8] kg; height, 174.3 [7.2] cm; 6 women: age, 20.8 [1.2] years; weight, 53.2 [4.7] kg; height, 161.3 [4.3] cm) participated in and completed the trial. The mean (SD) steady-state C(max) was significantly greater after rosuvastatin administration in the 20-mg group compared with the 5-mg group (37.69 [29.83] vs 6.17 [6.03] ng/mL; P = 0.04). The t(1/2) was significantly greater in the 20-mg group (15.51 [6.43] hours) compared with the 5-mg group (5.65 [5.08] hours; P = 0.001) and the 10-mg group (8.58 [5.17] hours; P = 0.002). The mean AUC(0-t) was significantly greater in the 20-mg group compared with the 5-mg group (349.16 [257.20] vs 40.63 [39.31] ng/mL/h; P = 0.02). All AEs were considered by the investigators to be mild in intensity, with the exception of 2 cases of abdominal discomfort (1 man and 1 woman, both in the 5-mg dose group). Two women in the 20-mg group experienced dizziness and cold sweats simultaneously. In the 10-mg group, 1 woman had abdominal discomfort and nausea and I woman had law pain. All reported AEs were considered possibly related to study drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in healthy Chinese volunteers, rosuvastatin systemic exposure appeared to be dose-proportional over the dosing range of 5 to 20 mg with multiple-dose administration. There was no accumulation of rosuvastatin in the body with the 5- and 10-mg doses. However, the results suggest that rosuvastatin might accumulate when the dose is increased to 20 mg. No serious AEs occurred in any of the 3 dosing groups. (Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2009;70:392-404) (C) 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Investigation of the anti-fungal activity of coptisine on Candida albicans growth by microcalorimetry combined with principal component analysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						anti-fungal activity; Candida albicans; coptisine; microcalorimetry; principal component analysis	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; RADIX-ISATIDIS; INHIBITION; BERBERRUBINE; DERIVATIVES; BERBERINE; ACIDS	Aims: This study investigated the anti-fungal activity of coptisine on Candida albicans growth. Methods and Results: The metabolic power-time curves of Candida albicans growth at 37 degrees C affected by coptisine were measured by microcalorimetry using an LKB-2277 Bioactivity Monitor with stop-flow mode. Then, the diameter of inhibitory zones in the agar layer was observed using agar cup method, and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of coptisine on Candida albicans growth was determined by serial dilution method. From the principal component analysis on nine quantitative parameters obtained from the power-time curves, we could easily evaluate the anti-fungal activity of coptisine by analysing the change of values of the main two parameters, growth rate constant k and maximum power output in the log phase P(m, log). The results showed that coptisine had strong anti-fungal activity: at a low concentration (45 mu g ml<SU-1</SU) began to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and at a high concentration (500 mu g ml<SU-1</SU) completely inhibited Candida albicans growth. Coptisine gave big inhibitory zones with diameters between 11 and 43 mm within test range, and the MIC of it was 1000 mu g ml<SU-1</SU. Conclusions: Coptisine had strong anti-fungal activity on Candida albicans growth. The method of microcalorimetry applied for the assay of anti-fungal activity of coptisine was quantitative, sensitive and simple. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work will provide useful information for the development of chemical biology policy in the use of anti-microbials in food and drug production.

Recent studies have shown that the species of Paris possess different chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, and efficiencies in clinical application. To distinguish 11 species of Paris collected from the western Sichuan province of China and ensure their safety and efficacy, in the present work, the microscopic characteristics of rhizomes and the crude drug powder of the 11 species of Paris were compared using a light microscope according to the usual microscopic techniques. The results of the microscopic features were systematically described and illustrated. The differences among these species are great enough that the identity of most material can be easily determined. Also, semiquantitative and quantitative micrographic parameter tables were simultaneously presented. Further, the key authentication parameters based on these anatomic characteristics analyzed was drawn up and presented for the Paris species studied. The study indicated that light microscopy and related techniques could provide a method that is convenient, feasible, and can be unambiguously applied in the authentication of species of Paris. This information is required not only for the identification procedures that guarantee the utilization of the appropriate raw material, but also for the quality control standards demanded. Microsc.

In quantitative analysis, the five alkaloids showed good regression (R > 0.999 2) within test ranges and the recovery of the method was in the range of 98.4-100.8%. The limit of detections and quantifications for five alkaloids in PAD were less than 0.07 and 0.22 mu g/ml, respectively. In order to compare the UPLC fingerprints between Rhizoma Coptidis from different origins, the chemometrics procedures, including similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to classify the Rhizoma Coptidis samples according to their cultivated origins. Consistent results were obtained to show that Rhizoma Coptidis samples could be successfully grouped in accordance with the province of origin. Furthermore, five marker constituents were screened out to be the main chemical marker, which could be applied to accurate discrimination and quality control for Rhizoma Coptidis by quantitative analysis. This study revealed that UPLC-PAD method was simple, sensitive and reliable for quantitative and chemical fingerprint analysis, moreover, for the quality evaluation and control of Rhizoma Coptidis.

This paper proposes a type of sensor for measuring these parameters and analyzes its force situation. The flexibility of the sensor makes it easy for doctors to let the sensor pass through woman's narrow cervix and get to her uterine cavity. The experiment shows that the sensitivity of three coils in the sample sensor achieves 22.38 nH/mm(2) both for left and right coils, 22.84nH/mm(2) for top coil, which can meet the requirements of sensitivity for testing the contraction situation of uterine musculature. Furthermore, an interface designed in the back end system can display the parameters of deformation size and vivid contraction situation of women's uterine musculature in real-time. The sensor has been applied in some medical fields. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, the biomass change during the process of T thermophila BF5 growth coexisted with palmatine was studied by a haemacytometer. The results showed that a low concentration (50 mu g/mL.) of palmatine began to inhibit the growth of T thermophila BF5, and when the concentration of palmatine reached 600 mu g/mL, T thermophila BF5 could not grow at all. The relationship between the growth rate constant (k) and the concentration c was almost linear with the correlation coefficient of 0.9957, showing the strong toxic action of palmatine on T thermophila BF5 growth. The biomass during T thermophila BF5 growth decreased obviously by the addition of palmatine at different concentrations. The investigation of biomass agreed well with the results obtained by means of microcalorimetry. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although taxol and vinblastine are widely used for cancer treatment, resistance to these agents is frequently encountered in the clinic. An ongoing question has been what mechanisms are involved in the resistance of tumour cells to microtubules-targeted agents or how the clinical effectiveness can be improved. There is increasing evidence that microtubules interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we have shown that taxol and vinblastine induce multiple arms of the ER stress response, including up-regulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression, X-box binding protein 1 splicing and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha phosphorylation. Abrogation of GRP78 induction sensitizes breast cancer cells to taxol and vinblastine. Treatment with (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a known GRP78 inhibitor, synergistically promotes taxol- and vinblastine-induced cell death. GRP78 knockdown or EGCG potentiates taxol- and vinblastine-induced activation of pro-apoptosis arms of the ER stress response, such as JNK phosphorylation, caspase-7 and PARP cleavage. Inhibition of JNK and caspase-7 abrogates EGCG sensitization of breast cancer cells to taxol and vinblastine. We conclude that induction of the unfolded protein response represents a novel mechanism underlying the efficacy and resistance to microtubules-targeted agents. Combination of compounds capable of suppressing GRP78 might be a novel approach for improving the effectiveness of microtubules-targeted chemotherapy.

The overall prevalence of any STI was 10.9% (95% CI 9.5-12.3); of any STI or RTI was 30.8% (95% CI 28.7-32.8). Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 6.4% of women, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 1.7%, Treponema pallidum in 0.5%, human papilloma virus in 0.6%, herpes simplex virus type-2 in 2.0%, Candida albicans in 8.8%, Trichomonas vaginalis in 0.7% and bacterial vaginosis in 15.4%. The reported low risk sexual behavior was corroborated by the prevalence of STI based on laboratory findings. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis alone and the combined prevalence rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were high enough (7.9%) to consider interventions for the control of cervical infections. Health promotion messages regarding safe sexual and health care seeking behavior is important. Routine STI surveillance, including prevalence studies, which provide accurate information for decision-making should be continued as an essential component of good STI control.

However, its effectiveness in the treatment of FD, and whether FD-specific acupoints exist, are controversial. So this study aims to determine if acupuncture is an effective treatment for FD and if acupoint specificity exists according to traditional acupuncture meridians and acupoint theories. Design: This multicenter randomized controlled trial will include four acupoint treatment groups, one non-acupoint control group and one drug (positive control) group. The four acupoint treatment groups will focus on: (1) specific acupoints of the stomach meridian; (2) non-specific acupoints of the stomach meridian; (3) specific acupoints of alarm and transport points; and (4) acupoints of the gallbladder meridian. These four groups of acupoints are thought to differ in terms of clinical efficacy, according to traditional acupuncture meridians and acupoint theories. A total of 120 FD patients will be included in each group. Each patient will receive 20 sessions of acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks. The trial will be conducted in eight hospitals located in three centers of China. The primary outcomes in this trial will include differences in Nepean Dyspepsia Index scores and differences in the Symptom Index of Dyspepsia before randomization, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after randomization, and 1 month and 3 months after completing treatment. Discussion: The important features of this trial include the randomization procedures (controlled by a central randomization system), a standardized protocol of acupuncture manipulation, and the fact that this is the first multicenter randomized trial of FD and acupuncture to be performed in China. The results of this trial will determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for FD and whether using different acupoints or different meridians leads to differences in clinical efficacy.

Some compounds exerted more potent anti-proliferative activities than those of honokiol on K562 leukemia cells, A549 alveolar basal epithelial cells, SPC-A1 adenocarcinoma cells and A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells in vitro. Compounds 2b, 3a, and 3c displayed most potent anti-proliferative activities against these tested cell strains and their anti-drug resistance effects were evaluated in vitro on cisplatin-resistant A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells. The structure-activity relationship was also proposed. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: The translation process included forward translation, back translation, pretest and cross-cultural adaptation. Reliability and validity of the translated version were examined by asking 300 subjects to complete the Chinese version of the NDI. The mean age of subjects was 39.24 years and 68.7% of the subjects were women. Internal consistency analysis with Cronbach's a was performed to test the reliability. Correlation analysis was used to assess the content validity. Factor analysis and structural equation models were used to assess the construct validity. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged 0.833-0.960, well above the acceptable level of 0.70. Correlation analysis showed that each item had a strong correlation with the corresponding domain, but a weak correlation with other domains. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the comparative fit index was 0.94, higher than the acceptable level of 0.90. CONCLUSION: The Chinese version of the NDI is a reliable and valid scale for measuring health-related quality of life and disease severity in Chinese patients with FD.

Effect of emodin on Candida albicans growth investigated by microcalorimetry combined with chemometric analysis	APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Emodin; Candida albicans; Microcalorimetry; Chemometric analysis	ESCHERICHIA-COLI GROWTH; 4 ORGANIC-ACIDS; QUALITY-CONTROL; RADIX-ISATIDIS; ANTHRAQUINONE DERIVATIVES; DISCRIMINATION; FINGERPRINTS; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; ROOTS	Using the 3114/3115 thermal activity monitor (TAM) air isothermal microcalorimeter, ampoule mode, the heat output of Candida albicans growth at 37 degrees C was measured, and the effect of emodin on C. albicans growth was evaluated by microcalorimetry coupled with chemometric methods. The similarities between the heat flow power (HFP)-time curves of C. albicans growth affected by different concentrations of emodin were calculated by similarity analysis (SA). In the correspondence analysis (CA) diagram of eight quantitative parameters taken from the HFP -time curves, it could be deduced that emodin had definite dose-effect relationship as the distance between different concentrations of it increased along with the dosage and the effect. From the principal component analysis (PCA) on eight quantitative parameters, the action of emodin on C. albicans growth could be easily evaluated by analyzing the change of values of the main two parameters, growth rate constant k(2) and maximum power output P(m)(2). The coherent results of SA, CA, and PCA showed that emodin at different concentrations had different effects on C. albicans growth metabolism: A low concentration (0-10 mu g ml(-1)) poorly inhibited the growth of C. albicans, and a high concentration (15-35 mu g ml(-1)) could notably inhibit growth of this fungus. This work provided a useful idea of the combination of microcalorimetry and chemometric analysis for investigating the effect of drug and other compounds on microbes.	[Kong, W. J.; Wang, J.

There are a variety of acupuncture treatment options to treat Bell's palsy in clinical practice. Since Bell's palsy has three different path-stages (acute stage, resting stage and restoration stage), so whether acupuncture is effective in the different path-stages and which acupuncture treatment is the best method are major issues in acupuncture clinical trials about Bell's palsy. In this article, we report the design and protocol of a large sample multi-center randomized controlled trial to treat Bell's palsy with acupuncture. There are five acupuncture groups, with four according to different path-stages and one not. In total, 900 patients with Bell's palsy are enrolled in this study. These patients are randomly assigned to receive one of the following four treatment groups according to different path-stages, i.e. 1) staging acupuncture group, 2) staging acupuncture and moxibustion group, 3) staging electro-acupuncture group, 4) staging acupuncture along yangming musculature group or non-staging acupuncture control group. The outcome measurements in this trial are the effect comparison achieved among these five groups in terms of House-Brackmann scale (Global Score and Regional Score), Facial Disability Index scale, Classification scale of Facial Paralysis, and WHOQOL-BREF scale before randomization (baseline phase) and after randomization. The result of this trial will certify the efficacy of using staging acupuncture and moxibustion to treat Bell's palsy, and to approach a best acupuncture treatment among these five different methods for treating Bell's palsy.

ICC cells were treated with aconitine (0.05 similar to 8%) and emodin (0.001 similar to 2%) in single or combined synchronous experiments and the effect of emodin on aconitine was evaluated using cell viability as end-point. Both the two compounds had toxicity on ICC cell. The cell membrane integrity impairment caused by the exposure lead to the efflux of intracellular ionic ([Na(+)], [Ca(2+)] and [K(+)]) and the deactivation of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. The ionic disturbance caused the interruption of the cellular breathing chain and resulted in anaerobic metabolism increase and the glycogen massive decomposition, at last the energy metabolism in the cells was obstructed. But the antagonist effect existed when the two compounds were exposed to ICC cells together. The compatibility (aonitine:emodin as 2:1), can significantly reversed the toxicity of aconition. In addition, synergistic effects were never observed in the range of concentrations considered. Although emodin can defer the aconition's toxicity oil ICC cell, the impairment can't be totally inhibited by the compatibility with time went oil. The results of our work represent a starting point to generate novel information on the interactions between aconitine and emodin in vitro, as well as a new relevant experimental approach useful to investigate the Herb compatibility with aconite and rhubarb and reference for the clinic.

The four kinds of alkaloids were berberine, coptisine, palmatine and jatrorrhizine. The heat flow power-time curves of E. coli growth in the presence of the four kinds of alkaloids were measured using an LKB-2277 Bio-activity monitor using a stop-flow method, at 37 degrees C. Then the thermal kinetic parameters such as, growth rate constant k, maximum power output of the log phase P(m,log) and the stationary phase P(m,stat), growth inhibitory ratio I, generation time t(g), total heat Output of the log phase Q(t,log) and half-inhibitory concentration of the drugs, IC(50), were obtained from the curves. The four kinds of alkaloids had different anti-E. coli activities. k, P(m,log) and Q(t,log) of E. coli in the presence of the four kinds of alkaloids decreased with increasing concentrations of the alkaloids. Judged from the values of k, P(m,log), Q(t,log), I and IC(50), the experimental results revealed that the sequence of anti-bacterial activities of the four kinds of alkaloids was berberine>coptisine>palmatine>jatrorrhizine. The functional groups methylenedioxy at C-2 and C-3 on phenyl ring improved anti-bacterial activity more remarkably than methoxyl at C-2 and C-3 on the phenyl ring. However, the antibacterial activity did not vary significantly with methylenedioxy or methoxyl at C-9 and C-10 on the other phenyl ring.

Acupuncture has been used in China for centuries to treat migraine headache. Convincing evidence of its efficacy in alleviating pain, however, has been inadequate to date. A total of 218 patients with migraine were recruited for the study; 180 met the inclusion criteria; 175 completed the callback process and were randomized into 3 groups. One group received verum acupuncture while subjects in the other 2 groups were treated with sham acupuncture. Each patient received 1 session of treatment and was observed over a period of 24 hours. The main outcome measure was the differences in visual analog scale (VAS) scores before treatment and 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after treatment. Significant decreases in VAS scores from baseline were observed in the fourth hour after treatment when VAS was measured in the patients who received either verum acupuncture or sham acupunctures (P < .05). The VAS scores in the fourth hour after treatment decreased by a median of 1.0 cm, 0.5 cm, and 0.1 cm in the verum acupuncture group, sham acupuncture group 1, and sham acupuncture group 2, respectively. Similarly, there was a significant difference in the change in VAS scores from baseline in the second hour after treatment among the 3 groups (P = .006). Moreover, at the second hour after treatment, only patients treated with verum acupuncture showed significant decreases in VAS scores from baseline by a median of 0.7 cm (P < .001). Significant differences were observed in pain relief, relapse, or aggravation within 24 hours after treatment as well as in the general evaluations among the 3 groups (P < .05). Most patients in the acupuncture group experienced complete pain relief (40.7%) and did not experience recurrence or intensification of pain (79.6%). Verum acupuncture treatment is more effective than sham acupuncture based on either Chinese or Western nonacupoints in reducing the discomfort of acute migraine. Verum acupuncture is also clearly effective in relieving pain and preventing migraine relapse or aggravation. These findings support the contention that there are specific physiological effects that distinguish genuine acupoints from nonacupoints.

Design: A typical KDS family was collected using a questionnaire of cold feeling and a 40-item scoring table of KDS based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), by single-blind method repeated annually over three years. Their transcriptomes were assayed by microarray and validated by RT-PCR and ELISA. Simultaneously, 10 healthy volunteers were recruited as controls and the same protocols were performed. Results: This typical KDS family has 35 members, of whom 11 were evaluated as having severe KDS and 6 as having common KDS. Results of the cDNA microarray revealed that there were 420 genes/expressed sequence tags differentially expressed in KDS transcriptomes, indicating a global functional impairment in the mass-energy-information carrying network of KDS patients, involving energy metabolism, signal transduction, development, cell cycle, and immunity. Pathway analysis by gene set enrichment assay (GSEA) and other tools demonstrated that mitogenic activated protein kinase (MAPK) is among the most insufficiently activated pathways, while the oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, the two main pathways relevant to ATP synthesis, were among the most excessively activated pathways in KDS patients. Results of RT-PCR and ELISA confirmed the status of insufficient activity of the MAPK pathway. Conclusion: KDS patients undergo overall attenuated functions in the mass-energy-information carrying network. The marked low level of energy output in KDS may be primarily attributed to the insufficient activity of the MAPK pathway, which may be a key monitor for the abnormal energy metabolism and other impaired activities in KDS.

The majority of these studies are centered on healthy controls (HC) and neuropathy, while little work has addressed other disorders. This study aimed to investigate the influence of acupuncture stimulations on brain activities in functional dyspepsia (FD) patients. Eight FD patients and eight healthy controls (HC) were involved in this study. Each HC received an 18F-FDG PET-CT scan at baseline, while each patient received scans at baseline and after acupuncture stimulations. Manual acupuncture stimulations were performed at ST34 (Liangqiu), ST36 (Zusanli), ST40 (Fenglong) and ST42 (Chongyang) in FD patients. The images were analyzed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software 2.0. Compared to HC, the FD patients showed a lower glycometabolism in the right orbital gyrus, the left caudate tail and the cingulate gyrus, and a higher glycometabolism in the left inferior temporal gyrus (p < 0.005). After acupuncture stimulations, the FD patients showed a glycometabolism decrease in the postcentral gyrus and the cerebella, and an increase in the visual-related cortices(p < 0.005). The results suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal cortices and the caudate tail involve in processing gastric perceptions in FD patients and that the deactivation of the primary somatosensory area and the cerebella is contributable to acupuncture stimulation, while activation of the visual-related cortex is a response to pain or acupoint actions.

The initial study indicated that radix isatidis had obvious in vitro inhibitory activity on NA with IC(50)=(0.90+/-0.20) mg(herb) . mL(-1). The correlation between logarithmic dose and reaction rate showed a "S" shape and a linear curve (linear equation, y=8.725 9+1.216 9 X log(D), R=0.9992) when the reaction rate was converted to probit-quite similar to Tamiflu's reaction curve, which hinted that radix isatidis had the same inhibitory function on NA as Tamiflu. According to the reaction type and the regularity of "parallel lines of qualitative effect", the experimental condition was optimized and a statistic method was confirmed based on the principle of bioassay statistic. Then the bioassay method for antivirus potency of radix isatidis based on fluorometric determination was established. The results of bio-potency assay showed the qualitative differences of radix isatidis samples sensitively and quantitatively. Meanwhile, this method has good reproducibility with RSD=5. 78% and reliability. The quality bioassay control method based on chemical fluorometric determination can reflect the pharmaco-dynamic features of Chinese medicine herb.

METHODS: Representative human gut bacteria were collected from 20 healthy volunteers, and then utilized in vitro to biotransform aesculin under anaerobic conditions. At 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h post-incubation, 10 mL of culture medium was collected. Metabolites of aesculin were extracted 3 x from rat urine with methanol and analyzed by HPLC. For in vivo metabolite analysis, aesculetin (100 mg/kg) was administered to rats via stomach gavage, rat urine was collected from 6 to 48 h post-administration, and metabolite analysis was performed by LC/ESI-MS and MS/MS in the positive and negative modes. RESULTS: Human gut bacteria could completely convert aesculin into aesculetin in vitro. The biotransformation process occurred from 8 to 24 h post-incubation, with its highest activity was seen from 8 to 12 h. The in vitro process was much slower than the in vivo process. In contrast to the in vitro model, six aesculetin metabolites were identified in rat urine, including 6-hydroxy-7-gluco-coumarin(M1), 6-hydroxy-7-sulf-coumarin (M2), 6, 7-di-gluco-coumarin (M3), 6-gic-7-gluco-coumarin (M4), 6-O-methyl-7-gluco-coumarin (M5) and 6-O-methyl-7-sulf-coumarin (M6). Of which, M2 and M6 were novel metabolites. CONCLUSION: Aesculin can be transferred into aesculetin by human gut bacteria and is further modified by the host in vivo. The diverse metabolites of aesculin may explain its pleiotropic pharmaceutical effects. (C) 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing CHM vs no treatment, placebo, conventional western medicine (CWM), or general non-specific surgical treatment for DUB were identified by electronic and manual searches. Trials of CHM treatments with CWM treatments were compared with CWM treatments alone. Jadad scale and allocation concealment were used to assess the quality of included studies. Four RCTs or quasi-RCTs involving 525 patients were included. The methodological quality was poor in all trials except one trial. No serious adverse events were reported in the included studies. With the lack of trials comparing CHM with no treatment or placebo, it is impossible to accurately evaluate the efficacy of CHM. However, CHM in these studies seem to show an encouraging comparative effectiveness with CWM. More RCTs with a higher quality are required.

Methods: In the present multi-central randomly controlled clinical study, 180 cases of chronic insomnia were randomly divided into the following two groups, a treatment group (90 cases) treated by the needle-rolling therapy and a control group (90 cases) treated with clonopin. The treatment course for both the two groups was 4 weeks. The therapeutic effects were evaluated based on improvement of the TCM symptoms and the Pittsburgs's sleep-quality index (PSQI). Results: After treatment, there were significant differences between the two groups in the effective rate (P<0.05), and in the total score of PSQI and in the scores of the 4 sub-items, i.e. sleep-quality, sleep-efficiency, hypnotic and daytime function (P<0.05). Although there was no significant difference between the two groups in the effective rate after a 3-month follow-up period, significant differences still existed in the 3 sub-items of sleep-efficiency, hypnotic, and daytime function of the PSQI (P<0.05). Conclusion: As compared with hypnotics of the second generation, the needle-rolling therapy may show better therapeutic effects for chronic insomnia patients.

The UPLC fingerprints were evaluated using similarity analysis (SA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). Some quantitative parameters obtained from the thermogenic curves of E. coli growth affected by R. coptidis were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The spectrum-effect relationships between UPLC fingerprints and anti-bacterial activities were investigated using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The results showed that close correlation existed between the spectrum-effect relationships. Berberine, jateorrhizine and palmatine in the UPLC fingerprints might be the main anti-bacterial components. The anti-bacterial activities of R. coptidis were related with the main active constituents, along with the production place and the harvesting time of this herb, the latitude and longitude of the place. This work provides a general model of the combination of UPLC and microcalorimetry to study the spectrum-effect relationships of R. coptidis, which can be used to discover principle components of it on bioactivity.

Ten video/EEG recordings of each type of seizure were obtained. Imaging data collected by video/EEG monitoring were transformed into a digital matrix with image processing software and then transformed into a movement trajectory curve with MATLAB 6.5 software. From these movement trajectories, amplitude, frequency, proximal/distal limb amplitude ratios, and shoulder/abdominal amplitude ratios measurements were calculated. One-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in average amplitude, as well as proximal/distal limb amplitude ratios, in SMA seizures when compared with those of temporal lobe seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

Methods: Twenty markers were attached to chosen body parts of patients, and 10 videos of seizures were recorded. The obtained videos were converted into digital matrices. Motor trajectories were established, the amplitude, frequency, limb distal-proximal amplitude ratio, and shoulder-abdominal amplitude ratio were calculated, analyzed and compared between two types of epilepsy. Results: The average of transient limb distal-proximal ratios in automatism patients with TLE was >3, which suggested that distal limb movements during TLE were predominant. However, the transient limb distal-proximal ratio in patients with FLE was <3, which indicated the predominance of proximal movements. The differences of motor trajectories between these two types of epilepsy were statistically significant. Conclusion: The quantification system may pave a new way for semiology study of epilepsy and is important in differential diagnosis of different types of epilepsy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We searched Chinese and English language literatures through MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2007), EMbase (January 1980 to October 2007), Chinese Biomedical Database (January 1978 to October 2007) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (January 1979 to October 2007) for randomized controlled trials. With independent assessment by 2 observers, 33 of 386 originally identified articles were finally included. The extracted information from these articles was focused on the selection of meridians and acupoints, types of stimulation and duration of treatment. On the whole, when treating PFP, the best acupoints options are Dicang (ST4), Xiaguan(ST7), Jiache (ST6), Chengjiang (CV24), Yingxiang (LI20), Quanliao (SI18), Yifeng (TE17), Yangbai (GB14), Sibai (ST2), Fengchi (GB20), Shuigou (GV26), Yuyao (EX-HN4) and Hegu (LI4). Manual stimulation or electro-acupuncture combined with moxibustion is recommended. Moreover, the suggested duration of acupuncture treatment refers to once a day, 10 times for each course, 2 to 5 days as courses interval, and 20 to 40 treatments in total.

Each candidate KDS subject from a typical family was diagnosed by 5 independent physicians of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and repeated for 3 years, all on the first Saturday of December. Fifteen samples of genomic DNA were isolated and genotyped by Affymetrix 100 K arrays of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Then appropriate tools were used for the analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and bioinformatic mining of LD SNPs. The results indicated that our procedure of TCM diagnosis can effectively collect KDS subjects and therefore provide substantial basis for the linkage analysis of KDS. Five SNPs (i.e. rs514207, rs1054020, rs7685923, rs10515889 and rs10516202) were identified as LD SNPs from this KDS family, representing an unprecedented set of LD SNPs derived from TCM syndrome. These SNPs demonstrate midrange linkage disequilibrium within the KDS family. Two genes with established functions were identified within 100 bp of these SNPs. One is Homo sapiens double cortin domain containing 5, which interacts selectively with mono-, di- or tri-saccharide carbohydrate and involves certain signaling cascades. Another one, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, is also a pleiotropic gene response to cysteinyl-tRNA aminoacylation and protein biosynthesis. In conclusion, KDS is involved in special SNP linkage disequilibrium in the intragenic level, and genes within the flanks of these SNPs suggest some essential symptoms of KDS. However, definitive evidence to confirm or exclude these loci and to establish their biological activities will be required.

To investigate the role of melatonin deficiency in AD, we used constant illumination to interrupt melatonin metabolism and measured some of the AD-like alterations in rats. Concomitant with decreased serum melatonin, the rats developed spatial memory deficits, tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple sites, activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and protein kinase A, as well as suppression of protein phosphatase-1. Prominent oxidative damage and organelle lesions, demonstrated by increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins including BiP/GRP78 and CHOP/GADD153, decreased number of rough ER and free ribosome, thinner synapses, and increased superoxide dismutase and monoamine oxidase were also observed in the light exposed rats. Simultaneous supplement of melatonin partially arrested the behavioral and molecular impairments. It is suggested that melatonin deficiency may be an upstream effector responsible for the AD-like behavioral and molecular pathologies with ER stress-involved mechanisms.

Most accessions have the chromosome number 2n=2x=16. However, three species (S. evansiana, S. przewalskii and S. brevilabra) are tetraploid with a chromosome number of 2n=4x=32. A B-chromosome was observed in S. tricuspis. The basic chromosome number x=8 was inferred for all accessions studied. The chromosome number of all the species was determined for the first time, except for S. evansiana, S. przewalskii, S. flava and S. miltiorrhiza. The chromosomes in this genus are mostly small (0.46-2.94 mu m). The small size of the chromosomes, together with their unclear centromeres, has hampered a detailed karyotype analysis.

The plasma protein was precipitated by acetonitrile, followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation. The supernatant was divided into the organic layer and aqueous layer by adding sodium chloride, and then the aqueous layer was derivatized with AQC in 0.2 m borate buffer of pH 8.8 before the HPLC analysis. An amino acid analysis column (3.9 x 150 mm, 4 gm) was applied, with 140 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH = 5.25) and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A linear correlation coefficient of 0.9987 was calculated within the range of 0.1-30 mu g/mL of the standard curve for glucosamine. The limit of detection was 30 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions (as RSD) were less than 7.38 and 12.72%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged from 91.8 to 110.0%. Extraction recoveries of glucosamine in plasma were more than 90%. The validated method was successfully applied for the quantitative determination of glucosamine in rat plasma and evaluation for pharmacokinetic study of glucosamine. It was also possible to be applied for the quantitative determination of other compounds containing amino group in biological samples. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this article, we report the design and the protocol of a randomized controlled large-scale trial to treat migraine using acupuncture, aiming at testifying it is effective to use acupuncture to treat migraine. We demonstrate also that the effectiveness of the treatment may vary due to using acupoints of different meridians or different acupoints of one meridian. Methods and design: A multi-center randomized controlled trial is currently undergoing, with three acupoints treatment groups and one non-acupoints control group. The acupuncture treatment consists of 20 sessions per patient with a observation period of 20 weeks. In total, 480 patients with Migraine are registered in this study within 8 hospitals in China from March 2008 to June 2009. These patients are randomly assigned to receive one of the following four acupoints treatment groups, i.e. 1) specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 2) non-specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 3) acupoints of other meridians (120 patients); or 4) non-acupoints control group (120 patients). The main outcome measurement in this trial is the effect comparison achieved among these four groups in terms of number of days with migraine and intensity of migraine during and after the baseline phase, i.e. the first 4 weeks before randomization and 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomization. The intensity of headache including Headache intensity grade (0-3) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score will also be used in this study. In addition, the differences of Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCD) before and after randomization are also used as the secondary outcome measurement. Discussion: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2009) will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat migraine, and verify whether the specific effect of acupoints exists and whether this specific effect of acupoints is related to meridian and a collection of meridian Qi.

Methods: Literature retrieval was conducted using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (R), EMBASE, CBMdisk, and CNKI in any language. Meta-analysis was performed on the results of homogeneous studies. Analyses subdivided by TACE frequency (subgroup A, < 3 times; subgroup B, >= 3 times) were also performed, but were not done for both therapy I and therapy II. Results: Based on our search criteria, we found 37 trials involving 2653 patients. Our results showed that therapy I, compared with therapy II, improved patient survival, quality of life, alleviation of symptoms, and tumor response, and was thus more therapeutically beneficial. Further analysis showed that subgroup A proved to be better for patients' survival and alleviation of symptoms, while the two subgroups were similar in improved tumor response. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Therapy I benefited patients with UHCC. Subgroup A improved the survival of patients and the amelioration of symptoms more than subgroup B. As in some trials, there were flaws in the methodological quality, and the data therefore have a risk of bias and of being insufficient for determining the effects of therapy I and subgroup A. Hence, further large-scale trials are warranted.

In this Study, a urinary metabonomics method based on the ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC Q-TOF MS) was used to evaluate the efficacy and study the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine preparation to blood stasis. With pattern recognition analysis (principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminate analysis) Of urinary metabolites, a clear separation of acute blood stasis model group and healthy control group was achieved, the dose groups were located between acute blood stasis model group and healthy control group showing a tendency of recovering to healthy control group, high dose and middle dose were more effective than low dose. Some significantly changed metabolites like cholic acid. phenylalanine and kynurenic acid have been found and identified and used to explain the mechanism. The work shows that the metabonomics method is a valuable tool in the research mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The principal components analysis of SPSS was applied to the study of characteristic elements in S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species. Three principal components which accounted for 79. 3% of total variance were extracted from the original data. The first factor accounted for 49. 6% of the total variance, which means that iron, manganese, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead are the characteristic elements in S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species. The results of cluster analysis show that the samples could cluster reasonably into two groups. The samples of S. miltiorrhiza from different regions were classified into one group except S. miltiorrhiza from Zhejiang and S. miltiorrhiza f. alba. The other Salvia species were classified into another group except S. cavaleriei. The S. miltiorrhiza and other Salvia species can be distinguished by this method, whose accuracy of classification is 90%. The cluster analysis based on the contents of trace element in S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species provided a quick, accurate and simple method for authentication of herb Salvia miltiorrhiza.

Twenty individuals at risk for inheriting NPS in the Chinese family participated in the study and a physical examination was performed and blood was drawn for DNA extraction. Linkage analysis and mutation screening of LMX1B gene were performed and the functional study in vitro for the Mutation was conducted by luciferase assay. The disease phenotype of this family was linked to D9S290 with LOD Score=5.8 at theta=0; a novel mutation 742 A>G (P248C) within the homeodomain was found in a conserved site and co-segregated with the disease phenotype of the family. The functional study in vitro by luciferase assay indicated that the R248G mutation within the binding domain of the gene affected the transactivation. This is the first report that a mutation in the LMX1B gene causes NPS in a Chinese population, which will expand the spectrum of mutations in the LMX1B gene and provide insight into the underlining pathology of NPS.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the degree of pathological changes in carotid atherosclerosis, carotid artery stenosis, and cognitive impairment in patients with acute cerebral infarction through the use of color Doppler imaging, DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The present concurrent, non-randomized, controlled experiment was performed at the Departments of Neurology and Ultrasound, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College between November 2006 and August 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five patients with cerebral infarction, consisting of 35 males and 20 females, aged 50-82 years, were admitted to the hospital between November 2006 and August 2007 and recruited for this study. An additional 30 subjects consisting of 18 males and 12 females, aged 47-78 years, that concurrently received a health examination at the same hospital, were also included as normal controls. METHODS: Intima-media thickness (IMT), plaque shape, size, and echo intensity of all subjects were detected by color Doppler flow imaging. Assessment criteria: IMT > 1.0 mm was considered to be intimal thickening, and IMT > 1.2 mm was determined to be formed atherosclerotic plaques. In the position of the largest plaque, the degree of carotid artery stenosis was determined by the following formula: (1-cross-sectional area of residual vascular luminal area/vascular cross-sectional area) x 100%. Less than 30% exhibited mild stenosis, 30%-40% moderate stenosis, and > 50% severe stenosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IMT and the degree of carotid artery stenosis were evaluated by color Doppler flow imaging. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the clinical memory scale, was compared between patients with cerebral infarction and normal controls. RESULTS: In the cerebral infarction group, IMT was increased, the degree of carotid artery stenosis was aggravated, and the MMSE and MQ scores of clinical memory scale were decreased. In particular, orientation of time and place, attention, calculation, and short-time memory were decreased. There were statistically significant differences in MMSE and MQ of clinical memory scale between patients with cerebral infarction and normal controls (P < 0.01). The scores from the two scales were significantly lower in patients with cerebral infarction with carotid plaque subgroup compared to the cerebral infarction with no carotid plaque subgroup (P < 0.01). The scores from the two scales were also significantly lower in patients with IMT > 1.0 mm, as well as moderate and severe carotid artery stenosis, compared to patients with IMT <= 1.0 mm, and normal and mild stenosis group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: More severe atherosclerotic and carotid artery stenosis leads to more obvious cognitive impairment.

These cognitive deficits can cause debilitating consequences due to aging. There are a number of herbal medicines which are reported to improve brain function including intelligence. In the present study, improving effects of tenuifolin, extracted from Radix Polygalae (RP), on learning and memory in aged and dysmnesia mice were determined using step-down type passive avoidance test or Y type maze trial. Oral administration of tenuifolin (0.02, 0.04, 0.08 g/kg d(-1), for 15 d) evidently improved the latency and number of errors in aged and dysmnesia mice. The levels of cortical acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity and hippocampal neurotransmitters in aged mice given tenuifolin (0.02, 0.04, 0.08 g/kg d(-1), for 15 d) were also investigated, and increased levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), decreased activity of AChE were found. However, serotonin (5-HT) had no significant difference from that of aged mice given distilled water. The evident improvement of learning and memory of aged mice is carried out by the effects of tenuifolin on the three stages of memory process, that is, acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. This may do so by relatively increasing the levels of NE, DA in the hippocampus and by decreasing the activity of AChE in the cortex. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Preliminary experimental data have demonstrated that acupuncture at meridians and acupoints is specific with regard to brain neural information. However, research findings are contradictory, which may be related to brain functional complexity, resolution of functional brain imaging techniques, and experimental design. Future studies should further improve study method, and should strictly control experimental conditions to better analyze experimental data and acquire more beneficial data. Because of its many advantages, the functional brain imaging technique is a promising method for studying meridian and acupoint specificity.

The power-time curves of S. aureus with and without BAs were acquired; meanwhile the extent and duration of inhibitory effects on the metabolism were evaluated by studying the growth rate constant (k), half inhibitory ratio (IC50), maximum heat-output power (P-max), peak time of maximum heat-output power (t(p)) and total heat production (Q(t)). The value of k of S. aureus in the presence of the three BAs decreased with the increasing concentrations of BAs. Moreover, P (max) was reduced and the value of t (p) increased with increasing concentrations of the three drugs. The inhibitory activity varied with different drugs. The values of IC50 of the three BAs are respectively, 101.4 mu g/mL for berberine, 241.0 mu g/mL for palmatine and 792.3 mu g/mL for jateorrhizine. The sequence of antimicrobial activity of the three BAs is: berberine > palmatine > jateorrhizine. It is suggested that the functional group methylenedioxy or methoxyl at C2 on the phenyl ring could possibly improve antimicrobial activity more strongly than hydroxyl at C2 on the phenyl ring.

Methods: Eighteen members of one Chinese family and 25 members of a second Chinese family with juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were investigated. Thirteen members in one family and 14 members in the second family were diagnosed with juvenile-onset POAG. A genome-wide linkage scan was performed on one family using 411 short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Subsequent fine mapping was performed in the two study families using a modified fluorescent labeled M13 primer method. Results: A whole genome-wide scan in one family showed linkage to chromosome 2p15-p16 with a two-point maximum LOD score of 5.01 at theta=0 between the disease phenotype and STR marker D2S337. The second family was also mapped to the same locus with a two-point maximum LOD score of 6.30 at theta=0 for D2S378. Haplotype analysis in these two families demonstrated that they shared the same disease haplotype, suggesting they have inherited the mutation from a common founder. The maximum LOD scores were 8.93 at theta=0 for D2S378 and 9.9 at theta=0 for D2S337 when the two families were combined for analysis. The disease interval for these two families was localized to 9.2 cM or 13.3 Mb between D2S123 and D2S2397. There are 42 known genes/transcripts within the interval. Five of these genes were sequenced, and no disease-causing mutation was identified in either family. Conclusions: This novel juvenile-onset POAG locus on chromosome 2p15-16 is overlapped by the Glaucoma 1, open angle, H (GLC1H) locus for adult-onset POAG. Eventual identification of the disease-causing gene will provide insights into the pathogenesis of POAG.

However, increasing blood lactic acid content can induce anxiety or panic in patients with anxiety disorder or endogenous opioid peptide functional disorder. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to observe the effects of electro-acupuncture, at the "Sanyinjiao" point (SP 6), on brain tissue norepinephrine and blood lactic acid content in anxiety-model mice after morphine withdrawal. DESIGN: A randomized controlled animal experiment. SETTING: This Study was performed in the Laboratory of Acupuncture, Electro-acupuncture & Tuina College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, from June to September 2001. MATERIALS: A total of 50 healthy Kunming male mice were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The protocol was performed in accordance with ethical guidelines stated in the Guide for the use and care of laboratory animals, approved by the Committee on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council, China (1985). Experimental reagents and equipment used were as follows: morphine hydrochloride (Lot No. 930503, Shenyang No.1 Pharmaceutical Factory, China), norepinephrine (Sigma Chemical Company, USA), fluorospectrophotometer (RF-510, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), Han electro-acupuncture apparatus (WQ 1002, No. zun (91)-227270-588, Beijing Anlong Photoelectricity-Technique Company, China), and T-maze (self-made). METHODS: A total of 50 mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, with 10 mice in each group: blank control, T-maze, model, model + electro-acupuncture. and electro-acupuncture groups. Establishment of anxiety model after morphine withdrawal: the mouse hot plate assay was used to detect the activity of morphine. The median effective dose of morphine, 2.95 mg/kg, was defined as the base. Mice were subcutaneously administered morphine, 3 times a day, for 4 days successively (initially 2.95 mg/kg, then increased day by day, as described below). Interventions: In the model + electro-acupuncture group, after model induction, mice were Subjected electro-acupuncture at bilateral "Sanyinjiao" (SP6) points using a Han electro-acupuncture apparatus with sparse-dense waves and frequency of 2-100 Hz, once a day, for 6 days. In the model group, after anxiety-model induction, mice were subjected to fixation as same as model + electro-acupuncture group within 6 days of model induction. In the electro-acupuncture group, the anxiety model was not induced and mice were subjected to fixation, electro-acupuncture and the T-maze test. In the T-maze group, the anxiety model was not induced and mice were subjected to fixation. The T-maze test was performed in the 4 groups after experiment. In the blank control group, the anxiety model was not induced and mice were subjected to fixation only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain tissue norepinephrine content of morphine-withdrawal anxiety mice was detected by fluorospectrophotometry after 6 clays of electro-acupuncture. Blood lactic acid content was detected by visible spectrophotometry. RESULTS: A total of 50 mice were included in the final analysis. Brain norepinephrine content was significantly greater in the model group compared to the T-maze, blank control, and model + electro-acupuncture groups, (P < 0.05-0.01). Brain norepinephrine content was similar between the model + electro-acupuncture and the blank control groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in blood lactic acid content among the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncture lowers brain norepinephrine content but does not influence peripheral blood lactic acid content in morphine-withdrawn, anxiety-modeled mice. These results demonstrate that anxiety-inhibiting effects of electro-acupuncture, after morphine withdrawal, might be related to regulation of norepinephrine release.

Vahl. has been widely used in traditional medicines in Asia to treat gonorrhoea, erysipelas, inflammation, pyrexia, ulcer and other diseases. Recently the investigation has been focused on the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of this plant. However, limited scientifically proven information is available. We isolated two compounds (forsythiaside and forsythin) from this plant. The aims of this investigation, therefore, were to assay antioxidant activity and antibacterial properties of the two main and distinctive compounds isolated and to exploit antioxidants and antibacterial agents from natural compounds. The antioxidant activity was estimated using the 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity method and the in-vitro antimicrobial activity was evaluated by microtitre plate method. Forsythiaside was found to possess strong antioxidant and antibacterial activity but forsythin was much weaker. Owing to these properties, the study can be further extended to exploit the possible application of forsythiaside as an alternative antioxidant and antibacterial agent of natural origin.

As a critical step to our further series synthesis of derivatives of honokiol, three derivatives of honokiol composed of two isomers and one compound with two formyl groups, which were hardly separated by common purification methods, needed to be rapidly separated and purified. The present work describes analytical and preparative high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) for the isolation and purification of these three C-formylation derivatives of honokiol, named 3'-formylhonokiol, 5-formylhonokiol and 3',5-diformylhonokiol, respectively. The solvent system for HSCCC separation was composed of hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water with the ratio of 1:0.4:1:0.4 (v/v). The one-step purification produced 157.8 mg, 121.6 mg and 21.2 mg of 3'-formylhonokiol, 5-formylhonokiol, 3',5-diformylhonokiol from crude sample of 400 mg with purities of 98.6%, 99.2% and 99.6%, respectively, in an elution time of 2.5 h. The purities and structural identification were determined by HPLC, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and mass spectroscopy. Their anti-proliferation effects on K562, A549 and SPC-A1 cell lines were evaluated by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This review examines Chinese-language-only publications for the patent medicines: Shenfu Tuodu, Fukang Pian, and Shifu Sheng. Other compound medicines will be reviewed in future publications. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in Western and Chinese databases. Most trials were excluded because they did not declare randomization and had poor methodology or reporting. The majority of clinical evidence in the random controlled trials demonstrates good evidence for TCM patent medicines in heroin addiction treatment. When compared to typical Western medications, TCMs demonstrate fewer side-effects, in addition to equal measures of treatment efficacy and safety.

The power-time curves of B. shigae with and without BAs were acquired; meanwhile, the extent and duration of inhibitory effects on the metabolism were evaluated by growth rate constants (k(1), k(2)), half inhibitory ratio (IC50), maximum heat output (P-max), and peak time (t(p)). The values of k(1) and k(2) of B. shigae in the presence of the five BAs decreased with the increasing concentrations of BAs. Moreover, P-max was reduced, and the value of t(p) increased with increasing concentrations of the five drugs. The inhibitory activity varied with different drugs. IC50 of the five BAs was respectively 75 mu g/mL for berberine, 90 mu g/mL for coptisine, 115 mu g/mL for palmatine, 220 mu g/mL for epilberberine, and 400 mu g/mL for jatrorrhizine. The sequence of antimicrobial activity of the five BAs: berberine > coptisine > pallmatine > epiberberine > jatrorrhizine. The functional groups methylenedioxy at C2 and C3 on phenyl ring improve antimicrobial activity more strongly than methoxyl at C2 and C3 on phenyl ring. However, the effect of bacteriostasis is not significant with methylenedioxy or methoxyl at C9 and C10 on phenyl ring.	320 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Inst Chinese Med, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Chengdu 610075, Peoples R China; Chongqing Inst Technol, Chongqing 400050, Peoples R China	XiaoHe, X (reprint author), 320 Hosp Peoples Liberat Army, Inst Chinese Med, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China.	yd277@126.com						15	0	0	1	4	SCIENCE PRESS	BEIJING	16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA	1006-9291			SCI CHINA SER B	Sci.

The present study evaluated the anti - glucosyltransferases (GTFs) activity, anti-adherence and anti-biofilm properties of 95% ethanol/water extract, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate and chloroform/methanol fractions of Nidus Vespae. Chloroform/methanol fraction showed a remarkable capacity for inhibiting the adherence of streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disc (S-HA) at sub-MC concentrations. In addition, the Nidus Vespue extract and chemical fractions significantly inhibited the activity of cell-associated and extracellular GTFs at sub-MIC concentrations, and the chloroform/methanol fraction was the most effective one. For the anti-biofilm activity assays, minimum biofilm inhibition concentrations (MBIC50) and minimum biofilm reduction concentrations (MBRC50) were determined using the micro-dilution method. The chloroform/methanol fraction showed the highest anti-biofilm activities with a MBIC50 of 8 mg/ml and a MBRC50 of 16 mg/ml against Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. The significant inhibition of GTFs activity and biofilm formation demonstrated by Nidus Vespae shows it to be a promising natural product for the prevention of dental caries. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We determined the effects of DBT on blood lipid and expression of genes related to foam cell formation in the early stage of atherosclerosis in diabetic GK rats. DBT (3 or 6 g/kg/day for 4 weeks) was orally administrated to the diabetic atherosclerosis rats, which were induced by nitric oxide inhibition (L-NAME in drinking water, 1 mg/ml) plus high-fat diet. The total cholesterol (TC), triglyeride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the mRNAs expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and CD36 mRNA in aorta were determined. The results demonstrated that DBT could regulate blood lipid, inhibit the genes expression of MCPA, ICAM-1 and CD36 in aorta. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there have been few systematic assessments of the quality of reporting of these trials. Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of reporting of RCTs in TCM Journals published in mainland China from 1999 to 2004. Methods: Thirteen TCM journals were randomly selected by stratified sampling of the similar to 100 TCM journals published in mainland China. All issues of the selected journals published from 1999 to 2004 were hand-searched according to guidelines from the Cochrane Centre. All reviewers underwent training in the evaluation of RCTs at the Chinese Centre of Evidence-based Medicine. A comprehensive quality assessment of each RCT was completed using a modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist (total of 30 items) and the Jadad scale. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Results: Seven thousand four hundred twenty-two RCTs were identified. The proportion of published RCTs relative to all types of published clinical trials increased significantly over the period studied, from 18.6% in 1999 to 35.9% in 2004 (P < 0.001). The mean (SD) Jadad score was 1.03 (0.61) overall. One RCT had a Jadad score of 5 points; 14 had a score of 4 points; and 102 had a score of 3 points. The mean (SD) Jadad score was 0.85 (0.53) in 1999 (746 RCTs) and 1.20 (0.62) in 2004 (1634 RCTs). Across all trials, 39.4% of the items on the modified CONSORT checklist were reported, which was equivalent to 11.82 (5.78) of the 30 items. Some important methodologic components of RCTs were incompletely reported, such as sample-size calculation (reported in 1.1% of RCTs), randomization sequence (7.9%), allocation concealment (0.3%), implementation of the random-allocation sequence (0%), and analysis of intention to treat (0%). Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the quality of reporting of RCTs of TCM has improved, but remains poor.

At 72 h after cyclophosphamide injection (250 mg/kg), the mice were administered AMI (500 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 6 consecutive days or an equivalent volume of saline as a control. Murine colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) formation, production of IL-6 and GM-CSF by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), and bcl-2 protein and mRNA expression in BMSC were measured by CFU-F assay, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The results indicated that AMI improved the hematopoietic microenvironment by enhancing the BMSC survival and proliferation of CFU-F, production of IL-6 as well as GM-CSF by BMSC and bcl-2 protein and mRNA expression in BMSC, which promoted myellopoiesis. The data may provide a mechanistic basis for applying this ancient Chinese herb to promote hematopoiesis as an efficacious adjuvant therapy against myellosuppression induced by anti-cancer therapy.

To solve these problems, we developed a thermosensitive in situ gelling and mucoadhesive ophthalmic drug delivery system containing puerarin based on poloxamer analogs (21 % (w/v) poloxamer 407/5% (w/v) poloxamer 188) and carbopol (0.1% (w/v) or 0.2% (w/v) carbopol 1342P NF). The combined solutions would convert to firm gels under physiological condition and attach to the ocular mucosal surface for a relative long time. The incorporation of carbopol 1342P NF not only did not affect the pseudoplastic behavior with hysteresis of the poloxamer analogs solution and leaded to a higher shear stress at each shear rate, but also enhanced the mucoadhesive force significantly. In vitro release studies demonstrated diffusion-controlled release of puerarin from the combined solutions over a period of 8 h. In vivo evaluation (the elimination of puerarin in tear and intraocular pressure-lowering effect) indicated the combined solutions had better ability to retain drug than poloxamer analogs or carbopol alone. It appears that ocular bioavailability can be increased more readily by using the in situ gelling and mucoadhesive vehicle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Knowledge is limited, however, on its effects on embryonic development. Methods: Whole embryo culture was applied to explore the effects of aconitine on rat embryos during their critical period of organogenesis. All embryos isolated on gestational day 9.5 were exposed to 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mu g/ml of aconitine with and without S-9 mix, and scored for their growth and differentiation at the end of the 48-hr culture period. Results: The embryonic growth and development were adversely affected at the concentration of 2.5 mu g/ml aconitine without S9 mix, represented as reduced crown-rump length and head length, decreased number of somites, and lower morphologic score. When the concentration of aconitine was increased to 5 mu g/ml, it induced severe dysmorphogenesis effects, including cardiac defect (undivided cardiac tube and inflated pericardial cavity), irregular somites, and brain malformation (e.g., narrow brain vesicles). In the presence of S9 mix, Aconitine toxicity to rat embryos was reduced to a certain extent. Conclusions: Our study showed that Aconitine had direct embryotoxic effects during the rat organogenetic period. NOAEL was about 1 mu g/ml and metabolism in S-9 mix could induce the attenuation of Aconitine toxicity. Until more is known about the effects of Aconitine in pregnant women, we suggest its use should be treated with caution.

The adsorption of (L)-arginine on the adsorbent was time, pH, initial concentration of (L)-arginine and temperature dependent. The adsorption process followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and was endothermic (Delta H = 24.66 KJ/mol). Almost 100% (L)-arginine adsorbed on the adsorbent could be recovered with a 2.0 mol/L NH4OH or 2.0 mol/L NH4Cl aqueous solution. After 25 and 40 cycles of adsorption and desorption, the decrease in adsorption capacity reached to 4.9% and 20.3%, respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are a number of herbal medicines that are reported to improve brain function and intelligence. In the present study, the ameliorating effects of an essential oil extracted from Acori graminei rhizoma on learning and memory in aged, dysmnesia rats and mice were determined using the step-down passive avoidance test and Y maze. Oral administration of the essential oil (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 g kg(-1)) to rats for 30 days and to mice for 15 days improved the latency and number of errors in aged, dysmnesia rats and mice. The cerebral neurotransmitters in aged rats given the essential oil (0.02, 0.04, 0.08 g kg-1) for 30 days were also investigated, and increased levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin, and decreased levels of acetylcholinesterase activity were found. The results suggest that the essential oil improves cognitive function in aged animals possibly by increasing norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin relative levels, and by decreasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the cerebra.

Simultaneous separation of these fourteen amino acids was achieved on a Prevail C(18) column. Under the condition of gradient elution, the fourteen amino acids were separated within 25 min. The drift tube temperature of ELSD was set at 115 degrees C, and with the nitrogen flow rate of 2.5 l/min. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r > 0.9975) within test ranges. The recoveries ranged from 94.8% to 104.4%. The limit of detection (LOD) for each compound was more than 20 mg/l at a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3. The validated method was successfully applied to quantify fourteen amino acids from Whitinania pigra, which provides a new basis of overall assessment on quality of Whitinania pigra.

In this paper, we use this technology to discover gene expression patterns in the cold syndrome in Chinese medicine. We identify differentially expressed genes and extracted gene modules that are enriched with differentially expressed genes in the cold syndrome by analyzing cDNA samples, which are purified from blood taken from a pedigree. Our results suggest that the cold syndrome might be caused by the physiological imbalance and/or the disorder of metabolite processes. The study confirms the hypotheses about molecular pathways responsible to human metabolic-related diseases.

In this experiment, two kinds of magnetic MS, e.g. BSA MS and PEG-incorporated BSA microspheres (PMS) were prepared. The obtained MS were characterized by Malvern laser particle sizer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained MS were spherical and about 1.3 mu m in size. The magnetic responsivity and in vitro release behavior of these MS were studied in detail. The in vivo distribution and targeting delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) magnetic MS after artery administration were studied in rat. The results showed that PMS could efficiently delivery 5-Fu to the targeted site compared with BSA MS without PEG MS and free drug.

The effect of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) on the aqueous solubility and in vitro corneal permeation of puerarin was also investigated. The puerarin solubility increased linearly and proportionally to the HP-beta-CD concentrations and 5% (w/v) HP-beta-CD enhanced its ocular permeability significantly. Carbopol (R) 980NF was used as the gelling agent in combination with HPMC (Methocel E4M) which acted as a viscosity-enhancing agent. The optimum concentrations of Carbopol (R) 980NF and HPMC E4M for the in situ gel-forming delivery systems were 0.1% (w/v) and 0.4% (w/v), respectively. When these two vehicles were combined, an in situ gel that had the appropriate gel strength and gelling capacity under physiological condition could be obtained. This combined solution could flow freely under nonphysiological condition and showed the character of pseudoplastic fluid under both conditions. Both in vitro release studies and in vivo pharmacokinetics studies indicated that the combined polymer systems performed better in retaining puerarin than puerarin eye drops did. These results demonstrate that the Carbopol (R) 980NF/HPMC E4M can be a viable alternative to conventional puerarin eye drops to enhance ocular bioavailability and patient compliance.
