Nanosilver/graphene (Ag/G) was added to the PU matrix to prepare Ag/G/PU nanocomposites. EDS, SEM and XRD are used for assaying the silver content and characterization of Ag/G. TEM, FT-IR, XRD and EDS were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites. The TEM results show that Ag/G belongs to sheet structures and is dispersed in a PU matrix. The SEM showed that the strong interfacial adhesion between the Ag/G and PU is indicated. FT-IR spectra analysis shows that the functional group of PU is free of obvious changes by adding a small amount of Ag/G in the PU matrix. XRD results showed that the main crystalline peak (26 degrees) of Ag/G became more apparent with increasing content of Ag/G, and EDS showed that the content of Ag increased with increasing content of Ag/G in the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites are improved with increasing content of Ag/G. Contact angle and AFM results showed that the hydrophobicity and surface roughness increased with increasing content of Ag/G. Moreover, the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites exhibit antibacterial activities toward Staphylococcus aureus as well as Escherichia coli and their antibacterial rates increase with increasing Ag/G. In addition, the electrical conductivity measurements showed that both surface and volume resistance of the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites decreased as the amount of Ag/G increased.

The set S is called a divisor chain if there is a permutation sigma on {1, ... , h} such that x(sigma(1))vertical bar...vertical bar x(sigma(h)). We say that the set S consists of finitely many quasi-coprime divisor chains if we can partition S as S = S-1 boolean OR ... boolean OR S-k, where k >= 1 is an integer and all S-i (1 <= i <= k) are divisor chains such that (max(S-i), max(S-j)) = gcd(S) for any 1 <= i not equal j <= k. For any arithmetic function f, define the function f(a) for any positive integer n by f(a)(n) := (f(n))(a). The matrix (f(a)(S)) is the h x h matrix having f(a) evaluated at the the greatest common divisor of x(i) and x (j) as its (i, j)-entry and the matrix (f(a) [S]) is the h x h matrix having f(a) evaluated at the least common multiple of x(i) and x(j) as its (i, j) entry. In this paper, when f is an integer-valued arithmetic function and S consists of finitely many quasi-coprime divisor chains, we establish the divisibility theorems between the power matrices (f(a)(S)) and (f(b)(S)), and between the power matrices (f(a)[S]) and (f(b)[S]) in the ring M-h(Z) of h x h matrices over integers. This extends Hong's theorem obtained in 2008 and the theorem of Tan and Li gotten in 2013.

The addition of ACM could accelerate the cross-linking reaction of PVA, and increase pore nucleus, resulting in a decrease of pore size and formation of a homogeneous and compact porous network structure. Under proper content of ACM, the shear elastic modulus (G') and network density (fie) of the composite hydrogels can be improved, leading to an enhancement of the mechanical property and hydraulic shock resistance. The PVA/1.5 wt % ACM hydrogel presented the best long-term hydraulic stability, and the toughening mechanism was studied. The values of oxygen uptake rate and chemical oxygen demand removal rate of PVA/ACM composite hydrogels embedded with microorganism fluctuated with the addition of ACM, and a high microorganism activity can be retained.

The present study firstly used the orthogonal test to compare the differences in extraction of chlorogenic acid in leaves and stems of Crofton weed by using three kinds of solvents, namely water, ethanol and ethyl acetate. The best effect was found by using ethonolic extraction of chlorogenic acid in Crofton weed. Further, by choosing Escherichia coli as test object, in-vitro antibacterial test was conducted to study the antimicrobial activities of chlorogenic acid by testing a series of indexes before and after the interaction between chlorogenic acid and Escherichia coli, to clarify the antibacterial mechanism of chlorogenic acid on Escherichia coli. Finally, by comparing the antibacterial activities of isochlorogenic acid A on Escherichia coli, it was concluded that both chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid A showed antibacterial activities against Escherichia colt, wherein chlorogenic acid had a better antibacterial effect on Escherichia colt than isochlorogenic acid A.

We took the Coriolis coupling (CC) effect into account and presented the comparison between the CC and the centrifugal sudden (CS) approximation calculations. Reaction probabilities obtained using the different methods were thoroughly compared as a function of the collision energy for a series of total angular momentum J values. Significant differences of integral cross section between CC and CS results have been observed. The QCT-calculated cross sections and probabilities reproduced well the CC results over most of the collision energy range. In addition, the attack angle dependent reaction probabilities of the title reaction at J = 0 were calculated. The reaction probabilities were found to be strongly dependent on the attack angle. The influences of the reactant vibration excitation on the attack angle dependent reaction probabilities were also studied in detail.

The influences of smelting temperature, smelting time, and the basicity of the metallized pellet on vanadium and iron recovery were investigated. The characteristics of titanium slag were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and mineralographic microscopic analysis. The results demonstrate that appropriate increases in smelting temperature and smelting time can improve the vanadium and iron recovery from metallized pellets and arc beneficial for the slag-iron separation. Although increasing the basicity of the metallized pellet can considerably improve the vanadium and iron recovery, the TiO2 grade of titanium slag was decreased. Under the optimal conditions, 90.17% of vanadium and 92.98% of iron in the metallized pellet were recovered, and the TiO2 grade of titanium slag was 55.01%. It was found that anosovite, augite, spinel, glassiness, and metallic iron were the main mineral phases of the titanium slag.

However, performance guarantees rely heavily on the premise that an exact tree projection (ETP) algorithm is employed. Nevertheless, for a given sparsity, the condensing sort and select algorithm in the model-based compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm can only yield an approximate tree projection. Therefore, in order to ensure reconstruction precision, the authors propose the combination of an ETP algorithm with the CoSaMP algorithm. Further, the hierarchical wavelet connected tree is also integrated into the ETP-CoSaMP algorithm to offset the high computational complexity of the ETP algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the hierarchical ETP based on CoSaMP algorithm (HETP-CoSaMP algorithm) enhances reconstruction accuracy while retaining reconstruction time that is comparable with that of the model-based CoSaMP algorithm.

The results showed that all of the alloys were consisted of the V-based solid solution main phase with a body centered cubic (bcc) structure and the TiNi-based secondary phases. The secondary phases were mainly in the grain boundaries with network distribution, and some of the secondary phase particles were distributed in the main phase. The cell volumes of the main phase and the maximum discharge capacity of the alloy electrodes decreased with the increase of Chromium (Cr) content, while the cycle stability of the alloy electrodes was gradually increased. At the same time, the kinetic performance of the alloy electrodes improved. The activation performance of the alloy electrodes deteriorated when the Chromium element was added, but further increase of Cr content did not change the activation performance significantly. The V2.1TiNi0.3Cr0.4 alloy showed the best electrochemical properties among the investigated alloys. Its maximum discharge capacity reached 442.20 mAh . g(-1) and its capacity retention ratio after 20 cycles was 81.91%.

The FRST can identify geological features by rotating the fractional Fourier transform frequency (FRFTfr) axis. Different seismic signals have different optimal fractional parameters which is not conducive to multichannel seismic data processing. Thus, we first decompose the common-frequency sections by the FRST and then we analyze the low-frequency shadow. Second, the combination of the FRST and blind-source separation is used to obtain the independent spectra of the various geological features. The seismic data interpretation improves without requiring to estimating the optimal fractional parameters. The top and bottom of a limestone reservoir can be clearly recognized on the common-frequency section, thus enhancing the vertical resolution of the analysis of the low-frequency shadows compared with traditional ST. Simulations suggest that the proposed method separates the independent frequency information in the time-fractional-frequency domain. We used field seismic and well data to verify the proposed method.

However, this method has a disadvantage that the coating tends to fall off when the fibers are exposed to an external force. In the present research, A diamine monomer 2-(4-aminophenyl)-5-aminobenzimidazole (PABZ) was introduced to modify poly (p-phenylene terephthalamide) by copolymerization, and corresponding modified aramid fibers (PBIA fibers) were prepared. we found that PBIA fibers can form complex with hydrogen chloride (HCl) which would not lead to the obvious decrease in mechanical properties, and the decomplexation of HCl can only be achieved at high temperature (higher than 280 degrees C). At the same time, PBIA/HCl complex molecule showed intense fluorescence emission, and which can provide an effective way to dissipate the harmful UV energy, thus, the UV resistance of PBIA fibers can be improved. In addition, the HCl have the ability to quench the photoactive triplet state of PBIA fibers, which can also contribute to improve the UV resistance of PBIA fibers. After 48 h UV irradiation, the PBIA/HCl complex fibers almost remained their tensile performances (only about 3% loss in tensile strength), and UV irradiation did not bring the obvious deterioration in structure and performance of the complex fibers. On the contrary, for PBIA fibers, its chemical structure and physical properties all suffered to obvious damages (about 15% loss in tensile strength). The UV resistance of PBIA/HCl complex fibers is approximately 5 times higher than that of PBIA fibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that high-temperature reduction or oxidization produces phase and structure transformations on ilmenite that facilitate the dissolution of iron, reduce the dissolution of titanium, and facilitate the hydrolysis of dissolved titanium. The results further indicate that oxidation at temperatures ranging from 1023 K (750 degrees C) to 1273 K (1000 degrees C) can significantly decrease the proportion of fine products. It is believed that the structure of oxidized ilmenite played an important role in minimizing the proportion of fine materials.

Results indicate that flat sheets of GO promote the formation of the TiO2NTs. GO is reduced during the hydrothermal and calcination steps, and is inserted into the TiO2 layers by the interaction between oxygen-containing groups on both the GO and TiO2. The rates of GO decomposition, GO reduction and TiO2 NT formation are temperature dependent. The TiO2 NT-GO hybrid calcined at 350 degrees C has a high degree of crystallization, a red-shifted absorption and the highest observed photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue.

The study mainly focuses on their efficacies and the optimization of the major operational parameters. The experimental results show that the joint application for conditioning sewage sludge is effective, especially using lime and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as skeleton builders. Additionally, it is revealed that Fe(II)-activated persulphate oxidation needs sufficient reaction time (20 min) to degrade organics in the sludge. The optimal conditions of this process are at Fe2+=47.6 mg g(-1) (dry solids), S-2 O82-=119.1 mg g(-1), lime=446.4 mg g(-1), and OPC=297.6 mg g(-1), under which the water content of dewatered sludge cake is 54.8% and the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) is 4.3 x 10(11) m kg(-1) with a reduction efficiency of 96.6%.

The sesquiterpenoid cantharidin, which is secreted mostly by adult male beetles, has recently been used as an anti-cancer drug. However, little is known about the mechanisms of cantharidin biosynthesis. Furthermore, there is currently no genomic or transcriptomic information for M. cichorii. In this study, we performed de novo assembly transcriptome of M. cichorii using the Illumina Hiseq2000. A single run produced 9.19 Gb of clean nucleotides comprising 29,247 sequences, including 23,739 annotated sequences (about 81%). We also constructed two expression profile libraries (20-25 day-old adult males and 20-25 day-old adult females) and discovered 2,465 significantly differentially-expressed genes. Putative genes and pathways involved in the biosynthesis of cantharidin were then characterized. We also found that cantharidin biosynthesis in M. cichorii might only occur via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, not via the methylerythritol 4-phosphate/deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway or a mixture of these. Besides, we considered that cantharidin biosynthesis might be related to the juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis or degradation. The results of transcriptome and expression profiling analysis provide a comprehensive sequence resource for M. cichorii that could facilitate the in-depth study of candidate genes and pathways involved in cantharidin biosynthesis, and may thus help to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cantharidin biosynthesis in blister beetles.

A locally adaptive weighting based on monogenic phase congruency and chaotic swarm optimization is used to produce a more robust method. Since the fixed regularization parameter cannot adapt to the grayscale difference between flat and edge patches, the box filter radius and regularization parameter of guided image filtering have significant influences on image-denoising effects. The chaotic swarm optimization algorithm, which is an improved optimization algorithm with a self-adapting search space, is adopted to find their optimal values for the best denoising effects. Compared with traditional guided image filtering for image denoising and other state-of-the-art methods with image quality as a performance metric, experimental results showed that the proposed denoising algorithm can not only remove noise efficiently and reduce halo artifacts, but can also preserve the edge texture well.

Disc diffusion assay and agar well diffusion assays were used to examine the antibacterial efficacy of this compound by measuring zones of inhibition and MIC/MBC values. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was involved to study the effect of this compound on cellular morphology of Shigella dysenteriae. Results revealed that seneciolactone exhibited moderate to potent antibacterial activity against different bacterial strains. Zones of inhibition and MIC/MBC values indicated that seneciolactone was most potent against S. dysenteriae followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli. SEM results indicated that seneciolactone induced potent damage to the cell membrane of the tested bacteria. As compared to the untreated control which exhibited normal cellular morphology, the seneciolactone treated bacterial cells revealed severe damage to the cellular membrane particularly at the higher doses.

However, this paper proposes a kind of curvilinear tooth gear which is processed by a parallel linkage with a single blade cutter. For the purpose of identifying the meshing and contact characteristics of curvilinear tooth gears, the paper covers the following: (i) equations of tooth surfaces are deduced from the meshing theory, and a parameterized geometric model is developed by applying computer graphics; (ii) an investigation into meshing characteristics for an ideal assembly condition is performed, and an instantaneous contact curve is obtained from the developed tooth contact algorithm; (iii) based on the application of the finite element method, the evolution of contact and bending stresses during the cycle of meshing and between different arc radii of the curvilinear tooth is illustrated by numerical examples. The result shows that curvilinear tooth gear drives possess a higher contact ratio, severe contact stresses on the top edge of the tooth, and lower contact and bending stresses between appropriate arc radii, hence they may replace spur gears in the future.

Based on economic theory, this paper analyses core stakeholders' behaviour in the tourism community at Qingcheng Mountain, Chengdu, China. Taking taxation, land prices and employment as the payoffs, and the local government, the community and the investors as the players, the incomplete information static game model is applied to outline the stakeholders' behaviour. The paper also examines who benefits the most and who occupies a dominant position. The results indicate that the game strategy of residents in Qingcheng Mountain is influenced by the investors. The influence of the investors is also crucial in the decision making mechanism of the tourism community to maintain sustainable tourism development.

BASED ON RAPD AND SRAP MARKERS	BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Conyza blinii; RAPD; SRAP; Genetic diversity; HPLC	POPULATIONS; ISSR	The genetic diversity and genetic relationships among 16 populations of Conyza blinii in the Panxi area of China were assessed by RAPD and SRAP markers. Relative to independent molecular markers, the combined RAPD-SRAP data showed a more reasonable cluster (r = 0.80718), and the clustering results divided the 16 populations into three groups. One major group was formed by populations from Pzhihua city (nos. 1 to 7) and another two populations from Liangshan prefecture (nos. 8 and 9); two populations (nos. 10 and 11) collected from Liangshan clustered into the second category, and the remaining populations made up cluster III. The samples clustered into two groups based on the content of blinin (the characteristic compound of this plant), except samples 4, 5 and 16, other samples were clustered similar like molecular markers, they all gathered together based on their similar distance. The Jaccard's similarity coefficients ranged from 0.5073 to 0.8422, the results suggested that the genetic variation of wild populations was not abundant. However, based on blinin content (detected by HPLC), there was a large difference among populations although populations had a close genetic relationship which revealed that samples were not fully related to their geographical location. The result has important implications for C. blinii characterization, improvement, and conservation.

To investigate the particular features of the ancient wood joint, three 1: 4 scaled models of a double-span timber frame with two exterior joints and an interior joint were fabricated according to the construction method commonly used in Chinese traditional wood structures, and tested subjected to fully reversed cyclic loading. Investigated were the mechanical properties of the ITSD mortise-tenon joints such as the connection stiffness and flexibility, hysteretic model and the relationship between the bending moment and relative rotation (i.e. the M-theta' model). The constitutive parameters of the Kishi-Chen M-theta' model for ITSD mortisetenon joints were calibrated using statistical fitting methods. Besides, an assumption applicable to the connection type (e.g. pinned, semi-rigid or rigid joint) at a given connection bending-moment level was suggested with respect to practical engineering purposes. Furthermore, the M-theta' model obtained for ITSD mortis-tenon joints was incorporated into the commercial software SAP2000, and the experimental hysteretic curves obtained for the three scaled specimens were compared with the curves obtained using finite element method (FEM), it was found that the M-theta' model validated by this study was applicable to the ITSD mortise-tenon joint.

The microstructure, surface composition, layer by layer element distribution and molecular structure of galvanized steel sheet passivation coating were revealed in scanning electron microscopy, X ray photoelectron spectroscopy, glow discharge atomic emission spectrometry and infrared spectrometry, respectively. The results show that: in one hand, using the silane coupling agent would produce many sol-gel particles in the passivation solution. On the other hand, tannic acid would produce spatial mesh structure. Therefore, passivation solution would generate a smooth, uniform and compact galvanized steel sheet passivation coating or membrane.

However, this malignancy displays resistance against current therapeutic strategies. One of major causes leading to bad outcomes for lung cancer therapy is the lack of understanding on its tumorigenesis and progression. To explore the molecular mechanism by which lung cancer progresses, we employed multidisciplinary approaches and used lung cancer cell lines as research models. miR-1244 was underexpressed in lung carcinoma by 40.6-73.8%, which is highly associated with patients' survival. miR-1244 restoration was shown to affect the proliferation, survival, and invasion of lung cancer cells. miR-1244 suppression rendered normal lung fibroblasts with malignant phenotypes. miR-1244 overexpression can reduce the growth of lung cancer xenografts. miR-1244 was then verified to negatively regulate the expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) in lung cancer cells. MEF2D can also affect the expression of miR-1244 by directly binding to its promoter. Further study showed that MEF2D is required for the effect of miR-1244 on lung cancer and normal cells. These results suggested that there is an autoregulatory circuit consisting of miR-1244 and MEF2D, which contributes to the progression of lung cancer. Targeting this molecular loop may be a promising strategy for lung carcinoma treatment.

First, a strong initial ECL signal was achieved by the dual amplification strategies of (i) intramolecular coreaction of a self-enhanced Ru(II)-based molecule (PTCA-PEI-Ru(II)) and (ii) intermolecular coreaction between PTCA-PEI-Ru(II) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which was named the signal-on state. Then, a novel triple quenching of the effect of multifunctional hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzymes upon the Ru(II) complex-based ECL system was designed to realize the desirable signal-off state, which was outlined as follows: (i) the hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzymes mimicked NADH oxidase to oxidize NADH and in situ generate the H2O2, consuming the coreactant of NADH; (ii) its active center of hemin could oxidize the excited state PTCA-PEI-Ru(II)* to PTCA-PEI-Ru(III), making the energy and electron transfer quench; (iii) it also acted as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the H2O2 for in situ producing the quencher of O-2. Based on triple quenching of the effect of hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzymes, the highly sensitive "on-off" thrombin aptasensor was developed with a wide linear detection range of 1.0 x 10(-14) M to 1.0 x 10(-10) M and a detection limit down to the femtomolar level.

The effect of total titanium concentration on the structure of the titania photocatalysts was investigated. The photocatalytic activity of FST samples was evaluated by studying the photooxidation of methylene blue in aqueous solution under irradiation with UV light or visible light. The results indicate that Fe-doping can effectively reduce the apparent band gap energy of titania and consequently extend the spectral response range to visible light. In addition, Fe-doping is beneficial to dissociation of adsorbed H2O, and subsequent formation of surface hydroxyl groups, and promoting the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Sulfation has effects of orienting, stabilizing, and supporting the mesoporous structure, and also effectively increases surface acidity. All these effects enhance the photocatalytic activity of FST samples.

The electronic and magnetic properties of the model system, zigzag pristine boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), are investigated under a transverse electric field (E) through spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. As E increases, the band gap of BNNTs is reduced due to charge redistribution induced by the asymmetry of electrostatic potential energy, and BNNTs experience rich phase transitions, such as semiconductor-metal transition and nonmagnetic (NM) metal-ferromagnetic (FM) metal transitions. Electric-field-induced magnetization occurs when a sufficiently high density of states at the Fermi level in the vicinity of metal-insulator transition is reached due to the redistribution of electronic bands and charge transferring across the BNNTs. Further analysis show that the spontaneous magnetization is derived from the localized nature of the 2p states of B and N, and the ferromagnetic coupling is stabilized by Zener's double-exchange mechanism. Our results may provide a viable way to realize spintronic devices for applications.

ISOLATION AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF McMenA, A GENE ENCODING A 1,4-DIHYDROXY-2-NAPHTHOATE OCTAPRENYLTRANSFERASE IN Mylabris cichorii	ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						McMenA; gene function; RNAi; cantharidin; biosynthesis	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BLISTER BEETLES; CANTHARIDIN; BIOSYNTHESIS; MENAQUINONE; COLEOPTERA; MELOIDAE; VITAMIN-K-2; CLONING	Cantharidin is a biomolecule with a role in host defense that can also be used as an anticancer drug. The in vivo biosynthetic pathway for cantharidin has been the subject of debate for several decades and the mechanism is not yet completely understood. To study the biosynthetic pathway of cantharidin in blister beetles, Mylabris cichori, a full-length MenA (McMenA) cDNA was cloned based on the partial sequence of the MenA gene from a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library of male and female adult M. cichorii. The cDNA was 1264 base pairs (bp) with an open reading frame of 1026 bp nucleotides encoding a 341 amino acid protein. Analysis of the McMenA amino acid sequence showed that the aspartate rich motif N/DDxxD represented binding sites for prenyl diphosphate via a Mg2+ ion. Phylogenetic analysis showed that McMenA was most closely related to MenA of Tribolium castaneum, and the amino acid sequence similarity was 86%. The expression pattern of McMenA in adults was analyzed using RT-qPCR, and we found that the highest expression of McMenA occurred during 22-25 days in the sex-separate breeding males, while the lowest expression occurred in females at the same time. Injection with a specific double-strand RNA (dsRNA) of McMenA led to a significant reduction of McMenA mRNA levels after 24 h. Cantharidin and ATP concentrations dropped around the same time. Together, our data showed that the McMenA gene might be involved in cantharidin biosynthesis. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Liao, Y. F.; Wang, Y.; Huang, Y.; Zha, S. F.; Liu, J. J.; Wang, Z.

Methods: 684 survivors from Beichuan county, the center of the Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008, were evaluated using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) questionnaire in 2013. Results: The prevalence of PTSD among survivors was 9.2% in 2013. Significant risk factors of PTSD included gender (females 12.1%, males 5.2%), age (18-35 y 0.8%, 36-59 y 9.7%, >= 60 y 12.9%), occupation (farmers 12.2%, non-farmers 1.6%), education (less than high school 11.0%; > = high school 0.8%) and family member loss (yes: 12.4%, no: 7.3%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that females, older people, farmers and those with family member loss were significantly more likely to develop PTSD. Conclusions: Posttraumatic stress symptoms remained relatively common among survivors five years after the "5.12" Earthquake in Beichuan county, China. It is important to provide psychological aid and social support for survivors to decease health burden from PTSD, especially for females, farmers, old age survivors and those with family member loss.

Most of the algorithms in the literature assume that the noise is spatially white. However, this assumption cannot be satisfied in multiple-input multiple-output systems when the channel is impaired by interference and jamming. This paper focuses on solving this problem by utilizing higher order statistics (HOS). Utilizing the diagonal structure of the cumulant matrices, the components of the unitarily transformed signals corresponding to the noise subspace follow Gaussian law. A statistic is proposed to test the Gaussianity of the signals with explicit mathematical explanation. Simulations verify the validity of our algorithm in spatially correlated noise.

The specific resistance to filtration (SRF) and moisture of sludge cake (MSC) were adopted to evaluate the improvement of sludge dewaterability. After 2-day bioleaching, the sludge pH dropped to about 2.5 which satisfied the acidic condition for Fenton oxidation. Meanwhile, the SRF declined from 6.45 x 10(10) to 2.07 x 10(10) s(2)/g, and MSC decreased from 91.42% to 87.66%. The bioleached sludge was further conditioned with Fenton oxidation. From an economical point of view, the optimal dosages of (HO2)-O-2 and Fe2+ were 0.12 and 0.036 mol/L, respectively, and the optimal reaction time was 60 min. Under optimal conditions, SRF, volatile solids reduction, and MSC were 3.43 x 10(8) s(2)/g, 36.93%, and 79.58%, respectively. The stability and settleability of sewage sludge were both improved significantly. Besides, the results indicated that bioleaching-Fenton oxidation was more efficient in dewatering the sewage sludge than traditional Fenton oxidation. The sludge conditioning mechanisms by bioleaching-Fenton oxidation might mainly include the flocculation effects and the releases of extracellular polymeric substances-bound water and intercellular water.

The structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (IR), morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical composition of samples were analyzed by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX), while the doping dosage of Co element was measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The results show that the Co-substituted Li1.03Mn2O4 samples display a single phase of cubic spinel structure, and have enhanced particle size uniformity and surface smoothness. The electrochemical performance tests show that the rate capability and cycling performances of Co-substituted samples are significantly improved compared with that of pristine Li1.03Mn2O4. The sample (Li1.03Mn0.85Co0.15O4) with 15 mol% of Co-substitution has discharge capacity of 106mAh . g(-1) at 2C and shows an improved average capacity retention of 97.2% compared with that of the Li1.03Mn2O4 which shows 87.7% capacity retention after 50 cycles at 1C rate.

The effects of oxidation, magnetic separation and pressure leaching were examined to optimize the experimental conditions. The optimum conditions were found to be: oxidation: 900 degrees C, 30 min; magnetic separation: excitation intensity 5.0 A, charging current 1.1 A, feeding speed 100 g/min; pressure leaching: 220 g/l HCl solution, 6 h at 135 degrees C,S/L ratios of 1:4 and 0.12 MPa pressure. Under these conditions, synthetic rutile was obtained with 93.7% TiO2, 2.31% Fe. The particles are mostly sized above 105 mu m and can be used as a feed for chlorination processes.

It was found that glycerol could increase the consumption of H3BO3 and decelerate the crosslinking reaction of PVA. Crosslinked structures of borate-PVA monodiol complex (abbreviation as BP) and PVA-borate-PVA didiol complex (abbreviation as BP2) were formed, and the proportion of BP2 increased by the introduction of glycerol. Moreover, the pores of the core and surface layers exhibited a similar size and the structure of the PVA/glycerol hydrogel was relatively uniform. With increasing glycerol content, the shear storage modulus (G') and the effective network density (nu(e)) increased first, then decreased, and reached a maximum in the presence of 1.5 wt% glycerol, indicating the formation of a dense network structure of the gel, resulting in an improvement in the tensile properties and crushing strength of the gel beads. PVA/1.5 wt% glycerol immobilized with and without a microorganism exhibited excellent hydrogel stability during long-term wastewater treatment process. The reactive toughening mechanism of glycerol on the PVA hydrogel was explored. The value of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and COD removal rate of the PVA hydrogel immobilized with activated sludge had no obvious difference with addition of glycerol, and a high microbial activity can be maintained.

The effects of pressure, residence time, temperature, catalyst on gasification efficiency were studied. The results indicated that pressure change had no significant influence on gasification efficiency. Higher temperature and longer residence time enhanced gasification efficiency, and lower temperature favoured the production of H-2. The carbon gasification ratio and hydrogen gasification ratio were up to 98 and 138% at 953 K, 140 s and 300 mg/l KOH, respectively, which demonstrated that phenol can be completely gasified in SCW.

However, the capacity fading problem limits its practical application, especially when a high cut-off voltage over 4.3 V is applied. In this study, the capacity fading mechanisms of LVP in different voltage windows of 3.0-4.3 V and 3.0-4.8 V are studied systematically by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry, and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the structure of LVP can be fully recovered after one cycle (even for a cut-off voltage as high as 4.8 V). It indicates that LVP is a promising cathode system with excellent structure reversibility intrinsically. We revealed that the capacity fading during high voltage cycling is mainly due to the parasitic reaction with the electrolyte, kinetics limitation and V dissolution, rather than LVP structure degradation. In addition, a "crystalline-amorphouscrystalline" phase transition pathway was revealed during the LVP synthesis process of the solid-state reaction by using synchrotron based in situ X-ray diffraction.

In the present study, a novel Cu/Zn-SOD gene (JcCu/Zn-SOD) was cloned from Jatropha curcas L. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that JcCu/Zn-SOD is constitutively expressed in different tissues of J. curcas and induced under NaCl treatment. To characterize the function of this gene with respect to salt tolerance, the construct p35S:JcCu/Zn-SOD was developed and transformed into Arabidopsis using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Compared with wild-type, transgenic plants over-expressing JcCu/ Zn-SOD showed enhanced tolerance to salt stress during germination, seedling establishment, and growth in terms of longer root, larger rosette area, and a larger number of leaves in addition to higher SOD activity levels under NaCl stress. In addition, over-expression of JcCu/Zn-SOD resulted in lower monodialdehyde content in transgenic Arabidopsis compared to wild-type plants under the same NaCl stress. Therefore, JcCu/Zn-SOD can increase a plant salt stress tolerance potentially by reducing oxidant injury.	[Liu, Z. B.; Zhang, W.

J	Yang, CW; Zhang, SX; Zhang, JJ; Bi, JW				Yang Changwei; Zhang Shixian; Zhang Jianjing; Bi Junwei			Seismic Stability Time-Frequency Analysis Method of Reinforced Retaining Wall	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MESHLESS METHOD	The first-order differential equation of the seismic active earth pressure is established by horizontal slices analysis method, based on the elastic wave theory, with the summarized dynamic analysis model of the reinforced retaining wall and the plane of fracture assumed as linear type. And then this paper proposes a time-frequency analysis method for the internal antiseismic stability analysis on the retaining wall. The reasonability of this method is verified by the results from other methods, for example, rule. The internal frictional angle of filling earth, the seismic intensity, and the frequency of the input earthquake wave have a predominant effect on the needed total tensile force of the lacing wires, which shows that (1) the needed total tensile force of the lacing wires goes up with the increase of the PGA and the internal frictional angle; (2) the needed total tensile force of the expandability lacing wires is bigger than that of the nonexpandability lacing wires; (3) the needed total tensile force of lacing wires is saddle distributed and the force achieves maximum value when the frequency of input wave equals the natural frequency of reinforced retaining wall. Besides, if the reinforced retaining wall is designed in compliance with the rules, the emergency capacity of reinforced retaining wall is reduced. At last, this paper not only takes into account the effect of three factors of the seismic wave (PGA, frequency, and duration) on the internal antiseismic stability analysis of reinforced retaining wall but also provides some valuable references for the time-frequency seismic design of other retaining structures.

In this study, heterogeneous kinetics of particulate phosmet and parathion with NO3 radicals were investigated with a mixed-phase relative rate method. A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and an atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer were used to monitor online the decays of particulate OPPs and reference compound, respectively. Reactive uptake coefficients of NO3 radicals on phosmet and parathion particles were (0.12 +/- 0.03) and (0.14 +/- 0.04), respectively, calculated according to the measured OPPs loss ratios and the average NO3 concentrations. Additionally, the average effective rate constants for heterogeneous reactions of particulate phosmet and parathion with NO3 radicals measured under experimental conditions were (2.80 +/- 0.16) x 10(-12) and (2.97 +/- 0.13) x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), respectively. The experimental results of these heterogeneous reactions in the aerosol state provide supplementary knowledge for kinetic behaviors of airborne OPPs particles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent phase congruency, which is a dimensionless, normalized feature of a local structure, is used as the structure similarity feature. This paper proposes a novel feature similarity index that is Riesz transform based monogenic phase congruency feature similarity index (RMFSIM). RMFSIM is based on monogenic signal theory for full reference IQA. Monogenic phase congruency (MPC) map, instead of phase congruency map, is constructed utilizing the local phase, the local orientation and the local energy information of the 2D monogenic signal. The corresponding 1st-order and 2nd-order coefficients of the MPC map are obtained by Riesz transform. The local feature coefficients similarities are computed by the similarity measure, and then a final single quality score is derived from weighting feature coefficients similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity index is highly consistent with human subjective evaluations and achieves good performance with the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction monotonicity and accuracy.

The resulting NCDs were quasi-spherical particles with an average diameter of approximately 2.1 nm. They exhibited excellent photoluminescent properties and had favorable solubility in water. Furthermore, the NCDs had low cytotoxicity and were readily integrated with cytoplasm. This makes them particularly suitable for multicolor bioimaging. Most importantly, NCDs internalized by cancer cells can be detected at four channels simultaneously with flow cytometry, which further demonstrates that the NCDs can be used as multifunctional fluorescent probes for biomedical applications.

At the same time, comparative experiments were carried out on the irradiation of helium and hydrogen ions in tungsten. Without the argon ion irradiation, the energy of 35 keV hydrogen ions mainly accelerated the coalescence of defects created by the 60 keV helium ions, the irradiation damage degree increased with hydrogen ion fluence increasing. With the argon ion irradiation, lots of voids were created by argon ion irradiation, which increased the helium and hydrogen retention and the synergistic effect of helium-hydrogen in tungsten. In the same hydrogen fluence, the surface damage degree with argon ion pre-irradiation was higher than that without argon ion pre-irradiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The n x n matrix having eth power [x(i), x(j)]e of the least common multiple of xi and xj as its (i, j)-entry is called the eth power least common multiple (LCM) matrix on S, denoted by ([S](e)). The set S is said to be gcd closed (respectively, lcm closed) if (x(i), x(j)) is an element of S (respectively, [x(i), x(j)] is an element of S) for all 1 <= i, j <= n. In 2004, Shaofang Hong showed that the power LCM matrix ([S](e)) is nonsingular if S is a gcd-closed set such that each element of S holds no more than two distinct two prime factors. In this paper, this result is improved by showing that if S is a gcd-closed set such that every element of S contains at most two distinct prime factors or is of the form plqr with p, q and r being distinct primes and 1 <= l <= 4 being an integer, then except for the case that e = 1 and 270, 520, 810, 1040 is an element of S, the power LCM matrix ([S](e)) on S is nonsingular. This gives an evidence to a conjecture of Hong raised in 2002. For the lcm-closed case, similar results are established.

However, when carrying out ultrasonic testing, especially in the ultrasonic detection of small-diameter steel pipes with thick walls, a mass of structural noise causes the useful information to get lost. This is problematic because the quality of ultrasonic echo signals is the foundation for the pipeline flaw-identification and feature extraction. At present, the wavelet packet thresholding method is the most widely used in signal de-noising processes. In this paper, a de-noising method of a wavelet packet based on the threshold is proposed for the limitation of both soft and hard thresholds. The ultrasonic wave pipeline detection signal that is often contaminated by noise is de-noised by this method. Moreover, the contrastive analysis is performed among the wavelet packet transform based on an adjusted threshold, the original ultrasonic echo signal, and the default threshold. Experiment results show that the noise reduction effect of the wavelet packet based on the adjusted threshold is the most reasonable one, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signals is also improved.

Subsequent to irradiation, the grain orientations near (0 1 1), (1 0 1) and (1 1 1) planes on the surface are analyzed by SEM and EBSD. It is found that blister density is the greatest on the grain orientation near (1 1 1) plane, and the smallest on the grain orientation near (0 0 1) plane. Experiments suggest that blistering degree highly depends upon the grain orientation, blisters are easily formed on the grain orientation near (1 1 1) plane, and medium on the grain orientation near (1 0 1) plane, and the most rare on the grain orientation near (0 1 1) plane. The surface resistant orientation of tungsten is orientation near (0 0 1) plane. The atom binding energy in the crystal plane in combination with the channeling effect of adjacent crystal planes may play an important role for the difference of the surface morphology.

To our knowledge, there is no report on dealing with this problem in literature. In this paper, the STBC systems are represented with an independent component analysis (ICA) model by merging the channel and coding matrices as virtual channel matrix. Analysis shows that the source signals are of group-wise independence and the condition of mutual independence can not be satisfied for ordinary ICA algorithms when specific modulations are employed. A new multidimensional ICA algorithm is proposed to separate the intercepted signals in this case by jointly block-diagonalizing (JBD) the cumulant matrices. In this paper, JBD is achieved by a 2-step optimization algorithm and a contrast function is derived from the JBD criterion to remove the additional permutation ambiguity with explicit mathematical explanations. The convergence of the new method is guaranteed. Compared with the ICA-based channel estimation methods, simulations show that the new algorithm, which does not introduce additional ambiguities, achieves better performance with faster convergence in a non-cooperative scenario.

However, wild type N. commune has been decreasing in quantity as a result of ever-growing market demand and environmental pollution. Therefore, artificial culture of N. commune is important as it can bring great social and economic benefits. In this article, N. commune was cultured in BG11 medium, under which condition morphological variation and biomass growth of N. commune were investigated. Results indicated that concentration, fresh weight and dry weight of the colony increased fastest at 40 rpm from the 1st day to 14th day and the fresh and dry weight increased as the culturing time was prolonged, and reached 27.22 gl(-1) and 0.88 gl(-1) respectively on 56th day. Aggregated cell mass formed on 4th day and it expanded to asteriated colonies on 10th day. Single microcolonies formed on the 21st day had diameters 200-250 mu m. Macrocolonies obtained after 28 days had diameters of 5 mm on 42nd day. Discoid colonies were formed as macrocolonies ruptured on 49th day and the diameter reached 15 mm on 56th day. Results of the present study can promote large-scale industrial production of N. commune.

In this study, the heterogeneous kinetics of particulate ametryn with NO3 radicals were investigated with a mixed-phase relative rate method. A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and an atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer were synchronously used to online monitor the decays of particulate ametryn and gas-phase isoprene. The reactive uptake coefficient of NO3 radicals on ametryn particles was calculated to be 2.9 x 10(-2), according to the measured ametryn loss ratio and the average NO3 concentration. The effective rate constant for the heterogeneous reaction of particulate ametryn with NO3 radicals measured under experimental conditions was 8.4 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). In addition, atraton, ametryn sulfoxide and ametryn sulfone were identified as the reaction products by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The experimental results might shed light on the chemical behavior of atmospheric ametryn at night-time.

Lev.; blinin; DXS gene; RACE; semiquantitative RT-PCR; HPLC	MEVALONATE-INDEPENDENT PATHWAY; SEMIQUANTITATIVE RT-PCR; ISOPRENOID BIOSYNTHESIS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; OVEREXPRESSION; TRANSKETOLASES	Conyza blinii H. Lev. is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant that is distributed mainly in southwestern Sichuan and northern Yunnan. Its characteristic product is blinin, which has, among other properties, antigastric ulcer activity, and can serve as a quality-control standard for such medicine. The problem is that C. blinii only produces low yields of blinin. As a diterpene, blinin is likely formed by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway. While 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in diterpenoid biosynthesis, it is a switch in the pathway. The DXS gene was successfully cloned and characterized from C. blinii by homologous cloning and rapid-amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). It was designated cbDXS and contains a 2190-bp open reading frame encoding 730 amino acids (aa), including a 17-aa signal peptide and a 713-aa mature protein. Semiquantitative RTPCR was used to determine the expression levels of cbDXS in different C. blinii tissues at the seedling stage. The corresponding blinin concentrations were also analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cbDXS gene showed tissue specificity. Moreover, its expression levels were highly correlated to blinin concentrations. In summary, it is suggested that overexpression of this gene may increase flux toward blinin synthesis.

Herein, we first report nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) with heterogeneous multi-layered structures by bottom-up hydrothermal carbonization process. The formation and surface passivation of NCDs was accomplished simultaneously. The as-prepared NCDs possess stable photoluminescence, solubility in water and various functional groups on their surface. XRD results clearly showed that there were two kinds of interlayer lattice spaces in the phase structure of prepared NCDs, which corresponded to the {002} plane of graphite and the {001} plane of graphite oxide. We further demonstrated that NCDs with good biocompatibility were easily and quickly internalized by cancer cells and are particularly suitable for multicolour real-time cellular imaging.

The finite-time H-infinity control performance problem is solved and desired controller is given to ensure the system trajectory stays within a prescribed bound during a given time interval.

The effects of collision energy and reagent initial vibrational excitation on the reaction probability and cross sections are studied over a wide range of collision energies. The QCT-calculated reaction probability and cross sections are in good agreement with previous time-dependent wave packet results. More importantly, we found that the vibrational excitation of LiH molecule inhibits the LiH depletion reaction, whereas it promotes the H-exchange reaction. In addition, the differential cross sections calculated for the depletion reaction at different collision energies and excitation states indicate a strong forward scattering of the product molecule H-2.

J	Shang, YH; Tian, JF; Hou, M; Xu, XY				Shang Yuan-Hong; Tian Jin-Feng; Hou Min; Xu Xiao-Yu			Progress on the protective effect of compounds from natural medicines on cerebral ischemia	CHINESE JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES			English	Review						Natural medicine; Individual compounds; Cerebral ischemia; Pathophysiological mechanisms; Research progress	ASSOCIATION/AMERICAN-STROKE-ASSOCIATION; TRANSIENT FOCAL ISCHEMIA; NITRIC-OXIDE; GENE-EXPRESSION; BRAIN-INJURY; CELL-DEATH; RATS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; REPERFUSION; APOPTOSIS	The treatment of cerebral ischemic disease by natural medicines has a long history, and has accumulated a rich theoretical knowledge and treatment experience. The objective of this review is to critically evaluate the experimental research situation of the protective effect of the individual compounds from natural medicine on cerebral ischemia in the past ten years, emphasizing the major mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemic pathophysiology. Sixteen representative compounds from natural medicines which are often used to treat stroke are discussed. The results indicate that these components possess a protective effect on cerebral ischemia, and that these components have different mechanisms, including inhibiting excitotoxicity by ginkgolide B, antiapoptosis of breviscapine, influencing astrocytic activation and proliferation of tanshinone IIA, influencing free radicals by ginsenoside Rd, impairing blood-brain barrier disruption by baicalin, and the anti-inflammatory activity of tetramethylpyrazine. Moreover, some components have multiple neuroprotective mechanisms. Therefore, the combination of individual compounds from natural medicines, considering the mechanisms of cerebral ischemia, may be beneficial to patients with cerebral ischemia in the future. This approach will provide a direction for the further application and exploitation of new drug development in the treatment of cerebral ischemia.

The TiO2-nanoparticle photoanode was prepared by screen-printing technique, and the SnO2 nanocrystalline films were coated on TiO2 nanoparticles by soaking TiO2 photoanodes in SnO2 solution with different concentrations or different time. SEM images indicate SnO2 nanocrystalline films have smaller surface grains than the TiO2 nanocrystalline films. The electrical properties of the films indicate that SnO2 thin films growing on the TiO2 films by soaking TiO2 films in 0.4 mol/L SnO2 solution for 50 min play a positive role on the structure and performance of the TiO2 films, and the conversion efficiency of the solar cell with TiO2/SnO2 photoanode is about 7% higher than that of TiO2 films.

Let L-n := lcm(u(0), u(1), ... , u(n)) and let a, l >= 2 be any integers. In this paper, the authors show that, for integers alpha >= a, r >= max(a, l - 1) and n >= l alpha r, the following inequality holds L-n >= u(0)r((l-1)alpha+alpha-l)(r + 1)(n). Particularly, letting l = 3 yields an improvement on the best previous lower bound on L-n obtained by Hong and Kominers in 2010.

It is found that the lattice constant and elastic constants are in very good agreement with the other calculations or experimental values. The phonon dispersion curve along several high symmetry lines at the Brillouin zone (BZ) is determined using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and the phonon frequencies at the Gamma point of the Brillouin zone are in reasonable agreement with previous calculations and experimental values. We also calculate the thermodynamic functions based on phonon density of states. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hou, H. J.; Yang, S.

These advantages of NSCT can, when used in fusion algorithm, help to attain more visual information in fused image and improve the fusion quality. At the same time, in order to improve the robustness of fusion algorithm and to improve the quality of the fused image, two selection rules should be considered. Firstly, a new bilateral sharpness criterion is proposed to select the lowpass coefficient, which exploits both strength and phase coherence. Secondly, a modified SML (sum modified Laplacian) is introduced into the local contrast measurements, which is suitable for human vision system and can extract more useful detailed information from source images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the conventional fusion algorithm in terms of both visual quality and objective evaluation criteria.

Solvent Extraction Separation of Titanium(IV) and Iron(III) from Acid Chloride Solutions by Trioctylphosphine Oxide	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						TOPO; Solvent extraction; Separation; Titanium; Iron	LIQUID-LIQUID-EXTRACTION; TITANIFEROUS MAGNETITES; LEACH LIQUORS; RECOVERY; TRIBUTYLPHOSPHATE; KEROSENE; MEDIA; IRON	The solvent extraction of calcium(II), magnesium(II), aluminum(III), titanium(IV) and iron(III) from acidic chloride solutions by trioctyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) in kerosene has been investigated. The solvent extraction results demonstrate that the dissolved titanium and iron is present as TiCl4 center dot 2TOPO and HFeCl4 center dot TOPO. Extraction of titanium(IV) and iron(III) increase with increased hydrochloric acid concentration in the aqueous phase. On the other hand, aluminum(III), calcium(II) and magnesium(II) are not extracted under these experimental conditions. IR spectral studies of the extracted complexes were further used to clarify the nature of the extracted complexes. Titanium(IV and iron(III) can be selectively recovered from the loaded organic phase by controlling the acidity of the stripping agent. The loading capacity of the TOPO system has been evaluated and the potential for the separation and recovery of titanium(IV) and iron(III) from acid chloride liquors has been assessed through extraction and stripping isotherms.

The three samples are exposed to the hydrogen plasma of 30 keV, hydrogen plasma irradiation fluences from 2 x 10(17) H+/cm(2), 2 x 10(18) H+/cm(2), 2 x 10(19) H+/cm(2) for three hours about different samples. The effect of the hydrogen plasma irradiation is analyzed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy. The hydrogen bubbles are not seen on the surface of the tungsten samples. Local melts region and high damage region are seen in SEM photographs when fluence increases for 2 x 10(19) H+/cm(2) (correlated with flux for 1.85 x 10(15) H+/cm(2)s). Some holes and pits can be only seen at melt region and high damage region from the surface morphology. Irradiation damage increases with fluence, and also affected by flux. Meanwhile, the experimental irradiations are simulated with the SRIM-2012 software, the temperature change trend to obtain through simulation is consistent with the damage levels of difference fluences, the higher the temperature rises, the greater the damage is.

The h x h matrix (S-a) = ((x(i), x(j))(a)), having the ath power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the greatest common divisor of x(i) and x(j) as its (i, j)-entry, is called the ath power GCD matrix on S. The ath power LCM matrix on S can be defined similarly. In this paper, we first obtain the formulae for determinants of power GCD and power LCM matrices on the set S consisting of finitely many coprime divisor chains (i.e., there is a positive integer k such that we can partition S as S = S-1 boolean OR ... boolean OR S-k, where S-i and S-j are divisor chains and each element of S-i is coprime to each element of S-j for any 1 <= i not equal j <= k). Consequently, we show that if S consists of finitely many coprime divisor chains, then under some natural conditions, we have det(S-a)vertical bar det(S-b), det[S-a]vertical bar det[S-b] and det(S-a)vertical bar det[S-b].

J	Li, SW; Zhang, QH; Niu, RH				Li Shi-wen; Zhang Qiu-hui; Niu Rui-hua			Thermodynamics Process of Laser Drilling on Copper Surface	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						Laser drilling; Laser plasma; Thermodynamics process; Shock wave		The laser drilling experiment was carried out on the copper surface by ns laser pulse, then the micro-morphology of the micro-hole was observed and the thermodynamic process was analyzed accordingly. The research results show that micro-hole is made of the pit in the center and surrounding uplift. The pit becomes deeper with the incident laser pulse energy. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that laser drilling on the metal requires two basic conditions: the first is the deposition of laser pulse energy, which makes the occurrence of melting, vaporization and ionization. Such phase transition can make the materials easy to remove and the laser plasma can accelerate the laser pulse energy deposition as the secondary heat source. The second condition is the production of the laser plasma shock wave, it can eject the materials of phase transition effectively and timely, thus the micro hole can be formed.

In order to not only attain the image focusing properties and more visual information in the fused image, but also sensitive to the human visual perception, a local multidirection variance (LEOV) fusion rule is proposed for lowpass subband coefficient. In order to introduce more visual saliency, a modified local contrast is defined. In addition, according to the feature of distribution of highpass subband coefficients, a direction vector is proposed to constrain the modified local contrast and construct the new fusion rule for highpass subband coefficients selection The NSCT is a flexible multiscale, multidirection, and shift-invariant tool for image decomposition, which can be implemented via the atrous algorithm. The proposed fusion algorithm based on NSCT not only can prevent artifacts and erroneous from introducing into the fused image, but also can eliminate 'block effect' and 'frequency aliasing' phenomenon. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved better fusion results than wavelet-based and CT-based fusion method in contrast and clarity.

Herein, anatase TiO2 white pigment was prepared by self-generating seeded thermal hydrolysis route from unenriched TiOSO4 solution. The effects of the pre-adding water volume ratio, the F value and the aging time were investigated on the structure and pigment properties of the as-prepared samples. The samples were characterized by XRD, particle size distribution. SEM and pigment properties tests. And these factors influenced the number and quality of hydrolysis nuclei, hydrolysis velocity, crystal growth rate and particles aggregation, eventually determined the structure and pigment properties of TiO2. The optimized pre-adding water volume ratio was of 0.17:1, the F value was of 1.93 and the aging time after gray point was of 21-31 min, and the prepared TiO2 pigment was with anatase phase, narrow particle size distribution and excellent pigment properties.

The set S is called a divisor chain if there is a permutation sigma on {1, ..., h} such that x(sigma(1)) vertical bar ...vertical bar x(sigma(h)). We say that the set S consists of finitely many coprime divisor chains if there is a positive integer k such that we can partition S as S = S-1 boolean OR ... boolean OR S-k, where all the S-i are divisor chains and each element of Si is coprime to each element of S-j for 1 <= I not equal j <= k. The matrix having the ath power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the greatest common divisor of x(i) and x(j) as its (i, j)-entry is called ath power greatest common divisor (GCD) matrix defined on S. denoted by (S-a). Similarly we can define the ath power LCM matrix [S-a]. In this paper, we show that if a vertical bar b and S consists of finitely many coprime divisor chains with 1 is an element of S, then in the ring M-h(Z) of h x h matrices over integers, we have (S-a) vertical bar (S-b), [S-a] vertical bar [S-b] and (S-a) vertical bar [S-b].

The aim of this study was to explore the role of mTOR/RPS6KB1 signaling pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and its downstream ribosomal phosphorylated RPS6KB1 (p-RPS6KB1) in NSCLC patients. We also analyzed p-mTOR/p-RPS6KB1 protein expression in 45 fresh NSCLC tissues using Western blotting. Results: The expression level of p-mTOR and p-RPS6KB1 was significantly higher in NSCLC tumor specimens than that in adjacent noncancerous normal lung tissues (P<0.01). p-mTOR expression correlated with p-RPS6KB1. Furthermore, high expression level of p-mTOR or p-RPS6KB1 in NSCLC was associated with a shorter overall survival (both P<0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated high level of p-mTOR expression was an independent prognostic factor (HR=2.642, 95% CI 1.157-4.904, p=0.002). Conclusions: p-mTOR and p-RPS6KB1 could be useful prognostic markers for NSCLC.

This study aimed to investigate the association of c.910A>G genetic polymorphism in XRCC1 gene and lung cancer susceptibility. A total of 330 lung cancer cases and 333 cancer-free controls were enrolled. The genotypes of c.910A>G genetic polymorphisms were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Our data suggested that there were statistically significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies between lung cancer patients and cancer-free controls. The GG genotype was statistically associated with the increased risk of lung cancer compared with the AA wild genotype [OR (odds ratio)=2.88, 95% CI: 1.62-5.13, p<0.001]. The allele G may contribute to lung cancer susceptibility (G vs A: OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.20-1.94, p<0.001). These preliminary results indicate that the c.910A>G genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 gene is statistically associated with lung cancer susceptibility in Chinese population.

On basis of the static error source, the dynamic error was analyzed by means of matrix differential equation. The elastic deformation of the rods has great influence on the tip pose error. According to the elastic deformation and the clearance between the joints, an effective error compensation method was presented. The results show that this compensation method has remarkable effect. This study provides references for the design and error compensation of mechanisms with similar structure.

Eight new lanthanide compounds, namely Ln(2)(obb) (3)(e-urea)(H2O) [Ln = Er (1), Yb (2), Ho (3); obb = 4,4'-oxybisbenzoic acid, e-urea = ethyleneurea], Ln(2)(obb)(3)(e-urea)(H2O)(3) [Ln = Tb (4), Dy (5), Eu (6)], La-2(obb)(3)(H2O)(1.5)(e-urea) (7) and [Sm-2(obb)(3)(H2O)(5)]center dot(H2O) (8), have been synthesized under urothermal reactions and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 are isostructural and possess three-dimensional structures with (3,3,4,5,5)-connected new topology, while compounds 4, 5 and 6 are almost identical in structure with the space group P2(1)/n and display an unusual (4,4,5)-connected topology. Compound 7 is a unique two-dimensional structure with the centrosymmetric space group Pbca and possesses a (4,4,7,7)-connected new topology. Different from the above-mentioned seven frameworks (1-7), compound 8 features a three-dimensional framework with unprecedented (3,4,4,5,6)-connected new topology. In these compounds, the structural variations were rationalized by the effect of lanthanide contraction, the effect of e-urea as the structure-directing agent and the different coordination modes of the flexible obb ligand. The luminescent properties of compounds 4 and 6 have been studied in the solid state at room temperature, and both of them display metal-based luminescence.

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopic data show that few-layer GO dispersions can be distinguished from multi- and thick-layer dispersions by a more intense peak at 230 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of few-layer GO contain a single peak, those of multi-layer GO exhibit a shoulder and those of thick-layer GO do not contain a peak or shoulder. These findings allow qualitative analysis of GO dispersions. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) show that the change of UV-vis absorption intensity of GO is caused by a conjugative effect related to chromophore aggregation that influences the pi-pi* plasmon peak.

The effects of calcining temperature on the structure of the titania were investigated. The photocatalytic activity of the FST was evaluated using the photodegradation of methylene blue and photooxidation of phenol in aqueous solutions under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively. The results evinced that Ti4+ is substituted by Fe3+ in titania lattice and forms impurity level within the band gap of titania, which consequently induces the visible light absorption and visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity. The synergistic effects of Fe-doping and sulfation are beneficial to the efficient separation of the photogenerated carriers and also improve the quantum efficiency of photocatalysis. In addition, Bronsted acidity arisen from the strong inductive effect of sulfate is also conducive to enhancing the photocatalytic performance of FST. However, when the calcining temperature is higher than 800 degrees C, sulfur species and surface hydroxyl groups decompose and desorb from FST and the specific surface area decreases sharply. Moreover, severe sintering and rutile phase formation occur simultaneously. All these are detrimental to photocatalytic activity of FST.

The numerical simulation results show that the ASE contrast can be improved by the rapid scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer by about two orders, and the transmission efficiency of the chirped pulse can exceed 80% with the synchronizing time jitter ranging from -5 to 5 ps.

J	Wang, SL; Hong, L; Chen, XG				Wang, Shuliang; Hong, Liu; Chen, Xueguang			Vulnerability analysis of interdependent infrastructure systems: A methodological framework	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Interdependent infrastructure systems; Network model; Vulnerability analysis	INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CASCADING FAILURES; INOPERABILITY; NETWORKS; BETWEENNESS; PERFORMANCE; HURRICANES; CENTRALITY	Infrastructure systems such as power and water supplies make up the cornerstone of modern society which is essential for the functioning of a society and its economy. They become more and more interconnected and interdependent with the development of scientific technology and social economy. Risk and vulnerability analysis of interdependent infrastructures for security considerations has become an important subject, and some achievements have been made in this area. Since different infrastructure systems have different structural and functional properties, there is no universal all-encompassing 'silver bullet solution' to the problem of analyzing the vulnerability associated with interdependent infrastructure systems. So a framework of analysis is required. This paper takes the power and water systems of a major city in China as an example and develops a framework for the analysis of the vulnerability of interdependent infrastructure systems. Four interface design strategies based on distance, betweenness, degree, and clustering coefficient are constructed. Then two types of vulnerability (long-term vulnerability and focused vulnerability) are illustrated and analyzed. Finally, a method for ranking critical components in interdependent infrastructures is given for protection purposes. It is concluded that the framework proposed here is useful for vulnerability analysis of interdependent systems and it will be helpful for the system owners to make better decisions on infrastructure design and protection.

The photocatalytic activity of the FST photocatalyst was evaluated using the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) and the photooxidation of phenol in aqueous solutions in the presence of UV irradiation, respectively. The effect of various parameters, such as calcining temperature, calcination time, initial concentration of substrate, amount of catalyst and pH value on the photocatalytic activity of FST photocatalyst was investigated. Among the parameters studied, calcining temperature, initial concentration of substrate, and amount of catalyst have a very similar effect on the activity of FST photocatalyst for both the photodegradation of MB and the photooxidation of phenol, while the others have distinct differences. The optimal calcination conditions were 500 degrees C, 1.5 h and 650 degrees C, 2.5 h; the optimal catalyst concentration were 1.0 and 1.2 g L-1; the optimal pH values were 8 and 4 for the photodegradation of MB and the photooxidation of phenol, respectively. In addition, the mechanism for the high photocatalytic efficiency of FST photocatalyst has also been put forward.

Based on the wavelength scanning from 580 to 760 nm, the wavelength of maximum absorbance of methylene blue was determined to be 666 nm and the corresponding calibration curve can be described by the equation of A = 0.0068 + 0.1514C. The adsorption of methylene blue onto FST samples was conformed to the Langmuir isotherms. The absorption capacity of each FST sample for methylene blue increases with increasing temperature. The increase in the adsorption parameters (q (m), b, and K (0)) and the positive Delta H (theta) reveal the endothermic feature of this adsorption process. The negative Delta G (theta) shows the adsorption of methylene blue onto FST samples can be carried out spontaneously at the examined temperatures. Furthermore, with the calcination temperature increases, the variation in crystallization degree, the surface and the sulfur species will obviously influence the adsorption properties of FST samples and the thermodynamic parameters of this adsorption process.

The set S is called a divisor chain if there is a permutation sigma of {1, ... , h} such that x(sigma)(1) vertical bar ... vertical bar x(sigma)(h). We say that the set S consists of three coprime divisor chains if we can partition S as S = S-1 boolean OR S-2 boolean OR S-3, where S-1, S-2 and S-3 are divisor chains and each element of S-i is coprime to each element of S-j for all 1 <= i not equal j <= 3. The matrix having the ath power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the greatest common divisor of x(i) and x(j) as its i, j-entry is called ath power greatest common divisor (GCD) matrix defined on S, denoted by (S-a). Similarly we can define the ath power LCM matrix [S-a]. In this article, we first obtain the formulae for determinants of power GCD matrices and power LCM matrices defined on three coprime divisor chains. Consequently, we establish several divisibility theorems among the determinants of these power matrices: if S consists of three coprime divisor chains and a vertical bar b, then under some natural conditions, we have det(S-a)vertical bar det(S-b), det[S-a] vertical bar det[S-b] and det(S-a)vertical bar det[S-b]. We also give an example which shows that such divisibility results are not true if those natural conditions are not satisfied.

Thirteen strains, tolerating 800 mg.L-1 Pb, 200 mg.L-1 Cu, and 200 mg.L-1 Cd simultaneously were selected for heavy-metal-solubilizing experiments in soil. The mobilization of heavy metals depended on the characteristics of bacteria and heavy metals. Correlation analysis demonstrated that for Pb solubilization, the acid-producing ability was the most significant factor, while for Cu and Cd, siderophores played a leading role in this process. Four strains, based on their excellent ability to solubilize heavy metal in soil, were applied in pot experiments. The results showed that all strains can promote the growth of C. comatus and meanwhile help mushroom accumulate more heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Cu). The maximum uptake for total Pb and Cu by C. comatus was observed in inoculations with Bacillus sp. strain JSG1 (2.02- and 2.13-fold, respectively, compared with uninoculated soil), while for Cd, it was recorded in Bacillus sp. strain PB2 treated soil (2.03-fold). Therefore, this work suggests that the mushroom-bacteria interaction can be developed into a novel bioremediation strategy.

In this account, we developed a mathematic model of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) associated signaling network, which involves EGFR-driving proliferation/pro-survival signaling pathways Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and pro-apoptotic signaling pathway apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/p38. In the setting of sustained EGFR activation, the simulation results show a persistent high level of proliferation/pro-survival effectors phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT, and a basal level of pro-apoptotic effector phospho-p38. The potential of p38 activation (apoptotic potential) due to the elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is largely suppressed by the negative crosstalk between PI3K/AKT and ASK1/p38 pathways. Upon acute EGFR inactivation, the survival signals decay rapidly, followed by a fast increase of the apoptotic signal due to the release of apoptotic potential. Overall, our systems biology modeling together with experimental validations reveals that inhibition of survival signals and concomitant release of apoptotic potential jointly contribute to the tumor cell death following the inhibition of addicted oncogene in EGFR addicted cancers.

For x, y is an element of S and y < x, we say the y is a greatest-type divisor of x in S if y vertical bar x and it can be deduced that z = y from y vertical bar z, z vertical bar x, z < x and z is an element of S. For x is an element of S, let G(S) (x) denote the set of all greatest-type divisors of x in S. For any arithmetic function f, let (f (x(i), x(j))) denote the n x n matrix having f evaluated at the greatest common divisor (x(i), x(j)) of x(i), and x(j) as its i,j-entry and let (f[x(i), x(j)]) denote the n x n matrix having f evaluated at the least common multiple [x(i), x(j)] of x(i) and x(j) as its i,j-entry. In this paper, we assume that S is a gcd-closed set and max(x is an element of S) {vertical bar G(S) (x)vertical bar} = 1. We show that if f is a multiplicative function such that (f * mu)(d) is an element of Z whenever d vertical bar 1cm(S) and f (a) vertical bar f (b) whenever a vertical bar b and a, b is an element of S and (f[x(i), x(j))) is nonsingular, then the matrix (f (x(i), x(j))) divides the matrix (f (x(i), x(j))) in the ring M(n)(Z) of n x n matrices over the integers. As a consequence, we show that (f (x(i), x(j))) divides (f[x(i), x(j))) in the ring M(n) (Z) if (f * mu)(d) is an element of Z whenever d vertical bar 1cm(S) and! is a completely multiplicative function such that (f (x(i), x(j))) is nonsingular.

Adsorption kinetics and mechanism of methylene blue onto FST samples were studied at different temperatures (298, 303 and 308 K). The kinetic experimental data appropriately correlate with the pseudo-second order model. The overall rate of the adsorption process appears to be influenced by both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. The low adsorption activation energy (in the range of 15.59-19.31 kJ mol(-1)) suggests that the adsorption of methylene blue onto FST samples was conformed to the physisorption mechanism. With calcination temperature increases from 400 to 600 degrees C, sulfur species gradually decomposes and desorbs from the surface of FST samples, which can enhance the affinity between methylene blue and FST samples. Moreover, the specific surface decreases and the pore volume and pore diameter increase with rise in calcining temperature. All these have a significant influence on the adsorption properties of FST samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ti film is highly orientational but lattice plane with the orientation is not exclusive with defferent variable process parameters and the orientation of several planes is observed too. It is also determined by XRD that the more serious lattice distortion of the base happens because of Ti atom infiltration.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and N(2) adsorption-desorption techniques. The effects of the m(Fe)/m (TiO(2)) on the structures of the titania photocatalysts were investigated. The photocatalytic activity of the mesoporous Fe-doped sulfated titania catalysts was evaluated using the photooxidation of methylene blue in aqueous solutions under UV light irradiation. The results indicated that Fe(3+) substitutes Ti(4+) in titania lattice, which induced the formation of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies are favorable to the dissociation adsorption H(2)O and formation of surface hydroxyl group. Fe(3+) captures the photoinduced electrons or holes that are conductive to the efficient separation of the photogenerated carriers, but too many doping Fe(3+) will promote recombination of the photogenerated carrier. Sulfur species in the form of sulfate are incorporated into the network of Ti-O-Ti and coordinated to titania in bidentate model, resulting in the strong inductive effect, large specific surface area, and mesoporous structure. All these are beneficial to improve the photocatalytic activities of the mesoporous Fe-doped sulfated titania photocatalysts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that with increasing temperature the reduction processes may be divided into four stages: reduction via CO and H(2) from volatiles at 400-650 degrees C, reduction via H(2) and C generated by cracking of hydrocarbon at 650-850 degrees C, direct reduction of carbon via gaseous intermediates at 850-1050 degrees C and direct reduction of carbon above 1050 degrees C.

When uncertain discrete-time recurrent neural network is a periodic system, it is expressed as switched neural network for the finite switching state. Based on the switched quadratic Lyapunov functional approach (SQLF) and free-weighting matrix approach (FWM), some linear matrix inequality criteria are found to guarantee the delay-dependent asymptotical stability of these systems. Two examples illustrate the exactness of the proposed criteria.

The set S is called a divisor chain if there is a permutation sigma of {1,...,h} such that x(sigma(1))vertical bar...vertical bar x(sigma(h)). We say that the set S consists of two coprime divisor chains if we can partition S as S = S(1) boolean OR S(2), where S(1) and S(2) are divisor chains and each element of S(1) is coprime to each element of S(2). The matrix having the ath power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x(i) and x(j) as its (i, j)-entry is called the ath power GCD matrix defined on S, denoted by (S(a)). Similarly, we can define the ath power least common multiple (LCM) matrix [S(a)]. In the first paper of the series, Tan [Q. Tan, Divisibility among power GCD matrices and among power LCM matrices on two coprime divisor chains, Linear Multilinear Algebra 58 (2010), pp. 659-671] showed that if S consists of two coprime divisor chains and 1 is an element of S and a vertical bar b, then (S(a)) j(S(b)), [S(a)]vertical bar[S(b)] and (S(a))vertical bar[S(b)] hold in the ring M(h)(Z) of h x h matrices over integers. But such factorizations need not hold if a x b. In this second paper of the series, we assume that S consists of two coprime divisor chains and 1 is not an element of 2 S. We show the following results: (i) If a x b, then (S(a)) x (S(b)), [S(a)] x [S(b)] and (S(a)) x [S(b)]. (ii) If a vertical bar b, then det(S(a)) vertical bar det(S(b)), det[S(a)] vertical bar det[S(b)] and det(S(a)) vertical bar det[S(b)]. (iii) If a vertical bar b, then (S(a)) vertical bar (S(b)), [S(a)] vertical bar [S(b)] and (S(a)) vertical bar [S(b)] hold in the ring M(h)(Z) if and only if both x(a)y(b)-1/x(a)y(a)-1 and x(b)y(a)-1/x(a)y(a)-1 are integers, where S = S(1) boolean OR S(2) with S(1) and S(2) divisor chains and x = min(S(1)) and y = min(S(2)). Our results extend Hong's results and complement Tan's results.

Metal or non-metal doping, surface sensitization, semiconductor coupling, precious metal deposition and increasing crystal defects have been used to enhance the photocatalytic activity of titania under visible light. Based on the research results of different modification methods in recent years, some mechanisms from the excitation, bulk diffusion and surface transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, such as band gap modification, changing the excitation path, promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carrier, improving the surface adsorption and reaction, and synergistic effects, for photocatalysis under visible light are discussed and the development trend in this field is predicted.

The matrix having the ath power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the greatest common divisor of x(i) and x(j) as its i, j-entry is called ath power greatest common divisor (GCD) matrix defined on S, denoted by (S(a)). Similarly we can define the ath power LCM matrix [S(a)]. We say that the set S consists of finitely many quasi-coprime divisor chains if we can partition S as S = S(1) boolean OR ... boolean OR S(k), where k >= 1 is an integer and all S(i) (1 <= i <= k) are divisor chains such that (max(S(i)), max(S(j))) = gcd(S) for 1 <= i not equal j <= k. In this paper, we first obtain formulae of determinants of power GCD matrices (S(a)) and power LCM matrices [S(a)] on the set S consisting of finitely many quasi-coprime divisor chains with gcd(S) is an element of S. Using these results, we then show that det(S(a))vertical bar det(S(b)), det[S(a)]vertical bar det[S(b)] and det(S(a))vertical bar det[S(b)] if a vertical bar b and S consists of finitely many quasi-coprime divisor chains with gcd(S) is an element of S. But such factorizations fail to be true if such divisor chains are not quasi-coprime. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Batch experiments were conducted on sewage sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Shanghai, China, to evaluate the effectiveness of the ATAD system by determining changes in volatile suspended solids (VSSs) and to study its microbial diversity by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified by PCR. The digestion system achieved rapid degradation of the organic substrate at 55 degrees C. The VSS was removed by up to 45.3% and 50.4% at 216 h and 264 h, respectively, while NH(4)(+)-N, chemical oxidation demand and total organic carbon of supernatant as well as total nitrogen did not exhibit obvious declines after 168 h. The microbial diversity changed during the thermophilic process as thermophiles belonging to the Hydrogenophilaceae, Thermotogaceae, Clostridiaceae and the genus Ureibacillus replaced less temperature-tolerant microorganisms such as Sphingobacteriaceae and the genus Trichococcus.

The effects of the volume ratio of pre-adding water to TiOSO4 on the structure of the titania photocatalysts were investigated. The photocatalytic activities of Fe-doped sulfated titania samples were evaluated using the photooxidation of methylene blue in aqueous solutions under UV light irradiation. The results indicate that Fe-doping induces the red shift of the absorption edge to the visible light range. Meanwhile, sulfur species in the form of sulfate are incorporated into the network of Ti-O-Ti and coordinated to titania in bidentate models, which can effectively promote the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Synergistic effects of both are beneficial for improving the photocatalytic activity of the Fe-doped sulfated titania photocatalysts.

We find that the signal-to-noise ratio is a non-monotonic function of the delayed times and of the amplitude of the driving square-wave signal, as well as of the asymmetry and correlation rate of the dichotomous noise. In addition, the SNR varies non-monotonically with the system parameters and the intensities of the multiplicative and additive noise.

J	Xiang, GQ; Huang, DG				Xiang Guoqi; Huang Dagui			A Metamodeling Method Based on Support Vector Regression for Robust Optimization	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						support vector regression; metamodeling; robust optimization; genetic algorithm	DESIGN	Metamodeling techniques have been used in robust optimization to reduce the high computational cost of the uncertainty analysis and improve the performance of robust optimization problems with computationally expensive simulation models. Existing metamodels main focus on polynomial regression(PR), neural networks(NN) and Kriging models, these metamodels are not well suited for large-scale robust optimization problems with small size training sets and high nonlinearity. To address the problem, a reduced approximation model technique based on support vector regression(SVR) is introduced in order to improve the accuracy of metamodels. A robust optimization method based on SVR is presented for problems that involve high dimension and nonlinear. First appropriate design parameter samples are selected by experimental design theories, then the response samples are obtained from the simulations such as finite element analysis, the SVR metamodel is constructed and treated as the mean and the variance of the objective performance functions. Combining other constraints, the robust optimization model is formed which can be solved by genetic algorithm (GA). The applicability of the method developed is demonstrated using a case of two-bar structure system study. The performances of SVR were compared with those of PR, Kriging and back-propagation neural networks(BPNN), the comparison results show that the prediction accuracy of the SVR metamodel was higher than those of other metamodels under uncertainty. The robust optimization solutions are near to the real result, and the proposed method is found to be accurate and efficient for robust optimization. This reaserch provides an efficient method for robust optimization problems with complex structure.

The set S is called a divisor chain if there is a permutation sigma of {1, ... , h} such that x(sigma(1)) vertical bar...vertical bar x(sigma(h)). We say that the set S consists of two coprime divisor chains if we can partition S as S = S(1) boolean OR S(2), where S(1) and S(2) are divisor chains and each element of S(1) is coprime to each element of S(2). The matrix having the a-th power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the GCD (GCD: greatest common divisor) of x(i) and x(j) as its i, j-entry is called a-th power GCD matrix defined on S, denoted by (S(a)). Similarly we can define the a-th power least common multiple (LCM) matrix [S(a)]. In this article, we show the following results: assume that S consists of two coprime divisor chains and 1 is an element of S. We first show that if a vertical bar b, then the power GCD matrix (S(a)) divides the power GCD matrix (S(b)) in the ring M(h)(Z) of h x h matrices over integers. But such factorization should not hold if a (sic) b. Consequently, we show that if a vertical bar b, the power LCM matrix [S(a)] divides the power LCM matrix [S(b)] in the ring M(h)(Z). Finally we show that if a vertical bar b, the power GCD matrix (S(a)) divides the power LCM matrix [S(b)] in the ring M(h)(Z). But such results fail to be true if a(sic)b. These results confirm partially Hong's conjectures.

The influence of Co and Cu doping on the surface morphologies of ZnO films was investigated. X-ray diffraction shows that all the ZnO thin film samples are well oriented and the grain size of Cu-doped ZnO film is the largest. Strong blue double emission and weak green emission Were observed in the photoluminescence spectra of all samples at room temperature and both long wavelength blue peak and green peak could be modulated by doping. The blue double peaks are caused by transition of electrons from the bottom of the conduction band to zinc vacancy or from the zinc interstitial to the top of the valence band. However, the green peak is highly relevant to the oxygen slip formed by doping.

Mordant Red 3 and bovine serum albumin was investigated using fluorescence and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence quenching, from which binding parameters were evaluated, revealed that the quenching of the serum by C.I. Mordant Red 3 resulted from the formation of a dye-serum complex. The enthalpy and entropy changes for the reaction were -50.49 kJ mol(-1) and -50.88 J mol(-1) K(-1) respectively. van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds were the dominant intermolecular forces that stabilize the complex: the distance between donor and acceptor was 2.79 nm, according to Forster's non-radiative energy transfer theory. The effect of the dye upon the conformation of bovine serum albumin was analyzed using synchronous fluorescence spectrum. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the adiabatic elimination and the two-state theories, the explicit expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the spectral power amplification (SPA) have been obtained. It is shown that two peaks can occur on the curve of SNR versus the intensity of the DN. Moreover, the SNR is a non-monotonic function of the correlation time of the DN. The SPA varies non-monotonously with the strength of the DN. The dependence of the SNR on the frequency and the amplitude of the external periodic signal are discussed. The effect of the external frequency and the correlation time of the DN on the SPA are analyzed.

Experiments using the glass beads (the average diameter (d) over bar (p) = 1.83 mm) were conducted in a two-dimensional vibrated fluidized bed (240 trim x 80 mm). The local heat transfer law between vibrated fluidized bed and horizontal tube surface has been investigated. The results show that the values of theoretical prediction are in good agreement with experimental data, so the model is able to predict the local heat transfer coefficients between vibrated fluidized beds and immersed horizontal tubes reasonably well, and the error is in range of +/- 15%. The results can provide references for future designing and researching on the vibrated fluidized beds with immersed horizontal tubes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An evaluation approach to furnace scheme design was brought forward based on artificial neural network. Ten independent parameters which determined a scheme design were proposed. The improved three-layer BP network algorithm was used to build the evaluation model in which the 10 independent parameters were taken as input evaluation indexes and the degree to which the scheme design satisfies the requirements of the blast furnace as output:,It was trained by the existing samples of the scheme design and the experts' experience, and then tested by the other samples so as to develop the evaluation model. As, an example, it is found that,a good scheme design of blast furnace can be chosen by using the evaluation model proposed.

By the use of the linear-response theory and the properties of the dichotomous noise, the exact expressions have been found for the first two moments and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown that the SNR is a non-monotonic function of the correlation time of the additive dichotomous noise, and it varies non-monotonically with the bias of the external field, with the intensity and asymmetry of the multiplicative dichotomous noise, as well as with the external field frequency. Moreover, the SNR depends on the intensity of the cross noise between the multiplicative and additive dichotomous noise, as well as on the strength and asymmetry of the additive dichotomous noise.

According to the thermodynamics parameters, the main sort of binding force of the interaction is electrostatic force, and binding BBTS to BSA is a spontaneous supermolecular interaction in which entropy increases and Gibbs free energy decrease. The formation constants of them were analyzed according to Stern-Volmer equation and double-reciprocal equation, and are smaller at high temperature than at low temperature. It is confirmed that the combination reaction of BBTS with BSA is a static quenching process. The change in the micro-circumstance of amino of bovine serum albumin was analyzed by synchronous fluorescence spectrometry.

Mesoporous TiO2 with high thermal stability was obtained via controlling the hydrolysis and condensation rate of industrial TiOSO4 solution by adjusting the pH value and post hydrothermal treating. The as-prepared materials were characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, SEM and HRTEM. The powder calcined at 723 K for 2 h showed higher thermal stability, with BET specific surface area of 218.7 m(2)/g and an average pore diameter of 3.63 nm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V..

The expressions have been obtained for the quasi-steady-state probability distribution function. It is found that the input energy (IE) pumped into the system by the external driving shows an SR-like behavior as a function of the noise strength, whereas the IE turns to be a monotonic function of the correlation time of the noise. The effect of potential asymmetry is also studied on SR and IE.

Enhancement of critical current density of YBa2Cu3O7-delta thin films by nanoscale CeO2 pretreatment of substrate surfaces	PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						YBa2Cu3O7-delta; flux pinning; CeO2 nanoparticles; metal-organic deposition	COLUMNAR DEFECTS; COATED CONDUCTORS; FIELD-DEPENDENCE; PINNING CENTERS; NANODOTS	YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) films were prepared on single-crystal SrTiO3 substrates with metal-organic deposition using trifluoroacetates (TFA-MOD). Positive results have been acquired in controlled study to investigate the effects of substrate surface modification on the growth-induced flux-pinning nanostructures in YBCO films. Nanoscale CeO2 particles were applied to single-crystal SrTiO3 substrate surfaces using pulsed laser deposition before YBCO precursors coating. Superconducting properties of the YBCO films grown on the controlled CeO2-modified substrates have shown substantial improvement in the critical current densities (J(c)) at 77 K over those grown on untreated substrates in almost all the field (78% increment at 1 T, 77 K). We think the reason is that the CeO2 nanoparticles act as pinning centers. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the expansion ratio of EG decreases from 750mL/g when the particle size is larger than 420 mu m to 110mL/g when the particle size is 95-85 mu m. Observing and determining the pore structures in EG by using SEM and mercury porosimetry, it is found that the size of macrostructures and sub-microstructures decreases along with the decrease in particle sizes. The size effect mainly results from the difference in the crystallization degree of graphite, and it is reflected in the ash content, sulfur content, adsorptivity of EG, tensile strength of compressed EG sheet.

The rate of hydrolysis and condensation of TiOSO4 solution was controlled by adjusting the pH value of the reacting system. Mesoporous titania with anatase phase was obtained after templates removal by calcinations. The as-prepared powder was characterized by XRD, N-2 isothermal adsorption and desorption method, particle size distribution, SEM, TEM, SAD and XPS. External field with enhancing polar action and soft hydrothermal condition is adaptive to prepare better mesoporous titania. Ultrasonic vibration promotes the formation of mesoporous structure. Under microwave irradiation, mesoporous TiO2 was synthesized with BET surface area 146.6 m(2)/g, average pore diameter 2.57 nm and crystal size 13.65 nm. Ultrasonic, microwave irradiations and hydrothermal condition are better than conventional method in forming mesopore and stabilizing the structure.
