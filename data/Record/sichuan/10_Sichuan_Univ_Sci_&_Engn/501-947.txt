In particular, hydrogenolysis of glycerol to other value-added chemicals over heterogeneous catalysts has been extensively studied in the past few years. The most desired products arising from this process are propanediols, i.e. 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol. Both diols are important industrial chemicals, being especially well-known as monomers for the production of many useful polymers. Although hydrogenolysis of glycerol is a promising new route for the production of propanediols, the design of applicable catalysts for its industrialisation is still a great challenge. In order to guide the rational development of efficient catalysts, several possible reaction mechanisms have been proposed based on experimental and theoretical investigations. A brief review is now presented on the reaction mechanisms for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to propanediols over heterogeneous catalysts. The possible reaction mechanisms are summarised and classified. The main characteristics and general reaction conditions for each reaction mechanism are highlighted. Furthermore, the developing prospects and future direction of research are suggested.

The interaction between La(III) and the azacrown ether, and the resulting complex and BNPP, were analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The catalytic rate of BNPP hydrolysis was measured kinetically by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The results indicated that the metallomicelle system exhibited relatively high stability and excellent catalytic function in BNPP hydrolysis, the rate of which, compared with the spontaneous hydrolysis, increased by a factor of ca 2 x 10(7) due to the catalytic effect of the active species and the local concentration effect of the micelle in the metallomicellar system. The results also showed that the complex, comprising La(III) ion, and the azacrown ether, is the active catalytic species, while the micelles provide a useful catalytic environment for reaction. On the basis of these results, a reaction mechanism for the catalytic hydrolysis of BNPP is proposed.

The compositions of the photoinduced copolymer were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), ultraviolet spectra (UV), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effects of 6 important factors, that is, photo-initiators concentration, monomers concentration, CO(NH2)(2) (urea) concentrations, pH value, mass ratio of AM to DAC, and irradiation time on the molecular weight and dissolving time, were investigated. The optimal reaction conditions were that the photo-initiators concentration was 0.3%, monomers concentration was 30 wt.%, irradiation time was 60 min, urea concentration was 0.4%, pH value was 5.0, and mass ratio of AM to DAC was 6:4. Its flocculation properties were evaluated with activated sludge using jar test. The zeta potential of supernatant at different cationic monomer contents was simultaneously measured. The results demonstrated the superiority of the copolymer over the commercial polyacrylamide as a flocculant.

It is only assumed that the upper normal bound of uncertain inner and outer coupling matrices is positive but its concrete structure is not also required to be known. The time-varying coupling delay is a any nonnegative continuous and bounded function and not require its derivative to be less than one, that is, general time-varying coupling delays and uncertainties. For such a class of uncertain complex networks, a new synchronization scheme is presented by a class of continuous memoryless robust decentralized adaptive synchronization controllers. It is also shown that the synchronization error dynamics of uncertain complex networks can be guaranteed as uniformly exponentially convergent toward a ball that can be as small as desired. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed complex networks synchronization schemes. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the present paper, a new strategy was established to study the metabolism of crude extract from Ganoderma lucidum using the highly separative and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Based on the investigation of the metabolism of five representative single compounds (ganoderic acid), a total of 90 metabolites were identified from the bile sample after oral administration of the crude extract. Among them, 21 compounds were identified by comparison with the reference standards, the other unknown metabolites were tentatively characterized by interpretation of the high resolution low collision energy and high collision energy mass spectra using the fragmentation rules. The metabolic characteristics and "soft spots" of the ganoderic acids were revealed. After being absorbed, the ganoderic acids from the extract could undergo extensive phases land II metabolism in rat before excreted into the bile. The main ganoderic acids could transform from one to another through reduction, oxidation, deacetylation and desaturation reactions. Other metabolic transformation included hydroxylation, sulfation and glucuronidation. The total tendency was that the low polar ganoderic acids were transformed into the high polar metabolites to eliminate from the organism. The metabolic "soft spots" of the ganoderic acids were 3,7,15,23-carbonyl groups (or hydroxyl groups), angular methyl groups, 20(22)-double bond, 12-acetoxyl group and 26-carboxylic acid moiety. These results are considered to be important for the further investigation of G. lucidum. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the simulation, with the increasing of the time, the number of the Fe-O bond decreases, while the numbers of Al-O bonds and Fe Fe bonds increase. At the same time, the total charge quantity of Fe ions decreases and the total charge quantity of Al ions increases as time increases. In the Al/Fe2O3 thermite reaction, the redox reaction is observed, Al atoms are oxidized and the Fe ions are reduced. And then the rupture of Fe-O bonds and the formation of Al-O bonds happen at the interface. Whole redox reaction is completed in about 3 ps.

The obtained EMC was characterized by SEM, XRD, potentiometric titration, and FTIR. The results showed that nano-Fe3O4 with granular morphology were steadily integrated with chitosan and EDTAD was successfully modified on the surface of chitosan. The adsorption properties of EMC for methylene blue (MB) were then evaluated. Factors affecting the uptake behavior such as pH, contact time, initial concentration of MB, and temperature were investigated. The optimal adsorption conditions were determined as pH 6.0, MB concentration 300mg L-1, contact time 30min, and temperature 35 degrees C. The adsorption capacity in the optimal condition was 113.257mgg(-1). The adsorption process followed the Sips isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Desorption and regeneration experiments were conducted and the adsorption/desorption cycles of MB were repeated three times. The EMC regeneration efficiency and the MB recovery efficiency were 82.82% and 80.72%, respectively, in the third cycle by using HCl as the eluent solution.

Interpersonal self-support and attentional bias on negative and positive interpersonal information	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Interpersonal self-support; Attentional Bias; Relational schema; Spatial cueing task; Emotional Stroop task	ACCESSIBLE CONSTRUCTS; REJECTION SENSITIVITY; EMOTIONAL STROOP; PERSONALITY; STIMULI; ANXIETY; THREAT; AUTOMATICITY; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS	Interpersonal self-support is an indigenous Chinese personality concept. It represents the idealized notion of the kind of personality traits that help individuals deal with interpersonal problems and develop and maintain the harmonic and appropriate social relationships required in China's collectivistic and interdependent culture. It also was assumed to be a protective personality factor with regard to mental health and was found to be negatively related to psychosomatic symptoms. In the current study, cognitive processing of interpersonal information is assumed to be an underlying mechanism that connects interpersonal self-support with interpersonal relationships and mental health. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments to investigate whether attentional bias on positive and negative interpersonal information was related to high and low interpersonal self-support. A spatial cueing task and the emotional Stroop task were administered to two samples of high and low interpersonal self-support Chinese undergraduate students to measure attentional bias. The results from both experiments suggested that high interpersonal self-support students had an attentional bias toward positive interpersonal information, while low interpersonal self-support students preferentially attended to negative interpersonal information. Study 1 indicated that attentional bias toward positive interpersonal information was easily engaged in the high interpersonal self-support group, while attentional bias toward negative interpersonal information was both easy to engage and difficult to disengage in the low interpersonal self-support students. These results support our hypotheses that high interpersonal self-support people engage in positive processing of interpersonal information, whereas low interpersonal self-support people engage in negative processing of interpersonal information. The differential balance between positive and negative processing on interpersonal information may explain why interpersonal self-support predicts both mental health and interpersonal relationships. In addition, the relational schema may explain why interpersonal self-support is associated with an attentional bias toward interpersonal information.

The composite photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to Bi2O3 for the degradation of aqueous methyl orange (MO) solution under solar irradiation. The samples were characterized in terms of BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and surface photovoltage (SPV). On the basis of the results, a mechanism is proposed to account for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of these In2O3/Bi2O3 composites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the hydrophobic CH3 and CF2 group was introduced into ZnO particles via modification, the ZnO nanoparticles were modified from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. When the weight ratio of modified-ZnO to polystyrene was 7:3, the ZnO/polystyrene composite coating contact angle was 158, coating surface with hierarchical micro/nano structures. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic cotton texiles have a very extensive application prospect in water-oil separation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phase evolution of the reaction products was investigated systemically. The results show that the amorphous oxides-C mixtures contribute to reduction of synthesis temperature. The phase evolution of tungsten oxides follows mainly WO3 -> WO2.9 -> WO2.72 -> WO2 -> W -> WC. During the whole process of powder synthesis, Co element reacts easily with W and C elements to form eta phases (such as Co3W3C, Co6W6C and Co3W9C4). Synthesis time can promote the formation of WC phase powders, but the elimination of eta phases strongly depends on synthesis temperature. At 1100 degrees C for 2 h, the pure-phased WC-Co-Cr3C2-VC nanocomposite powders with granular particle of similar to 100-200 nm were obtained. The significant grain growth occurs especially at 1300-1400 degrees C. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the ISDEMS algorithm, the population is dynamically divided into multiple populations according to the fitness value of the individuals. Multiple strategies are used to improve the diversity of the individuals, to avoid premature convergence and to ensure efficiency in exchanging information among sub-populations. In addition, a self-adaptive adjustment method is introduced to automatically adjust the scaling and crossover factors during the running time. It is helpful to improve the robustness of the ISDEMS algorithm. To prove the validity of the ISDEMS algorithm for solving complex problems, thirteen benchmark problems and one real-life problem are selected to validate the performance of the ISDEMS algorithm. The experiment results show that the ISDEMS algorithm is better in terms of search precision and convergence performance than the DE, ACDE and SACDE algorithms from the literature.

The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis, BET and photogradation of RhB for comprehensive structural, morphological, specific surface area and visible-light properties. This results show the interlayer structure of g-C3N4 was partially peeled and formed Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The 60 wt% Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 photocatalysts possess enhanced photocatalytic activity than the single phase Bi2WO6 and g-C3N4 under visible light, which can be ascribe to its wide visible light reponse, large surface area and high quantum efficiency. In addition, the Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 composite is not only highly stable but also easy to be collected.

In this paper, we concentrate typical properties of random quantum evolution. We obtain that universal random evolutions change the generic unknown pure states into their orthogonal states approximately. Moreover, typical random evolutions distort the von Neumann entropy with constants. These results are extended to mixed states with a stronger orthogonal preparation ability. These typical characters are very important for quantum information retrieving or various quantum tasks.

The self-inductance can be determined based on a conformal transformation for the field region, which demonstrates that the inductance only depends on the side length ratio of the two walls instead of the length of the walls. The magnetic force on each side of the walls is then calculated by employing the principle of virtual work. It is proved that the magnetic force has the same magnitude and opposite direction to the electric force. And then the electromagnetic force on the wall is zero. The general meaning of this conclusion for all kinds of coaxial transmission line is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both binuclear complexes exhibited good hydrolytic reactivity, giving rise to ca. 15547- and 17462-fold acceleration over background value for PNPP hydrolysis at neutral conditions, respectively. For comparing, activities of the other two mononuclear analogues were evaluated, revealing that binuclear complexes show approximately 150- and 171-fold kinetic advantage over their mononuclear analogues.

The reductive perturbation method is employed to reduce the basic set of fluid equations to the modified Korteweg-de Vried (KdV) equation. How the amplitudes and the widths of the dust-acoustic waves vary with the plasma parameters is studied by using numerical simulations. Results show that not only the fast ion but also the number densities and the temperatures of the dust, the cold ions, the hot ions and the electrons all can play significant roles in determining the features of the amplitude and the width.

But for time delay problems, complete analysis of the algorithm is rare. In this paper, by using the reaction diffusion equations with a constant discrete delay as the underlying model problem, we investigate the convergence behavior of the overlapping SWR algorithm with Robin transmission condition. The key point of using this transmission condition is to determine a free parameter as better as possible and it is shown that the best choice of the parameter is determined by the solution of a min-max problem, which is more complex than the one arising for regular problems without delay. We propose new notion to solve the min-max problem and obtain a quasi-optimized choice of the parameter, which is shown efficient to accelerate the convergence of the SWR algorithm. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical conclusions.

Reaction of (PhCO)(2)(dmit) and (PhCO)(2)(dmio) with MeONa afforded the intermediates 2-thioxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dithiolate dianion and 2-oxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dithiolate dianion, respectively. Reaction of the two dianions with (diphosphine) NiCl2 [diphosphine = (Z)-1,2-bis(diphenylphosphanyl) ethane (dppv), 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)benzene (dppb)] gave (dppv) Ni(dmit) (1), (dppb) Ni(dmit) (2), (dppv) Ni(dmio) (3), and (dppb) Ni(dmio) (4). This synthesis route was found to be an efficient pathway to prepare dmit and dmio ligand complexes. Complexes, 1-4 were fully characterized by elemental analysis and IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and P-31 NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the molecular structures of 1, 3 and 4 were established by X-ray diffraction.

In this work, using the atomic structure code of Cowan, a collisional radiative model (CRM) based on the spin-orbit-split-arrays is developed. Based on this model, the charge state distribution of tungsten ions is determined and the soft X-ray spectra from high charged ions of tungsten at different temperatures are calculated. The results show that both the average ionization charge and line positions are well agreed with others calculations and measurements with discrepancies of less than 0.63% and 1.26%, respectively. The spectra at higher temperatures are also reported and the relationship between ion abundance and temperature is predicted in this work.

We have calculated the ground states properties and they are in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. We have obtained the electronic structure and density of states, and the results showed that both of Immm and Cmcm phases are metal material. The elastic properties such as elastic constants, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are obtained for the first time. Furthermore, the optical properties are reported for radiation up to 30 eV. Finally, the thermodynamic properties of Cmcm phase such as free energy, entropy, enthalpy, heat capacity and Debye temperature are given for reference. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The nanocomposite powders were characterized by means of XRD and SEM. The results show that the amorphous oxides-C mixtures contribute to reduction of synthesis temperature. During the whole process of powder synthesis, Co element reacts easily with W and C elements to form eta phases (such as Co3W3C, Co6W6C). At 1100 degrees C for 2 h, the pure-phased WC-Co-Cr3C2-VC nanocomposite powders with granular particle of similar to 100-200 nm were obtained. The WC/Co sintered alloy using WC-Co-Cr3C2-VC nanocomposite powders as starting materials exhibits ultrafine grain sizes, in comparison with the reference alloy using traditional milled powders.

The prepared photocatalyst (SDBS-Bi2O3) was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that SDBS-Bi2O3 exhibits better visible light photocatalytic activity than Bi2O3. The prepared SDBS-Bi2O3 photocatalyst possesses higher BET surface area, pore volume and smaller pore size than Bi2O3. According to the UV-Vis diffused reflectance spectra, SDBS-Bi2O3 appears red-shift as compared to Bi2O3. In addition, the Bi4f(7/2) of SDBS-Bi2O3 shifts to a lower value. SDBS is key in the formation of the flower-like nanostructure of SDBS-Bi2O3, and improves the photoinduced charge separation rate. The results of further experiments show that morphology, specific surface area, the energy band structure, the Bi4f(7/2) shift and photoinduced charge separation rate, all play an important role in the promotion of visible light induced photocatalytic activity of the SDBS-Bi2O3 nanostructure. The removal of methyl orange solution under sun light reaches 79.3% at 12 hours, which is a 32.0% increase compared to the removal obtained using pure Bi2O3. Moreover, the COD removal rate is increased by 12.8%.

The cyclic stress response at all strain rates exhibited behavior of rapid softening in the early stage of fatigue life and subsequent saturation up to failure. It was found that the stress amplitude, the plastic strain amplitude, the plastic strain energy density and the fatigue life depend mainly on the strain rate. The strain rate of 0. 012 s(-1) was found as a transition point where the LCF of the steel showed different behavior from low strain rate to high strain rate. The relationship between the time to failure and strain rate was expressed well by a power law relation. The fracture surfaces of the fatigue samples were characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the fracture mechanisms were discussed in terms of time-dependent deformation of the steel.

Interface stability and microstructure of ultrathin Mo/MoN diffusion barrier in Cu interconnects	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Diffusion barrier; Thermal stability; Microstucture	METALLIZATION; PERFORMANCE; COATINGS; FILMS; TA	An ultrathin Mo (7 nm)/MoN (3 nm) bilayer film covered by Cu film was deposited on the Si substrate using reactive magnetron sputtering in N-2/Ar ambient. The film stacks of Cu/Mo (7 nm)/MoN (3 nm)/Si were then annealed in a vacuum chamber at 500-800 degrees C for 1 h. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scans were employed to investigate the microstructure evolution and the diffusion behaviour of the film stacks. The results show that the Mo (7 nm)/MoN (3 nm) bilayer film as a diffusion barrier has sufficient interface stability, which can prevent Cu atom diffusion at elevated temperatures up to 700 degrees C. The relationship between the interface stability and the microstructure of the bilayer barrier is characterised in detail.	[Liu, C. H.; Jin, Y. Z.; Cui, X. J.; Yang, R. S.; Fu, Q.

A sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the concentrations of GD and its main metabolite (ganoderic acid B) in rat plasma. Following protein precipitation, the analytes were separated on a reversed-phase C18 column. Acetonitrile-water-acetic acid (40:60:0.01) was used at a flow-rate of 0.2 ml/min. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electro-spray ionization source was used as the detector and was operated in the negative ion mode. Multiple reaction monitoring using the characteristic transitions was performed to quantify the analytes. The method had a lower limit of quantification of 8.19 ng/ml for GD, and 8.59 ng/ml for ganoderic acid B (GB). The calibration curves were demonstrated to be linear over the concentration range of 8.19-4096 ng/ml and 8.59-2149 ng/ml, respectively. Variations within- and between-batch were less than 6.4% and 4.6%, respectively. The extraction recovery rates ranged from 98.8 to 105.2% and 100.7 to 113.6%, respectively. The validated method was successfully applied to the quantification of GD and GB concentrations in rat plasma after oral administration (or intravenous administration) of GD preparations at a dose of 15 mg/kg. The data showed that the absolute bioavailability increased from 22% to 70% after the GD suspension was changed to GD loaded solid lipid nanoparticles. In the meantime, the C-max increased from 107.2 to 1555.6 ng/ml; the t(max) changed from 2.0 h to 0.3 h. These results are very helpful in the further studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium lattice parameter we obtained for ZrN in B1 phase is closer to the experiment results than previous theoretical results. In addition, the calculations of the elastic constants show that ZrN is a brittle material. What is more, based on third-order natural strain equation of state, the phase transition pressure 338 GPa for ZrN is predicted for B1-B2 transition. According to the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the thermodynamic parameters of ZrN have been investigated systematically.

In this paper, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve the general coupled matrix equations and their optimal approximation problem over generalized reflexive matrix solution (X-1, X-2,..., X-q). When the general coupled matrix equations are consistent over generalized reflexive matrices, the generalized reflexive solution can be determined automatically by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors. The least Frobenius norm generalized reflexive solution of the general coupled matrix equations can be derived when an appropriate initial matrix group is chosen. Furthermore, the unique optimal approximation generalized reflexive solution ((X) over tilde (1),(X) over tilde (2),...,(X) over tilde (q)) to a givenmatrix group (X-1(0), X-2(0),..., X-q(0)) in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution ((X) over tilde (*)(1),(X) over tilde (*)(2),..., (X) over tilde (*)(q)) of the corresponding general coupled matrix equations Sigma(q)(j= 1) Aij (X) over tilde B-j(ij) = (M) over tilde (i), i = 1,2,..., p, where (x) over tilde (j) = X-j -X-j(0), (M) over tilde (i) = M-i -Sigma(q)(j=1) A(ij)X(j)(0) B-ij. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm.

A maintenance policy (N-1,N) based on the number of failures of the service machine is introduced into the system. Assuming that a failed service machine after repair will not be as good as new', and the spare service machine for replacement is only available by an order. More specifically, we suppose that the procurement lead time for delivering the spare service machine follows a phase-type (PH) distribution. Under such assumptions, we apply the matrix-analytic method to develop the steady state probabilities of the system, and then we obtain some system performance measures. Finally, employing an important Lemma, the explicit expression of the long-run average cost rate for the service machine is derived, and the direct search method is also implemented to determine the optimal value of N for minimising the average cost rate.

The potential energy analysis, the pair distribution function and the common neighbor analysis have been used. The results show that the solidification point increases with decreasing cooling rate and that the solidification of the microstructure of Cu nanoparticles varies with the cooling rate. The microstructure consists of fcc, hcp and bcc crystals or mixtures, though the fcc structure dominates, except in the amorphous state. An amorphous structure was obtained when the cooling rate reached 1.0 x 10(13) K/s or higher while crystallization degree increased with decreasing cooling rate, and the total content of crystal structures reached to 95% when the cooling rate dropped to 4.0 x 10(11) K/s, which was nearly a perfect crystal structure. The results also indicate that a single-crystal nanoparticle will not be obtained by quenching the liquid metal under various cooling rates.

The key steps included the construction of C-5 stereocenter adjacent to gem-difluoromethylene group by way of lipase AK catalyzed kinetic resolution, the introduction of aryl group via Stille coupling, and lactonization by 1,5-oxidative cyclization. These ,-difluorinated Goniothalamin analogues 4a-4i and their enantiomers 6a-6i, together with several corresponding -monofluorinated Goniothalamin analogues were biologically evaluated against four different cancer cell lines. Compound 7h showed a nearly equivalent potency as the parent (R)-Goniothalamin in the micromolar range. The different fluorine effects between fluoromethylene and gem-difluoromethylene on antitumor activity were discussed through the analysis of bioassay data.

The specific surface area, structure, morphology and the photoinduced charge separation rate of the photocatalyst prepared (CTAB-TiO2) were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), respectively. The results show that CTAB alters the surface parameters and the morphology, enhances the photoinduced charge separation rate of TiO2. The photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange solution was investigated. The results demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of CTAB-TiO2 is more than three times of that of the reference TiO2 and the underlying reason was discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The plain message becomes a cipher sequence after being encoded to a DNA sequence and encrypted by the addition operation. The cipher sequence is attached to a random DNA primer sequence and circularly shifted for finite times, then hide the whole sequence into a Word document through substituting each character's color. The plaintext can be extracted according to the keys, and the key space is large enough to resist brute force attacks. Experimental results show the feasibility of the scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure of complex 1 is a ladder-like chain, which is connected by stronger hydrogen bond interactions to result in a 2D network. While complex 2 is composed of molecular dimmer based on a paddle-wheel unit with two coppers, four syn-syn carboxylates, and two water molecules coordinated to copper in the axial positions which could also be linked into a 2D supramolecular architecture via hydrogen bond interactions. Magnetic studies reveal the overall antiferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring Cu(II) ions in compounds 1 and 2.

Under a mild spontaneous reaction condition, DA as a reducing agent and monomer, and HAuCl4 as an oxidant to trigger DA polymerization and the source of gold nanoparticles, were mixed to yield composites of DA polymer and gold nanoparticles, which were then anchored on GCE by electropolymerization of the remaining DA monomer. The resultant electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic redox activities toward EP, DA, AA and UA. Furthermore, although the oxidation peaks of EP and DA at the modified electrode appeared at a same potential of 230 mV, three well-defined oxidation peaks for AA, EP, DA and UA (50, 230, 380 mV) and two non-interference reduction peaks for EP (-150 mV) and DA (190 mV) were presented. By virtue of this interesting phenomenon, for the first time the simultaneous detection of EP, DA, AA and UA using the proposed sensor has been achieved by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). The calibration curves for EP, DA, AA and UA were acquired in the range of 1.0-80.0 mu M, 1.0-80.0 mu M, 40.0-1000.0 mu M, and 0.8-100.0 mu M with the detection limits (S/N = 3) of 0.1 mu M, 0.08 mu M, 5.0 mu M and 0.06 mu M, respectively. The proposed method is simple, sensitive and convenient, and was successfully applied to the determination of EP, DA, AA and UA in human blood serum and urine samples.

It will significantly affect the performance of the device. According to the Maxwell equations and one-dimensional motion equation of electron, the self-consistent equation of the beam-wave interaction is obtained in the intermediate cavity. Based on these equations, the influences of the modulation depth and the modulation frequency on the amplitude and phase of gap voltage are studied respectively. The voltage amplitude obtained by the self-consistent equation is close to the voltage amplitude of particle in cell simulation, especially under the higher modulation depth compared with that obtained from the equivalent circuit model of conventional klystron. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of device becomes wide with the increase of the modulation depth. Finally, an S-band high-gain RKA is designed, and the corresponding experiments are done on the LTD accelerator. The output power with 1.1 GW is obtained, the gain is 49 dB.

In this paper, we give the solvability conditions of and the general expressions to the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem for the (R, S)-symmetric and (R, S)-skew symmetric solutions. The corresponding best approximation problems for the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem are also solved. That is, given an arbitrary complex n-by-n matrix (A) over tilde, find a(R, S)-symmetric (or(R, S)-skew symmetric) matrix A((A) over tilde) which is the solution to the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem such that the distance between (A) over tilde and A((A) over tilde) is minimized in the Frobenius norm. We give an explicit solution to the best approximation problem in the (R, S)-symmetric and (R, S)-skew symmetric solution sets of the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem under the assumption that R - R* and S - S*.

This situation may be changed from the following constructions. Our purpose in this paper is to find some special differences between these two quantum tasks besides the classical resource costs. Some novel schemes show that the first one is useful to simultaneously broadcast arbitrary quantum states, while the second one cannot because of the quantum no-cloning theorem. Moreover, these broadcast schemes may be adapted to satisfying the different receivers' requirements or distributing the classical information, which are important in various quantum applications such as the quantum secret distribution or the quantum network communication.

This system is described using a five-state continuous time Markov chain. We assume that the system is monitored by an (X) over bar control chart to avoid costly failures. When the control chart gives an out-of-control signal, a full inspection will be conducted to confirm the actual system condition. Moreover, we assume that the system unit can be preventively replaced at a sampling epoch and must be replaced upon failure; the cost of preventive replacement is less than that of failure replacement. In addition, a random shift size is considered for two types of design. Based on these assumptions and by using renewal theory, optimization models have been developed to find the optimal control chart parameters for minimizing the average maintenance costs. A numerical example is presented to compare the two control chart designs. We also consider the effect of each statistical constraint on the decision variables and on the expected cost.

Calcein as a fluorescence indicator and Sudan I-IV as model analytes were employed to investigate the analytical feature of this assay platform. Results show that the fluorescence of calcein can be efficiently quenched by Cu(II). When the ligand exchange reaction proceeds, calcein is deprived of Cu(II) by Sudan I and III, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of calcein. However, the ligand exchange reaction does not happen in the presence of Sudan II or IV due to the 2-methyl steric effects, which is favorable for selective determination of Sudan I and III against the influence of Sudan II and IV. It was found that the fluorescence enhancement efficiency (FEE) against the concentration of Sudan (c(Sudan) nmol L-1) shows a linear relationship. The calibration equations are FEESudan (I) = 0.0032 c(Sudan) (I) - 0.02613, and FEESudan III = 0.0033 C-Sudan III - 0.02467 over the corresponding linear range of 11.25-2078.29 and 9.44-1035.78 nmol L-1 with the correlation coefficients (R-2) of 0.9984 and 0.9955, respectively. And the detection limits (3 sigma/slope) are calculated to be 211.3 and 208.5 pmol L-1 for Sudan I and III, respectively, showing ultralow detection limit. The Sudan dye in a commercial chilli powder sample was assayed with satisfactory results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influence of affect factors about treating conditions on the acid removal of diesel oil was investigated, such as ultrasonic frequency, volume ratio of sodium carbonate solution to oil (VRSO), ultrasonic work function, and ultrasonic strengthening time. Orthogonal tests were done to confirm the optimum process condition. The results showed that the optimum condition was that ultrasonic frequency was 28 KHz, VRSO was 0.30, ultrasonic work function was 350 W, and ultrasonic strengthening time was 6 min. Under this optimum condition, acidity of diesel oil was reduced to 4.88 mgKOH/100 mL from 135.52 mgKOH/100 mL, and deacidification rate of naphthenic acid reached 96.4%.	[Hu, Z.; Yu, H.

The most suitable conditions for total nitrogen removal was attained at a normal temperature, pH of 8, flocculant of 1.0 g/L when the shaking speed was 200 r/min and the reaction time was 30 min. Through testing saccharide and protein in the bioflocculant, it was found that the bioflocculant contained saccharides and proteins. After detecting the content of saccharide and protein before and after reacted, it was found that the content of saccharides and proteins in the bioflocculant decreased after treating total nitrogen which meant the saccharides and the proteins in the bioflocculant played flocculation effect in the removal of total nitrogen from tannery wastewater, and the saccharides played main effect. It is expected that the results will contribute to the industry treatment of total nitrogen removal in tannery effluent by bioflocculant.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of PNPP hydrolysis have been examined. All four complexes exhibit higher catalytic activity in the buffered CTAB micellar solution and the rate increases with pH of the buffered CTAB micellar solution under 25 degrees C. The complexes containing a crown ether group exhibit higher catalytic activities than the free-crown analogues. The catalytic activity of manganese(III) complex is superiority over cobalt(II) complex in catalyzing hydrolysis of PNPP under the same ligand.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/vis diffuse reflectance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques and surface photovoltage spectroscopy, respectively. The results show that dysprosium-doped Bi2O3 with 3/100 Dy prepared has the highest BET surface area, pore volume, the smallest pore size. XRD spectra of dysprosium-doped Bi2O3 catalysts calcined at 773 K are composed of monoclinic and tetragonal phase. Doping Dy into Bi2O3 increases the BET surface area and decreases the crystal size and the band gap of doped Bi2O3 photocatalysts, induces binding energy value of Bi 4f(7/2)-shift and promotes the photoinduced charge separation rate. Of all of the photocatalysts prepared among the experimented compositions, dysprosium-doped Bi2O3 with 3/100 Dy possesses the best photocatalytic activity and the underlying reason was discussed.

The stable geometries with different spin multiplicities are determined. The results show that doping gold clusters with two Rb atoms dramatically affects the ground-state geometries of the pure gold clusters, the doped Rb atoms prefer locating on the surface and mirror symmetry positions, and the Au-capped Rb2Aun-1 clusters are the dominant growth pattern. The ground-state structures of Rb2Aun (n >= 3) clusters tend to be considered as three dimensional configurations with a two dimensional (or only slightly tilted) gold subunits motif. The energetic and electronic properties of the Rb2Aun and Aun+2 (n = 1-10) clusters are strongly dependent on sizes and structures. The average atomic binding energies show that the doped Rb atoms enhance the stabilities of host clusters for the larger clusters (n > 5). Dramatic odd-even alternative behaviors are found in the fragmentation energies, the second-finite difference of energies, the HOMO-LUMO gaps, VIPs, and chemical hardness for both Rb2Aun and Aun+2 (n = 1-10) clusters. In addition, it is found that Rb2Au6 isomer is the most stable of the Rb2Aun (n = 1-10) clusters. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The decolorization reaction of MO solution is photocatalysis. The paper reveals that the optimal loading of photocatalyst for decolorization of MO solution (10 mg/L) is 0.6 g/L. The results show that the photocatalytic decolorization reaction of MO with HPA in a homogenous solution can be described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation; the results manifest that the reaction is first order with lower concentration, the limiting rate constant and the adsorption constant in this case are 0.3378 mg/(Lmin) and 0.5988 L/mg, respectively. The effect of pH value on the decolorization efficiency was also demonstrated, where special attention was paid on the nature of photocatalyst itself. Several observations indicate that only hydroxyl radicals participate the photocatalytic decolorization of MO with HPA under UV irradiation.

In this paper, we propose a non-data-aided timing acquisition scheme to mitigate sample-timing error due to the asynchronous transmission of random allocated user ends (UEs) on the uplink. A closed-loop timing control scheme is constructed for the asynchronous IDMA system in this paper. We use the extrinsic information generated during the iterative detection algorithm with signal noise ratio evolution to estimate the timing offset for the asynchronous uplink in the base station (BS) receiver. The BS receiver returns the timing control bits, which is generated with estimated timing offsets, to the corresponding UE. And the UE uses the timing control bits to adjust local transmission time to guarantee the sampling performance at the BS receiver. The simulation results show that the proposed acquisition scheme based on feedback loop can provide high acquisition probability and low false alarm probability. The proposed scheme can overcome the bit-error-rate performance bottleneck, which is caused by the sample-timing error in BS receiver due to the asynchronous signals in the uplink.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have also been examined. The rate increases with pH of the buffer solution; all four complexes exhibited high activity in the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis. Compared with the crown-free analogs MnL (2) (3) Cl and CoL (2) (3) , the crowned Schiff base complexes (MnL (2) (1) Cl, MnL (2) (2) Cl) exhibited higher catalytic activity. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the PNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by the complex MnL (2) (1) Cl, containing a benzo-10-aza-crown ether pendant, is 1.84 x 10(3)-fold higher than that of spontaneous hydrolysis of PNPP at pH 7.60, 25 A degrees C, [S] = 2.0 x 10(-4) mol dm(-3).

By using the total probability decomposition technique, we study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursion expressions of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursion expressions of the steady state queue length distribution at arbitrary time epoch n(+). The results obtained in this paper indicate that the queue length distribution in equilibrium no longer follows the stochastic decomposition discipline. The important relations between the steady state queue length distributions at different time epochs (n(-), n, n(+)) are discovered. Finally, by numerical examples, we discuss the sensitivity of the steady state queue length distribution towards system parameters, and illustrate the application of the expressions for the steady state queue length distribution in the system capacity design.

The repairman may mean here the human beings who are used to repair the failed device. When the device functions smoothly, the repairman leaves the system for a vacation, the duration of which is an exponentially distributed random variable. In vacation period, the repairman can perform other secondary jobs to make some extra profits for the system. The lifetimes and the repair times of the device are governed by phase-type distributions (PH distributions), and the condition of device following repair is not "as good as new". After a prefixed number of repairs, the device is replaced by a new and identical one. The spare device for replacement is available only by an order and the procurement lead time for delivering the spare device also follows a PH distribution. Under these assumptions, the vector-valued Markov process governing the system is constructed, and several important performance measures are studied in transient and stationary regimes. Furthermore, employing the standard results in renewal reward process, the explicit expression of the long-run average profit rate for the system is derived. Meanwhile, the optimal maintenance policy is also numerically determined. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Magnetic hysteresis measurement reveals that nanocomposite shows a superparamagnetic behavior, and possesses a larger saturation magnetization strength (M-s) of about 15.06 emu/g at room temperature, which allows its application in adsorption or separation as magnetically recyclable materials.

The photocatalysts fabricated were characterized by BET surface area. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and surface photovoltage spectroscopy, respectively. The results showed that doping ZnO with Sn increased BET surface area of ZnO. The XRD patterns of Sn-doped ZnO photocatalysts calcined at 573 K showed only the characteristic peaks of wurtzite-type. Doping ZnO with Sn changed the morphology of ZnO, the morphology changed from irregular lump and particle to irregular honeycomb. The photoinduced charge separation rate of 1% Sn doped-ZnO was higher than that of ZnO, while 2% and 3% Sn doped-ZnO had lower photovoltage than that of ZnO. The photocatalytic activity of Sn-doped ZnO photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange solution was evaluated, of all photocatalysts prepared, Sn-doped ZnO with 1% Sn exhibited the best photocatalytic activity and the underlying reason was discussed.

In the classical framework, one first discretizes the time direction and then solves a sequence of state steady problems by the domain decomposition method. In this paper, we consider the heat equations at spacetime continuous level and study a Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm for parallel computation purpose. We prove the linear convergence of the algorithm on long time intervals and show how the convergence rate depends on the size of overlap and the nonlinearity of the nonlinear boundary functions. Numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical conclusions.

The kinetics of hydrolysis of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) in a catalytic system comprising the macrocyclic ligand and neodymium(III) was investigated. The analysis of specific absorption spectra of the hydrolytic reaction system indicated that key intermediates containing BNPP and the Nd(III) complex are formed in the reaction. The mechanism proposed for the catalytic hydrolysis proposed is based on the analytical results of the specific absorption spectrum, and the corresponding kinetic constants are calculated. The results showed that the Nd(III) complex as a mimic hydrolase exhibits good catalytic activity, i.e. similar to that of the natural enzyme.

The cutting function of the cerium complex towards supercoiled DNA was studied by the gel electrophoresis method. The results show that metal complex can bind to the phosphate group of DNA double helix and promote the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of supercoiled DNA (Form I); under certain conditions, supercoiled form DNA (Form I) was transformed into the nicked form DNA (Form II) under the strong cutting effect of the macrocyclic cerium complex; the cutting is completed by a hydrolysis mechanism.

The set-valued mapping is assumed to be upper semi-continuous compact with nonempty closed convex values. Based on topological degree for set-valued mappings, instead of the technique of continuous selection, an alternative theorem is obtained which says that the generalized variational inequalities have either a solution or an exceptional family of elements. In addition, an existing result of a solution for generalized variational inequalities is obtained.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalysed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of PNPP hydrolysis have been examined. All four complexes exhibit higher catalytic activity in the buffered CTAB micellar solution and the rate increases with pH of the buffer at 25 degrees C. The complexes containing two crown ether group exhibit higher catalytic activities than their crown-free analogues, and the catalytic activity of the phenyl-bridged Schiff base complex is larger than that of the ethyl-bridged Schiff base complex for the same substituents and metal. The catalytic activity of the manganese(III) complex exceeds that of the cobalt(II) complex in catalysing hydrolysis of PNPP under the same ligand.

In the presence of the target NSE, the sandwiched immunocomplex is formed on the functionalized graphene sensing interface between the labeled mAb(2) on the platinum nanoflowers and the immobilized primary antibody (pAb(1)) on the electrode. Upon addition of hydrogen peroxide to the detection solution, the horseradish peroxidase can catalyze the reduction of the hydrogen peroxide with the aid of the immobilized thionine on the electrode in pH 5.5 acetic acid buffer. Under the optimal conditions, the cathodic current of the as-prepared immunosensor increases with the increasing NSE concentration, and exhibits a dynamic linear range from 0.01 to 120 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 5.0 pg mL(-1) NSE at S/N = 3.

We first analyze the algorithm at continuous level with transmission conditions of Dirichlet and Robin type. We show that the convergence rate of the algorithm can be significantly improved by using the Robin transmission condition, provided the involved parameter is chosen properly. Then we discretize the model problem in space and investigate the SWR algorithm at the semidiscrete level. It would be desirable if the convergence could be further improved by considering the influence of the space discretization, since the semidiscrete SWR algorithm is closer to the fully discretized algorithm. For this point, we show that for the Dirichlet transmission condition the convergence rate of the SWR algorithm analyzed at the continuous and semidiscrete levels is equal. However, for the Robin transmission condition, using the parameter derived at the semidiscrete level can both ameliorate and deteriorate the convergence rate of the SWR algorithm in practical computations, compared to the one derived at the continuous level. In particular, when a relatively large space discretization size Delta x is used, the acceleration ability of the parameter derived at the semidiscrete level outperforms the one derived at continuous level, while if the mesh parameter Delta x is small, the latter outperforms the former. The obtained results can also predict how the convergence rate of the algorithm with Robin transmission condition behaves with respect to the time discretization size Delta t and the delay argument tau. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical conclusions.

This combines ideas from genetics and evolutionary game theory. The aim of this work is to study the effects of partial selfing selection on the discrete dynamics of population evolution. It is shown that the system undergoes period doubling bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation by using center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations are presented not only to illustrate our results with the theoretical analysis, but also to exhibit the complex dynamical behaviors, such as the period-3, 6 orbits, cascade of period-doubling bifurcation in period-2, 4, 8, and the chaotic sets. These results reveal richer dynamics of the discrete model compared with the model in Tao et al., 1999. The analysis and results in this paper are interesting in mathematics and biology.

Considering an early arrival system, as soon as the server empties the system in a regular busy period, he leaves the system and takes a working vacation for a random duration at time n. The service times both in a working vacation and in a busy period and the vacation times are assumed to be geometrically distributed. By using embedded Markov chain approach and difference operator method, queue length of the whole system at random slots and the waiting time for an arriving customer are obtained. The queue length distributions of the outside observer's observation epoch are investigated. Numerical experiment is performed to validate the analytical results.

The photocatalysts prepared were studied by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) techniques and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), respectively. The results show that 2% sample prepared has the highest BET surface area, pore volume, the smallest pore size. The XRD spectra of the Rh-doped Bi2O3 catalysts calcined at 773 K is composed of monoclinic and tetragonal phases. Rh-doped Bi2O3 absorbs much more light than Bi2O3 in the visible light region. XPS results reveal the binding energy of Bi 4f(7/2) and O 1s of 2% and 3% samples shifts to a lower value. Doping Rh into the lattice of Bi2O3 influences the photoinduced charge separation rate of Bi2O3. Rh-doped Bi2O3 with 2% Rh possesses the best photocatalytic activity and the underlying reason was discussed.

Brassica napus possesses enhanced antioxidant capacity via heterologous expression of anthocyanin pathway gene transcription factors	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brassica napus; anthocyanin; Delila; Roseal1; antioxidant activity	FLAVONOID BIOSYNTHESIS; CANCER; ANTIRRHINUM; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; FAMILY; FRUIT; MICE	Anthocyanins are one of the largest and most important groups of water-soluble pigments in most species in the plant kingdom. They are flavonoid derivatives and colorful pigments of plant tissues and vegetables. Moreover, anthocyanins exhibit potential antioxidant capacity and can protect plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, two transcription factor genes of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, DELILA (Del) and ROSEAL (Ros1), were cloned from snapdragon Antirrhinum majus and heterologously expressed in Brassica napus. Down-stream structural genes in the anthocyanins biosynthesis pathway were significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, the anthocyanin content in the transgenic plant leaves was increased nearly up to tenfold and the antioxidant activity in transgenic leaves was approximately enhanced up to three-fold. Our present study provides a novel approach to enhance B. napus antioxidant activity. Moreover, the present study supplies a potential source to produce anthocyanins from the tissues of transgenic Del/Ros1 B. napus plant and yields a new insight into better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis.

The oxygen groups on coal surface were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The textures of the coal samples were investigated by N-2 adsorption at 77 K. Their surface morphologies were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The methane adsorption behaviors of these coal samples were measured at 303 K in pressure range of 0-5.3 MPa by volumetric method. The adsorption data of methane were fitted to the Langmuir model and Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) model. The fitting results showed that the D-A model fitted the isotherm data better than the Langmuir model. It was observed that there was, in general, a positive correlation between the methane saturated adsorption capacity and the micropore volume of coals while a negative correlation between methane saturated adsorption capacity and the O-total/C-total. The methane adsorption capacity was determined by the coal surface chemistry when the microporosity parameters of two samples were similar. Coal with a higher amount of oxygen surface groups, and consequently with a less hydrophobic character, had lower methane adsorption capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Our calculating results display the bulk modulus of WB are 352 +/- 2 GPa (K'(0) = 4.29) and 322 +/- 3 GPa (K'(0) = 4.21) by LDA and GGA methods, respectively. We have analyzed the probable reason of the discrepancy from the bulk modulus between theoretical and experimental results. The compression behavior of the unit cell axes is an isotropic, with the c-axis being more compressible than the a-axis. By analyzing the bond lengths information, it also demonstrated that WB has a lower compressibility at high pressure. From the partial densities of states (PDOS) of WB, we found that the Fermi lever is mostly contributed by the d states of W atom and p states of B atom and that the contributions from the s, p states of W atom and s states of B atom are small. Moreover, using the Gibbs 2 program, the thermodynamic properties of WB are obtained in a wide temperature range at high pressure for the first time in this work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

FMOS is a recently developed generalized synchronization concept, i.e., in which different state variables of the corresponding nodes can evolve into finite-time complete synchronization, finite-time anti-synchronization, and even amplitude finite-time death simultaneously for an appropriate choice of the controller gain matrix. Some novel stability criteria for the synchronization between drive and response complex networks with coupling time-varying delay are derived using the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequalities. And a simple linear state feedback synchronization controller is designed as a result. Numerical simulations for two coupled networks of modified Chua's circuits are then provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed complex networks control and synchronization schemes and then compared with the proposed results and the previous schemes for accuracy.

Following problems will be discussed: 1) The probability that the server is in a "generalized busy period" at time n; 2) The probability that the service station is in failure at time n, i.e., the transient unavailability of the service station, and the steady state unavailability of the service station; 3) The expected number of service station failures during the time interval (0, n], and the steady state failure frequency of the service station; 4) The expected number of service station breakdowns in a server's "generalized busy period". Finally, the authors demonstrate that some common discrete-time queueing models with unreliable service station are special cases of the model discussed in this paper.

The equilibrium structural parameters are calculated. The elastic constants, elastic anisotropy, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio dependencies on pressure are also calculated. The thermodynamic properties of anti-ReO3 type Cu3N are calculated by using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The dependencies of the Debye temperature and the heat capacity, as well as the thermal expansion coefficient and Gruneisen parameter on pressure and temperature are investigated systematically in the ranges of 0-5 GPa and 0-300 K.

The alpha,beta-unsaturated lactone in Fostriecin is believed to be the critical pharmacophore, which can covalently bind to the Cys269 residue of the PP2A subunit via a Michael 1,4-conjugate addition. We reasoned that the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing gem-difluoromethylene to replace the methylene group at the gamma position of the lactone ring would lead to fostriecin analogue 4 with enhanced enzymatic binding affinity. Accordingly, the synthesis of fostriecin analogue 4 was investigated. The skeleton of target molecule 4 was established convergently from fragments a, b and c via an magnesium mediated chelation-controlled addition and Stille coupling using Pd(CH3CN)Cl-2 as catalyst. The key steps of synthesizing fragment a included the coupling between alkenyl iodide 8 and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate in the presence of copper powder and the establishment of C-5 stereocenter via lipase AK catalyzed kinetic resolution. The construction of C-11 and C-9 stereocenters in fragment b were realized by the lipase AK catalyzed kinetic resolution and CBS asymmetric reduction of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone 23 (BH3 center dot PhNEt2 as reductive agent), respectively. The connection of fragments a and b proceeded through the magnesium mediated chelation-controlled addition procedures: fragment a (vinyl stannane) was firstly converted to vinyl lithium reagent 27 by the treatment of BuLi (1.05 equiv.) at -78 degrees C, then the i-PrMgCl (2.0 equiv.) solution in THF was added dropwise to produce the critical magnesium-ate complex intermediate A, finally the addition of fragment b solution in THF to the magnesium-ate complex A gave the coupled product 29. The Stille coupling of fragment c with vinyl iodide 39 prepared from 29 in the presence of Pd(CH3CN)Cl-2 gave target molecule skeleton 40 in 85% yield. Finally, the protected fostriecin analogue 42 was successfully synthesized by a longest linear steps of 18 steps in 1.28% overall yield. However, the deprotection of compound 42 failed to give the target molecular 4. This could be caused by the instability of the fluorinated lactone in which the strong electron-withdrawing gem-difluoromethylene group enhanced the polarization of the lactone function.

Both the carbides have the same crystal structure, a sodium-chloride structure. The (1 1 0) surfaces of the carbides were modeled with (2 x 1) supercells. Every supercell is composed of five atomic planes. Our results demonstrate that the preferred site for oxygen atom is the C-Hf bridge site and the Ta-Ta bridge site on the HfC (1 1 0) and TaC (1 1 0) surface, respectively. The adsorption sites are different from the one on the (1 0 0) surfaces of the carbides. For the carbides, the adsorption energies of oxygen on the (1 1 0) surfaces are larger than that on the (1 0 0) surfaces.

The morphology, composition, phase structure and its corrosion resistance were studied. The effects of film-forming temperature and free acid on corrosion resistance, microstructure and electrochemical behavior of the film were discussed. The results indicate that the corrosion resistance of AZ31 with the phosphate film was better than blank AZ31 substrate, which was most attributed to the great inhibitive action on the anodic dissolution and cathodic hydrogen evolution of the film.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), respectively. The results show that doping Ga3+ into ZnO increases the BET surface area. The XRD spectra of the photocatalysts calcined at 573 K show only the characteristic peaks of wurtzite-type. Ga3+-doped ZnO absorbs much more light than ZnO in the visible light region. Doping Ga3+ into ZnO greatly changes the morphology of ZnO and enhances the photoinduced charge separation rate. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO and Ga3+-doped ZnO for decolorization of methyl orange (MO) solution was evaluated, of all the photocatalysts prepared, the Ga3+-doped ZnO with 1% possesses the best photocatalytic activity and the possible reason was discussed.

Three PEGylated PLGG copolymers (PLGGE2000, PLGGE1100 and PLGGE500) were characterized by XRD, TG and DSC. The critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of the amphiphilic copolymers were 1.04, 0.55 and 0.13 mu g/mL, respectively. The TEM, AFM and DLS measurements revealed that the micelles were homogeneous spherical nanoparticles with the diameters ranged from 50 to 150 nm when THF was used as solvent in the preparation of the micelles. Interestingly, extended cylindrical micelles were obtained using CHCl3 as solvent. The micelles could trap doxorubicin (DOX) in the core with the highest drug loading content up to 23.7%. The mean diameter of drug loaded micelles was much bigger than that of blank micelles. The in vitro drug release of the micelles was diffusion-controlled release within the first 36 h and initial burst release was not obvious. However, after 36 h, the release rate in pH 5.0 was faster than that in pH 7.4 due to the degradation. The PLGGE micelles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells demonstrated that the drug loaded micelles exhibited high inhibition activity to cancer cells. CLSM observation of HepG2 cells showed that DOX released from the micelles could be delivered into cell cytoplasm and cell nuclei. PLGGE micelles are potential promising carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery.

Reaction of Fe-2(SeH)(2)(CO)(6) and aqueous formaldehyde affords the possible intermediate Fe-2(SeCH2OH)(2)(CO)(6). While the intermediate Fe-2(SeCH2OH)(2)(CO)6 reacts with Glycine (NH2CH2CO2H) or (BocNH-p)C6H4NH2, to produce [(mu-SeCH2)(2)NCH2CO2H]Fe-2(CO)(6) (1) and [(mu-SeCH2)(2)NC6H4(p-NHBoc)]Fe-2(CO)(6) (2) in satisfactory yield. This synthesis route is found to be an efficient pathway to produce the N-functionally substituted butterfly [2Fe2Se] cluster complexes.

As applications, some new common fixed point theorems for a mixed family of fuzzy and crisp operators in fuzzy normed spaces are also given.

X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide, hydrogen chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the structure and deactivation characteristics of the catalysts. The catalysts exhibited a narrow Ni-metal particle-size distribution between 5 and 11 nm. The presence of lanthanum evidently improved reforming activity in the temperature range of 600-700 degrees C, because the introduction of lanthanum into the NiMgAl catalysts increased the total amount of basic sites and the surface Ni content. The activity of the Ni0.5Mg2.5Al0.9La0.1O4.5 catalyst was slightly higher than those of the other lanthanum-containing catalysts. The addition of lanthanum improved the stability of the NiMgAl catalysts significantly because of the suppression of coke deposition. Lanthanum effectively inhibited coking by increasing the basicity of the catalysts, forming the La2O2CO3 phase and improving nickel metal dispersion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phase composition of the synthesized products with various ratios of chromium and vanadium was investigated systemically. The present study shows that there are not single-phase VC and Cr3C2 in VC-x wt% Cr3C2 (with 10 <= x <= 90) nanocomposite powders. When low-concentration V or Cr element exists in the reaction system, (V, Cr) C or (Cr, V)(3)C-2 solid solution phase forms easily but the solubility of Cr atoms in VC lattices is larger than that V atoms in Cr3C2. With the increase of Cr addition, there is a shifting trend of (V, Cr) C diffraction peaks toward higher angle. Two phases of (V, Cr) C solid solution and Cr2VC2 compound exist in VC-50 wt% Cr3C2 and VC-70 wt% Cr3C2 system.

The models are based on energy dissipation during average of cycles, cycles to crack propagation and total cycles to failure. Plastic strain energy per cycle was determined and found as an important characteristic for initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks for high-strength structural steels. Fatigue strain-life curves were generated using plastic energy dissipation per cycle (loop area) and compared with the Coffin-Manson relation. Low cycle fatigue life was found similar from both methods. The material showed Masing-type behavior. The cyclic hysterisis energy per cycle was calculated from cyclic stress-strain parameters. The fracture surfaces of the fatigue samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope and the fracture mechanisms were discussed.

This deposition method can avoid effectively the high resistivity of bi-layer barrier films resulted from the N integration and the introduction of heterogeneous elements for the transformation of alpha-Ta phase. X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD), Four-point probe (FPP) measurement and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization of the film microstructure. The results show that the as-deposited gradient alpha-Ta(N)/TaN bi-layer films have lower resistivity and good crystallinity, and the gradient alpha-Ta(N)/TaN bi-layer films have good structure stability even annealed at 600 degrees C for 60 min in vacuum.

Interface stability and microstructure of an ultrathin alpha-Ta/graded Ta(N)/TaN multilayer diffusion barrier	MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Diffusion barrier; Interface stability; Phase structure; XTEM	THERMAL-STABILITY; TA/TAN BILAYER; TA; METALLIZATION; FILMS; THICKNESS; NITRIDE; SYSTEM; PHASE	An ultrathin alpha-Ta (5 nm)/graded Ta(N) (1.5 nm)/TaN (2.5 nm) multilayer film coated with Cu film was deposited on the Si substrate using reactive magnetron sputtering in N-2/Ar ambient. The film stacks of Cu/alpha-Ta/graded Ta(N)/TaN/Si were then annealed in a vacuum chamber at 400-700 degrees C for 1 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM), and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) line scans were employed to investigate the microstructure evolution and the diffusion behavior of the film stacks, respectively. The results show that the alpha-Ta/graded Ta(N)/TaN multilayer film as a diffusion barrier had sufficient interface stability, which could be attributed to a relative stable amorphous layer forming at the interface of Cu and alpha-Ta layer, to prevent Cu atom diffusion at elevated temperatures up to 700 degrees C. The relationship between the interface stability and the microstructure of the multilayer barrier were also investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, C. H.; Liu, W.; Wang, Y.

J	Liu, XY; Lei, JD				Liu, Xingyong; Lei, Jiandu			Combinatorial synthesis and screening of uniform molecularly imprinted microspheres for chloramphenicol using microfluidic device	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article							POLYMER BEADS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; SILICA; PHASE; HPLC	A novel method for combinatorial synthesis and screening of uniform-size molecularly imprinted microspheres using a microfluidic device is presented, in which a new microfluidic device containing twelve pairs of shape microchannels is designed to produce droplets and imprinted microspheres via controlled suspension polymerization. This technique combines molecular imprinting and microfluidic device with the combinatorial chemical approach, allowing rapid screening and optimization of uniform imprinted microspheres. On the example of chloramphenicol (CAP), the imprinted microspheres of CAP were prepared by a combinatorial approach using water with 1.5% polyvinyl alcohol as continuous phase, and ethyl acetatechloroform (4:1, v/v) as porogenic solvents. Functional monomers methacrylic acid (MAA), 4-vinylpyridine or acrylamide were screened, and the molar ratio of template molecule to functional monomer was optimized. The results indicate that MAA is the best functional monomer for imprinting of CAP, and when the molar ratio of CAP to MAA is 1:5, the imprinted microspheres exhibit the best imprinting performance, and have good monodispersity and selectivity. This combinatorial protocol is well suited for fast and efficient screening and optimization of synthesis for uniform imprinted microspheres because 12 kinds of imprinting conditions can be performed simultaneously in this microfluidic device.

In the proposed hybrid algorithm, the whole process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we make use of the randomicity, rapidity and wholeness of the genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to obtain a series of sub-optimal solutions (rough searching) to adjust the initial allocation of pheromone in the ACO. In the second stage, we make use of these advantages of the parallel, positive feedback and high accuracy of solution to implement solving of whole problem (detailed searching). To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm, various scale benchmark problems from TSPLIB are tested to demonstrate the potential of the proposed two-stage hybrid swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. The simulation examples demonstrate that the GA-PSO-ACO algorithm can greatly improve the computing efficiency for solving the TSP and outperforms the Tabu Search, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, PS-ACO and other methods in solution quality. And the experimental results demonstrate that convergence is faster and better when the scale of TSP increases.

The discrete-time neural networks are derived by discretizing the corresponding continuous-time counterparts with implicit-explicit-0 (IMEX-0) method. The impulses are classified into three classes: input disturbances, stabilizing and "neutral" type- the impulses are neither helpful for stabilizing nor destabilizing the neural networks, and then by using a very excellent ideology introduced recently the connections between the impulses and the utilized Lyapunov function are fully explored with respect to each type of impulse. New analysis techniques that used to realize the ideology in discrete-time situation are proposed and it is shown that they are essentially different from the ones used in continuous-time case. Several criteria for global exponential stability of the static neural networks in discrete-time case are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and numerical simulations are given to validate the obtained theoretical results.

In order to acquire a comprehensive understanding of its physiological characteristics, a genome-scale metabolic model of K. vulgare WSH001, iWZ663, including 830 reactions, 649 metabolites, and 663 genes, was reconstructed by genome annotation and literature mining. This model was capable of predicting quantitatively the growth of K. vulgare under l-sorbose fermentation conditions and the results agreed well with experimental data. Furthermore, phenotypic features, such as the defect in sulfate metabolism hampering the syntheses of l-cysteine, l-methionine, coenzyme A (CoA), and glutathione, were investigated and provided an explanation for the poor growth of K. vulgare in monoculture. The model presented here provides a validated platform that can be used to understand and manipulate the phenotype of K. vulgare to further improve 2-KLG production efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The features of this synthesis included electrophilic activation of C(3) of tryptamine derivatives with "CF3S+" and cascade ring cyclization by carbamate nucleophile attacking at C(2). Surprisingly, when Lewis acid (BF3 center dot 0Et2) was used as activator instead of proton acid (TsOH center dot H2O) for the electrophilic trifluoromethanesulfanylation of tryptamine derivatives, the uncyclized product 6 was formed preferentially. This sequential trifluoromethanesulfanylation-cyclization protocol was used to synthesize several pyrrolidinoindolinic alkaloid analogues. The cytotoxicity activities of these trifluoromethanesulfanylated alkaloid analogues were evaluated against three cancer cell lines (K562, HeLa, L929).

In allusion to the shortcomings of the rough set method for rule extraction in systems with incomplete fault diagnosis, in this paper we propose a novel fusion approach based on rough set theory and particle swarm optimization for rule extraction (RSTPSORE) in order to improve the diagnostic robustness and accuracy. In the proposed method, first, an iterative linear subsection interpolation completion method is used to achieve completion of the fault diagnosis process. Then rough set theory is used to find a subset which can preserve the meaning of the attributes. Particle swarm optimization is used to discover the best rule within the flying subset space.

The effects of temperature, acrylic acid neutralization degree and salt concentration on the micellization behavior of PAA-F108-PAA block copolymer were investigated by H-1 NMR spectroscopy combined with nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy(2D NOE). The neutralization degree of carboxyl acid groups(alpha) had little influence on the critical micellization temperature(CMT) of PAA-F108-PAA. When alpha=0.14, the PAA-F108-PAA copolymer was in a collapsed state at low temperature, at high temperature the poly(propylene oxide) block (PPO) was dehydrated and associated into a hydrophobic micellar core, while PEO entangled with PAA and formed the micellar shell; when alpha=0.80, PAA-F108-PAA copolymer was in a stretched state at low temperature, while at high temperature the micellar core was still composed of the hydrophobic PPO, with PEO and PAA separating from each other and forming the micellar shell. Salt species and concentration had great influence on the CMT of PAA-F108-PAA copolymer, which The CMT of PAA-F108-PAA copolymer decreased significantly by increasing KCl concentration to 1 mol/L. KCl showed a dehydration effect for both PPO and PEO block. In contrast, 1 mol/L KI increased the CMT of PAA-F108-PAA to a slightly higher value, suggesting that KI weakened the interaction between PPO and water but enhanced the interaction between PEO and water.

The paper reveals that Methyl Orange (MO) can be decolorized effectively in beta-Bi2O3 suspension system under UV irradiation. The optimal loading of photocatalyst in our experimental condition for the decolorization of MO is 800 mgL(-1). The present study, on the base of Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, illustrates that the decolorization reaction is a pseudo first order kinetic model with the limiting rate constant of 10.2354 mgL(-1)h(-1) and equilibrium adsorption constant 5.8395x10(-2) Lmg(-1), respectively. The decolorization efficiency decreases as the pH value increases. Several observations indicate that the photocatalytic mechanism involves hydroxyl radicals attack in MO decolorization with beta-Bi2O3 under UV irradiation, but other reactive oxygen species and h(+) attack can not be excluded. Special attention was paid on the nature of the MO itself, more considerations should be focused on the underlying photocatalytic mechanism of beta-Bi2O3.

The complex was characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray single crystal diffraction. There are two kinds of cations constructed by CdII atoms with a octahedral coordination arrangement in 1. The CdII atom is bonded by six nitrogen atoms from six im ligands in the first cation, and the second central CdII atom is bonded by three nitrogen atoms of im molecules and three oxygen atoms belonging to water molecules. The ans anion acts as a counterion to balance the charge, and the adjacent anions are reversed but non-parallel interlinked by NH...O(S) hydrogen bonds into graphite-like 2D sheet viewed from the c axis. The anionic channels along the [110] direction are filled with the cations, and the two kinds of cations are alternatingly arranged in the channels. The hydrogen-bonding interactions together with the ionic bonds stabilize the crystal structure. The thermostability of the complex was investigated by TG and DSC.

The CS-CD was used as an adsorbent for the adsorption of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), and 2,4,6-tuichlorophenol (TCP) from aqueous solutions. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were applied to describe the adsorption isotherms of the chlorophenols. The adsorption parameters have also been evaluated. The calculated maximum adsorption capacities for 2-CP, DCP, and TOP on CS-CD were 14.51, 50.68, and 74.29 mg.g(-1), respectively, indicating that the introduction of the beta-CD moiety greatly increased the adsorption efficiency. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorptions were fast, in that all of the adsorption equilibria were reached within one hour, and that the adsorption processes followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees, and Delta S degrees were also calculated. The negative Delta G degrees values indicated that all of the adsorption processes were spontaneous. A possible adsorption mechanism has been provided and discussed. The effects of electrolytes and pH values on adsorption revealed that hydrogen bonding between the chlorophenols and CS-CD dominated the adsorption process, which was further confirmed by FT-IR analysis. The adsorbent could be regenerated by washing with ethanol. Following six cycles of usage and regeneration, the mass and adsorption efficiency of the CS-CD remained at 90% and 82%, respectively. CS, however, showed greater mass loss and efficiency reduction following regeneration.

The result shows that decolorization of MO increases as the dosage of K2S2O8 increases. The kinetic results demonstrate that the decolorization reaction is a pseudo first-order reaction when the concentration of MO is below 10 mg/L and Langmuir-Hinshewood kinetic model (L-H) can well described it, the value of Ea is 19.5 kJ/mol. The decolorization efficiency is low when the pH value is low (<= 2). Result of CODCr shows MO can be effectively mineralized with KPS direct oxidation. The knowledge on the kinetics of the system and influence of some parameters on the system possesses both practical and theoretical values.

The surface parameters, structure, morphology, the adsorption ability of light, the hydroxyl content and the photoinduced charge separation rate of the photocatalyst prepared (SDBS-SiO2-TiO2) were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), respectively. The results show that doping Pd into ZnO decreases the BET surface area. The XRD spectra of the Pd-doped ZnO catalysts calcined at 773 K show only the characteristic peaks of wurtzite-type. Doping Pd into ZnO increases the absorbance of ZnO in visible region and enhances the photoinduced charge separation rate. The photocatalytic activity of Pd-doped ZnO photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange (MO) solution was evaluated, of all the photocatalysts prepared, the Pd-doped ZnO with 3/100 possesses the best photocatalytic activity.

We first prove linear convergence of the algorithm in the continuous case on infinite time intervals at a rate depending on the size of the overlaps, the time-delay argument and the coefficients of the equations. For the special case, i.e., the heat equation with a fixed time delay, the convergence rates of the OSWR algorithm presented in this paper are sharper than the existing results. We then prove that the linear convergence remains valid after spatial discretization and the convergence rates are robust with respect to mesh refinement. The convergence behaviour of the algorithm with an arbitrary number of subdomains is also investigated and it is shown that the convergence rate deteriorates with as number of subdomains increases and ameliorates as the overlap size increases.

The iterative method is an important way to solve the generalized coupled Sylvester systems. In this two-part article, finite iterative methods are proposed for solving one-sided (or two-sided) and generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations and the corresponding optimal approximation problem over generalized reflexive solutions (or reflexive solutions). In part I, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve one-sided and coupled Sylvester matrix equations (AY - ZB, - CY - ZD) = (E, F) over generalized reflexive matrices Y and Z. When the matrix equations are consistent, for any initial generalized reflexive matrix pair [Y-1,Z(1)], the generalized reflexive solutions can be obtained by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the least Frobenius norm generalized reflexive solution pair can be obtained by choosing a special kind of initial matrix pair. The unique optimal approximation generalized reflexive solution pair [(Y) over cap, (Z) over cap] to a given matrix pair [Y-0,Z(0)] in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution pair [(Y) over tilde (center dot), (Z) over tilde (center dot)] of two new corresponding generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations (A (Y) over tilde - (Z) over tildeB, C (Y) over tilde - (Z) over tildeD) = ((E) over tilde,(F) over tilde), where (E) over tilde = E - AY(0) + Z(0)B, (F) over tilde = F - CY0 + Z(0)D. Several numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the presented iterative algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper our purpose is to establish a theoretical framework for a candidate of the quantum one-way functions and quantum trapdoor functions based on one-parameter unitary groups. The dynamics of parameterized unitary groups ensure the one-wayness and quantum undistinguishability in different levels, and the physical feasibility are derived from the simultaneous approximation of its infinitesimal generators. Moreover, these special functions are used to construct new cryptosystems-the quantum public-key cryptosystems for encrypting both the classical and quantum information.

PLGG was synthesized through the ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide (LLA) and (3s)-benzoxylcarbonylethyl-morpholine-2,5-dione (BEMD) using Sn(Oct)(2) as a catalyst and it was subsequently deprotected via hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd/C. A series of monomethyl poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with the molecular weights of 2,000, 1,100, and 500 were immobilized on the carboxyl groups of PLGG. These PEGylated graft derivatives were characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (H-1 NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of the amphiphilic copolymers were tested by the fluorescence probe technique and the CMCs were 2.3, 1.0, and 0.32 mu g/mL, respectively. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) images revealed that the micelles were homogeneous spherical nanoparticles and the sizes of the micelles were distributed across a range of 80 to 22 nm. Anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded into the micelles. The in vitro release profiles showed that the sustaining release of the drugloaded micelles could last over 7 days. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay of the DOX-loaded micelles against HepG2 cells was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assays. The results demonstrated that the drug-loaded micelles exhibited a high level of inhibition activity on cancer cells. The confocal microscopy images of HepG2 cells showed that DOX released from the micelles could be delivered into cell nuclei. PLGG-g-mPEG micelles are promising potential carriers for delivering anticancer drugs.

We assume that the spare system for replacement is available only by an order and the lead time for delivering the spare follows exponential distribution. Moreover, we also suppose that the repair facility may be subject to failure during the repair period. Under these assumptions, by using the geometric process and the supplementary variable technique, some important reliability indices such as the system availability, rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) and the probability that the system is waiting for replacement are derived. An ordering policy N - 1 and a replacement policy N based on the number of failures of the system are also considered. Furthermore, employing several Lemmas, the explicit expression of the average cost rate is derived. Meanwhile, the optimum value N* for minimizing the average cost rate could be determined numerically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In many practical dynamic systems, physical input saturation on hardware dictates that the magnitude of the control signal is always constrained. Saturation is a potential problem for actuators of control systems. It often severely limits system performance, giving rise to undesirable inaccuracy or leading instability. To deal with saturation, we construct a new system with the same order as that of the plant. With the error between the control input and saturation input as the input of the constructed system, a number of signals are generated to compensate the effect of saturation. Finally, simulation results show that the AFNC can achieve favorable tracking performances.

The discrete-time neural networks are derived by discretizing the corresponding continuous-time counterparts with different discretization methods. The impulses are classified into three classes: input disturbances, stabilizing and "neutral" type - the impulses are neither helpful for stabilizing nor destabilizing the neural networks, and then by using the excellent ideology introduced recently by Chen and Zheng [W. H. Chen, W. X. Zheng, Global exponential stability of impulsive neural networks with variable delay: an LMI approach, IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. I 56 (6) (2009) 1248-1259], the connections between the impulses and the utilized Lyapunov function are fully explored with respect to each type of impulse. Novel techniques that used to realize the ideology in discrete-time situation are proposed and it is shown that they are essentially different from the continuous-time case. Several criteria for global exponential stability of the discrete-time neural networks are established in terms of matrix inequalities and based on these theoretical results numerical simulations are given to compare the capability of different discretization methods.

The nanomorphology of CB and rubber/CB soluble rubber was observed by atomic force microscope. The results show that high-structure CB DZ13 has a "grape cluster" structure which consists of many original particles with the grain size of about 30-50 nm. Graphitizing process of CB decreases the amount of bound rubber. The NR/DZ13 soluble rubber with island-rim structure has been obtained, where the islands are DZ13 particles and the rims around the islands are occupied by NR film. But when the graphitized DZ13 particles were used as fillers of rubber, we have only observed that some graphitized DZ13 particles were deposited on the surface of the globular-like NR molecular chains, instead of the spreading of NR molecular chains along the surface of DZ13 particles, indicating that graphitized DZ13 has lower chemical activity than ungraphitized DZ13. Especially, we have already observed an interesting unusual bound rubber phenomenon, the blocked "bracelet" structure with the diameter of about 600 nm in which CB particles were blocked in ring-shaped SBS monomer.

The highest conversion yield of styrene and selectivity for epoxide were 40 and 96%, respectively. These complexes have been also studied as catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of p-xylene to p-toluic acid. The effects of the crown ether group on the catalytic properties of the complexes are discussed. The oxidation of p-xylene to p-toluic acid with air at 120 degrees C under normal pressure proceeded efficiently in the presence of the aza-crown ether substituted complexes. Significant selectivity for p-toluic acid (up to similar to 87%) and conversion of p-xylene (up to similar to 30%) were obtained.

The complexes were characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The results show that all the four complexes are coordination polymers. [Cd(phen)(H2O)(male)]n.2nH2O (1) and [Cd(bipy)(H2O)(male)]n.2nH2O (2) (male = maleate; phen = 1, 10-phenanthroline, bipy = 2, 2'-bipyridine) are isomorphic, and the asymmetric unit is constructed by one CdII atom, a maleate group, a diimine ligand and two crystal water molecules. Each maleate group links two CdII atoms in a bis(bidentate) chelating mode, resulting in a 1D helical chain. Within [Cd(phen)(H2O)2(male)]n.2nH2O (3), the maleate group bridges two CdII atoms in a bis(monodentate) chelating mode into a 1D helical chain along the [100] direction. The helical chain is decorated by phen groups alternatively at the two sides, and each phen plane of one chain is inserted in the void space between two adjacent phen ligands from an adjacent chain, resulting in a double zipper-like chain. The asymmetric unit of [Cd2(phen)2(male)2]n (4) contains a CdII cation, one phen molecule, and a maleate group, and one bridging maleate group links three CdII atoms resulting in a 2D layer extending in [011] plane. The 2D networks are constructed by four kinds of rings formed by the central metal atom and maleate dianion. The thermostabilities of the four complexes were investigated.

The process has two steps in which the amorphous WO3-C mixtures were first produced from salt solution containing tungsten and carbon elements by air drying and subsequent calcining at 400 degrees C for 1 h, and secondly treated at temperatures in the range of 500-1300 degrees C for 1-2 h. Reaction path of the WO3-C system was discussed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and microstructure of reaction products was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. The results show that the phase evolution of WO3 follows mainly WO3 -> WO2.9 -> WO2.72 -> WO2 -> W -> WC and the incomplete carburization reaction occurs at low carburization temperature and short carburization time. In addition, the increase of carburization temperature contributes to the grain growth of WC powders which is relatively slow at 1000-1200 degrees C and enhanced significantly at 1200-1300 degrees C.

J	Wu, DQ; Zheng, JG				Wu, Daqing; Zheng, Jianguo			A Dynamic Multistage Hybrid Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithm for Function Optimization	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							BEE COLONY ALGORITHM; PARTICLE SWARM	A novel dynamic multistage hybrid swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, which is abbreviated as DM-PSO-ABC. The DM-PSO-ABC combined the exploration capabilities of the dynamic multiswarm particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and the stochastic exploitation of the cooperative artificial bee colony algorithm (CABC) for solving the function optimization. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, the whole process is divided into three stages. In the first stage, a dynamic multiswarm PSO is constructed to maintain the population diversity. In the second stage, the parallel, positive feedback of CABC was implemented in each small swarm. In the third stage, we make use of the particle swarm optimization global model, which has a faster convergence speed to enhance the global convergence in solving the whole problem. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm, various scale benchmark problems are tested to demonstrate the potential of the proposed multistage hybrid swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. The results show that DM-PSO-ABC is better in the search precision, and convergence property and has strong ability to escape from the local suboptima when compared with several other peer algorithms.

The results confirm that the aggregation reaction between Mel and Ps is highly pH-dependent. Changes in pH dramatically influence the molar ratio of Mel to melaminium (Hmel(+)) and subsequently affect the synergistic nature of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and pi-pi stacking interactions, resulting in the reversibility of the aggregation and dissolution process. The composition of the Mel-Ps aggregates has been characterized as 2[Hmel(+)]center dot[HPO42-]center dot 3H(2)O. Mechanism analysis demonstrated that there exist two different methods for the transformation of Mel into Hmel(+) by considering the aggregation reaction process and conditions.

This catalytic system showed higher catalytic activity in this hydrolysis and better reproducibility and stability than other similar lanthanum(III) ion systems. The rate of the catalytic hydrolysis was about 10(8)-fold faster than that of its spontaneous hydrolysis under the same conditions. Compared with previous Cu(II) or Ni(II) complexes containing the same ligand in water, the activity of the macrocyclic La(III) complexe is increased ca 10(4)-fold. The experimental evidence showed that the mon-hydroxy complex made of the nitrogen heterocycle ligand and lanthanum(III) ion is the active species as catalyst in the catalytic hydrolysis of BNPP.

When the matrix equations are consistent, for any initial generalized reflexive matrix pair [X-1, Y-1], the generalized reflexive solutions can be obtained by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the least Frobenius norm generalized reflexive solutions can be obtained by choosing a special kind of initial matrix pair. The unique optimal approximation generalized reflexive solution pair [(X) over cap, (Y) over cap] to a given matrix pair [X-0, Y-0] in Frobenius norm corresponding can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution [(X) over tilde*, (Y) over tilde*] of a new corresponding generalized coupled Su;vester matrix equation pair (A (X) over tildeB - C (Y) over tildeD, E (X) over tildeF - G (Y) over tildeH) = ((M) over tilde(N) over tilde), where (M) over tilde = M - AX(0)B _ CY0D, (N) over tilde = N - EX0F + GY(0)H.

The results show that doping with two Cs atoms dramatically affects the geometries of the ground-state pure gold clusters and the doped Cs atoms prefer to locate at the symmetry position. The relative stability of these clusters is examined via analysis of the averaged atomic binding energies, fragmentation energies, the second-order difference of energies and the highest occupied-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gaps as a function of cluster size. The results exhibit a dramatic even-odd alternative behavior. In particular, it should be noted that a maximum peak is observed for Cs2Aun clusters at n = 2, implying that the Cs2Au2 cluster possesses relatively higher stability. In addition, the charge transfers, VIPs, VEAs, chemical hardnesses and polarizabilities have been analysed and compared.

The sufficient conditions about the existence of the global strong solution are given. Provided that (1 - partial derivative(2)(x))u(0) is an element of M-broken vertical bar (R) (u)0 is an element of H-1 (R), and u(0) is an element of L-1(R), the existence and uniqueness of the global weak solution to the equation are shown to be true.

A Study on Removing Naphthenic Acid From Diesel Oil by Salt	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						diesel oil; naphthenic acid; orthogonal tests; removal of acid; sodium carbonate		Sodium carbonate as deacidification agent was used to remove naphthenic acid from diesel oil. The influence of affect factors about treating conditions on the acid removal of diesel oil was investigated, such as volume ratio of deacidification agent-to-oil (VRDO), reaction temperature, stirring time, and resting time. Orthogonal tests were done to conform the optimum process condition. The results showed that the optimum condition is that VRDO was 0.40, reaction temperature was 330 K, stirring time was 6 min, and resting time was 35 min. Under the optimum condition, acidity of diesel oil was reduced to 5.15 mgKOH/100 mL from 135.52 mgKOH/100 mL, and if deacidification rate of naphthenic acid reached 96.8%, diesel oil recovery could reach 92.6%. The quality index of diesel met the national standard.	[Hu, Z.; Yu, H.

Fluorescein (F1) as fluorescence indicator and a cationic dye methylene blue (MB) as model analyte were employed to investigate the analytical feature of this assay platform. An anionic dye sunset yellow FCF (SY) was chosen as a comparison analyte to test the generality of this strategy. Results show that rGO can bind F1 and quench the fluorescence by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), while MB can displace F1 quickly from the Fl/rGO complex by competitive adsorption, inducing the fluorescence recovery which provides a quantitative readout for MB. Besides, this design was simply based on the competitive adsorption of rGO between dye and FD, and can be generally applied to other dyes for label-free detection. The fluorescence enhancement efficiency (FEE) is proportional to the dye concentration over the range of 7.60-420.00 ng mL(-1) MB and 7.28-400.25 ng mL(-1) SY, respectively. The linear regression equations were calculated as FEEMB = 0.0192c(MB) - 0.3103 for MB and FEESY = 0.0142 c(SY) - 0.0427 for SY, with the detection limits of 1.03 and 1.15 ng mL(-1), respectively. The MB in waste water and SY in an orange-flavored sports drink sample were assayed with satisfactory results.

The effects of two-temperature nonthermal ions on the basic properties of small but finite amplitude nonlinear dust-acoustic waves are examined. It is found that two-temperature nonthermal ions affect the basic properties of the dust-acoustic solitary waves. It is also observed that only compressive solitary waves exist in this system.

The optimized geometries show that the most stable isomers have a three-dimensional structure except for Au2Si1,3 clusters. The doped gold atoms prefer to occupy the surface site in the Au2Sin clusters. Here, the averaged atomic binding energies and fragmentation energies show that the Au2Si5 isomer is the most stable among the Au2Sin (n = 1-8) clusters. A pronounced even-odd alternation is found in the energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO gaps), especially, the Au2Si5 cluster has the largest HOMO-LUMO gap of. 2.06 eV. Moreover, the reverse even-odd alternation rule to the average polarizability per atom versus the charges transfer was found. A transition point appears at n = 5.

The iterative method is an important way to solve the generalized coupled Sylvester systems. In this paper, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve the minimum Frobenius norm residual problem: ||(AXB CXD) - (EF)|| min over generalized reflexive matrix X. For any initial generalized reflexive matrix X-1, by the iterative algorithm, the generalized reflexive solution X* can be obtained within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the unique least-norm generalized reflexive solution X* can also be derived when an appropriate initial iterative matrix is chosen. Furthermore, the unique optimal approximate solution (sic)X to a given matrix X-0 in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution (X) over tilde* of a new corresponding minimum Frobenius norm residual problem: min ||(A (X) over tildeB C (X) over tildeD) - ((E) over tilde (F) over tilde)|| with (E) over tilde = E - AX(0)B, (F) over tilde = F - CX0D. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate that our iterative algorithm is effective.

Especially, the crossing points (CPs) among different PESs were located by means of the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach presented by Yoshizawa et al., and the structures and energies of the corresponding minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) were obtained by the mathematical algorithm proposed by Harvey et al. Finally, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) interaction analyses about MECP1 and MECP2 were used to prove our calculation results.

For the geometric structures of the AunRb (n=1-10) clusters, the dominant growth pattern is for a Rb-substituted Aun+1 cluster or one Au atom capped on a Aun-1Rb cluster, and the turnover point from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional structure occurs at n=4. Moreover, the stability of the ground-state structures of these clusters has been examined via an analysis of the average atomic binding energies, fragmentation energies, and the second-order difference of energies as a function of cluster size. The results exhibit a pronounced even-odd alternation phenomenon. The same pronounced even-odd alternations are found for the HOMO-LUMO gap, VIPs, VEAs, and the chemical hardness. In addition, about one electron charge transfers from the Au-n host to the Rb atom in each corresponding AunRb cluster.

The maximum rate of Cr(VI) removal was attained at a temperature of 37 degrees C, pH of 7.0-9.0, and biomass of 20 g/L when the initial Cr(VI) concentration was less than 50 mg/L. Under the optimum conditions, the Cr(VI) in tannery wastewater was treated with each cellular component of B. cereus to detect its ability to reduce Cr(VI). The results showed that the removal rate of Cr(VI) for the cell-free extracts could reach 92.70%, which was close to that of the whole cells (96.85%), indicating that the Cr(VI) reductase generated by B. cereus is primarily intracellular. Additionally, during continuous culture of the B. cereus, the strain showed good consecutive growth and removal ability. After treatment of 20 mg/L Cr(VI) for 48 h, the B. cereus was observed by SEM and TEM-EDX. SEM images showed that the B. cereus used to treat Cr(VI) grew well and had a uniform cellular size. TEM-EDX analysis revealed large quantities of chromium in the B. cereus cells used to treat Cr(VI). Overall, the results presented herein demonstrate that B. cereus can be used as a new biomaterial to remove Cr(VI) from tannery wastewater.

The PHIOA uses the ideas of selection, crossover and mutation from genetic algorithms (GAs) and the update velocity and situation of particle swarm optimization (PSO) under the independence of PSO and GAs. The proposed algorithm divides the individuals into two equation groups according to their fitness values. The subgroup of the top fitness values is evolved by GAs and the other subgroup is evolved by the PSO algorithm. The optimal number is selected as a global optimum at every circulation which shows better results than both PSO and GAs, then improves the overall performance of the algorithm. The PHIOA is used to optimize the structure and parameters of the fuzzy neural network. Finally, the experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed PHIOA to search the global optimal solution. The PHIOA can improve the error accuracy while speeding up the convergence process, and effectively avoid the premature convergence to compare with the existing methods.

Decolorization efficiency of MO increases as the loading of the KBrO3 increases, when the dosage of KBrO3 is 8 g/L, the decolorization of MO is up to 100% in 20 mins. The paper reveals that the decolorization reaction is a pseudo first-order reaction when the concentration of MO is below 10 mgL(-1), the decolorization rate constant for 10 mgL(-1) MO is 0.0102 min(-1). The decolorization efficiency in acid is better than that in base, the decolorization efficiency for pH 2.0 and 12.0 are 44.0% and 3.8%, respectively. Several observations indicate that the decolorization of MO with KBrO3 under UV irradiation is not the attack of hydroxyl radicals. More considerations should be paid on the underlying decolorization mechanism of MO with KBrO3 under UV irradiation.

We choose the reaction diffusion equations with a constant time delay as the underlying model problem and try to derive optimized transmission conditions of Robin type. To this end, we propose a new method to get quasi-optimized parameter involved in the transmission conditions and it is shown that this method is essentially different from the existing ones. Moreover, when the situation is reduced into the heat equations with a constant delay, we show that this method results in a more efficient quasi-optimized parameter.

In this study, high purity conductive carbon black was produced by high temperature treatment from ordinary carbon black. The products were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analyzer, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, combining with composition, physical and chemical analysis. The results indicate that the purity and the conductivity of the ordinary carbon black are greatly improved after treatment. The size of the black becomes large and the distribution becomes central, the oxygen-containing functional groups are reduced compared with the starting carbon black. In addition, the ash content and metal impurities are greatly reduced.

The obtained powder was ground by ball milling and doped with Y2O3; then, it was shaped into pellets. Transparent ceramics sintering was carried out at 2153 K (1880 A degrees C) for 5, 10, and 20 hours. Obtained samples for three duration times are all are transparent, and the light transmittance of samples increases with increasing the holding time at the sintering temperature. The transmittance of the sample with 20 hours holding time is 55 pct at near 5 mu m. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement shows that all samples were single-phase AlON. The fracture surfaces of samples from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that with increasing the holding time, the grain size grows slightly, while the pore size and porosity decrease apparently, which bring about the transmittance increase. The pore size and the porosity are the main factors affecting the light transmitting properties of samples.

J	Min, F; He, HP; Qian, YH; Zhu, W				Min, Fan; He, Huaping; Qian, Yuhua; Zhu, William			Test-cost-sensitive attribute reduction	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Cost-sensitive learning; Attribute reduction; Test cost; Heuristic algorithm	ROUGH SETS; DECISION SYSTEMS; ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS; MODEL	In many data mining and machine learning applications, there are two objectives in the task of classification: one is decreasing the test cost, the other is improving the classification accuracy. Most existing research work focuses on the latter, with attribute reduction serving as an optional pre-processing stage to remove redundant attributes. In this paper, we point out that when tests must be undertaken in parallel, attribute reduction is mandatory in dealing with the former objective. With this in mind, we posit the minimal test cost reduct problem which constitutes a new, but more general, difficulty than the classical reduct problem. We also define three metrics to evaluate the performance of reduction algorithms from a statistical viewpoint. A framework for a heuristic algorithm is proposed to deal with the new problem: specifically, an information gain-based lambda-weighted reduction algorithm is designed, where weights are decided by test costs and a non-positive exponent lambda, which is the only parameter set by the user. The algorithm is tested with three representative test cost distributions on four UCI (University of California - Irvine) datasets. Experimental results show that there is a trade-off while setting lambda, and a competition approach can improve the quality of the result significantly. This study suggests potential application areas and new research trends concerning attribute reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we shall study this question in a more general way. For a finite group G, we define the subgroup A(G) to be intersection of the normalizers of all non-cyclic subgroups of G. Set A(0) = 1. Define A(i+1)(G)/A(i)(G) = A(G/A(i)(G)) for i >= 1. By A(infinity)(G) denote the terminal term of the ascending series. It is proved that if G = A(infinity)(G), then the derived subgroup G' is nilpotent. Furthermore, if all elements of prime order or order 4 of G are in A(G), then G' is also nilpotent.

The impulses are classified into three classes: input disturbances, stabilizing and "neutral" type-the impulses are neither helpful for stabilizing nor destabilizing the neural networks. We handle the three types of impulses in a uniform way by using the excellent ideology introduced recently. To this end, we propose new techniques which coupled with more general Lyapunov functions to realize the ideology and it is shown that they are more effective. Exponential dissipativity conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and these conditions can be straightforwardly reduced to exponential stability conditions. Numerical results are given to show that the obtained conditions are effective and less conservative than the existing ones. (C) 2011 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to test the effect, the CGAC algorithm was success in finding the best values of C and., when the support vector machine (SVM) was used to fit the nonlinear relationship between the numerical representation of the chemical structure and IC(50). The genetic algorithm (GA) was also used to obtain the appropriate feature subset simultaneously, because feature subset selection influences the appropriate kernel parameters and vice versa. The obtained results illustrate that GA-CGAC-SVM models have satisfactory prediction accuracy. The best quantitative modeling results in thirteen-descriptors model based on GA-CGAC-SVMr with mean-square errors 0.397, a predicted correlation coefficient (R(2)) 0.842, and a cross-validated correlation coefficient (Q(2)) 0.756. The best classification result was found using SVM: the percentage (%) of correct prediction based on 7-fold cross-validation was 90.6%. The results demonstrate that the proposed CGAC algorithm provides a new and effective method to find the optimum parameters when the SVM tool is used.

Observations reveal that the one complex (MnL(2)(2)Cl) containing morpholine pendants exhibits 1.2-1.7 fold kinetic advantage over the other one (MnL(2)(2)Cl) containing benzoaza-15-crown-5 group. Especially, optimum molecule structures using a Gaussian 03 software confirm that MnL(2)(2)Cl indeed possesses a relatively open linked site for the approaching of PNPP, resulting in higher efficiency due to a convenient association between substrate (PNPP) and MnL(2)(2)Cl. In addition, the steric hindrance of two pendants, i.e., benzoaza-15-crown-5 and morpholine, may be a main influencing factor for tuning catalytic activities of the synthesized Mn(III) catalysts. Both Mn(III) catalysts used here were found to have fine tolerance to the operated temperature and pH. Related kinetic and thermodynamic analyses were also given to demonstrate their structure-activity relationships (SAR) of both catalysts used.

In practice, the maximum admissible values of the control inputs are restrained. To solve this problem, based on time-varying sliding mode theory, we can obtain the best possible control quality without violating technical and environmental constraints by selecting the switching line parameters. Also a kind of extended state observer is used to compensate for the uncertainties of systems, using only the available synchronizing error. Then the controller becomes physically realizable based on the states of the observer, and can be used to synchronize between Duffing and Van der Pol chaotic systems. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Further, we also discuss the convergence and stability of a new perturbed iterative algorithm with errors for solving this class of nonlinear operator equations in Banach spaces. Since general A-monotonicity generalizes general H-monotonicity (and in turn, generalizes A-monotonicity, H-monotonicity and maximal monotonicity), our results improve and generalize the corresponding results of recent works.

With biochemical and genetics method, the isolated bacterium was identified as Citrobacter freundii. Then, the isolate was inoculated to tubes containing sulfate in simulated tannery wastewater to optimize the process. The results show that the effect of C. freundii in removing sulfate was best when the temperature was 32 degrees C, pH was 7.0, COD/SO(4)(2-) was 5.0 and the initial SO(4)(2-) concentration was 1500 mg/L. Also, the SRB was inoculated onto an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) to remove sulfate in actual tannery wastewater. It was found that the removal rate of sulfate in actual tannery wastewater reached 89.66% which was 12.13% higher than the treatment without inoculating the isolated SRB when the initial SO(4)(2-) concentration was 1069 mg/L. The experiment demonstrates that C. freundii could be selected as a new biomaterial to remove sulfate in tannery wastewater.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of PNPP hydrolysis have been examined. All four complexes exhibit high catalytic activity and the rate increases with pH under 25 degrees C. The complexes of ligands containing a crown ether group exhibit higher catalytic activities than the non-crown analogues. The catalytic activity of the complexes follows the order Mn(III)>Co(II) under the same ligands.

The weight loss experiment showed that the inhibition efficiency increased with amoxicillin and ceftriaxone concentrations to attain the maximums of 80.3% and 94.1%, respectively at 1.00x10(-2) mol/L. Potentiodynamic polarization indicated that amoxicillin and ceftriaxone acted as mixed-type inhibitors but mainly inhibited cathode hydrogen evolution reaction for mild steel in 1 mol/L HCl. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated the inhibitors covered the active points of metal surface to inhibit corrosion. The absorption of both inhibitors on the mild steel surface was found to follow Langmuir adsorption isothermal and dominantly involve chemical adsorption at 298 K. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed both of the inhibitors played a significant protective effect in mild steel corrosion in 1 mol/L HCl. The relationship between the inhibition properties and molecular structure had been discussed by quantum chemistry calculation. All the experimental results concluded that both amoxicillin and ceftriaxone acted as good corrosion inhibitors and their inhibition efficiency was in the order of ceftriaxone > amoxicillin.

The effect of Mo(2)C, WC and TaC on the microstructure and mechanical properties of (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N)-8 wt.% Ni-7 wt.% Co systems was investigated. The Mo(2)C content was varied from 0 to 10 wt.% and additive WC or TaC was added at a level of 5 wt.% with Mo(2)C addition. The results show that the densification of (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N)-8 wt.% Ni-7 wt.% Co cermets was improved significantly by the addition of Mo(2)C. With the increase of Mo(2)C content, there is a coarsening tendency in the microstructure of (Ti, 20W, 15Mo, 0.2V)(C, N)-8Ni-7Co system, but the refinement for (Ti, 15W, 5Mo, 0.2V)(C, N)-8Ni-7Co. TaC addition decreases the density of (Ti, 15W, 5Mo, 0.2V)(C, N)-10Mo(2)C-8Ni-7Co cermet and thus weakens its bending strength. (Ti, 15W, 5Mo, 0.2V)(C, N)-10Mo(2)C-5WC-8Ni-7Co cermet has optimal mechanical properties: bending strength of 1999 MPa, hardness (H(v)) of 1677 MPa and toughness of 9.95 MPa m(1/2) respectively by adding WC, which is due to its ultrafine and weak core/rim structure.

When the first phase of service is completed, the service process can be interrupted with probability 1 - p (0 <= p <= 1) as a result of the customer leaving the service area to attend to other work. There is a finite space to accommodate the interrupted customers in the queueing system. When the other work is completed, the customer, whose service was interrupted, will re-enter the service area and resume his interrupted service based on the non-preemptive priority rule. Using the matrix geometric method, the steady state behavior of this system is analyzed. Based on the queue length distribution, several important performance measures along with some numerical examples have been discussed. Finally, under a given cost structure, we use the direct search method to determine the optimal capacity of the space to accommodate the interrupted customers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of Cu content on catalytic properties of the NiMgAl catalysts was studied. These catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric and differential analyses, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction. The addition of small amounts of Cu to NiMgAl catalysts leads to the increase of surface Ni species and the enhancement of Ni(2+) reducibility. The Ni(0.5)Cu(0.1)Mg(2.4)Al catalyst with Cu/Ni ratio of 0.2 exhibits the higher activity and stability, showing no apparent deactivation during 20 h on stream at 700 A degrees C, whereas Ni(0.5)Mg(2.5)Al catalyst suffers severe deactivation only after 10 h on stream. This improved performance is closely related to smaller nickel particles well dispersed on the catalyst surface. The Ni(0.5)Cu(0.1)Mg(2.4)Al catalyst exhibits strong resistance to coke formation and the sintering of nickel particles.

The sensor exhibits a good response for Al(3+) over a linear range of 9.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-1) mol/L, with a Nernstian slope of 20.0 +/- 0.2 mV/decade and detection limit of 7.0 x 10(-6) mol/L. Selectivity coefficients determined by the method of separate solution indicate high selectivity for Al(3+). The response mechanism was discussed in view of UV-Vis spectroscopy technique and the A.C. impedance technique. It was used as an indicator electrode in potentiometric titration of Al(3+) with EDTA and in the determination of Al(3+) in real samples. The electrode has a relatively fast response time, long life time and satisfactory stability.	[Liu, X. L.; Yuan, R.; Xu, W. J.; Ma, Y. H.; Chai, Y.

The process is simple and can be used to fabricate large size porous structures. It has been characterized that the pores in the porous structure are open in nature and the size of pores in the same porous structure can be controlled within a narrow range. Depending on the processing condition, the porosity in the porous structure was measured to be from 50% to 78%, and pore size varied from 0.5 mu m to 3 mu m. It has been determined that the porosity in the process was formed primarily due to volume reduction caused by phase transformation from chromium oxides to chromium carbides. It is believed that similar process can be used to form porous structures of other materials as long as a reactive sintering can occur and is accompanied with volume reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One of the 4,4'-diazenediyldiphthalic acid molecules is arranged around an inversion center and possesses two -COOH groups, while the other is partially deprotonated and is a dianion for charge balance. It can be noted that, in the undeprotonated acid, the -COOH groups are disordered over two positions by rotation around the C-C bond linking the -COOH group to the phenyl ring. Surprisingly, the H atom is not involved in the disorder. In the dianion, the remaining H atom is located between the two COO groups.

It is found that the morphology and photocatalytic activity of ZnO has a strong dependence on the kind of precipitant. The mixed weak base is the key to determine the honeycomb-like nanostructure of ZnO. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by BET, XRD and SEM. The results show that ZnO prepared by the mixed weak base. possesses the highest BET surface area, pore volume, the smallest pore size and the particle average size. ZnO prepared by the mixed weak base exhibits the best photocatalytic activity and the possible reason was discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

The DSC results show the endothermic peaks disappeared with the increasing of cold-rolling reduction and there was an exothermic peak around 330 degrees C on the curve during the first heating process. The exothermic peak is associated with recrystallization of amorphous phase induced by cold-rolled work. During the second heating process, the endothermic peak showed up but the exothermic peak didn't. These phenomena are confirmed by the internal friction results. During the first heating process, the transformation internal friction decreased with the increasing of the cold-rolling reduction and the internal friction augmentation appeared around 330 degrees C which is related to recrystallization.

The server in the system is assumed to provide two different types of services, namely essential and optional services, to the customer. During the operation of the system, the arrival of the catastrophe will break the system down and simultaneously induce customer to leave the system immediately. Using a new type discrete supplementary variable technique, the authors obtain some performance characteristics of the queueing system, including the steady-state availability and failure frequency of the system, the steady-state probabilities for the server being idle, busy, breakdown and the loss probability of the system etc. Finally, by the numerical examples, the authors study the influence of the system parameters on several performance measures.

The O/HfC (0 0 1) system was also calculated for comparison. The (root 2 x root 2) R45 degrees supercell was constructed to calculate the adsorption. In calculations, we treated the exchange and correlation potential with the revised version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized-gradient approximation (GGA-RPBE). Our data demonstrate that the preference adsorption site for oxygen atom is the 4-fold hollow site on the silicon-doped HfC (0 0 1) surface. The oxygen on the silicon-doped surface receives more charges from silicon atoms than that in O/HfC (0 0 1) from carbon atoms. The Si-O bonds exhibit ionic and covalent characteristics, while the C-O bond exhibits primarily covalence. And the covalence of Si-Hf bonds is stronger than that of C-Hf bonds. The strong Si-O and Si-Hf bonds indicate the strong interactions of oxygen with the silicon-doped surface. The strong interactions can explain the possibility of improving the oxidation resistance of HfC surface via doping silicon. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim is to design a full-order fuzzy DOF controller that ensures asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and guarantees a prescribed H-infinity performance level on disturbance attenuation for all admissible uncertainties. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasoviskii functional and the Barbalat lemma, delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are presented in terms of LMIs.

J	Xiong, XZ; Hu, JH; Ling, X				Xiong, Xing-Zhong; Hu, Jian-Hao; Ling, Xiang			A Cooperative Transmission and Receiving Scheme for IDMA with Time-Reversal Technique	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						IDMA; TDR-IDMA; Multi-user detection; Time-reversal; Convergence speed	FIELDS	In this paper, we propose an efficient uplink and downlink cooperative transmission and receiving scheme for interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) systems with time-reversal (TR) technique. We refer this system as TDR-IDMA, since the time- division duplexing (TDD) mode is used in this transceiver system. In TDR-IDMA systems, the time-reversed version of the channel impulse responses obtained from the uplink is used to process the received signal before the elementary signal estimator in the receiver of base station (BS). Due to the weak correlations of multi-path for different users, the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) at the beginning of turbo-like detection of TDR-IDMA can be increased significantly. Compared with conventional IDMA system, much less iterations is needed for signal detection in TDR-IDMA systems. Thus, the proposed scheme effectively reduces the multi-user detection (MUD) computation load for the uplink, which is the bottleneck for IDMA system. TR processing is also applied in the transmitter of BS to reduce the complexity of user ends (UEs). Simulation and analysis results show that TDR-IDMA can achieve the same performance of the traditional IDMA system with fast processing speed and simple UEs.

J	Lin, D; Wang, XY				Lin, Da; Wang, Xingyuan			Self-organizing adaptive fuzzy neural control for the synchronization of uncertain chaotic systems with random-varying parameters	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Uncertain chaotic systems; Chaos synchronization; Adaptive control; Lyapunov stability; Self-organizing fuzzy neural network	NONAFFINE NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; NETWORK CONTROL; UNKNOWN-PARAMETERS; IDENTIFICATION; OBSERVER; DESIGN; MODEL	This paper proposes a self-organizing adaptive fuzzy neural control (SAFNC) for the synchronization of uncertain chaotic systems with random-varying parameters. The proposed SAFNC system is composed of a computation controller and a robust controller. The computation controller containing a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) identifier is the principle controller. The SOFNN identifier is used to online estimate the compound uncertainties with the structure and parameter learning phases of fuzzy neural network (FNN), simultaneously. The structure-learning phase consists of the growing of membership functions, the splitting of fuzzy rules and the pruning of fuzzy rules, and thus the SOFNN identifier can avoid the time-consuming trial-and-error tuning procedure for determining the network structure of fuzzy neural network. The robust controller is used to attenuate the effects of the approximation error so that the synchronization of chaotic systems is achieved. All the parameter learning algorithms are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure network convergence as well as stable synchronization performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation results are illustrated in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Exponential stability of static neural networks with time delay and impulses	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY; VARIABLE DELAYS; VARYING DELAYS	In this study, the authors investigate the problem of global exponential stability of static neural networks with time delay and impulses. Three types of impulses are studied: the impulses are input disturbances; the impulses are 'neutral' type, that is, they are neither helpful for stability of neural networks nor destabilising; and the impulses are stabilising. For each type of impulses, by using Lyapunov function and Razumikhin-type techniques, sufficient conditions for global exponential stability are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities with respect to suitable classes of impulse time sequences. The new sufficient conditions can explicitly reveal the effects of time delay, impulses etc., on the stability. Numerical results are given to show the less conservatism of the obtained criteria compared with the existing ones.	[Wu, S.

The complex crystallized in orthorhombic, Pbca space group with the cell parameters: a=1.203 5(2) nm, b= 1.638 3(3) nm, c=2.517 1(5) nm, V=4.963 1(17) nm(3), D-c =1.599 g.m(-3), Z=4, F(000)=2416, mu(Mo K alpha)=1.072 mm(-1), S=1.066, (Delta/sigma()max)=0.001, R-1=0.037 6, wR(2)=0.088 8 (1>2 sigma(I)). The crystal structure study shows that each Ag atom is in a AgS2N2 distorted tetrahedral geometry by two S atoms from different (4-MeC6H4O)(2)PS2- ligands and two N atoms from one phen ligand, respectively. The two (4-MeC6H4O)(2)PS2- ligands each bridge two silver atoms to form an chair configuration of eight-membered Ag2S4P2 ring. And one-dimensional stack is formed vis intermolecular pi-pi interactions between the phen ligands, which is further linked into three-dimensional networks by weak intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions.

The reaction products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The results show that the synthesizing temperature of WC powders was reduced greatly by the novel precursor method. Thus, the preparation of the single-phase nano-WC powders is at only 1000 degrees C for 2 h. The lowering of synthesizing temperature is mainly due to the homogeneous chemical composition of the amorphous oxide-carbon mixture. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of reactant concentration, reaction time and temperature on the morphology of the samples were studied. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID) measurement. alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles show a superparamagnetic behavior and the average size of the spherical particles was around 60 nm. However, hollow microspheres show a normal ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature with remanent magnetization and coercivity of 0.2482 emu/g and 2,516 Oe, respectively, and their average diameter was around 2 mu m. The effects of reactant concentration and reaction temperature on the formation of the products were investigated. The experimental results reveal that the magnetic properties of hematite can be tuned by controlling the morphology.

The catalyst was characterized by XRD and XPS. The electrocatalytic activity in the ORR was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry in 0.5 mol L(-1) H(2)SO(4) solution. The results show that the Co-N/C catalyst aids the reduction of oxygen. The presence of elemental cobalt in the precursor allows nitrogen atoms to embed themselves in the graphite matrix to form pyridinic and graphitic type C-N structures as the ORR active sites. The effect of heat-treating temperature on the catalytic activity was also investigated. The results also show that the Co-N/C catalyst is most active when pyrolyzed at 600A degrees C. The obtained Co-N/C catalyst loses some activity after initial exposure to the H(2)SO(4) solution because of leaching, but is then stable for up to 20 h immersion. The catalyst is also stable when charged, which is supported by the cyclic voltammetry results.

For a systematic comparison, activated carbon, graphite and two kinds of carbon black powder were used as reducing agents in this study. Ultrafine (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N) powders with a particle size of similar to 200-500 nm have been produced at 1450 degrees C for 2 h by using nanosized carbon black source with small particle size. The presence of phases in the reaction products was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the microstructure of carbon source powders and final products was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the formation of the Ti(C, N) phase is strongly dependent on the particle size of carbon source powders, and the synthesizing temperature of the Ti(C, N) phase decreases significantly from 1750 degrees C to 1300 degrees C by using nanosized carbon black, as compared with micron graphite. In addition, activated carbon with a particle size of 5-50 mu m does not favor the dissolution of tungsten or molybdenum carbides into Ti(C, N) despite its large specific surface area.

By employing delay differential inequality and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization approach, some sufficient conditions ensuring global exponential stability of equilibrium point for impulsive Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying delays and diffusion are obtained. In particular, the estimate of the exponential convergence rate is also provided, which depends on system parameters, diffusion effect and impulsive disturbed intention. It is believed that these results are significant and useful for the design and applications of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the results obtained here. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, GX; Chen, HF; Zhou, ZL; Yin, F; Guo, K				Huang, Guangxin; Chen, Huafu; Zhou, Zhongli; Yin, Feng; Guo, Ke			Two-class support vector data description	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Support vector data description; D-SVDD; TC-SVDD; One-class classification	DOMAIN DESCRIPTION	Support vector data description (SVDD) is a data description method that can give the target data set a spherically shaped description and be used to outlier detection or classification. In real life the target data set often contains more than one class of objects and each class of objects need to be described and distinguished simultaneously. In this case, traditional SVDD can only give a description for the target data set, regardless of the differences between different target classes in the target data set, or give a description for each class of objects in the target data set. In this paper, an improved support vector data description method named two-class support vector data description (TC-SVDD) is presented. The proposed method can give each class of objects in the target data set a hypersphere-shaped description simultaneously if the target data set contains two classes of objects. The characteristics of the improved support vector data descriptions are discussed. The results of the proposed approach on artificial and actual data show that the proposed method works quite well on the 3-class classification problem with one object class being undersampled severely.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study topographic characteristics of the films, including nucleation, crystalline feature, grain size, clustering and roughening. The initial nucleation of titanium oxides has almost completed during annealing at 300 degrees C for 120min or 400 degrees C for 30min. Especially, we have already observed the preferential nucleation and grain growth of titanium oxides on locations that protrude from the surface, as opposed to deep grooves. It is confirmed by AFM characterization that both of annealing temperature and time can hasten the nucleation and grain growth of titanium oxides, but annealing time is less influential than its temperature. The typical crystal transfer from amorphous-like to crystalline state occurs at 300-400 degrees C for 120 min during annealing, but the too low temperature of 200 degrees C does not contribute to the crystal transfer. In addition, higher annealing temperature (600 degrees C) leads to the transformation of crystal texture from globular-like to flaky type. Generally, higher annealing temperature or time can lead to higher film surface roughness through the grooving effect, but the roughness decreases with the increase of annealing time (at 400 degrees C for 90-120min).

The results show that the normal load is one of the main controlling factors for generation of electric arc during friction process with electric current applied. The strength of electric arc is enhanced with the decrease of normal loads and the increase of electric currents. The unstable friction process and the fluctuated dynamic friction coefficients are strongly dependent upon the electric arc. The wear volumes and the wear mechanism of carbon brush were affected by the electric arc obviously. As no electric arc occurs, no clear discrepancy of the wear volumes of the carbon samples with and without electric current applied could be detected. While the wear mechanisms are mainly mechanical wear. However, under the condition of the electric arc appearance, the wear volume of carbon with electric current applied increases much more rapidly than that without electric current applied and also increases obviously with the increase of electric current strengths and the decrease of normal loads. The wear mechanisms of carbon block are mainly electric arc ablation accompanying with adhesive wear and material transferring.

The catalytic system displayed high catalytic activity and the catalytic character of a metalloenzyme, although it did not attain the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. The final products were maleic and oxalic acids. Intermediate products, such as catechol and hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone, were detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The effects of temperature and the pH of the system on the rate of the catalytic oxidation were investigated. A reaction mechanism and kinetic model for the catalytic oxidation are proposed, which are supported by the results of the experimental and calculation data.

By establishing an integro-differential inequality with impulsive initial conditions and employing M-matrix theory, some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of equilibrium point for impulsive BAM FCNNs with time delays in the leakage terms and distributed delays are obtained. In particular, the estimate of the exponential convergence rate is also provided, which depends on the delay kernel functions and system parameters. It is believed that these results are significant and useful for the design and applications of BAM FCNNs. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the results obtained here.

However, the information level of the signal is far lower than the actual bandwidth. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured signal models, in which signal lies in a shift-invariant space. In this paper, we introduce a randomly modulated converter to produce a low-rate set of digital measurements, and develop an efficient recovery of such signals from a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which signal lies in a shift-invariant spaces, chosen from a larger set of m possibilities. Our main result is an equivalence condition under which the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard RIP used extensively in the context of compressed sampling. Based on RIP we also prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modeling errors. Finally, we demonstrate the method by simulations, and show the proposed method yields better performance compared to over-sampling. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Iron(II) is also determined, being oxidized to iron(III) by potassium bromate. The calibration graph is linear in the range of 0.02-10.0 mu gl-1 and 10.0-1100 mu gl-1. The relative standard deviation is 1.5% for 4.0 mu gl-1 iron(III) and 2.3% for 60.0 mu gl-1 iron(III) (n=11). The presented system was applied successfully to the determination of iron in natural waters.

The kinetic mathematical model and mechanism cleavage on PNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by these complexes was proposed. The effects of complexes structure and reactive temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have been also examined. The results showed that the reactive rate increases with pH of the buffered CTAB micellar solution; all four complexes exhibited high activity for the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis in the buffered CTAB micellar solution. In comparison with the crown-free analogy [image omitted] and [image omitted], the crowned Schiff base complexes [image omitted] and [image omitted] exhibit higher catalytic activity for promoting PNPP hydrolysis.

The catalytic activities of the MPcs were evaluated by the absorbance ratios at the characteristic peak of the oxidation products. The results showed that MnPc had the best catalytic activity under the optimal conditions. The fiber optic AD biosensor based on MnPc catalysis and fluorescence quenching was fabricated and studied. The dissolved oxygen and AD content were evaluated by the phase delay phi. A linear relationship between phi and AD concentration was observed in the range from 2.0x10(-6) to 9.0x10(-5) mol . L-1, and the detection limit was 4.0x10(-7) mol . L-1. The results indicated that the fiber optic biosensor exhibited good reproducibility and stability.

The aim is to design a state feedback controller such that, for all admissible uncertainties as well as actuator failures occurring among the prespecified subset of actuators, the plant remains asymptotically stable and guarantees an adequate level of a quadratic cost index. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the Barbalat lemma, the descriptor system approach and the free weighting matrix method, new delay-dependent sufficient conditions for solvability of this problem are presented in terms of LMIs. Based on that, the design problem of the optimal reliable guaranteed cost controller is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The oxidation of p-xylene to p-toluic acid with air at 120 degrees C under normal atmospheric pressure occurred efficiently in the presence of aza-crown ether substituted unsymmetrical Schiff base Mn(III) complexes. Significant selectivity (up to similar to 90%) and conversion levels (up to similar to 40%) were obtained. The effect of the pendant aza-crown ether group in Mn(III) Schiff base complexes on the oxidation of p-xylene was also investigated by comparison with the pendant morpholino-group analogues. The addition of Na(+) cation accelerated the rate of conversion of p-xylene to p-toluic acid.

In this paper, we study the finite non-solvable groups G such that v(chi) consists of at most two conjugacy classes for all but one of the non-linear irreducible characters chi of G. In particular, we characterize a class of finite solvable groups which are closely related to the above-mentioned question and are called solvable phi-groups. As a corollary, we answer Research Problem 2 in [Y. Berkovich and L. Kazarin: Finite groups in which the zeros of every non-linear irreducible character are conjugate modulo its kernel. Houston J.

A matrix A is an element of C(nxn) is called R-skew symmetric if RAR = -A. The least-squares solutions of the matrix inverse problem for R-skew symmetric matrices with R* = R are firstly derived, then the solvability conditions and the solutions of the matrix inverse problem for R-skew symmetric matrices with R* = R are given. The solutions of the corresponding optimal approximation problem with R* = R for R-skew symmetric matrices are also derived. At last an algorithm for the optimal approximation problem is given. It can be seen that we extend our previous results [G. X. Huang, F. Yin, Matrix inverse problem and its optimal approximation problem for R-symmetric matrices, Appl. Math. Comput. 189 (2007) 482-489] and the results proposed by Zhou et al. [F.Z. Zhou, L. Zhang, X.Y. Hu, Least-square solutions for inverse problem of centrosymmetric matrices, Comput. Math.

A platinum-free electrocatalyst Co-N/C(8 0 0) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was synthesized by mixing the composite Co/C with urea and heat-treating at 800 degrees C. The results from linear sweep voltammograms indicated that the Co-N/C(8 0 0) is active to ORR. The beta-Co and cobalt oxides are not the active site of the catalyst Co-N/C. However, the existence of cobalt facilitated the modification of nitrogen to carbon black and led to the formation of active site of catalyst Co-N/C(8 0 0). (C) 2010 Chang Guo Chen.

By establishing the delay differential inequality with impulsive initial conditions, and employing the homeomorphism theory, the M-matrix theory and the inequality a Pi(1)(k=1) b(k)(qk) <= (1/r) (a(r) + Sigma(1)(k=1)qkb(k)(r)) (a >= 0, b(k) >= 0, q(k) >= 0 with Sigma(1)(k=1)qk=r-1, and r >= 1) some new sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of equilibrium point for impulsive Cohen-Grossberg-type BAM neural networks with time-varying delays are derived. In particular, the estimate of the exponential convergence rate which depends on the system parameters and the impulsive disturbance intension is also provided.

The predictions of 31 steroids benchmarks and 79 carbapenem derivatives using multiple linear regression analysis were carried out. The statistically significant QSAR models were obtained (steroids benchmarks: N=25, R(2)=0.894.; R(cv)(2)=0.785: carbapenem derivatives: n=64, R(2)=0.821, R(cv)(2)=0.765). Finally, classification of 32 stereoisomers of perindoprilate as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was carried out. All LDA models classified correctly 100% for active and inactive compounds. Our results showed 3D-Vpai models remarkably superior to others, and it provides a powerful alternative to other more common 3D-QSAR descriptors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phase composition of reaction products was discussed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and microstructure of the calcined powders and final products was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. The results show that the synthesizing temperature of (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N) powders was reduced greatly by the novel precursor method. Thus, the preparation of (Ti, 15W, 5Mo, 0.2V)(C, N) is at only 1200 degrees C for 2 h. The lowering of synthesizing temperature is mainly due to the homogeneous chemical composition of the complex oxide-carbon mixture and its unusual honeycombed structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray diffraction pattern indicates that a metallic beta-Co is generated after the heat-treating process.

We have identified 123 known natural CPPs from the literature and used them to construct 2 data sets, the training set with 25 CPPs and 16 non-CPPs and the test set with 61 CPPs and 21 non-CPPs. The auto cross covariances (ACCs) by describing each amino acid by principal properties (z-scales) and their main compounds were used to construct classifiers, respectively. The obtained models, using fisher's LDA, were only able to classify correctly 57.3% on test sets, whereas these models showed large classification rates on the training sets in training and cross-validation procedures. The classification rates using SVM tool were 100% (75.6%) and 85.4% (80.5%) on the training test in training (Loo-cross-validation), when 72 ACCs and their main components were used for classification. The best result for SVM classification on test set is 74.4% using 72 ACCs. These results validate that the SVM can extract the minor change in variables. The SVM's model is better than LDA model.

The method is based on the CL-emitting reaction between ninhydrin and potassium permanganate in hydrochloric acid medium, enhanced by formaldehyde (HCHO). The calibration curve is linear in the range of 0.002 to 10 mu g ml(-1) with r = 0.9995, and the limit of detection is 4.6 x 10(-4) mu g ml(-1). The relative standard deviation for replicate measurements is 1.5% for 4 mu g ml(-1) of formaldehyde. The chemical and flow injection variables were studied and optimized to make the procedure suitable for determination of formaldehyde in water. It is shown that the reverse flow injection analysis could greatly improve the sensitivity and precision for determination of formaldehyde. The procedure has been applied successfully to the determination of formaldehyde in leather wastewater, and the results were statistically compared with results determined by a standard method.

The oxygenation constants (KO(2)) of these complexes in MeOCH(2)CH(2)OMe solution were measured over the range of -5 to 25 degrees C, and the thermodynamic parameters (Delta H(0), Delta S(0)) for oxygenation were calculated based on these KO(2) values. The effects of different substituents on the Schiff base ligand with respect to the modulation of O(2)-binding capability were explored. The results indicate that the dioxygen affinities of the Co(II) complexes are much more enhanced by aza-crown pendants than that by morpholino pendants, and the O(2)-binding capabilities of the aza-crown pendants complexes can also be enhanced by adding Na(+) cations.

Fretting wear behaviors of the coating and its substrate were comparatively tested without lubrication under varied displacement amplitudes (D) in a range of 3-40 mu m, constant normal load (F-n) of 300 N and frequency of 5 Hz. The results showed that the MAO coating, presenting rough and porous surface and high hardness, mainly consisted of rutile and anatase TiO2 phases. Compared with the substrate, the MAO coating could shift the mixed fretting regime (MFR) and slip regime (SR) to a direction of smaller displacement amplitude. In the partial slip regime (PSR), lower friction coefficients and slight damage appeared due to the coordination of elastic deformation of contact zones. In the MFR, the friction coefficient of the coating was lower than that of the substrate as a result of the prevention of plastic deformation by the hard ceramic surface. With the increase of the displacement amplitude, the degradation of the MAO coating and the substrate increased extremely. The fretting wear mechanisms of the coating were abrasive wear and delamination with some material transfer of specimen. In addition, the coating presented a better property for alleviating fretting wear.

So it is crucial to develop processes which can degrade these compounds effectively. The paper demonstrates that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 toward the decomposition of gaseous benzene in a batch reactor can be greatly enhanced by loading TiO2 onto the surface of CexZr1 O-x(2) (x >= 0.25) using sol-gel technology. This research investigated the relationship between x amount and the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, UV-vis diffuse reflectance and XPS analyses. The specific surface area of photocatalyst decreases as x decreases. XRD results reveal the no peaks of titania were detected. Among the five catalysts prepared, only the binding energy values of Ti2p(3/2) of TiO2/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 shift toward lower value. The order of photocatalytic activity is TiO2/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2>TiO2/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2>TiO2/CeO2 approximate to TiO2/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2>TiO2/ZrO2 approximate to TiO2.

Then, graft polymerization of MAA onto the esterified HAP particles surfaces was carried out by ultraviolet light (UV) initiation. The structure of the surface-esterified and grafted HAP was studied by ESCA, FTIR, Scanning Electron microscopy, laser particle sizes analyze, esterification, and graft degrees tests. The results show that poly(methyl acrylic acid) (PMAA) is successfully inserted onto HAP particles surfaces by covalent bond linkage. The esterification degree between MAA and HAP particles increases with reaction temperature and time, and tends to level off at about 6 h under 90 degrees C. The graft degree of MAA onto HAP particles with 1.14% esterification degree and its average particle sizes increase with UV initiation polymerization time, and to reach a maximum at 25 min under 40 degrees C, then decrease as irradiation time further increases. The surfaces of the grafted HAP particles become rough and loose. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For comparison, hydrolytic kinetics of PNPP was respectively investigated in the micellar solutions of three kinds of conventional single-chain cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants, i.e., hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), n-lauroylsarcosine sodium (LSS), and polyoxyethylene(23) lauryl ether (Brij35). Experimental results showed that the one complex with small Schiff base ligands exhibited better catalytic activity than the other one with bigger ligands towards the PNPP hydrolysis under comparable conditions, which testified that a relatively open catalytic site is essential for tuning the activities of the two mimic hydrolases. Moreover, compared effects of various micellar solutions demonstrated that Gemini 16-2-16 micellar solution is the best reaction medium relative to its single-chain analogs.

The crystal structures of DAFND and its analogue 4,5-diazafluorene-9-phenylhydrazone (DAFPD) were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction method. X-ray analyses reveal that DAFPD comprise of a nonplanar molecule and all atoms of DAFND are essentially coplanar. The color of DAFND changes from brown to blue when heated, so called thermochromism and the spectroscopic properties of the two compounds are investigated by electronic absorption spectra, showing DAFND possess solvatochromism, while DAFPD does not have thermochromic and solvatochromic properties.

J	Xiong, XZ; Hu, JH; Ling, X				Xiong, Xing-Zhong; Hu, Jian-Hao; Ling, Xiang			An efficient uplink transmission technique for IDMA based on time-reversal	AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						IDMA; TDR-IDMA; Multi-user detection; Time-reversal; Convergence	FIELDS	In this paper, we propose an efficient uplink transmission technique for interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) systems based on time-reversal (TR) technique (named as TDR-IDMA). In TDR-IDMA systems, the time-reversed version of the channel impulse responses (TR-CIR) obtained from the uplink is used to process the received signal preceding the elementary signal estimator (ESE) at the receiver. By exploiting the weak correlations of multi-paths for different users, the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) at the beginning of turbo-like detection of TDR-IDMA becomes significantly higher than that of the traditional IDMA. As a result, substantially less number of iterations is needed for the convergence in the proposed TDR-IDMA as compared with traditional IDMA. Our proposed technique effectively breaks the bottleneck of multi-user detection (MUD) in IDMA receiver, and the receiver's complexity is approximately independent of the number of the multi-path channels.

The first method is a GA with binary chromosome (GA-BC) and the other is a GA with a fixed-length character chromosome (GA-FCC). The overall prediction accuracy for the training set by means of 7-fold cross-validation was tested. All the regression models were evaluated by the test set. The poor prediction for the test set illustrates that the forward stepwise regression (FSR) model is easier to overfit for the training set. The results using SVR methods showed that the over-fitting could be overcome. Further, the over-fitting would be easier for the GA-BC-SVR method because too many variables fleetly induced into the model. The final optimal model was obtained with good predictive ability (R(2) = 0.885, S = 0.469, R(cv)(2) = 0.700, S(cv) = 0.757, R(ex)(2) = 0.692, S(ex) = 0.675) using GA-FCC-SVR method. Our investigation indicates the variable selection method using GA-FCC is the most appropriate for MLR and SVR methods.

J	Xiong, XZ; Hu, JH; Yang, F; Ling, X				Xiong, Xingzhong; Hu, Jianhao; Yang, Feng; Ling, Xiang			Analysis and performance of a hybrid multiple access scheme: IDMA/CDMA	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Wireless Systems - Computation, Assembling and Compatibility (CAC 2008)	DEC 10-13, 2008	Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		IDMA; CDMA; Multi-user detection; Hybrid multiple access	OFDM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce the analysis and performance of a hybrid multiple access scheme which combines interleave division multiple access (IDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA), referred to as IDMA/CDMA. With experimentations, the scheme can achieve good performance with simple user ends for the system. Design/methodology/approach - IDMA technique is employed as the uplink transmission and CDMA technique as the downlink transmission. The performance comparison of IDMA and IDMA/CDMA downlink is studied with Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the bit error rates. For IDMA/CDMA downlink, the signals are interleaved by random interleavers, spreaded by M-sequence and orthogonal Gold sequence, respectively, and then transmitted over an AWGN with BPSK modulation. Moreover, a channel estimation approach for IDMA based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is also presented. Findings - The multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm in uplink IDMA systems is much simpler than that used in traditional CDMA systems. It is also well known that the orthogonal spreading codes in CDMA can effectively help suppress the MM in the synchronized environments. But for the asynchronized application, the performance of CDMA systems will degrade due to the serious multiple user interference. According to traditional IDMA and orthogonal code division multiple access/IDMA signal detection algorithms, every UE has to detect all of the signals of other users for iterative detection. The advantages of IDMA and CDMA technologies can be utilized substantially. Originality/value - The proposed hybrid multiple access scheme can achieve a very simple chip-by-chip iterative MUD strategy at base station, and the simplified receiving operation at UE. On the other hand, this paper also evaluates channel estimation approach for IDMA based on EM algorithm.

Calculations were also carried out for the adsorption of Al and Cr atoms on the surface. The structural and electronic properties of bulk HfC were also determined. All of these calculations were based on first principles. We have dealt with the exchange and correlation potential for bulk HfC using the Perdew-Wang generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91) (1991). Furthermore, the local density approximation (LDA) was used for the adsorption energy calculations of Al and Cr atoms on the HfC (0 0 1) surface. For Al, Cr atoms on the surface, the adsorption energies confirm the preference for adsorption at the on-top C atoms sites. Moreover, compared with Al atoms, Cr atoms are more easily adsorbed on the HfC (0 0 1) surface. The Cr adatom-surface bonds are stronger than the Al adatom-surface bonds. The C-Al bonds are ionic while the C-Cr bonds present the covalent and metallic characteristics in nature. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalysed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of the structures of the complexes and reaction temperature on the rate of PNPP hydrolysis have been examined. All four complexes exhibit high catalytic activity and the rate increases with pH. In comparison with the crown-free analogues (MnL2Cl)-Cl-2 and CoL22, the crowned Schiff base complexes (MnL2Cl)-Cl-1 and CoL21 exhibit higher catalytic activity for promoting PNPP hydrolysis.

A semi-analytic approach for the nonlinear dynamic response of circular plates	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Circular plates; Nonlinear vibration; Differential quadrature method; Perturbation technique; Semi-analytical approach	FREE-VIBRATION ANALYSIS; DIFFERENTIAL QUADRATURE METHOD; LAMINATED PLATES; RECTANGULAR-PLATES; ELASTIC FOUNDATIONS; HDQ METHODS; THICKNESS; ACCURACY	This paper presents a new semi-analytic perturbation differential quadrature method for geometrically nonlinear vibration analysis of circular plates. The nonlinear governing equations are converted into a linear differential equation system by using Linstedt-Poincare perturbation method. The solutions of nonlinear dynamic response and the nonlinear free vibration are then sought through the use of differential quadrature approximation in space domain and analytical series expansion in time domain. The present method is validated against analytical results using elliptic function in several examples for both clamped and simply supported circular plates, showing that it has excellent accuracy and convergence. Compared with numerical methods involving iterative time integration, the present method does not suffer from error accumulation and is able to give very accurate results over a long time interval.

It has been found that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 toward the decomposition of gaseous benzene in a batch reactor can be greatly enhanced by loading TiO2 on the surface of Ce0.67Zr0.33O2. In this work, we have investigated the loading amount of TiO2 on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. This article reveals that the optimal loading amount of TiO2 on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 for the degradation of gaseous benzene is 1% (wt). The prepared photocatalyst was characterized by Brunauer-Emmet Teller, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The deposited titania was well dispersed in the Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 matrix. TiO2/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 absorbs much more ultraviolet light than TiO2 in the ultraviolet light region. The binding energy values of Ti2p shift to lower value. TiO2/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 demonstrates 1.5 times photocatalytic activity of that of pure TiO2. Based upon these observations., the mechanistic role of Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction has been suggested. The suggested mechanism is electrons transfer, increase of the surface coverage of active oxygen species, and increase of the absorption from 210 to 400 nm of TiO2/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2.

In this paper, we further extend this idea to the stationary Kerr black hole to discuss its entropy correction. To get the corrections correctly, the proportionality parameters of quantum corrections of action I (i) to the semiclassical action I (0) in this case are regarded as the inverse of the product of Planck Length and Planck Mass. The result shows that entropy corrections to the stationary black hole also include the logarithmic term and inverse area term in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy beyond semiclassical approximation.

V)(C, N)-Ni composite powders with globular-like particles of similar to 50-300nm were synthesized at static nitrogen pressure from oxides by a simple and cost-effective route which combines traditional low-energy milling plus carbothermal reduction-nitridation (CRN) techniques. Reaction path of the (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N)-Ni system was discussed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and microstructure of the milled powders and final products was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. The results show that CRN reaction has been enhanced by nano-TiO(2) and nano-carbon powders. Thus, the preparation of (Ti, 15W, 5Mo, 0.2V)(C, N)-20Ni is at only 1300 degrees C for I h. During synthesizing reaction, Ni solid solution phase forms at about 700 degrees C and reduction-carbonization of WO(2) and MoO(2) occurs below 900 degrees C. The reactions of TiO(2) -> Ti(3)O(5), Ti(3)O(5) -> Ti(C, O) and Ti(C, O) -> Ti(C, N) take place at about 930 degrees C, 1203 degrees C and 1244 degrees C, respectively (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of main technological parameters was investigated by X-ray diffraction, and microstructure of the milled powders and reaction products was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the phase evolution of TiO(2) follows TiO(2) --> Ti(3)O(5) --> Ti(C, N), and (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N)-Ni composite powders with higher nitrogen content and smaller crystalline size can be produced by introducing high nitrogen pressure. By contrast with high nitrogen pressure, high synthesizing temperature and long isothermal time can contribute to dissolution of W, Mo and V atoms into Ti(C, N). In addition, synthesizing temperature has a significant effect on the microstructure evolution of (Ti, W, Mo, V)(C, N)-Ni composite powders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using Alber's inequalities, Nalder's results and the new proximal mapping technique, we also construct two new class of perturbed iterative algorithms with mixed errors for solving a new class of nonlinear set-valued relaxed cocoercive operator inclusions and study applications of general A-monotone operators to the approximation-solvability of the nonlinear set-valued relaxed cocoercive operator inclusion problems in Banach spaces. Furthermore, the general A-monotone operators are illustrated by some examples. The results presented in this paper improve and generalize the corresponding results on strongly monotone quasi-variational inclusions and nonlinear implicit quasi-variational inclusions.

The prepared photocatalyst was characterized by BET, XRD, and XPS analyses. XRD results reveal that the peaks of titania in either rutile or anatase form are not detected by XRD in the 2 theta region from 20A degrees to 50A degrees. The binding energy values of Ti 2p of pure TiO2 are 458.90 and 464.60 eV, while for TiO2/SrAl2O4: Eu2+, Dy3+, the binding energy values of Ti 2p are 458.50 and 464.20 eV. The results indicate that the optimum loading of TiO2 is 1 wt% and TiO2/SrAl2O4: Eu2+, Dy3+ (1 wt%) demonstrates 1.4 times the photocatalytic activity of that of pure TiO2, but the underlying mechanism of SrAl2O4: Eu2+, Dy3+ in the photocatalytic reaction remains to be unraveled.

We derive a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation governing the dust-acoustic solitary waves by using the reductive perturbation method.

Sufficient conditions for exponential stability criteria are developed for arbitrary switching signal with average dwell time. The results are obtained based on Lyapunov's stability analysis via Krasovsky-Lyapunov's functionals and the related stability study is performed to obtain delay-dependent results. It is proved that the stabilizing switching rule is arbitrary if all the switched subsystems are exponentially stabile. These conditions are delay-dependent and are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Some examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of the result. (C) 2009 IMACS.

The aim is to design an asymptotically stable fuzzy filter ensuring asymptotical stability and prescribed H-infinity performance of the filtering error system for all admissible uncertainties. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the Barbalat lemma and the LMI approach, delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are proposed in terms of LMIs, and an explicit expression of the desired H-infinity fuzzy filter is readily given when these LMIs are feasible. Finally, the H-infinity filter design problem for a neutral-type nonlinear distributed network (long line with tunnel diode) is considered in the simulation example to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

So it is crucial to develop processes which can destroy these compounds effectively. It has been found that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 towards the decomposition of gaseous benzene can be greatly enhanced by loading Pd on the surface of TiO2. The results show that the optimum palladium loading is 0.25 wt.% The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, UV-vis diffuse reflectance and XPS. XRD results indicate that no peaks of Pd are detected in the 2(theta) region from 10 degrees to 90 degrees. Pd/TiO2 absorbs much more light than TiO2 in the visible light region. The XPS spectrum shows that there are Ti, O, C and Pd elements on the surface of the Pd/TiO2, the binding energy values of Ti2p of 0.25%Pd/TiO2 transfer to a lower value. In addition, the photocatalytic performance of 0.25%Pd/TiO2 was investigated, the result illustrates that 0.25%Pd/TiO2 demonstrates 2.32 times the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO2. The reason of promotion of photocatalytic performance was discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Peng, JS; Yang, J; Yuan, YQ; Luo, GB				Peng, Jian-she; Yang, Jie; Yuan, Yu-quan; Luo, Guang-bing			A convolution-type semi-analytic DQ approach to transient response of rectangular plates	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						convolution; transient response; differential quadrature method; semi-analytical method	DIFFERENTIAL QUADRATURE; VIBRATION ANALYSIS	The convolution-type Gurtin variational principle is known as the only variational principle that is, from the mathematics point of view, totally equivalent to the initial value problem system. In this paper, the equation of motion of rectangular thin plates is first transformed to a new governing equation containing initial conditions by using a convolution method. A convolution-type semi-analytical DQ approach, which involves differential quadrature (DQ) approximation in the space domain and an analytical series expansion in the time domain, is proposed to obtain the transient response solution. This approach offers the same advantages as the Gurtin variational principle and, at the same time, is much simpler in calculation. Numerical results show that it is very accurate yet computationally efficient for the dynamic response of plates.

The effect of different micelles and their complex structures on the catalytic hydrolysis of PNPP is discussed in detail. The observations showed that MnL(2)(2)Cl exhibited higher catalytic activity over MnL(2)(1)Cl under a comparable condition, which confirmed that an open active centre is essential for modulating the activities of the two enzyme mimics. Moreover, under the conditions employed, hydrolytic rates of PNPP induced by these Mn(III) complexes were faster in Gemini 16-2-16 micelles than that in the micellar solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), a conventional analogue of Gemini 16-2-16.

The relationship between the metric and the correlation fringes representation is examined and the generalized metric is defined. The theoretical analysis of traditional algorithms for correlation fringes indicates that all of them can be regarded as the generalized metrics. In addition, the generalized metric for correlation fringes is applied in developing a new algorithm. A novel generalized metric for correlation fringes based on cross entropy is presented and is proved by theoretical derivation and experimental verification. All the investigations show that it is reasonable and valid to define the generalized metric for correlation fringes in digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI). The fringes obtained by cross-entropy metric can be used to represent the same desired information by subtracting. There are different vector function structures among the generalized metrics, which directly influence the quality of fringes and the difficulty in post-processing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of PNPP hydrolysis have been examined. All four complexes exhibit high catalytic activity and the rate increases with pH. The complexes of ligands containing a crown ether group exhibit higher catalytic activities than the non-crown analogs, and the catalytic activity of the phenyl-bridged Schiff base complex is larger than that of ethyl-bridged analogue for the same substituents and metal.

In addition, the orbital interaction analysis of C-C double bond activation is carried out by fragment molecular orbital method. The results indicate that the orbital interaction mode of the C-C bond activation by the "early" transition metal oxide ion VO2+ is characteristic. as is compared with the DCD model and the CrO2+ + C2H4 system.

We consider not only the quantum corrections in the single particle action revealing that these are proportional to the usual semiclassical contribution but also the quantum effects of space time arising from the change of energy of probe particles moving in it. The result shows that as the high order terms with respect to a" of the action is considered, the first and second corrections, namely the logarithmic term and the inverse area term respectively, are produced. This result is consistent with that of loop quantum gravity and other entropy correction theories.

Circular dichroism, AFM and cell 3D culture were used to study the objective model, D-EAK16. The result reveal that a stable secondary structure of D-EAK16 is beta-sheet at 30 degrees C. D-EAK16 can form transparent hydrogel with 99% water content, which can self-assemble to nanofibers and to the scaffold in physiological solution such as PBS and DMEM. Toxicity of the ECM (extracellular matrices) was not found when cultured the cell stains HO-8910 and SPC-A-1 in the solution of D-EAK16. Moreover, there is no significant difference to toxicity between the nano-scaffolds made of D or L amino acid. We hope these synthetic peptides can be as a 3D microenvironment of the cells (just similar to the bodies), widely use in the biomedical engineering.

With the internal noise switched on, the center of the main peak in the PSD (power spectrum density) was modified by internal noise. With increasing of the cell volume, the calculated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) undergoes a maximum, which is referred in the present work as explicit bursting stochastic resonance. In addition, another quantity, the correlation time is used to measure the coherence of bursting oscillations. We demonstrate that the correlation time of the oscillations also exhibits a maximum at a certain cell volume. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalysed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have been also examined. The rate increases with pH of the buffer solution; all four complexes exhibited high activity in the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis. Compared with their crown-free analogues, the crowned Schiff base complexes exhibit higher catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of a phenyl-bridged Schiff base complex is larger than that of an ethyl-bridged Schiff base complex under the same substitute groups and metal ion.

Effects of TiO2 dosage, pH, initial BBP concentration and co-existing substances on the degradation of BBP by TiO2/UV process were investigated. The optimal TiO2 dosage and pH value for the BBP degradation were 2.0 g L-1 and 7.0, respectively. The degradation rate of BBP by TiO2/UV process could be fitted pseudo-first-order kinetics. The effects of co-existing substances on the degradation rate of BBP revealed that some anions (such as BrO3-, ClO4- and Cr2O72-) could enhance BBP degradation, and other anions would restrain BBP degradation. The sequence of inhibition was PO43- > CO32- > NO3- > SO42- > Cl-. The cations K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ had the restrained effect on the BBP degradation, and the effect of Ca2+ was the strongest among four cations tested. The organic compounds acetone and methanol decreased the degradation rate of BBR The major intermediates of BBP degradation were identified as mono-butyl phthalate, mono-benzyl phthalate and phthalic acid, and a primary degradation mechanism was proposed.

Effects of pH, persulfate concentration, ionic strength, temperature and catalytic ions Fe(3+) and Ag(+) on the degradation efficiency of DPA by persulfate are examined in batch experiments. The degradation of DPA by persulfate is found to follow the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Increasing the reaction temperature or persulfate concentration may significantly accelerate the DPA degradation. Fe(3+) and Ag(+) ions can enhance the degradation of DPA, and Ag(+) ion is more efficient than Fe(3+) ion. However, the increase of either the pH value or ionic strength will decrease the rate of DPA degradation. N-Phenyl-4-quinoneimine, N-carboxyl-4-quinoneimine, 4-quinoneimine and oxalic acid are identified as the major intermediates of DPA degradation, and a primary pathway for the degradation of DPA is proposed. The degradation of DPA in surface water, groundwater and seawater is also tested by persulfate, and more than 90% of DPA can be degraded at room temperature in 45 min at an initial concentration of 20 mg L(-1).

The characteristics of surface charge, current, electric force, magnetic force and electromagnetic force are studied. The results show that the electric force is tension and magnetic force is press. The surface density of electromagnetic force on the wall can be calculated by the difference between magnetic and electric energy density there. For TE wave, the electromagnetic force distribution on the walls may be either tension or pressure in general. However, the electromagnetic force is always pressure for TM wave.

The calculations were performed Using the ab initio pseudopotential method, in which we employed the Perdew-Wang form of the generalized gradient approximation (GCA) together with plane wave basis sets for expanding the periodic electron density. The states at the Fermi level are mainly Composed of Al-3s, Al-3p and O-2p orbital, which demonstrate the hybridization between Al and O atoms in alpha alumina. Our results show that there exists covalence besides ionicity in alumina. The covalence results in the delocalization of the electrons. The delocalization improved as the pressure contributes to the toughness of alumina. According to the quotient of bulk of shear modulus, we know alpha alumina is brittle in nature at ambient conditions. But the quotient exhibits the increasing tendency with pressure. At 100 GPa, the ratio is up to 2.0 which is larger than the critical value 1.75. We find that it is possible to improve the toughness of alpha alumina at high pressure (100 GPa). Understand the influence of pressure on the alpha-Al2O3 electronic structure and the toughness. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that both catalysts enhance the hydrolysis of PNPP by over two orders of magnitude relative to the spontaneous rate at 25 A degrees C. Moreover, Mn(III)-promoted hydrolysis of PNPP was faster in LSS micellar solution than in both Brij35 micellar solution and pure buffer.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study topographic characteristics of the films, including crystalline feature, grain size, clustering and roughening. The amorphous-like microstructure feature has been observed at 100-150 W and the transition of crystal microstructure from amorphous-like to crystalline state occurs at 200 W. The increase in grain size of Ti films with the sputtering power (from 200 to 300 W) has been confirmed by AFM characterization. In addition, higher sputtering power (300 W) leads to the transformation of crystal texture from globular-like to hexagonal type. The study has shown that higher sputtering power results in the non-linear increase in deposition rate of Ti films. Good correlativity between the surface roughness parameters including root mean square (RMS) roughness, surface mean height (Ra) and maximum peak to valley height (P-V) for evaluating the lateral feature of the films has been manifested. Surface roughness has an increasing trend at 100-250 W, and then drops up to 300 W. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The kinetic mathematical model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes was proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have been also examined. The results showed that the rate increases with pH of the buffer solution and four complexes exhibited high activity in the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis. Compared with the crown-free analogy CoL(2)(2) and MnL(2)(2)Cl, the crowned Schiff base complexes (CoL(2)(1), MnL(2)(1)Cl) exhibit higher catalytic activity. The pseudo-first-order-rate (k(obs)) for the PNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by the complex MnL(2)(1)Cl containing benzo-10-aza-crown ether is 923-fold higher than that of hydrolysis of PNPP at pH=7.00, 25 degrees C,[S]=2.0 X 10(-4) mol center dot dm(-3).

AP site-containing DNA is designed in a way that only the nucleotide opposite the AP site is variable to allow for coexistence of an unpaired nucleotide and a number of DNA base pairs. The surface of a gold electrode was modified by AP site-containing DNA duplex on which Ag(+) binding specificity was evaluated. Electrochemical investigations on the AP-DNA-modified electrodes reveal that Ag(+) preferentially associates to the unpaired nucleotides instead of the coexisted base pairs and shows sequence-dependant binding, especially stronger for purines than for pyrimidines. Additionally, the hydrogen bond pattern moieties of the unpaired nucleotides should be involved in Ag(+) binding evidenced by a decrease of the redox signal when introducing a ligand with its hydrogen bond moiety complementary to the nucleotide deoxycytidine. This is the first attempt to make a comparison in one DNA molecule for metal ion binding to coexisted unpaired nucleotide and DNA base pairs. The present method demonstrates an easy way for investigating binding specificity of heavy metal ions to AP site in the presence of coexisted DNA base pairs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By establishing an intergro-differential inequality, applying M-matrix theory and inequality technique, several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of an equilibrium point for impulsive FCNNs with mixed delays and diffusion. In particular, the estimate of the exponential convergence rate is also provided, which depends on the system parameters and impulses. These results generalize and improve the earlier publications.

The kinetics and the mechanism on PNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by these complexes were investigated. The kinetic mathematical model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes was proposed. The relative kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were determined. The effects of complexes structure and reactive temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have been also examined. The results showed that the rate for the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis was increased following the increase of pH of the buffered CTAB micellar solution; four complexes can efficiently accelerate the catalytic cleavage of PNPP in the buffered CTAB micellar solution. Compared with the crown-free analogous [image omitted] and [image omitted], the crowned Schiff base complexes [image omitted] exhibit more high catalytic activity for promoting PNPP hydrolysis.

Additionally, the addition of diethylenetriamine (DETA) resulted in a 1.22.7 folds higher rate enhancement in contrast with 1,2-Ethylenediamine (EDA).

Its electrochemical properties including the activation property, maximum discharge capacity and high rate discharge ability were evaluated after annealed at 1173K and 1573K by model cell and cycling voltammetry. The results show that after annealing, the diffraction intensities for TiNi in the alloy are weaken with the structure distribution of the alloy being more even and the grains of the alloy being bigger. The charge and discharge cycling stability and the high rate discharge of the alloys are improved by annealing. The maximum discharging capacity of the annealed alloy is not lower than that of the as-east alloy (350mAh/g), while their cycling stability is improved markedly. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient of the alloy is increased as the annealing temperature increasing.

For a class of these equations, an important feature is that the minimal positive solution can be obtained by computing the minimal positive solution of a couple of fixed-point equations with vector form. Based on the fixed-point vector equations, we introduce a new algorithm, namely, two-step relaxation Newton, derived by combining two different relaxation Newton methods to compute the minimal positive solution. The monotone convergence of the solution sequence generated by this new algorithm is established. Numerical results are given to show the advantages of the new algorithm for the nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations in vector form. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Wu and C. Huang.

The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl picolinate (PNPP) as promoted by this complex was investigated by the UV-vis method, the results showing that MR acts as a very efficient catalyst. The specific absorption spectra of the hydrolytic reaction systems indicated that the key intermediate, made up of PNPP and MR was formed during reaction. Based on these spectra, a mechanism for the catalytic hydrolysis of PNPP has been proposed and a kinetic mathematical model established.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalysed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of PNPP hydrolysis have been examined. All four complexes exhibit high catalytic activity and the rate increases with pH. The complexes of ligands containing a crown ether group exhibit higher catalytic activities than the non-crown analogue; the catalytic activity of the complexes follows the order Mn(III)>Co(II) (MnL(1)Cl>CoL(1)) with the same ligands.

A (2 + 1) Kadomtsev-Perviashvili (KP) equation and a (3 + 1) KP equation are derived by using the reductive perturbation method, respectively. Results shows that in the presence of the higher order transverse perturbations, the peak amplitude of the solitary waves may decrease, whereas their width increases as compared to the one-dimensional case. Meanwhile, not only compressive but also rarefactive solitary waves can coexist in this system. Furthermore, the nonthermally distributed ions have significant influence on the normalized dust charge.

Single-point UCCSD(T) energy calculations were carried out for each stationary point. The object of this investigation was the elucidation of the reaction mechanism. The result shows that the reaction mechanism between yttrium ion and CS2 is an insertion-elimination mechanism. Intersystem crossing may occur in the reaction of Y+ with CS2 and a minimum energy crossing point has been found. All theoretical results are in line with early experiments.

The method is based on the reaction of Cr(VI) with sodium diphenylamine sulfonate (DPH) in acidic medium to form a purple complex (lambda(max) = 550 nm). Under the optimized conditions, the calibration curve is linear in the range 0.04-3.8 mu g m(-1) at a sampling rate of 30 h(-1). The detection limit of the method is 0.0217 mu g m l(-1), and the relative standard deviation is 1.1% for eight determinations of 2 mu g ml(-1) Cr(VI).

The oxygen uptake of Schiff base Co-II complexes in MeOCH2CH2OMe solution was determined at different temperatures, and the equilibrium constants (KO2) and thermodynamic parameters (Delta H-0, Delta S-0) for oxygenation were calculated. The corresponding Mn-III complexes, MnL Cl-1-MnL Cl-6, were employed to catalyze epoxidation of styrene at ambient temperature and pressures. The effects of crown ether on the modulation of O-2-binding capability and the catalytic oxidation of styrene are discussed. The results indicate that the dioxygen affinities of the Co-II complexes are much more enhanced by aza-crown pendant group than that by morpholino pendant group, and the O-2-binding capabilities of CoL1 -CoL3 with aza-crown pendant group can also be enhanced by adding alkali metal cations (Li+, Na+, and K+); similarly, the catalytic activities of the Mn-III complexes with aza-crown pendant group, MnL1 Cl-MnL Cl-3, are higher than those of the Mn-III complexes with morpholino pendant group, MnL4 Cl-MnL Cl-6.

Effect of low-frequency power on dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ENERGY-DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION; ION ENERGY; FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION; RF DISCHARGE; MODEL; SHEATH; CF4/AR	In low-pressure dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas driven with 60/13.56 MHz, the effect of low-frequency power on the plasma characteristics was investigated using a compensated Langmuir electrostatic probe. At lower pressures (about 10 mTorr), it was possible to control the plasma density and the ion bombardment energy independently. As the pressure increased, this independent control could not be achieved. As the low-frequency power increased for the fixed high-frequency power, the electron energy probability function (EEPF) changed from Druyvesteyn-like to Maxwellian-like at pressures of 50 mTorr and higher, along with a drop in electron temperature. The plasma parameters were calculated and compared with simulation results.	[Yuan, Q. H.; Xin, Y.; Huang, X. J.; Sun, K.; Ning, Z.

The calculated lattice parameters, bulk modulus. the first order pressure derivative of bulk modulus. and elastic constants are consistent with the experimental data and those calculated by others. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, Debye temperature and heat capacity under different temperatures and pressures were Successfully obtained. It is shown that when the temperature is constant, the Debye temperature increases almost linearly with applied pressures. while the heat capacity shows an opposite trend. The relative lattice parameters and relative Volume, the bulk modulus, thermal expansion versus temperature and pressure were also investigated.

Some quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) have been modeled by Vmedc for both 32 stereoisomers of perindoprilate as angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and 7 pairs of chiral N-alkylated 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-piperidines that bind or-receptors. Stepwise linear regression analysis was made forward to the 32 stereoisomers with good modeling results: R=0.913 (R(2)=0.834, SD=0.768, F=33.875); R(cv)=0.877 (R(cv)(2) =0.769, SD(cv)=0.906, F(cv)=22.473). Furthermore, average correlation coefficients (R) for random 60 groups with 23 training compounds for all the 32 ACE 0 stereoisomers by backpropagation neural network (BPNN) were R(tr)=0.931 (R(tr)(2)=0.967) and R(cv)=0.918 (R(cv)(2)=0.842), except for four groups sampled unreasonably. Compared with literatures, Vmedc has also been applied to obtain good results for 14 samples with correlation coefficient being R(cv)=0.955 (R(cv)(2) = 0.849). Through both Fisher' linear discriminant analysis and BPNN, the 32 ACE stereoisomers were classified correctly into 88.89% active with one (#9) wrongly classified, 100.00% nonactive with no wrongly classified, and average classification of 96.87% globally. Good results obtained here were compared to those obtained with other chiral descriptors, when it was applied to the same 2 datasets, which shows that the Vmedc approach provides a powerful alternative QSAR technique for chiral compounds.

Control of the discharge chemistry of CHF(3) in dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							CYCLOTRON-RESONANCE PLASMA; FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION	The discharge chemistry of CHF(3) in 27/2, 60/2, and 60/13.56 MHz dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas (DF-CCPs) is studied with actinometric optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The frequency effect on the generation of reactive species was investigated. The reactive radicals and the density ratio of F/CF(2) could be controlled by the 2 MHz rf power in 27/2 and 60/2 MHz DF-CCPs. The density ratios of F/CF(2) in 27/2 and 60/2 MHz DF-CCPs are observed to increase with an increase in low-frequency power. However, this control could not be obtained in 60/13.56 MHz DF-CCP.

In this study, two groups of samples were prepared at three different sputtering time within 12s using radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering and characterized by atomic force microscopy. Good nucleation uniformity has been obtained on the unabraded mica substrates due to the statistical distribution of nucleation sites. Especially, we have already observed an interesting unusual nucleation phenomenon, the island-rim structure on the abraded mica substrates after 4 s, where the island is fractal-like and the rim around the island was only occupied by few grains for nucleation. These ramified islands were located at the wide grooves introduced as predominate nucleation sites. The island-rim structure formed in initial nucleation process is closely associated with x, y velocity components of surface atoms and the distribution of active sites (related intimately to the surface free energy sigma and strain energy epsilon) for nucleation. With the increasing of the sputtering time, voids and overlarge grains have been observed in the island-rim region after the sputtering time of 8s and 12s, respectively.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have been also examined. The rate increases with pH of the buffer solution; all four complexes exhibited high activity in the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis. Compared with the crown-free analogues MnL(2)(2)Cl and CoL(2)(2), the crowned Schiff base complexes (MnL(2)(1)Cl, CoL(2)(1)) exhibit higher catalytic activity. The pseudo-first-order-rate (k(obs) ) for the PNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by the complex MnL(2)(1) Cl containing benzo-10-aza-crown ether is 1.06 x 10(3) times that of spontaneous hydrolysis of PNPP at pH = 7.00, 25 degrees C, [S] = 2.0 x 10(-4) mol dm(-3).

For an isolated calcium system, the internal noise can induce stochastic oscillations for a steady state close to the Hopf-bifurcation point, and the regularity of those stochastic oscillations depends resonantly on the system size, exhibiting system-size resonance. For the coupled system consisting of two subsystems, the system-size resonance effect observed in the subsystem subject to coupling is significantly amplified due to the nontrivial effects of coupling.

Effects of various reaction conditions on the hydrolysis of BNPP were systematically investigated. The observations obtained indicate that the two Mn(III) catalysts can efficiently promote hydrolysis of BNPP with a six order of magnitude rate enhancement relative to the background rate constant (k(0)). Different structures of the two complexes lend to their distinguishing activities each other. Furthermore, rates of BNPP hydrolysis in Gemini 16-6-16 micellar medium are much higher than that in hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and n-lauroylsarcosine sodium (LSS) micelles.

It has been generally agreed that methyl orange (MO) can be effectively degraded in aerated K(2)S(2)O(8) homogeneous reaction system using near-UV irradiation. In this paper photocatalytic degradation of MO solutions with K(2)S(2)O(8) was investigated, with particular attention on the possible underlying mechanisms. This report has shown decolorization efficiency of MO increases with the increasing of the dosage of the catalyst. There is no optimal amount of catalyst in our case, where special attention was paid on the nature of the photocatalyst itself. The current research revealed that the decolorization reaction is a pseudo first-order reaction when the concentration of MO is below 20 mg L(-1) and the decolorization reaction is zero-order reaction when the concentration of MO is above 100 mg L(-1), but the Langmuir-Hinshewood kinetic model does not describe this. The influence of IO(4)(-), BrO(3)(-) and H(2)O(2) were investigated in detailed. Several observations indicate that the mechanism is not involved in hydroxyl radical attacks in MO degradation with K(2)S(2)O(8) by UV irradiation. The possible underlying mechanisms are direct oxidation of the MO by S(2)O(8)(2-) and hydrogen attraction by SO(4)(center dot-).

It has been generally agreed that reactive orange 5 (KGN) can be effectively degraded in aerated phosphotungstic acid (HPA) homogeneous reaction system using near-UV irradiation. The knowledge on the kinetics of the system possesses both practical and theoretical values. The results reveal that the photocatalytic degradation reaction of KGN with HPA in a homogenous solution can be described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation; the results manifest the reaction is first-order with lower concentration and is zero-order with higher concentration. As the initial concentration goes up, the order of the reaction is reduced from 1 to 0, the limiting rate constant and the adsorption constant in this case are0.8098 mg L(-1) min(-1) and 4.359 x 10(-2) L mg(-1), respectively. The paper reveals that the optimal amount of photocatalyst in our experimental conditions for the degradation of KGN is 0.6 g L(-1). The effects of irradiation intensity and pH value on the degradation rate constant were also demonstrated, where special attention was paid on the nature of the photocatalyst itself.

So it is crucial to develop processes which can destroy these dyes effectively. It has been generally agreed that reactive orange 5 (KGN) can be effectively degraded in aerated phosphotungstic acid (HPA) in a homogeneous reaction system using near-UV irradiation. In this paper, photocatalytic degradation of reactive orange 5 solutions with phosphotungstic acid was investigated, especially more attention was paid to the kinetic model and the anion degradation products. The results revealed that the photocatalytic degradation reaction of KGN with HPA in a homogenous solution can be described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation and Langmuir-Hinshewood kinetic model described it well. The reaction manifested the first order with lower concentration(<= 30 mg L(-1)) with the limiting rate constant and the adsorption constant in this case being 0.8098 mg L(-1) min(-1) and 4.359 10(-2) L mg(-1), respectively. The degradation mechanism of KGN with HPA is different from that with TiO(2), the anion products of the two reaction systems are the same. The difference in degradation mechanism of KGN with HPA from that with TiO(2) is caused by the nature of the photocatalyst.

By the iterative method, the solvability of the equation A X B = C over skew-symmetric matrix can be determined automatically. When the equation A X B = C is consistent over skew-symmetric matrix X, for any skew-symmetric initial iterative matrix X(1), the skew-symmetric solution can be obtained within finite iterative steps in the absence of roundoff errors. The unique least-norm skew-symmetric iterative solution of A X B=C can be derived when an appropriate initial iterative matrix is chosen. A sufficient and necessary condition for whether the equation AXB = C is inconsistent is given. Furthermore, the optimal approximate solution of A X B = C for a given matrix X(0) can be derived by finding the least-norm skew-symmetric solution of a new corresponding matrix equation AXB = C. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate that our iterative method is effective. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Various deposition charges were employed to achieve different coating thickness. The capacitive characteristics of the as-grown MnO2 coatings were evaluated in various neutral alkali metal chloride solutions by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. The as-grown MnO2 coatings exhibited a capacitance of 275 F g(-1) in a 0.5 M KCl solution. Dependence of coating thickness and electrolytes on the capacitive properties of MnO2 coatings was demonstrated. The relationship of C,, with the deposition charge exhibits linearity in the range of 4.0 C cm(-2), and there is a peak at around 4.5 C cm(-2), however, the value of C,, keeps diminished. With the increase of the discharge current density, more rapid decrease of the specific capacitance was found when measured in the electrolyte with larger hydrated alkali metal cation in the order of Li+ > Na+ > K+. This was especially noted for thicker MnO2 coatings. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The SnOx coatings grown on graphite were characterized as typical capacitive behaviors by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometric (CP) in 0.5 M KCl. Specific capacitance (in millifarad per square centimeter, C-a)changes linearly with the deposition charge up to 4.5 C cm(-2), and a maximum of as high as 355 mF cm(-2) was obtained with the SnOx coating grown at around 5 C cm(-2). For the SnOx coating deposited at 0.2 C cm(-2), a maximum specific capacitance (in farad per gram, C.) of 298 and 125 F g(-1) was achieved from CVs at a scan rate of 10, and 200 mV s(-1), respectively. The value of C,, significantly gets lower from 265 to around 95 F g(-1) when the deposition charge increases from 0.2 to around 6.0 C cm(-2). The long cycle-life and stability of the SnOx coatings on graphite via the presented cathodic deposition were also demonstrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A macro-cyclic ligand and the corresponding Cu (II) and Ni (II) complexes were synthesized and characterized. The metallomicelles made up of macrocyclic divalent metal complex and micelle, as mimic hydrolytic metalloenzyme, was used in BNPP catalytic hydrolysis. The metallomicelles displayed higher catalytic activity although they do not attain the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. The analysis of specific absorption spectra showed that the course of the BNPP catalytic reaction was different from that of the BNPP spontaneous hydrolysis, and was an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. Based on the analytic result of the specific absorption spectrum, an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism of BNPP catalytic hydrolysis was proposed and a correlative kinetic mathematical model was established, and the corresponding thermodynamic and kinetic constant was calculated. The result of this study proved validity of the mechanism and mathematical model proposed in the article.

The as-grown coatings were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses, and thus verified to be largely amorphous manganese oxide. The coatings behave typically capacitive in various neutral aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts, e.g., 0.5 M LiCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.5 M KCl. The capacitance per geometric electrode surface area (C-a) from cyclic voltammetry in 0.5 M NaCl increased to 67.2 mF/cm(2) when the conversion time was up to 120 min, obeying the logarithm law very well. In addition, the capacitance per mass of the coating (C-m) of 362, 385, 380, and 374 F g(-1) was achieved with the manganese coatings grown for 10, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated evident differences in capacitive behaviors of the coatings in the three above-mentioned electrolyte solutions. It was confirmed that this facile conversion of the surface layers of graphite offers a simple and efficient formation of thin-film supercapacitors promising for industrial applications.

The oxidation of p-xylene to p-toluic acid with air at 120 degrees C under normal atmospheric pressure occurred efficiently in the presence of aza-crown ether substituted unsymmetrical Schiff base Mn(III) complexes. Significant selectivity (up to 90%) and conversion levels (up to 40%) were obtained. The effect of the aza-crown ring appended in Mn(III) Schiff base complexes on the oxidation of p-xylene were also investigated by comparison with the morpholino group pendant analogues. The addition of alkali metal ions accelerates the rate of conversion of p-xylene to p-toluic acid.

The results show that a small quantity of SDBS could make the open circuit and active potential more positive, polar resistance bigger, the bubbling of hydrogen on the surface of electrode was. restrained, resulting in the performance of discharge at high current density was improved. In studied concentration range of SDBS, there was an "anti-S" shape rule between the concentration and the inhibiting ability to AZ31 alloy. When the concentration was less than 0.1 mmol/L, the inhibiting ability gradually enhanced; when between 0.1 similar to 0.2 mmol/L, the inhibiting ability reduced; when more than 0.2 mmol/L, the ability increased again. The phenomenon could be attributed to the nonsynchronous change between the resistance of relaxation process of adsorbed species on the electrode surface and the resistance of charge transfer. The current efficiency of discharge at 50 mA/cm(2) was bigger than 73%, which implied the actual utilization of AZ31 alloy in metal fuel cells.

In this study, a group of samples were prepared at nine different sputtering times within 20s using radio-frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Only globular-like grains were formed on mica substrates within 6s, whose average grain size is similar to 21-44 nm. Meanwhile, few grains with larger size are subject to settle at the defect sites of mica substrates. At 8s, we found large columnar crystallites with the average grain size of 61 nm. From 10 to 14s, islands grew continuously and coalesced in order to form an interconnected structure containing irregular channels or grooves, with a depth of similar to 3.5-5 nm. Up to 16s, a nearly continuous film was formed and some new globular-like grains were again present on the film. Study of the AFM image at 20s suggests that the watercolor masking method designed by us is an effective method, by which we can prepare thin films with steps for the measurement of the thickness of continuous thin films. It is also found that the coverage rate of films increases with the increase in sputtering time (from 2 to 16s). On the other hand, the increase in root mean square (RMS) roughness is much more significant from 6 to 10s, and there is a maximum value, 2.81 nm at 10s due to more islands during deposition. However, RMS roughness decreases with the decrease in length and width of channels or grooves from 10 to 16s. Especially, a lower RMS roughness of 0.73 nm occurs at 16s, because of the continuous film produced with a large coverage rate of 98.43%.

The catalytic activities toward toluene combustion were investigated in a micro-reactor. The results demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Pt/gamma-Al2O3/Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 monolithic catalyst can be greatly improved by doping metal into Ce0.50Zr0.50O2. When doping Y and Mn into Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 simultaneously, the catalyst Pt/gamma-Al2O3/Ce0.40Zr0.40Y0.10Mn0.10Ox shows the highest activity. The T-10 (the temperature of 10% toluene conversion) and the complete conversion temperature (the temperature of 90% toluene conversion) of toluene are 443 and 489 K, respectively. Gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) results show that the prepared catalyst can be applied in a wide range of GHSV (from 12,000 to 20,000 h(-1)). The catalyst prepared shows great potential for practical application. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reproducibility was satisfactory with a relative standard deviation of 1.7% for ten determinations of 50 mu g 1(-1) Al(III). With a sample solution of 450 mu l being injected, the sampling frequency is 60/h.

FT-IR and XPS analyses indicated rapid functionalization of the surface of the MWCNTs could be achieved by a less environmentally hazardous approach. Composite coatings of MWCNTs and polyaniline ( PANI) were grown in situ onto graphite electrodes in an acidified suspension of MWCNTs and aniline. The as-grown MWCNT/PANI composites were characterized by SEM, cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the composite coatings had a lower resistance and much improved mechanical integrity than the pure PANI ones. The capacitance per geometric electrode surface area ( F cm(-2)) of the composites increases linearly relative to the deposition charge, reaching as high as 3.6 F cm(-2), which can be compared favorably with the capacitance of 2.3 F cm(-2) of the pure PANI, and comparable to a capacitance of 3.5 F cm(-2) for the similar composite coating with the traditionally acid-treated carbon nanotubes. The advantage of the integrity of the MWCNTs after microwave exposure was used to improve the conductivity and the mechanical strength of the composite coatings, especially when an utmost thick coating was attempted for a high capacitance.

The exact analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation of the spin cluster system are derived and employed to study the geometric phase. An alternative expression of the geometric phase in each eigenstate is obtained. It is shown that the geometric phase is related to the external magnetic-field parameter theta (the angle between the magnetic field and the Z axis) and the effective coupling strength J(n). Based on the relation, how the geometric phase depends on the coupling strength J(n) in different reducible subspace is discussed.

Analysis in phase plane stands out the motion is non-linear oscillation. The phase orbit is determined then the oscillation period is expressed with elliptic integrations. Besides the intrinsic parameters in the system, the initial disturbing conditions affect the oscillation period, which readily demonstrates the non-linearity of oscillation. The characters of the period are discussed and the approximate computation is presented. Further, the threshold of control voltage under which the results can be still used for the capacitor with an inclined plate is achieved. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The experimental results reveal that a higher rate of acceleration (about 2016-fold) of HPNP cleavage promoted by the Zn(II)-biap complex has been observed in the 16-2-16 micellar solution in comparison with the background rate (k(0)) of HPNP spontaneous cleavage at 25 degrees C. Reaction rates of HPNP cleavage in CTAB micellar solutions are only about 40% of that in Gemini 16-2-16 micelles under comparable conditions. In addition, the cleavage rates of HPNP in Gemini micelles and in CTAB micelles are respectively 29.5 times and 12 times faster than that in aqueous buffer. Especially, a "sandwich absorptive mode" has been proposed to explain the acceleration of HPNP cleavage in a cationic micellar solution. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A modified KdV (mKdV) equation which describes the dust acoustic waves in this system is derived by the reductive perturbation method. The effects of dusty plasma parameters on the dust-acoustic solitary waves is studied theoretically. It is found that the soliton structures is determined by the dusty plasma parameters. Furthermore, the soliton only exists in certain regions where these parameters are specially chosen.

A kinetic mathematical model, applied to the calculation of the kinetic and thermodynamics parameters of PNPP catalytic hydrolysis, has been established on the foundation of the mechanism proposed. The result of the study shows that the two complexes have a good catalytic activity in PNPP catalytic hydrolysis, and the rate of the PNPP catalytic hydrolysis was increased with the increase of the pH values in the buffer solution and affected by the polarization effect of metal ion of the complexes.

A is an element of C-nxn is called anti-Hermitian R-symmetric if A* = -A and RAR = A. The presentation and some properties for an arbitrary anti-Hermitian R-symmetric matrix with R* = R and the relations between the eigenproblem for A and the corresponding eigenproblems for anti-Hermitian matrices are given. Then the solutions of Constrained Inverse Eigenproblem and Approximation Problem are essentially decomposed into the same kind subproblems for anti-Hermitian matrices in complex field with smaller dimensions. The explicit solutions for the later subproblems are arrived. The corresponding problems which are the formulations of Constrained Inverse Eigenproblem and Approximation Problem in complex field was first given, then the solutions of Constrained Inverse Eigenproblem and Approximation Problem with R* = R are derived.

By using the concept and properties of A-monotone mappings, and the resolvent operator technique associated with A-monotone mappings due to Verma, we construct a new iterative algorithm for solving this system of nonlinear multivalued variational inclusions associated with A-monotone mappings in Hilbert spaces. We also prove the existence of solutions for the nonlinear multivalued variational inclusions and the convergence of iterative sequences generated by the algorithm. Our results improve and generalize many known corresponding results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using an algebraic dynamics method, we solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation of the spin-cluster system and give an alternative expression for the nonadiabatic geometric phase or the Berry phase when the magnetic field rotates around the Z axis. Based on the exact analytical solutions, we show how the Berry phase depends on the external magnetic field parameters omega (the angular velocity of the rotating magnetic field) and theta (the angle between the magnetic field and the Z axis), and we discuss the changing diagram of the Berry phase of the system in the ground state.

In the presence of pH 4.6 HAc-NaAc buffer solution and surfactant polyethylene octyl phenyl ether (OP) medium, copper reacts with thiomichlersketone (TMK) to form a stable 1:4 complex. The complex Cu(II)-TMK-OP shows maximum absorbance at 500 nm with a molar absorptivity value of 5.7 x 10(4) l Mol(-1) Cru(-1). Beer's law is obeyed for copper concentrations in the range of 0-15 mu g/25 ml. The average recovery of copper is between 95.8 and 106%. The method has been applied for determination of trace copper in different water samples with satisfactory results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
