However, little is known about alterations of the nodal and edge efficiency in abnormal systems of MDD patients. We used two independent datasets and two different structural templates to investigate the alterations of the nodal and edge efficiency of whole-brain functional networks of MDD. Method: Forty-two MDD and forty-two age, education-matched controls were selected to investigate network efficiency abnormalities of the MDD patients' cortical and subcortical regions, as well as the disrupted functional connectivity between these regions, from the perspective of network topological architectures. In addition, another dataset, which included thirty MDD patients and thirty controls, was also investigated using the same method. Results: Results showed that MDD group demonstrated significant increase in the local efficiency, although not change of global efficiency. In addition, nodal efficiency was found to increase in affective processing regions (i.e., amygdale, thalamus, hippocampus), but decrease in cognitive control related regions, which included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. The edge efficiency was found to increase, involving both connectivity between thalamus and limbic system regions and connectivity between hippocampus and regions (i.e., amygdala, thalamus). More important, result was replicated within independent datasets for the first and different structural templates for another. Conclusions: Our results indicated that MDD was associated with disrupted functional connectivity networks between cognitive control and affective processing systems. The findings might shed light on the pathological mechanism of depression and provide potential biomarkers for clinic treatment of depression.

The GCMC calculations show that the amount of gases adsorbed increases gradually with the rise of pressures and tends to be gently adsorption equilibrium after high pressure as well as decreases step by step with the coverages from 3.125% to 50% or with moisture range from 0.84 to 23.57 mmol/g at room temperature and pressure up to 10 MPa. In mixed gases, we also found that CO2 preferentially adsorbs at importantly greater loadings than CH4 and N-2, whereas CH4 is more preferentially adsorbed than N-2 on HSMC. The presence of N-2 no significantly effect on CH4 and CO2 adsorption, particularly for CO2. Meanwhile, a trace amount of CH4 and/or CO2 in mixtures is easy to dissolve in H2O or to form CH4 or CO2 clathrates while a large number of N-2 molecules exist in containing moisture systems of HSMC.

J	Wu, SL				Wu, Shu-Lin			Towards essential improvement for the Parareal-TR and Parareal-Gauss4 algorithms	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Parareal; Trapezoidal rule; 4th-order Gauss RK method; Convergence analysis	TIME-PERIODIC PROBLEMS; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; DIFFUSION-EQUATIONS; PARALLEL; SYSTEMS; OSCILLATIONS	Parareal is an iterative algorithm and is characterized by two propagators g and F, which are respectively associated with large step size Delta T and small step size Delta t, where Delta T = J Delta t and J >= 2 is an integer. For symmetric positive definite (SPD) system u'(t) Au(t) = g(t) arising from semi-discretizing time-dependent PDEs, if we fix the g-propagator to the Backward-Euler method and choose for F some L-stable time-integrator it can be proven that the convergence factors of the corresponding parareal algorithms satisfy rho approximate to 1/3,for all J >= 2 and for all sigma (A) subset of [0, + infinity), where sigma(A) is the spectrum of the matrix A. However, this result does not hold when time-integrators that lack L-stability, such as the Trapezoidal rule and the 4th-order Gauss RK method, are chosen as the F-propagator. The parareal algorithms using these two methods for the F-propagator are denoted by Parareal-TR and Parareal-Gauss4. In this paper, we propose a strategy to let these two parareal algorithms possess such a uniform convergence property. The idea is to choose an L-stable propagator (F) over tilde and on each coarse time-interval [T-n, Tn+1 we perform first two steps of (F) over tilde, then followed by J-2 steps of F. Precisely, for the Trapezoidal rule we select the 2nd-order SDIRK method as the (F) over tilde -propagator, and for the 4th-order Gauss RK method we select the 4th-order Lobatto III-C method as the (F) over tilde -propagator. Numerical results are given to support our theoretical conclusions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the alternation of the reverse horns thickness, the amplitude of the acoustic pressure propagated in the structure changes, which results in growing energy focused in the edge and in the reverse horns tip when the characteristic length is equal to or less than a wavelength and the incident wave is compressed. There are two kinds of methods adopted to realize energy dissipation. On the one hand, sound-absorbing materials are added in incident direction in order to overcome the badness of the reverse horns absorption in high frequency and improve the overall high-frequency and low-frequency sound-absorption coefficients; on the other hand, adding mass and film in its tip could result in mechanical energy converting into heat energy due to the coupled vibration of mass and the film. Thus, the reverse horn with film in the tip could realize better sound absorption for low-frequency broadband. These excellent properties could have potential applications in the one-dimensional absorption wedge and for the control of acoustic wave.

Nanosilver/graphene (Ag/G) was added to the PU matrix to prepare Ag/G/PU nanocomposites. EDS, SEM and XRD are used for assaying the silver content and characterization of Ag/G. TEM, FT-IR, XRD and EDS were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites. The TEM results show that Ag/G belongs to sheet structures and is dispersed in a PU matrix. The SEM showed that the strong interfacial adhesion between the Ag/G and PU is indicated. FT-IR spectra analysis shows that the functional group of PU is free of obvious changes by adding a small amount of Ag/G in the PU matrix. XRD results showed that the main crystalline peak (26 degrees) of Ag/G became more apparent with increasing content of Ag/G, and EDS showed that the content of Ag increased with increasing content of Ag/G in the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites are improved with increasing content of Ag/G. Contact angle and AFM results showed that the hydrophobicity and surface roughness increased with increasing content of Ag/G. Moreover, the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites exhibit antibacterial activities toward Staphylococcus aureus as well as Escherichia coli and their antibacterial rates increase with increasing Ag/G. In addition, the electrical conductivity measurements showed that both surface and volume resistance of the Ag/G/PUs nanocomposites decreased as the amount of Ag/G increased.

The calculated equilibrium crystal parameters and normalized volume dependence of the resulting pressure agree with available experimental and theoretical results. Within the considered pressure range of 0-90GPa, the dependences of the bulk modulus, Young's modulus, and shear modulus on the crystal orientation for Pnnm-CN have been systematically studied. The results show that the Pnnm-CN exhibits a well-pronounced elastic anisotropy. The incompressibility is largest along the c-axis. For tension or compression loading, the Pnnm-CN is stiffest along [001] and the most obedient along [100] direction. On the basis of the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we have explored the Debye temperature, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, and Gruneisen parameters within the pressure range of 0-90 GPa and temperature range of 0-1600K.

Based on the detailed analysis of the losses in the converter, this paper firstly develops a model to theoretically calculate the efficiency of the converter. Then, the influences of temperature, switching frequency, duty cycle and material of switching device on the converter's efficiency are experimentally investigated. The analysis of the experimental results has shown that (1) The efficiency at the switching frequency of 15 kHz is about 2% higher than that of 25 kHz. (2) The efficiency at 25 degrees C is similar to that at 85 degrees C for the MOSFET SiC while the efficiency at 25 degrees C is 2% higher than that at 85 degrees C for the IGBT Si for both buck and boost modes. (3) In buck mode, when the duty cycles are decreasing from 66.7%, 50% to 3333%, the peak efficiencies are also decreasing from 97.6%, 94.5% to 90.3%, respectively. In boost mode, when the duty cycle is increasing from 33.33%, 50% to 75%, the peak efficiency is decreasing from 96.9%, 96.5% to 92.4%, respectively.

J	Hu, HJ; Sun, Z; Ou, ZW				Hu, Hong-J; Sun, Z.; Ou, Z-W			Influences of die channel angles on microstructures and wear behaviors of AZ61 wrought magnesium alloy fabricated by extrusion-shear process	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; AS-CAST; DEFORMATION; THIXOFORMABILITY; TUBES	Extrusion-shear (ES) process for magnesium alloy is a newly developed plastic deformation process, and ES process combines direct extrusion and two steps of ECAE (equal channel angular extrusion). To investigate the effects of the die channel angles on the microstructures and wear behaviors of AZ61 wrought magnesium alloy, the samples used in this study were fabricated by ES process with different die channel angles (120 degrees and 135 degrees). The microstructures of the samples were characterized by optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (SEM). The cumulative strains in the ES process were predicted by approaches of numerical simulation and theoretical calculation. To characterize the wear resistance of the samples, pin-on-disk tests under dry sliding conditions with various normal loads and reciprocating frequencies were conducted. To define the wear mechanisms of AZ61 magnesium alloy, the worn surfaces after wear tests were analyzed by SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Based on the results obtained, die channel angles have significant influences on the grain refinements and wear behaviors of the samples. Decreasing channel angles of the ES die will not only refine the microstructures of magnesium alloys effectively and improve their harnesses, but also improve their wear resistance as decreasing channel angles results in higher friction coefficients and wear rates. With the increase in applied loads and frequencies, wear mechanisms change from mild wear (adhesion, abrasion and oxidation) to severe wear (delamination, plastic deformation and melting). In summary, the wear resistance of ES-processed AZ61 magnesium alloy could be improved by decreasing channel angles of ES dies.

VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM WITH TIME WINDOWS USING MULTI-OBJECTIVE CO-EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SIMULATION MODELLING			English	Article						Multi-Objective Optimization; Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization; Variable Neighbourhood Search; Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; LOCAL SEARCH; SOLVE	This paper introduces a novel multi-objective algorithm (HMPSO) based on discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve vehicle routing problems with time windows (VRPTW). The presented HMPSO algorithm was combined with an advanced discrete PSO based on set and variable neighbourhood searches to find Pareto optimal routing solutions. These consisted of a complete routing schedule for serving the customers to minimize the two aims of travelling distance and number of vehicles. To increase the discrete PSO efficiency, a novel decoding scheme based on set was designed, and the variable neighbourhood local search was employed to explore new solutions. The experiment results were showed for a set of the Solomon's 56 VRPTW. The HMPSO algorithm was compared with some algorithms published in papers with the computational evaluations clearly supporting the high performance of the proposed HMPSO algorithm against other algorithms, and confirming that the HMPSO is an efficient algorithm because of a reasonable computational time and cost in solve VRPTW.

Increased and decreased pH cause the Ag NCs to switch between agglomeration and dispersion, accompanied by decreases in and recoveries of fluorescence intensity and absorbance. The pH switchable behavior of the Ag NCs is attributed to carboxyl groups on the nanocluster surface that are rich in the citrate and amido functional groups of ligands (glutathione), creating an easily formed, weak molecular interaction among Ag NCs (for example, hydrogen bonding) and maintaining a balance in the colloidal solution, whereas a change in pH will disrupt the balance, leading to the reversible agglomeration of Ag NCs and the switchable spectral signal response. In addition, because urea and glucose can change the pH of a solution by producing NH3 and gluconic acid in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the pH-switchable behavior of the Ag NCs is used to develop them as an optical probe to establish a regenerated biosensing platform for the sensitive and selective detection of urea and glucose, and the test results are satisfactory.

The obtained results reveal that DAM acts as a mixed-type inhibitor with a predominantly anodic reaction, and the inhibition efficiency increases with increasing inhibitor concentration whereas decreases with increasing temperature. The adsorption of DAM on steel surface is found to obey Langmuir isotherm, and the adsorption mechanism is mixed physical and chemical adsorption. The results of quantum chemical calculation demonstrate that pyrazolone rings within molecular structure of DAM play a dominant role in corrosion inhibition of mild steel.

After completion of repair of all broken components, the repairman remains idle for a period of time called changeover time, and then takes a vacation following an arbitrary distribution if there is no operating component breaks down during the changeover time. Applying the supplementary variable method, several reliability measures of the system including the steady-state availability, the steady-state rate of occurrence of failures and the mean time to the first failure are obtained. Meanwhile, some numerical illustrations are presented to demonstrate how the various parameters influence the behaviour of the system. Finally, a special case (n-1)-out-of-n:G system is discussed to validate the correctness of the theoretical results.

The chain length of 147 +/- A 10 (1 sigma) is determined by an HO2 source that uses the photolysis of water vapor under 184.9 nm in air. A Nafion system equipped with a Nafion tube of similar to 2.2 mm external diameter and 350 mm length is employed in the PERCA instrument (Nafion-PERCA system). When flowing an air sample containing HO2 through the Nafion system, it is found that - 94.6 % of HO2 is removed. In contrast, only 17.8 % of RO2 radicals (a mixtures of CH3O2 and CH3C(O)O-2 with a ratio of 1.1:0.9) are removed. The results indicate the Nafion system has a good selective removing performance of HO2 radical during the PERCA measurement. Therefore, the method could be applied to ambient and laboratory measurements of absolute concentrations of RO2 as well as the sum of HO2 and RO2.

Forty-eight strains were initially screened out from Sichuan sun vinegar grains. The sodium nitrite-aluminum nitrate-sodium hydroxide colorimetry method was used to determine the total flavonoids, and the Folin-phenol method was used to determine the total phenols. Based on the results of total flavonids and total phenol producing capacities of the strains, one strain was singled out for use in this study. This strain, which was named YB-19, is capable of producing a total amount of 96.55 mu g/mL flavonoids and 86.69 mu g/mL phenols. YB-19 was identified by its strain morphology, physiological and biochemical characteristics. DNA sequencing was performed on YB-19. The results of the DNA sequencing showed that the sequence similarity between strain YB-19 and Bacillus toyonensis strain BCT-7112 was 99 %, and the two strains were housed on the same branch in the phylogenetic tree. Combined with the results of the strain morphology and the observed physiological and biochemical characteristics, YB-19 was identified as B. toyonensis. The screened strain YB-19 can be applied to the traditional brewing process of sun vinegar to improve vinegar quality and to enrich the microbial resources for vinegar fermentation.

The CdS QDs-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited a well-defined anodic stripping response in acidic solution, attributed to the release of Cd(II) ions from CdS QDs. The influences of supporting electrolyte and CdS QDs concentration on the response of CdS QDs-modified electrode were investigated and optimized. When CIP was added into the solution, the anodic stripping current of Cd(II) on CdS QDs/GCE decreased due to the complexation of CIP with in situ generated Cd(II) ions from CdS QDs. A linear relationship existed between the anodic stripping voltammetric response of CdS QDs/GCE and CIP concentration in the range from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1.

In this paper, TiO2 was successfully loaded onto the g-C3N4 surface to induce the electron hole separation and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. The results revealed the maximum photocatalytic performance toward discoloration of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution under the simulated sunlight illumination at molar ratio of 3% TiO2 to g-C3N4 composite. The junction between TiO2 and g-C3N4 significantly accelerate the separation of the photo. generated charge pairs caused by the strong interactions between TiO2 and g-C3N4. Such highly efficient photo-generated charge separation can be explained by a Z-scheme charge separation and migration mechanism based on the results of the scavenger experiments and the energy band structures.

A dual delay-partitioning approach is introduced to partition the delay intervals [0, tau(a)] and [tau(a), tau(b)] into different multi-segments separately. A newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms is constructed by dual-partitioning the delay in integral terms, in which the relationships between the augmented state vectors are fully taken into account. The Wirtinger-based integral inequality and Peng-Park's integral inequality are employed to effectively handle the cross-product terms occurred in derivative of the LKF. Therefore, less conservative results can be achieved in terms of e(s) and LMIs. Finally, two numerical examples are included to show that the deduced criteria are less conservative than existing ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, Pearson correlation coefficients among the nodes within the functional brain networks from healthy subjects were calculated. Then, small-world network indicators, including the clustering coefficient, the average path length, the global efficiency, the local efficiency, the average node degree, and the small-world index, were generated for the functional brain networks during both right-and left-hand MIs. We identified large differences in the small-world network indicators between the functional networks during MI and in the random networks. More importantly, the functional brain networks underlying the right-and left-hand MIs exhibited similar small-world properties in terms of the clustering coefficient, the average path length, the global efficiency, and the local efficiency. By contrast, the right-and left-hand MI brain networks showed differences in small-world characteristics, including indicators such as the average node degree and the small-world index. Interestingly, our findings also suggested that the differences in the activity intensity and range, the average node degree, and the small-world index of brain networks between the right-and left-hand MIs were associated with the asymmetry of brain functions.

In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining the thermal pattern of the entire freeform surface of a propeller using eddy current pulsed thermography (ECPT). To understand the electromagnetic field and heating distributions on propeller, the induction fields of two induction coil types (line conductor and Helmholtz coil), one in air space and the other with a propeller placed are simulated and analysed through multiphysics-based models. It shows that the relatively uniform electromagnetic field induced between Helmholtz coil pair in air space becomes non-uniform with a propeller existing, as it is distorted by propeller freeform surface. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain precise thermal pattern to profile the surface condition. To overcome these challenges, segment heating is applied using a line conductor type induction coil and the thermal image stitching is proposed for showing the entire thermal pattern on propeller surface. Both finite element simulation and experimental study are implemented. The results show that more clearly thermal distributions on propeller freeform surface can be obtained using the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the annealing temperature and the reverse bias voltage on the near-infrared responsivity were investigated. The photodiode exhibits optimal rectification and photoresponse at an annealing temperature of 500 degrees C. At a 12 V bias, a responsivity of 2.41 A/W at 1064 nm is obtained. The linear increase at bias from 0 to 10 V and faster-than-linear increase at bias from 10 to 12 V for the responsivity are observed with the increase of the bias voltage. The results suggest that the gain mechanism is most likely to be a photoconductive gain.

By using the optical selection rule derived by a single electron charged self-assembled GaAs/InAs quantum dot in a micropillar resonator, two photons are used to generate four-qubit entangled decoherence-free states. Compared with previous entanglement based photonic protocols, the present one requires single-photon resources and is deterministic. These states may be applied to long-distance communications because only two photons are transmitted.

Vanillic acid, caffeic acid and ferulic acid were covalently attached to maltodextrin. The prepared derivatives were confirmed by ATR-IR and H-1-NMR. The thermal characteristics and viscosity were measured by thermogravimetric analysis and viscometer, respectively, and the studies revealed the grafted maltodextrins to be more thermal stable and viscous than the native maltodextrin. Moreover, the scavenging ability of most of the products was higher than 60% at 1mgmL(-1) against DPPH radical. The inhibitory effect of lipid peroxidation of caffeic acid and ferulic acid grafted maltodextrins attained 85% at 0.5mgmL(-1). It was also found that these compounds had no toxic effect (up to 100gmL(-1)) on the HEK 293 cells through the MTT test. These findings suggested that the prepared derivatives could potentially be used as a nontoxic antioxidant in food and drug industries.

Recently, Furukawa (Computer security-ESORICS 2013, Springer, 129-146, 2013) introduced a new primitive called request-based comparable encryption (comparable encryption for short) which overcomes the problem that OPEs cannot solve. OPEs have the problem that when all the numbers in a certain domain are encrypted by an OPE, an attacker can easily obtain all the orders of the encrypted numbers and hence retrieve the original numbers. However, comparable encryption is not efficient enough both in storage and in computation workload. Comparable encryption based on sliding window method Ko double dagger in Comput Math Appl 30:17-24, 1995 can adaptively adjust the window size to achieve a high performance. We set the window size as a constant number to conveniently generate ciphertexts and compare with others. Besides, the proposed scheme allows the users to obtain a variable trade-off between security and efficiency through adaptively setting the window size.

The complex relative permittivity and permeability of the graphite-fullerene composites in the frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 18 GHz were measured using a vector network analyzer with the reflection/transmission technique. Additionally, the microwave reflection loss of the composites was calculated using the obtained complex microwave electromagnetic parameters. It was found that the microwave loss peaks in the Ku band were dependent on the concentration of fullerene nanoparticles in the composites. Maximum reflection loss of -30 dB was observed between 2 GHz and 8 GHz when the graphite composites were doped with 1 wt.% fullerene. This absorption loss dropped (-24 dB) when the composite contained 3 wt.% fullerene. In addition, the electrical properties of the graphite were independent of the presence of fullerene in the composites. The tunable microwave reflection loss indicates that these graphite-fullerene composites show promise as wideband electromagnetic wave absorption materials.

The inactivation is due to the accumulation of photogenerated charges on TiO2 surface. The surface charges significantly enhance the adsorption of particulate matters and thus block incident light. To shield photogenerated charges on TiO2 surface, a series of nanocomposites composed of inner TiO2 nanocrystals and SiO2 coating was synthesized using ethylenediamine as SiO2 coating assistant. XRD, N-2 adsorption/desorption, TEM, surface photovoltage, UV-vis, and GC-FID were used to study the effect of SiO2 coating on the structure of inner TiO2 nanocrystals, the ability of shielding surface charges, the adsorption of airborne particles, and the removal efficiency of toluene. The results showed that SiO2 coating efficiently shielded the photogenerated charges on the TiO2-SiO2 interface and reduced the adsorption of airborne particles but did not diminish the transfer of toluene from air to photocatalytic sites on the TiO2 surface. The crystallinity and crystal size of inner TiO2 gradually decreased with increased amount of SiO2 coating. TiO2@SiO2-50 with a small crystal size of 9.2 nm and relatively high crystallinity showed the best photoactivity. This work may provide a new strategy to overcome the problem of TiO2 inactivation by haze pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared CoFe-LDHs exhibited a high adsorption activity to the methyl orange (MO) dye and Cr(VI). The adsorption characteristics including adsorption kinetics and isothermals were investigated. Structure analysis of the as-synthesized LDHs before and after adsorption revealed that adsorption proceeds in two processes: external surface adsorption and interlayer anion exchange. The results of MO adsorption experiments showed that LDHs with Co2+/Fe3+ molar ratios of 4 worked best with the largest MO adsorption amount up to 1290 mg/g at an initial concentration of 300 mg/L due to the porous structures. We have also noted that Cr(VI) in a range of 2-25 mg/L can be quickly removed with the maximum adsorption capacity of 27.62 mg/g in the initial 5 min, much faster than other LDH materials. Therefore, CoFe-LDHs are potential cost-effective adsorbents for both MO dye and Cr(VI). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The enhancement in infrared absorption and carrier density is achieved by sputtering a Si thin film onto the Se film before femtosecond-laser irradiation. The effects of laser micro-structuring conditions (scanning speed and laser fluence) on surface morphology, optical and electronic properties of Se doped silicon are also studied. With the decrease of scanning speed, the absorptance increases at wavelengths from 0.4 to 2.2 mu m, while the carrier density and mobility follow an opposite tendency. The optical absorption and sheet carrier density for sample fabricated at the fluence of 4.5 kJ/m(2) are greater than that of samples prepared at other fluence. This experimental method facilitates the application of hyperdoping of silicon with Se in optcielectronic devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A two-step semi-batch emulsion polymerization was employed for constructing core shell latex. TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis indicated that the core shell latex possessed a broad particles size distribution, which led to the adsorption of the latex on fiber proceeding via two-stage equilibrium mainly due to the effect of latex particle size. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model was appropriate for the description of the kinetics of the first stage equilibrium at high latex concentration and the entire adsorption process at low concentration. In contrast, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted the second equilibrium at high latex concentration well. The activation energy calculated suggested that the number of activated molecules was increased as the increase of adsorbent concentration, which might change the dominant adsorption mechanism. This also addressed the reasons for the abnormal adsorption behavior with the extra-added emulsifier. In addition, the surface property of the modified cellulose fibers was also investigated via contact angle measurements. The results proved that the cellulose fiber modified with the latex became hydrophobic, allowing the as-modified cellulose to be potential reinforcements for biocomposite. Finally, the adsorption mechanism was proposed according to the adsorption process mainly governed by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bond, pi-pi stack and chain entanglement.

However, diverse coating antigen might bring different antiserum titer and sensitivity for the identical antiserum. In the present study, four AFB1-protein (aflatoxin B1-carrier protein) conjugates were prepared by activated ester method (AFB1O-BSA/AFB1O-OVA) and mannich method (AFB1-cBSA/AFB1-cOVA), and then applied as coating antigen for titer and sensitivity detection of the identical antiserum obtained from rabbit immunized by AFB1-KLH. Afterwards, the ultraviolet visible, fluorescence and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (far-UV CD) spectra were recorded for understanding the difference in titer and sensitivity obtained. Results revealed that AFB1O-BSA/AFB1O-OVA showed a strong intrinsic fluorescence band centered at 450 nm that originated from the emission of AFB1, which differed from AFB1-cBSA/AFB1-cOVA, while the decrease of alpha-helical and increase of beta-sheet in AFB1-cBSA was the most remarkable. This indicated that the better sensitivity obtained by using AFB1O-BSA as coating antigen might be caused by its extended structure, because such structure affect the binding between AFB1 and antibody. The study might offer structural information for understanding the titer and sensitivity difference caused by coating antigen. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considerable efforts have been made by our research group focusing on additional developments, including the heterogenization of catalytic systems and hydrogenation for application in catalytic delignification of pulp. [H-2] and [H-4]salen type complexes of cobalt encapsulated in zeolite cages were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Their catalytic properties were then evaluated in the catalytic delignification of pulp using peracetic acid (CH3COOOH) as an oxidant. The encapsulation and hydrogenation of the complexes yielding increased spatial separation, which strongly enhanced the activity of complexes, were found to play a key role in the selective delignification of pulp. With encapsulated and hydrogenated complexes as catalysts, pulp was selectively delignified to a high brightness. The catalysts that were developed could suitably be used in green bleaching for the pulp industry.

The Min(N, V)-policy means that the server commences its service once the number of waiting customers reaches threshold N or when its vacation time ends with at least one but less than N customers waiting for processing, whichever occurs first. Otherwise, if no customer is presenting at the end of the server vacation, the server remains idle until the first arrival occurs. Under these assumptions, the z-transform expressions for the transient queue size distribution at time epoch n(+) are obtained by employing the renewal process theory and the total probability decomposition technique. Based on the transient analysis, the explicit recursive formulas of the steady-state queue length distribution at time epochs n(broken vertical bar), n, n and outside observer's time epoch are derived, respectively. Additionally, the stochastic decomposition structure is presented and some other performance measures are also discussed. Furthermore, some computational experiments are implemented to demonstrate the significant application value of the recursive formulas for the steady-state queue size in designing system capacity. Finally, the optimal threshold of N for economizing the system cost is numerically determined.

Proanthocyanidins (PCs), a natural antioxidant, possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological and medicinal properties. However, its protective effects against lead-induced liver damage have not been clarified. This study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of PCs on the hepatotoxicity of male Kunming mice induced by chronic lead exposure. A total of 70 healthy male Kunming mice were averagely divided into four groups: control group, i.e., the group exposed to lead, the group treated with PCs, and the group co-treated with lead and PCs. The mice exposed to lead were given water containing 0.2% lead acetate. Mice treated in the PCs and PCs lead co-treated groups were given PC (100 mg/kg) in 0.9% saline by oral gavage. Lead exposure caused a significant elevation in the liver function parameters, lead level, lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities. The induction of oxidative stress and histological alterations in the liver were minimized by co-treatment with PCs. Meanwhile, the number of Transferase-Mediated Deoxyuridine Triphosphate-Biotin Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was significantly reduced in the PCs/lead co-treated group compared to the lead group. In addition, the lead group showed an increase in the expression level of Bax, while the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased. Furthermore, the lead group showed an increase in the expression level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes and protein (GRP78 and CHOP). Co-treated with PCs significantly reversed these expressions in the liver. PCs were, therefore, demonstrated to have protective, antioxidant, and anti-ER stress and anti-apoptotic activities in liver damage caused by chronic lead exposure in the Kunming mouse. This may be due to the ability of PCs to enhance the ability of liver tissue to protect against oxidative stress via the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, resulting in decreasing ER stress and apoptosis of liver tissue.

Y.; He, Hongda			The Reynolds stress induced by weakly up-down asymmetric ion temperature gradient mode	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							DRIFT WAVES	A weakly up-down asymmetric ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode (formed in the up-down symmetric equilibrium), localized in the bad curvature region, may contribute dominantly to the nonlinear Reynolds stress because its growth rate is higher than the competing modes: the strongly up-down asymmetric modes, and other modes peaked (poloidally) away from the outboard mid-plane. Based on the fluid ITG model, the parameterized analytic wave function is constructed in the two dimensional (2D) Fourier-ballooning representation, and numerically verified by making use of the finite difference methods. Analytic expressions for the poloidal Reynolds stresses, defined on a rational surface, are given for both the weakly and the strongly up-down asymmetric ITG modes. It is shown that the poloidal stresses of both modes can be interpreted as a superposition of a monopole and a dipole structure. For comparison with the experiment, the stresses are calculated for L-mode discharge parameters on five machines. Analytic expressions for the total parallel Reynolds stresses (contributed from all rational surfaces) are also derived for both modes: they are also exhibited, graphically, using a Gaussian wave intensity model.

The results obtained from weight loss experiments and electrochemical tests displayed that [ABlm]Br served as a mixed-type inhibitor primarily controlling cathode corrosion process and the anti-corrosive efficiency (up to 90.38% at 10 mM) improved with the increase of the concentration. Besides, it was found that the adsorption of the organic molecules on X65 steel substrate followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and surface topography of X65 steel was characterized using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, theoretical calculations suggested that investigated inhibitor was flat-lying adsorbed on the X65 steel surface.

Therefore, it is critical to reveal the relationship between the molar ratio of two semiconductors and the photo-induced charge separation; the information can shed light on the study of nature of surface catalysis. In this work, (BiO)(2)CO3-BiOBr composites were facilely fabricated in-situ through a pore impregnating approach using HBr aqueous solution. The samples were studied by BET, XRD, SEM, UV-Vis DRS and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS). The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the discoloration of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution upon the simulated sunlight illumination.

The true protein contents and volatile compounds of the jerkies before and after fermentation were also determined. The study results demonstrated that Lactobacillus bulgaricus reduced the meat pH (from 6.42 to 4.77), degraded the protein in the meat by the proteases (including acid and neutral proteases) produced during fermentation, and increased the amount of free amino acids. And the viable count of Lacrobacillus bulgaricus in the pork jerkies after fermentation was increased. Four and twenty-two volatile compounds were detected for the non-fermented and fermented jerky, respectively. The important compounds affecting the flavor of fermented jerky included 1-octen-3-ol, benzaldehyde, pentanal, octanal, nonanal, and 2-pentyl-furan. The study results demonstrated that Lactobacillus bulgaricus reduced the meat pH, degraded the protein in the meat by the proteases (including acid and neutral proteases) produced during fermentation, and increased the amount of free amino acids and flavored compounds. In these ways, the meat quality and flavor were improved, and digestion and absorption were enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Products bearing adjacent quaternary-tertiary centers were smoothly obtained in high yields (up to 90% yield) with good diastereoselectivity (up to >20:1). In addition, their biological activity has been preliminarily demonstrated by in vitro evaluation against human lung cancer cells A549, human prostate cancer cells PC-3, and human leukemia cells 1<562 by the MIT-based assays, using the commercially available broad-spectrum anticancer drug of Cisplatin as a positive control. The results also demonstrated that most of the compounds showed considerable cytotoxicities to these three cell lines of 1<562, PC-3, and A549, showed comparably potent or even more potent than the positive control of Cisplatin (up to 3.0 times), and indicated that novel pyrimidine-fused spiropyrrolidine oxindoles may be potential leads for further biological screenings and may generate drug-like molecules.

Corresponding surfaces of mild steel were examined by atomic force microscope (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The experimental results are in good agreement and reveal a favorable synergistic effect of 2,6-diaminopyridine with tartaric acid, which could protect mild steel from corrosion effectively. Besides, quantum chemical calculations and Monte Carlo simulation were used to clarify the inhibition mechanism of the synergistic effect.

MD-g-CA was prepared through esterification in a two-step convenient synthesis procedure and characterised using infra-red (IR) spectroscopy. The IR data indicated the typical ester carbonyl stretching at around 1721cm(-1). Moreover, MD-g-CA could give about 40% inhibition of DPPH radical and present excellent UV-absorption, which were notably better than that of native MD. Maltodextrin (MD) and MD-g-CA were used to prepare PSPa microcapsules by spray drying. The stability of PSPa was evaluated by UV-Vis analysis. The microcapsules produced by MD-g-CA showed a spheres-like appearance with some cracks. Storage tests revealed that the degradation rate of PSPa embedded by MD-g-CA was much lower than that of free PSPa under the same condition. Thus, MD-g-CA could be used as an effective wall material to improve stability of anthocyanins.

At different processing time points, the nitrogen concentrations for the total nitrogen, ammonia, Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate, and nitrite were determined. Furthermore, a computer simulation was performed to derive the experience dynamic equations as follows: C-A = C-0 x (1- t/105.93 - 0.5978t) ; C-B = C-0 x (1- t/142.66 - 2.3177t) ; C-K = C-0 x (1- t/151.25 - 2.5957t); C-X = C-0 x (1- t/82.492 - 0.7615) ; and C-Y = C-0 x (1- t/67.374 + 0.7252t). The established dynamic equations can be used to predict the removal capacity of the total nitrogen, ammonia, Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate; and nitrite in the tannery wastewater treated with the bioflocculant, calculate the optimum processing time, and cut costs. In addition, these equations establish a foundation for studying the mechanism underlying this bioflocculant treatment for tannery wastewater.

In this paper, Ag2CO3 was facilely deposited on the surface of ZnO through a precipitation method. The effects of loading content of Ag2CO3 on the charge separation of Ag2CO3/ZnO composites and their photocatalytic performance were studied by the means of surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS). Coupling of ZnO with Ag2CO3 can greatly accelerate the charge separation under the simulated solar light irradiation, supported by the SPS results. The enhancement of charge separation rate and photocatalytic activities of Ag2CO3/ZnO composites notably depends on the loading content of Ag2CO3. With the optimal theoretical Ag/Zn molar ratio of 3/100, the composite exhibits the highest charge separation rate and photocatalytic activity under the simulated solar light illumination. To better comprehend the improved separation of the photo-induced charge carriers, a Z-scheme charge separation mechanism was proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LocationThe Indo-Malesian region section of the Indo-West Pacific region. MethodsNext-generation sequencing technology was used to sequence 81 nuclear loci from a pooled DNA sample of 31-44 individuals of Rhizophora apiculata from 11 populations. Five nuclear loci from six to eight individuals from 18 populations were sequenced using conventional Sanger sequencing technology to validate the results. ResultsGenetic diversity at the population level was low ( and were <1.0x10(-3) in most of the populations), but relatively high at the specieslevel (=2.419x10(-3) and =1.362x10(-3)). The populations of R.apiculata in the Indo-Malesian region were genetically differentiated and grouped into three clusters: east Indian Ocean (EIO), South China Sea (SCS) and Australasia (AUA). Based on the genetic distance matrices, two genetic discontinuities were observed, and they correspond to the Malay Peninsula land barrier and the Wallacea zone. The admixture observed in populations from the Malacca Strait was attributed to asymmetric gene flow through the strait, which was simulated by the isolation-with-migration (IM) model. Main conclusionBoth the Sunda shelf barrier and ocean currents in Wallacea contributed to the observed genetic discontinuity, which separated R. apiculata into three clusters (SCS, EIO and AUA). The cycle between extinction and recolonization in the SCS in response to Pleistocene sea level fluctuations reduced the genetic diversity within populations. The repeated opening and closing of the gene flow corridors, such as the Malacca Strait, may have blurred the genetic discontinuities to an extent and introduced an admixture into populations in boundary areas.

Dynamic stability analysis of a cylindrical shell subjected to swirling annular flow under thermal loads	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Cylindrical shell; Annular flow; Dynamic stability; Fluid rotation; Viscosity; Temperature effects	INDUCED INSTABILITIES; CONVEYING FLUID; VIBRATIONS; BEHAVIOR	Considering thermal loads, a dynamic stability analysis is presented for a flexible cylindrical shell conveying a viscous, incompressible, swirling fluid in the annulus between the inner shell and the outer shell in this paper. The inviscid fluid-dynamic forces associated with shell motions are treated in the frame of the potential flow theory. And the steady viscous forces are derived by using fully developed turbulent theory. The thermal loads are determined by the thermo-elastic theory. Shell motions are described by Flugge's thin shell equations, which are modified to incorporate the prestresses relating to the steady viscous forces. The theoretical analysis is conducted by the zero-level contour method and the Galerkin's method. This study shows that, for annular flow, the effect of viscosity renders the system more unstable. Fluid rotation strongly degrades the stability of the shell. The influences of a combined action of the viscous annular flow having two velocity components and the thermal loads on the stability of shells are discussed in detail. Also, the critical temperature rise is found. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous structural and functional studies have demonstrated that WMLs are associated with cognitive and motor decline. However, the underlying mechanism of how WMLs lead to cognitive decline and motor disturbance remains unclear. We used functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM) to investigate changes in brain functional connectivity in 16 patients with ischemic WMLs and 13 controls. Both short- and long-range FCD maps were computed, and group comparisons were performed between the 2 groups. A correlation analysis was further performed between regions with altered FCD and cognitive test scores (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) in the patient group. We found that patients with ischemic WMLs showed reduced short-range FCD in the temporal cortex, primary motor cortex, and subcortical region, which may account for inadequate top-down attention, impaired motor, memory, and executive function associated with WMLs. The positive correlation between primary motor cortex and MoCA scores may provide evidence for the influences of cognitive function on behavioral performance. The inferior parietal cortex exhibited increased short-range FCD, reflecting a hyper bottom-up attention to compensate for the inadequate top-down attention for language comprehension and information retrieval in patients with WMLs. Moreover, the prefrontal and primary motor cortex showed increased long-range FCD and the former positively correlated with MoCA scores, which may suggest a strategy of cortical functional reorganization to compensate for motor and executive deficits. Our findings provide new insights into how WMLs cause cognitive and motor decline from cortical functional connectivity perspective.

After fermentation, the jerky was dried and then tested for sensory evaluation, pH and free amino acid content. The results showed that the optimal conditions for fermentation using L. bulgaricus and Angel Yeast were: a pH of 6.5, a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of L. bulgaricus to Angel Yeast, a fermentation time of 42 h and temperature of 25 A degrees C. The results showed that the pork jerky fermented with the combined strains was not very sour which was close to the pH of 7.0 and had a higher free amino acid content which was more than 68.3 mg/100 g compared with the pork jerky fermented by either L. bulgaricus or Angel Yeast alone. Overall, the results demonstrate that fermentation of raw pork with combined strains of L. bulgaricus and Angel Yeast improves the quality and flavor of pork jerky.

A more flexible switching mechanism between low and regular service states is introduced to enhance the practical value of the working vacation queue. Under different precision levels of the system information, namely observable, almost un-observable and fully unobservable cases, the utility function is studied from both the individual customer's and the system administrator's points of view. By analyzing the steady-state behavior of the system, the associated optimal joining decisions under different information scenarios are obtained. We find that for the fully observable queue, the joining threshold for individual optimization may be less than the one for social optimization in working vacation period. A similar situation also appears in almost unobservable case. Such phenomenon is not possible for the classic first come first served queue due to the fact that there is no vacation time and thus will not cause large fluctuations in customers' conditional waiting time. Additionally, we also conduct some numerical comparisons to demonstrate the effect of the information levels as well as system parameters on customer joining behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The microstructure evolution of the deposited polymeric films induced by silicon (Si) and aluminum(Al) doping were scrutinized through infrared spectroscopy, multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The comparative results show that Si doping can enhance polymerization and Al doping results in an increase in the ordered carbon clusters. Si and Al co-doping into polymeric films leads to the formation of an unusual dual nanostructure consisting of cross-linked polymer-like hydrocarbon chains and fullerene-like carbon clusters. The super-high elasticity and super-low friction coefficients (<0.002) under a high vacuum were obtained through Si and Al co-doping into the films. Unconventionally, the co-doped polymeric films exhibited a superior wear resistance even though they were very soft. The relationship between the microstructure and properties of the polymeric amorphous carbon films with different elements doping are also discussed in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this letter, we first reported a low-lost synthesis of Cr3C2 nanowhiskers at 800 degrees C by vacuum carburization process using precursor powders as raw materials without Fe/Co/Ni catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data confirm that Cr3C2 nano whiskers have a single-phase orthorhombic structure. A homogeneous chemical composition can be obtained in the calcining product from precursor, which reduces significantly the synthesis temperature. Morphological studies using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show Cr3C2 nanowhiskers have a clean and smooth surface with a diameter size of similar to 50 nm.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 shows 1D dimeric chain structure, while 2 gives a 3D dense packing framework. Topology analysis illustrates that 2 can be simplified as a 3-nodal net (4, 5, 6-connected net) with the point symbol of {4(4).6(2)}{4(6) .6(4)}(2){4(8) .6(6) .8}. In addition, solid state luminescent properties of two complexes have also been studied in detail, which may act as the potential optical materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms is constructed by decomposing integral interval, in which the relationships between the augmented state vectors are fully taken into account. The tighter bounding inequalities such as a Wirtinger-based integral inequality, Peng-Park's integral inequality, and an auxiliary function-based integral inequality are employed to effectively handle the cross-product terms occurred in derivative of the LKF. As a result, less conservative delay-dependent stability criterion can be achieved in terms of e(s) and LMIs. Finally, two numerical examples are included to show that the proposed results are less conservative than existing ones.

Structural analysis reveals that all of these complexes contain the 1D infinite chains, with different variations in the weak interactions. Complexes 1 and 2 are interconnected by intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions to form 1D infinite chains and 2D networks, and the ordered-layer-lattic C1071 and DMF in 2 are between 2D networks. For 3, the pbaa ligand adopts a tetradentate coordination mode to link two adjacent stair-like [Ag4O4] cores resulting in a 1D chain, respectively, with Ag center dot center dot center dot C, N-O center dot center dot center dot pi and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. All these show that phosphine ligands play an important role in the construction of interesting topological structures with different types of the weak interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

F--binding properties of the dye in the presence of tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)), tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), and tetramethylammonium (TMA(+)) counter ions were investigated by UV-Vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopies. Dye 3 displayed various degrees of absorption red shift, fluorescence quenching, and downfield shifts of NH signals for the three fluoride salts. The association constants of these salts mainly depend on cation size effects and ion-pairing effects and were in the order KTMA+ > KTEA+ > KTBA+. Thus, we speculate that both F- and tetraalkylammonium cations are concomitantly located above and below a bowl-shaped calix[4]pyrrole cup in an ion-paired complex, respectively.

The new phase is mechanically and dynamically stable, as confirmed by the calculations of its elastic constants and phonon dispersion curve. The calculated large shear modulus (227 GPa) and high hardness (42.2 GPa) show that ZrB3 within the monoclinic phase is a potentially superhard material. The analyses of the electronic density of states and chemical bonding reveal that the strong B-B and B-Zr covalent bonds are attributed to its high hardness. By the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and Gruneisen parameter of ZrB3 are also systemically investigated.

A modified augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established by partitioning the delay in all integral terms. Then, on the basis of taking into account the independent upper bounds of the delay derivative in various delay intervals, some new results on tighter bounding inequalities, such as Peng-Park's integral inequality and the Free-Matrix-based integral inequality are employed to effectively reduce the enlargement in bounding the derivative of LKF, therefore, less conservative results can be expected in terms of e (s) and LMIs. Finally, three numerical examples are included to show that the proposed method is less conservative than existing ones.

The original microstructure and the deformation temperature of semi-solid ZCuSn10 alloy are different. The strain is 0.2, and the strain rate is 1 s(-1) for the compression test. The results show that when the semi-solid ZCuSn10 alloy was prepared by SIMA process, the liquid fraction of semi-solid microstructure increases, and the solid grain is smaller, more uniform and more inclined to be round as the rolling pre-deformation increasing. The results also indicate that the deformation resistance of ZCuSn10 alloy in semi-solid state decreases with the deformation temperature increasing or the solid fraction of original microstructure decreasing. The stress-strain curves of the isothermal compression can be divided into quasi-elastic deformation stage and plastic deformation stage, and there are three deformation zones in the samples after isothermal compression, namely the difficult deformation zone, the large deformation zone and the free deformation zone. In the three deformation zones, the main deformation mechanism is flow of liquid incorporating solid particles (FLS) mechanism, plastic deformation of solid particles (PDS) mechanism and liquid flow (LF) combining with FLS mechanism, respectively.

Ordovician intrusive rocks exposed in the XMOB, from north to south, are the Abaga-East Ujimqin Qi-Duobaoshan belt, the Sonid Zuoqi-West Ujimqin Qi belt, and the Damaoqi-Baimaimiao-Tulinkai belt, respectively. Zircon U-Pb dating and geochemical data are presented for the intrusive rocks in East Ujimqin Qi and West Ujimqin Qi, Inner Mongolia. The intrusive rocks from East Ujimqin Qi consist of gabbro, diorite, and granodiorite. LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages range 446 to 461Ma. Geochemical data suggest that the gabbros and diorites from East Ujimqin are a tholeiitic series, both of arc-related and N-MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) signature, indicating a back-arc basin setting. The granodiorites have a shoshonitic series and arc-related signature. Rare earth element (REE) patterns and trace element characteristics suggest gabbros, diorites, and granodiorites are petrogenetically correlated. These intrusive rocks from East Ujimqin Qi have high light REE, Th, and U concentrations, suggesting the effect of middle-upper continental crustal contamination. Major oxides display positive or negative correlations, with increasing MgO or SiO2, indicating that fractional crystallization occurred during magma evolution. Geochemical data of diorite from West Ujimqin Qi indicate a tholeiitic series, arc-related signature. Zircon U-Pb dating yielded an age of 441.8 +/- 1.5Ma. Integrated with the regionally exposed Mid-Late Ordovician plutons and metasedimentary strata, we concluded that the northward subduction of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean (PAO) that occurred beneath the southern margin of the South Mongolian Micro-continent along the Sonid Zuoqi-Xilinhot gave rise to early Palaeozoic igneous rocks from the Abaga-East Ujimqin Qi-Duobaoshan and the Sonid Zuoqi-West Ujimqin Qi belts. Southward subduction beneath the North China Craton generated the Damaoqi-Baimaimiao-Tulinkai belt. The results support the bidirectional subduction model of the PAO in the early Palaeozoic.

For comparison, two other CZA samples were prepared using ammonia and ammonium carbonate as the precipitants, respectively. Differences in the textural, structural and redox properties, together with the evolution upon thermal aging treatment and the catalytic performance of the corresponding Pd-only three-way catalysts, were investigated systematically. The choice of precipitant was found to affect the interactions between CeO2-ZrO2 (CZ) and Al2O3. When ammonia was used as the precipitant, the resulting CZ and Al2O3 seemed insusceptible to each other, thus the obtained CZA composite displayed inferior thermal stability due to the weakest interaction between CZ and Al2O3. In the case of ammonium carbonate, stronger interaction between CZ and Al2O3 enhanced the thermal stability of CZA, but in the meantime, the homogeneity of the CZ solid solution was severely impaired by Al2O3, leading to undesirable redox performance. Fortunately, the use of the composite precipitant brought about favorable interaction between CZ and Al2O3, leading to excellent textural and structural properties along with the highest thermal stability of the CZA compound. Consequently, the corresponding Pd-based catalyst displayed prominent reducibility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) performance, as well as superior three-way catalytic performance.

By recording the waiting time of the leading customer in server's vacation period, the model is successfully described as a vector-valued Markov chain. Meanwhile, depending on the special block structure of the one-step transition probability matrix, the equilibrium queue length distribution is calculated through a more effective UL-type RG-factorization. Due to the number of customers served in the busy period does not have the structure of a Galton-Watson branching process, analysis of the regeneration cycle is regarded as a difficult problem in establishing the cost structure of the queueing system. However, employing the concept of i-busy period and some difference equation solving skills, the explicit expression for the expected length of the regeneration cycle is easily derived, and the stochastic decomposition structure of the busy period is also demonstrated. Finally, numerical results are offered to illustrate how the direct search method can be implemented to obtain the optimal management policy.

This article investigates synchronization behavior for chaotic systems subject to states quantization. Based on the invariance principle of differential equations, an adaptive feedback scheme is proposed to strictly synchronize chaotic systems via limited capacity communication channels. Furthermore, it is important to point out that the mutual synchronization behavior for bidirectional coupled systems is determined by the amount of transmitting information and the initial states of coupled systems.

A Burgers equation and its stationary solutions are obtained by using the reductive perturbation method. The analytical and numerical results show that the height with polynomial dust size distribution is larger than that of the monosized dusty plasmas with the same dust grains, but the thickness in the case of different dust grains is smaller than that of the monosized dusty plasmas. Furthermore, the moving speed of the shock waves also depend on different dust size distributions.

Since some bacteria are capable of vigorous gamma-PGA biosynthesis from renewable biomass, gamma-PGA is considered a promising bio-based chemical and is already widely used in the food, medical, and wastewater industries due to its biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-immunogenic properties. In this review, we consider the properties, biosynthetic pathway, production strategies, and applications of gamma-PGA. Microbial biosynthesis of gamma-PGA and the molecular mechanisms regulating production are covered in particular detail. Genetic engineering and optimization of the growth medium, process control, and downstream processing have proved to be effective strategies for lowering the cost of production, as well as manipulating the molecular mass and conformational/enantiomeric properties that facilitate screening of competitive gamma-PGA producers. Finally, future prospects of microbial gamma-PGA production are discussed in light of recent progress, challenges, and trends in this field.

By using the command filter, it is not only the states, the actuator constraints, and the problem of explosion of complexity' in conventional backstepping have been solved, but also the calculation of partial derivatives is unnecessary, so that control law and update law become succinct. Fuzzy logic systems, designed in this study, are utilised in real-time identification of the uncertain non-linear functions. Throughout the process of controller design, the transformed style and Butterworth low-pass filter are applied to solve the problem of unknown control directions. Using the Lyapunov theorem, it has been shown that the approach can guarantee all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, an application of the method has been made to the controller design of the attack angle of a hypersonic vehicle. The simulation results are given to prove the effectiveness of the method presented in this study.

The synthesized Pd/alpha-Fe2O3 particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), atomic force microscope (AFM), scan electron microscopy with energy dispersion spectra (SEM-EDS), FT-IR and BET. Related characterizations confirm that IN light-induced reduction is a feasible, simply and environment-friendly method for the preparation of supported catalysts containing active metal. Furthermore, hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) to o-chloroaniline (o-CAN) by the selected Pd(0.5%)/alpha-Fe2O3 was investigated systematically. The alpha-Fe2O3-supported Pd catalyst was found to exhibit good catalytic activity and selectivity for the o-CNB reduction under mild conditions. The hydrogenation of o-CNB over the resulting Pd-based catalyst gave a 100% o-CNB conversion and 91.4% selectivity of o-CAN under the reaction conditions of 50 degrees C, 2 h, 1 MPa hydrogen pressure, n(0-CNB)/n(Pd) = 6000:1. Moreover, the resulting Pd-based catalyst remained higher hydrogenation reactivity after three runs even if a sharply decrease in activity was observed at the fourth run. The obtained results reveal the as-prepared Pd/alpha-Fe2O3 is an efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation of o-CNB even at a high level of substrate concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These reactions are reviewed in light of major advances over the past few decades, spurred by interest in Fe-2(mu-SR)(2)(CO)(x) centers at the active sites of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes. The most useful synthetic route to Fe-2(mu-SR)(2)(CO)(6) involves the reaction of thiols with Fe-2(CO)(9) and Fe-3(CO)(12). Such reactions can proceed via mono-, di-, and triiron intermediates. The reactivity of Fe(0) carbonyls toward thiols is highly chemoselective, and the resulting dithiolato complexes are fairly rugged. Thus, many complexes tolerate further synthetic elaboration directed at the organic substituents. A second major route involves alkylation of Fe-2(mu-S-2)(CO)(6), Fe-2(mu-SH)(2)(CO)(6), and Li2Fe2(mu-S)(2)(CO)(6). This approach is especially useful for azadithiolates Fe-2[(mu-SCH2)(2)NR](CO)(6). Elaborate complexes arise via addition of the FeSH group to electrophilic alkenes, allcynes, and carbonyls. Although the first example of Fe-2(mu-SR)(2)(CO)(6) was prepared from ferrous reagents, ferrous compounds are infrequently used, although the Fe(II)(SR)(2) + Fe(0) condensation reaction is promising. Almost invariably low-yielding, the reaction of Fe-3(CO)(12), S-8, and a variety of unsaturated substrates results in C-H activation, affording otherwise inaccessible derivatives. Thiones and related C=S containing reagents are highly reactive toward Fe(0), often giving complexes derived from substituted methanedithiolates and C-H activation.

Herein, a simple, rapid, and ultra-sensitive analytical method for the determination of cyanazine (CZ) based on inner filter effect (IFE) of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the fluorescence of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) is first described in this study. With the presence of citrate-stabilized AuNPs, the fluorescence of GSH-capped CdTe QDs was remarkably quenched by AuNPs via IFE. The fluorescence of the AuNP-CdTe QD system was recovered upon addition of CZ. CZ can adsorb on to the surface of AuNPs due to its cyano group that has good affinity with gold, which could induce the aggregation of AuNPs accompanying color change from red to blue. Thus, the IFE of AuNPs on CdTe QDs was weakened, and the fluorescence intensity of CdTe QDs was recovered accordingly. A good linear correlation for detection of CZ was exhibited from 0.05 to 9 mu M, and the detection limit reached 0.1568 mu M, which was much lower than the safety limit required by the USA, the UK, and China. In order to probe into the selectivity of AuNPs towards CZ over other pesticides, various frequently used pesticides were mixed with AuNPs. AuNP composite solution shows good selectivity towards CZ among other pesticides. This method was successfully carried out for the assessment of CZ in real samples with satisfactory results, which revealed many advantages such as high sensitivity, low cost, and non-time-consuming compared with traditional methods.

The dispersion characteristics of a spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bio-reactor (SSSAB) were investigated under overall and local dispersion conditions, which were well described by the axial dispersion model and increasing-sized CSTRs model, respectively. The flow patterns of the SSSAB under super-high (hydraulic loading rate L=18.45 L L-1 d(-1), biogas production rate G=80.24 L L-1 d(-1)) and high loadings (L = 9.23 L L-1 d(-1) G=40.12 L L-1 d(-1)) tended to the completely mixed flow, while under middle (L = 4.61 L L-1 d(-1), G=20.06 L L-1 d(-1)) and low loadings (L=2.31 L L-1 d(-1), G = 10.03 L L-1 d(-1)) tended to the plug-flow. The axial dispersion decreases along the height of the SSSAB. The fluid in the reactor mixed completely after the actual completely mixed time Gum, which decreases from 1.54 to 0.44 with the loading rate increases. The maximum and minimum values of the mean increasing rate v(m) are 14.00 and 0.72 at super-high and loading rate, respectively. And eta positively correlates to the number of tanks N and negatively to v(m). Reducing v(m) and enlarging N are the favorable method to further improve the treatment efficiency for the reactor operated under low or medium loading and high or super-high loading conditions, respectively.

Initially, the biotinylated primer DNA (P-DNA) was complementary with aptamer to form dsDNA which was further linked to streptavidin-coated magnetic bead (MB), thereby fabricating the expected MB-based aptasensor. In the presence of target TB, the aptamer was taken away from the aptasensor, and the free P-DNA immediately triggered HCR to spontaneously form DNA concatemer-directed nanochains with numerous DNAzymes and Pt nanoclusters (PtNCs) to achieve cascades signal amplification. The dual peroxidase mimetics catalyzed the H2O2-mediated oxidation of colorless 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into the colored TMB oxides (oxTMB), causing intensified color change of the chromogenic solution for the highly sensitive naked-eye detection of as low as 100.0 pM TB. In this strategy, the employment of magnetic separation and exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted digestion of residual dsDNA minimized the background noise and avoided the false positive results, greatly improving the detection accuracy and sensitivity with a low limit of detection (LOD=15.0 pM). The proposed visual platform has promise for detecting various types of proteins with careful DNA sequence designs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using renewal process theory and total probability decomposition technique, the authors study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursive expression of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursive formula for calculating the steady state queue length at arbitrary time epoch n(+). Meanwhile, the authors obtain the explicit expressions of the additional queue length distribution. Furthermore, the important relations between the steady state queue length distributions at different time epochs n(-), n and n(+) are also reported. Finally, the authors give numerical examples to illustrate the effect of system parameters on the steady state queue length distribution, and also show from numerical results that the expressions of the steady state queue length distribution is important in the system capacity design.

Simulation results show that 1) Plunger cavity cavitation degree increase nearly one time when the piston pump rotation rate increase from 1500 r/min to 3000 r/min; 2) The axial piston pump L shape throttling groove is more conductive to inhibiting cavitation of plunger cavity than the V shape; 3) The variation law which shows the influence of the thickness of cylinder kidney shape port on the cavitation of plunger cavity. This paper put forward the two-way inclined type cylinder barrel kidney shape port, which was beneficial to improve the self-sucking of the plunger cavity under high speed rotation and could inhibit the cavitation of plunger cavity. The Kriging agent model of has been established by taking the configuration parameters of one-way inclined cylinder kidney shape port as independent variables and the mean value of the gas volume fraction of plunger cavity as target function, based on the Kriging interpolation principle. The optimized structure of the one-way inclined type cylinder barrel kidney shape port is obtained through the Kriging agent model which is optimized by using improved genetic algorithm.

Potentiodynamic polarization measurements, weight loss measurements and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the corrosion inhibition of Cl-EPP for mild steel in sulfuric acid. The results of electrochemical measurements indicate that the Cl-EPP is a mixed type inhibitor. Meanwhile, the inhibition efficiency increase with the increasing of concentration of inhibitor concentration, decrease with the increasing of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration and storage time. In addition, the adsorption of Cl-EPP on mild steel surface is chemical adsorption, and obeys Langmuir isotherm.

The synthesized samples were characterized by scanning microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET). The photocatalytic performance of the samples was evaluated via the photocatalytic degradation process of methylene blue (MB) and phenol under UV-light irradiation. Compared to pure ZnO, the ZnO/BSA composites exhibited superior photocatalytic activity, which could be attributed to the distensible surface area and the effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. Besides, the BSA used as a template could promote the photocatalysts to absorb more dye particles on its surface and improve degradation performance, which could be applied in a similar fashion between the protein and MB.

Compared with normal Fuqu, Rhodiola rosea Fuqu demonstrated higher spore numbers, spore germination rates, protease activity, liquefying amylase activity and total acid and amino acid nitrogen. Specifically, the spore number was 1.36 times that of regular Fuqu. Protease activity, liquefying amylase activity, total acid and amino acid nitrogen were 0.475 g/100mL, 104.16 U/g dry Qu, 35.67 mmol/L and 26.08 g/100mL, respectively. These values were 21.48, 7.41, 6.07 and 67.82% higher than the regular Fuqu. The Rhodiola rosea soy sauce indices were also better than those for the control. The DPPH scavenging abilities of R. rosea soy sauce, control soy sauce, market soy sauce 1 and market soy sauce 2 were 74.25, 44.01, 34.73 and 11.38%, respectively. The total phenolic content in these four samples was 387.38, 309.23, 212.85 and 202.60mg GAE/g, respectively. As observed with the DPPH and total phenolic assay, the R. rosea soy sauce showed the highest antioxidant capacity. A simple, rapid, and sensitive determination method of salidroside in R. rosea Fuqu and R. rosea soy sauce using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS was developed and validated with multiple reaction monitoring in the negative mode.

It is found that an appropriate content of carbonaceous filler is needed for forming well-ordered parallel vorticity-aligned stripes and the content depends on the category of the filler. Interestingly, the lowest aspect ratio carbon black (CB) with lowest electrical conductivity is the best candidate for fabricating ACF. The film with CB stripes shows excellent conductive anisotropy: the electrical resistivity in the direction parallel to the CB stripes is almost eight orders of magnitude lower than that in the perpendicular direction. The formation mechanism of the vorticity-aligned stripe is also investigated by the rheological measurement and the study of morphological evolution. It is found that the coalescence of dispersed phase or aggregates dominates the formation and growth of the stripe and negative value of the first normal stress difference drives the stripe to align along the vorticity direction.

Conventional RF input cavities, however, encounter the problem of power capacity in the high frequency band due to the scaling law of the working frequency and device size. In this paper, an X-band overmoded input cavity is proposed and investigated. A resonant reflector is employed to reflect the microwave and isolate the input cavity from the diode and RF extractor. The resonant property of the overmoded input cavity is proved by simulations and cold tests, with PIC simulation showing that with a beam voltage of 600 kV and current of 7 kA, an input power of 90 kW is sufficient to modulate the beam with a modulation depth of 3%.

The shared software and hardware resources and information can be provided to the computers and other equipments according to the demands of users. A majority of services are deployed through outsourcing. Outsourcing computation allows resource-constrained clients to outsource their complex computation workloads to a powerful server which is rich of computation resources. Modular exponentiation is one of the most complex computations in public key based cryptographic schemes. It is useful to reduce the computation cost of the clients by using outsourcing computation. In this paper, we propose a novel outsourcing algorithm for modular exponentiation based on the new mathematical division under the setting of two non-colluding cloud servers. The base and the power of the outsourced data can be kept private and the efficiency is improved compared with former works.

We choose some suitable adaptive synchronization controllers to ensure the robust synchronization of this dynamical network.

The two strains, when applied as soil drenches or seed treatments in greenhouse experiments, reduced root-knot severity and incidence on tomato compared to no-bacteria controls. In tomato field trials conducted in separate years, soil drench treatment with either strain reduced root-knot disease levels and increased yields compared to the control. Levels of disease control and yield enhancement provided by the strains were higher than those using the chemicals abamectin and carbofuran. This is the first report of B. methylotrophicus being used as a biocontrol agent against a plant parasitic nematode and the first demonstration that B. methylotrophicus and L. antibioticus can suppress disease caused by root-knot nematodes in the field.

Structural analysis shows that complex 1 contains repeat "8"-shape building units that are linked to each other by the bridging coordination action of 4-bpo, forming a 3D network. The introduction of 4,4'-bipyridine results in the size variance of complex 2, which consists of 1D meso-helical chain, 2D multilayer architecture and 3D network formed by intermolecular pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions and hydrogen bonds. All these indicate that the change of secondary ligand might be the key of the extended supramolecular networks of the lower-dimensional coordination polymers.

Hydrothermal reaction was applied to synthesize different kinds of ceria nanoparticles, hollow nanospheres and nanorods of zinc silicate to immobilized ferric thiocyanate [Fe(SCN)(3)] which were subsequently combined to construct a 3x3 colorimetric sensor array. Performance of the colorimetric sensor array was evaluated using 5 kinds of tea polyphenols and 14 kinds of tea fusions with 5 repeated parallels. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of the colorimetric profiles suggested that all 5 kinds of tea polyphenols can be easily differentiated with good reproducibility. Correct discrimination of 14 kinds of tea fusions was also realized according to individual quality grade and categories. Our preliminary study provides a potential alternative for fast visible detection and discrimination of teas within different qualities and grades.

In such a photoelectrocatalytic system, highly ordered titanium dioxide nanotubes served as a highly active photoanode for photoelectrocatalytic degradation of ofloxacin; and titanium plate was used as the cathode, on which Cu2+ ions were electrodeposited. Compared with other treatment methods including photo catalysis, electrochemistry and direct photolysis, photoelectrocatalytic technique exhibited the highest removal efficiency for either ofloxacin or Cu2+. To obtain the optimum photoelectrocatalytic operation conditions, some influencing factors such as current, pH and supporting electrolyte concentration were investigated systematically. The mutual influence analysis indicated that the photoelectrocatalytic removal efficiency of ofloxacin was first promoted by Cu2+ but was then suppressed with prolonging the treatment time; whereas the removal of Cu2+ was always promoted by ofloxacin over the whole photoelectrocatalytic treatment process. Furthermore, the photoelectrocatalytic removal of ofloxacin -Cu2+ was studied by differential pulse voltammetry and high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The results indicated that although Cu2+ influenced the removal rate of ofloxacin, it did not change the degradation mechanism of ofloxacin. The formation of an electroactive intermediate product during the photoelectrocatalytic process was clearly observed by voltammetric analysis. Based on intermediate products identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, a possible photoelectrocatalytic removal mechanism for ofloxacin -Cu2+ was proposed.

In this study, adaptive evolution of Lactobacillus casei was conducted in MRS broth at 37 degrees C for 70 days, and three acid-tolerant strains were isolated. The evolved strains exhibited more than 60% increases in biomass than the parental strain when cultured at pH 4.3 for 54 h. Then, the tolerances of the evolved strains to acid stress, bile salt, and simulated gastrointestinal juice were determined. Acid tolerance was investigated by exposing the evolved strains and the parental strain in pH 3.3 and pH 2.5 of lactic acid and HC1-adjusted MRS broth respectively. The evolved strains showed higher survival rate than the parental strain. In addition, the evolved strains exhibited higher resistance to simulated gastric juice (pH 2.5), simulated intestinal juice (pH 8.0), and bile salt (1.6%). Analysis of the intracellular pH (pH) showed that the evolved strains exhibited higher pH, compared with that in parental strain. The enhanced tolerance of the evolved strains to various stresses observed in this study provides a possible procedure for the food industry to select environmental-resistant strains and may be important in the production of probiotics.

J	Wu, SL; Al-Khaleel, M				Wu, Shu-Lin; Al-Khaleel, Mohammad			Convergence analysis of the Neumann-Neumann waveform relaxation method for time-fractional RC circuits	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Waveform relaxation; Parameter optimization; Convergence analysis; RC circuits; Time-fractional problems	DIFFERENTIAL-ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS; TRANSMISSION-LINES; SIMULATION	The classical waveform relaxation (WR) methods rely on decoupling the large-scale ODEs system into small-scale subsystems and then solving these subsystems in a Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel pattern. However, in general it is hard to find a clever partition and for strongly coupled systems the classical WR methods usually converge slowly and non-uniformly. On the contrary, the WR methods of longitudinal type, such as the Robin-WR method and the Neumann-Neumann waveform relaxation (NN-WR) method, possess the advantages of simple partitioning procedure and uniform convergence rate. The Robin-WR method has been extensively studied in the past few years, while the NN-WR method is just proposed very recently and does not get much attention. It was shown in our previous work that the NN-WR method converges much faster than the Robin-WR method, provided the involved parameter, namely beta, is chosen properly. In this paper, we perform a convergence analysis of the NN-WR method for time-fractional RC circuits, with special attention to the optimization of the parameter beta. For time-fractional PDEs, this work corresponds to the study of the NN-WR method at the semi-discrete level. We present a detailed numerical test of this method, with respect to convergence rate, CPU time and asymptotic dependence on the problem/discretization parameters, in the case of two-and multi-subcircuits.

Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) was used as an additive to improve the anti-corrosion ability of anodization film. The anodization film was characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The anti-corrosion ability of the film was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectrum. The results show that VO3- ions react with Mg2+ to form yellow magnesium vandate. Magnesium oxide in anodization film is restrained by VO3-. The pores on the film decreases and the cracks can be filled by the addition of NH4VO3. The film also becomes smoother and compacter which increase the resistance of film and charge transfer resistance of the corrosion process of the AZ31B magnesium alloy. The anti-corrosion ability of the anodization film is obviously enhanced.

J	Wu, SL				Wu, Shu-Lin			Convergence Analysis of the Parareal-Euler Algorithm for Systems of ODEs with Complex Eigenvalues	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Parareal algorithm; Backward-Euler; Convergence analysis; Complex eigenvalues	TIME METHOD; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; PARALLEL; PDES; INTEGRATORS	Parareal is an iterative algorithm and is characterized by two propagators and , which are respectively associated with large step size and small step size , where and is an integer. The choice Backward-Euler denotes the simplest implicit parareal solver, which we call Parareal-Euler, and has been studied widely in recent years. For linear problem with being a symmetric positive definite matrix, this algorithm converges very fast and the convergence rate is insensitive to the change of J and . However, for the case that the spectrum of contains complex values, no provable results are available in the literature so far. Previous studies based on numerical plotting show that we can not expect convergence for the Parareal-Euler algorithm on the whole right-hand side of the complex plane. Here, we consider a representative situation: with , i.e., the spectrum is contained in a sectorial region. Spectrum distribution of this type arises naturally for semi-discretizing a wide rang of time-dependent PDEs, e.g., the Fokker-Planck equations. We derive condition, which is independent of J and depends on only, to ensure convergence of the Parareal-Euler algorithm. Numerical results for initial value and time-periodic problems are provided to support our theoretical conclusions.

The specific surface area, structure, morphology, and the separation rate of photo-induced charge pairs of the photocatalysts were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy(DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, respectively. XRD patterns and DRS demonstrated that Ag2CO3 has no effect on the crystal phase and bandgap of (BiO)(2)CO3. The existence of Ag2CO3 in the composites enhances the separation rate of photo-induced charge pairs of the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic performance of Ag2CO3/(BiO)(2)CO3 was evaluated by the decolorization of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution under simulated solar irradiation. It was found that the simulated solar-induced photocatalytic activity of Ag2CO3/(BiO)(2)CO3 copmposites was significantly improved, which was mainly attributed to the enhanced surface area and the separation rate of photo-induced charge pairs.

These schemes are based on optical selection rules realized with a single electron charged self-assembled GaAs/InAs quantum dot in a micropillar resonator. Compared with previous photonic protocols, the first scheme is to replace the entangled-state resources with much simpler single-photon resources and has a deterministic success probability. Moreover, the cavity-QED system may be used to generate four-spin entangled decoherence-free states and hybrid four-qubit of spin-photon entangled decoherence-free states. These states may be applied up to different requirements because of different superiorities of photons and spins. All schemes may be implemented with current physical technologies.

The main aim of this paper is to present a survey of the comparative performance evaluation among the state-of-the-art OSG-PLLs (include Delay-PLL, Deri-PLL, Park-PLL, SOGI-PLL, DOEC-PLL, VTD-PLL, CCF-PLL, and TPFA-PLL) under different grid disturbances such as voltage sags, phase, and frequency jumps, and in the presence of dc offset, harmonic components, and white noise in their input.

The structure of the derivative was characterized by IR and UV-vis spectrum. The weight loss and AC impedance found that the inhibition efficiency increased with the increase in concentration of the inhibitor but decreased with rise in temperature, the corrosion inhibition efficiency attains 91.26% in 8 x 10(-2) g/L concentration at 30 degrees C. The polarization studies showed that the studied amino acid derivative can be used as a corrosion inhibitor. The surface of inhibited and uninhibited specimens was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and the adsorption of the inhibitor on the mild steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The quantum chemical descriptors such as the energy of highest occupied molecular orbital, energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were calculated and the inhibition mechanism can be analyzed by the distribution of electrons. Analysis indicated that the inhibitor molecular and empty d orbital of metal forms the coordination bond, coverson the surface of metal, and prevents corrosion reaction.

There remains a great challenge in the development of signal amplification method for biomolecules detection. Herein, we describe a novel signal amplification strategy based on the formation of guanine nanowire for quantitative detection of nucleic acids and proteins (thrombin) at room temperature. In the presence of analytes and magnesium ions, the guanine nanowire could be formed within 10 min. Compared to the widely used single G-quadruplex biocatalytic label unit, the detection limits are improved by two orders of magnitude in our assay. The proposed enzyme-free method avoids fussy chemical label-ling process, complex programming task, and sophisticated equipment, which might provide an ideal candidate for the fabrication of selective and sensitive biosensing platform.

First of all, nonlinear equations about forces exerted on haze particles are obtained according to the Newton's second law, and these main forces ( air drag force, van der Waals repulsion, rotary lift force) on the haze particles are solved by integrating these nonlinear equations by the Runge-Kutta method. The facts that the concentrations of particles with diameters in a range from 0.5 mu m to 0.835 mu m increased obviously in the haze particles test on December 17-25, 2013 and February 20-26, 2014 in Xi'an are verified. Secondly, the laser gradient force is analyzed and calculated in the homogeneous medium of haze particles. It is found that the system balanced by the force exerted on haze particles is destroyed completely by laser gradient force, because the magnitude of laser gradient force is always larger than any other forces exerted on haze particles. Therefore, it is feasible to eliminate these haze particles by laser gradient force. It is undoubted that the proposed way of eliminating haze particles is of great significance to establish harmonious surroundings for human.

The percentage of intramuscular lipid in cooked-longissimus dorsi (LD) (dry weight %) were in the order mentioned below: microwaving > foil-baking > stewing. All treated samples showed decrease in the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), whilst increase in the proportion of saturated (SFA) and n-6/n-3 value during processing. All of the cooked samples had the n-6/n-3 ratio within the recommended range (5-10). By the analysis of partial least squares regression (PLSR), the microwaving treatment was better to keep the stability of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), whilst the long-time Al foil-baking did the most serious damage to UFA, especially the PUFA. In addition, the heating method showed greater influence on the samples than the processing time. The shorter processing time was better to retain the intramuscular PUFA of Hyla rabbit, especially the LC-PUFAs (C20-22). Considering all the factors, microwaving showed the superiority in reserving the composition of intramuscular fatty acids of Hyla rabbit.

The effect of heat treatment temperature and flowing of nitrogen gas were investigated. A catalyst with the highest activity can be obtained at 700 degrees C. Mn(II) ion was changed to MnO in heat treatment, which improved the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Hexamethylenetetramine takes part in the formation of active site of the catalyst as its decomposed gases. The flowing of protective gas takes the decomposed gases out of the tube furnace and brings negative effect on the catalytic activity of the MnHMTA/C catalyst.

The bonding strength between filler and rubber was investigated by AFM, mechanical tests and a bonding test using solvent extraction with xylene. Results indicate that the silica has an excellent reinforcing performance at normal temperature, but the bond energy is weakened at high temperatures. High-structure carbon blacks exhibit excellent reinforcement and bonding stability at low to high temperatures, and vulcanized rubbers have the highest tensile strength and can withstand the highest tensile stress, and are considered the best fillers. Low-structure carbon blacks show an intermediate reinforcing performance between the silica and the high-structure carbon blacks, but their reinforcement is best at ultra high temperatures.

The traditional quantum adiabatic algorithms use the linear interpolating to construct quantum evolution paths. We construct special evolution paths to speedup quantum evolutions. By choosing state-dependent correlations some constant time evolution paths may be generated. This result is very useful quantum adiabatic simulations.

The impulses are classified into two classes: the ones are input disturbances and the ones are stabilizing. For each type of impulses, by adopting proper Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions for global exponential dissipativity are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The new sufficient conditions can explicitly reveal the influence of time delay, impulses, etc., on the dissipativity. We show that these conditions can be straightforwardly reduced to exponential stability conditions and that these stability conditions are remarkably less conservative than the existing ones. Numerical results are given to show the less conservatism of the obtained criteria compared to the existing ones.

And the as-prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), photoluminescence (PL) and the photocurrent response. The results show that the appropriate load content of CCN is conducive to form well-morphology CCN-CuS heterojunctions. And the formation of CCN-CuS p-n heterojunctions is both beneficial to achieve higher charge separation efficiency and promote its photocatalytic performance to RhB dye without the existence of H2O2, which is commonly used as the sources of hydroxyl radicals to assist photocatalytic process. Besides, the as-synthesized 5CCN-CuS NFs show good stability and no obvious inactivation occurred after five degradation cycles runs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the lowest energy structures of [AunRb](+) clusters, the planar to three-dimensional transformation is found to occur at cluster size n = 4 and the Rb atoms prefer being located at the most highly coordinated position. The trends of the averaged atomic binding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order difference of energies, and energy gaps show pronounced even-odd alternations. It indicated that the clusters containing odd number of atoms maintain greater stability than the clusters in the vicinity. In particular, the [Au6Rb](+) clusters are the most stable isomer for [AunRb](+) clusters in the region of n = 1-10. The charges in [AunRb](+) clusters transfer from the Rb atoms to Au-n host. Density of states revealed that the Au-5d, Au-5p, and Rb-4p orbitals hardly participated in bonding. In addition, it is found that the most favourable channel of the [AunRb](+) clusters is Rb+ cation ejection. The electronic localisation function (ELF) analysis of the [AunRb](+) clusters shown that strong interactions are not revealed in this study.

According to optimized CunS geometries, the dominant growth pattern is described as one Cu atom being added on the Cun-1S clusters. The planar (C-2v) Cu2S cluster is the most stable geometries of CunS clusters. From n = 3, the doped systems show the appearance of three-dimensional (3D) geometries. In addition, the calculated HOMO-LUMO gaps are in the energy range of 1.42-2.96 eV, which make CunS clusters suitable candidates for renewable energy sources. At last, the molecular orbital energy, density of states, electrostatic potential and electron density deformation are also respectively analyzed for realizing the doped microscopic mechanism and providing strong support for essential theoretical and experimental research.

The network consists of a pair of partially complementary DNA hairpins (HP1 and HP2) with 3' overhang ends, between which the spontaneous hybridization is kinetically hindered by the stems. The target DNA is repeatedly used to trigger a recycling progress between the hairpins, generating numerous HP1-HP2 duplex complexes. Exo III was then employed to digest the double strand parts of the residual hairpins and the intermediate products. The fluorescent dye, SYBR Green I, binds to the double-strand DNA products and emits strong fluorescence to achieve sensitive detection of the target DNA with the detection limit of 5.34 pM. Moreover, this proposed strategy showed high discrimination efficiency towards target DNA against mismatched DNA and was successfully applied in the analysis of human serum sample.

Here, we investigate the tunable plasmon in one-dimensional h-BN/graphene/h-BN quantum-well structures. The analysis of optical response and field enhancement demonstrates that these systems exhibit a distinct quantum confinement effect for the collective oscillations. The intensity and frequency of the plasmon can be controlled by the barrier width and electrical doping. Moreover, the electron doping and the hole doping lead to very different results due to the asymmetric energy band. This graphene/h-BN hybrid structure may pave the way for future optoelectronic devices.

The effects of modification time on the wettability of the coatings were investigated using the contact angle measuring device. The surface morphologies and structure of the coatings were evaluated using SEM, XRD and FT-IR. The corrosion resistance was investigated by potentiodynamic polarization curves and long-term immersion test. The results showed that the water contact angle (CA) increases gradually with modification time from 0 to 5 h, the highest CA reaches 138 degrees after being modified for 5 h, and the number and size of the micro pores are decreased. The modification method hardly alters crystalline structure of the MAO coating, but improves the corrosion resistance based on the much positive potential and low current density. Moreover, the corrosion resistance and hydrophobicity can be enhanced with increasing the alkyl chain. The wetting and spreading for the alkylcarboxylate with low surface energy become easier on the micro-porous surface, and alkylcarboxylate monolayer will be formed through bidentate bonding, which changes the surface micropores to a sealing or semi-sealing structure and makes the MAO coating dense and hydrophobic. All the results demonstrate that the modification process improves the corrosion protection ability of the MAO coating on AZ31B Mg alloy.

However, most of them focus on quantum transformations on the same degree of freedom (DOF) of quantum systems. We propose a CNOT gate performed on the polarization DOF and spatial mode DOF of one photon system assisted by a quantum dot in double-side optical microcavities. This hyper CNOT gate is implemented by using spin selective photon reflection from the cavity, without auxiliary spatial modes or polarization modes. This interface can also be used to construct a hyper photonic Bell-state analyzer. The high fidelities of the hyper CNOT gates may be achieved with low side leakage and cavity loss.

The bioflocculant was then subjected to component analysis for saccharides, proteins, glycoprotein, osamine, fat, and nucleic acid using the Molisch reaction, Biuret reaction, Anthrone reaction, Elson-Morgan method, Soxhlet extraction method, and spectrophotometry, respectively. The results demonstrated that the prepared bioflocculant was able to remove total nitrogen, COD, and colority from tannery wastewater. Component analysis revealed that the bioflocculant contained saccharides and proteins, which may have existed as glycoproteins, in addition to osamines and fats. The bioflocculant did not contain nucleic acid. These results will contribute to future research into the mechanism by which bioflocculants remove contaminants from tannery wastewater.

SYSTEMATIC REGULARITY OF HEMISPHERIC SUNSPOT AREAS OVER THE PAST 140 YEARS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; Sun: magnetic fields; sunspots	NORTH-SOUTH ASYMMETRY; TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE; CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; POLAR FIELD REVERSALS; LOW-DIMENSIONAL CHAOS; LONG-TERM VARIATIONS; N-S ASYMMETRY; TIME-SERIES; FLARE INDEX; MAUNDER MINIMUM	Solar magnetic activity varies with time in the two hemispheres in different ways. The hemispheric interconnection of solar activity phenomena provides an important clue to understanding the dynamical behavior of solar dynamo actions. In this paper, several analysis approaches are proposed to analyze the systematic regularity of hemispheric asynchronism and amplitude asymmetry of long-term sunspot areas during solar cycles 9-24. It is found that, (1) both the hemispheric asynchronism and the amplitude asymmetry of sunspot areas are prevalent behaviors and are not anomalous, but the hemispheric asynchronism exhibits a much more regular behavior than the amplitude asymmetry; (2) the phase-leading hemisphere returns back to the identical hemisphere every 8 solar cycles, and the secular periodic pattern of hemispheric phase differences follows 3 (south leading) + 5 (north leading) solar cycles, which probably corresponds to the Gleissberg cycle; and (3) the pronounced periodicities of (absolute and normalized) asymmetry indices and lines of synchronization (LOSs) are not identical: the significant periodic oscillations are 80.65 +/- 6.31, 20.91 +/- 0.40, and 13.45 +/- 0.16 years for the LOS values, and 51.34 +/- 2.48, 8.83/8.69 +/- 0.07, and 3.77 +/- 0.02 years for the (absolute and normalized) asymmetry indices. The analysis results improve our knowledge on the hemispheric interrelation of solar magnetic activity and may provide valuable constraints for solar dynamo models.	[Deng, L. H.; Xiang, Y.

The two special rotation cycles of 26.6 and 28.5 days should be derived from different magnetic flux elements in the SMMF. The rotation cycle of the weak magnetic flux element in the SMMF is 26.6 days, while the rotation cycle of the strong magnetic flux element in the SMMF is 28.5 days. The two rotation periods of the structure of the interplanetary magnetic field near the ecliptic plane are essentially related to weak and strong magnetic flux elements in the SMMF, respectively. The rotation cycle of weak magnetic flux in the SMMF did not vary over the last 40 years because the weak magnetic flux element derived from the weak magnetic activity on the full disk is not influenced by latitudinal migration. Neither the internal rotation of the Sun nor the solar magnetic activity on the disk (including the solar polar fields) causes the annual variation of SMMF. The variation of SMMF at timescales of a solar cycle is more related to weak magnetic activity on the full solar disk.	[Xiang, N.

The active species were investigated using scavengers. The photocatalytic activities of (BiO)(2)CO3/BiOI heterojunctions towards discoloration of rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sun light irradiation were evaluated. Benefiting from enhanced charge separation efficiency, the composite photocatalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic performance than the pure BiOI. Finally, the possible reason was discussed.

After fermentation, the pork jerky was subjected to sensory evaluation and the levels of pH, free amino acids, and volatile compounds were measured. The results showed that the fermented pork jerky had a better sensory evaluation score (score: 93.2), lower pH value (3.54), and more free amino acids (39.24 mg/100 g). Furthermore, in the fermented pork jerky, the content of three acids (18.552%) was high, which lowered the pH of the pork jerky and inhibited growth of pathogens. Moreover, some new compounds produced, including 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (49.095%), 2,3-butanediol (2.790%), 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2.400%), oxalic acid isobutyl hexyl ester (2.280%), phenylethyl alcohol (0.953%), and eucalyptol (0.659%), contributed to the flavour of pork jerky. Overall, our results demonstrated that P. acidilactici can be used for the production as well as improvement of the quality and flavour of fermented pork jerky.

The structure, composition, corrosion resistance, and tribological behaviour of the coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electrochemical and long-term immersion test, and ball on-disc friction test. The results show that a dense 92 pin thick B-coating was tightly deposited onto the MAO-coated Mg alloy and exhibited a good mechanical interlock along the rough interface. Compared with the MAO-coated sample, the corrosion current density of the MAOB-coated Mg alloy decreased by two or three orders of magnitude and no corrosion phenomenon was observed during a long-term immersion test of about 500 h (severe corrosion pits were found for MAO-treated samples after about 168 h of immersion). The frictional coefficient values of the MAOB coating were similar to those of the MAO coating using dry sliding tests, while the B-coating on the MAO-coated surface significantly improved the wear resistance of the AZ91D Mg alloy. All of these results indicate that a B-coating can be used to further protect Mg alloys from corrosion and wear by providing a thick, dense barrier. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we used the Yorkshire pig as a control to analyze the Tibetan pig-specific liver miRNAome, and for preliminary investigation of differentially expressed miRNAs participating in metabolism. A comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig liver miRNAomes by small RNA sequencing identified 362 unique miRNAs. Among these, 304 were co-expressed in both libraries, and 10 and 48 miRNAs were specifically expressed. Differential expression analysis of miRNAs, miRNA target prediction and KEGG analysis revealed that differentially expressed miRNAs were associated mainly with the metabolism of glucose, lipid and protein. Six differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-326, miR-1, miR-335, miR-185 and miR-378) participating in the metabolism of glucose and lipid were identified. Additionally, qPCR results revealed that a lower expression of miR-34a in Tibetan pig liver may promote gluconeogenesis by increasing the expression of Sirtuin type 1 (Sirt1); a lower expression of miR-1 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the synthesis and accumulation of lipid by increasing the expression of Liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha); and a lower expression of miR-185 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the uptake of cholesterol from blood and secretion of bile by increasing the expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Our results provide new information and understanding of porcine miRNA profiles, which may help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in the metabolic functions of Tibetan pig liver, and provide new biomarkers to assist in the development of Tibetan pig breeding characteristics.

Many large and medium-sized W, Mo, Cu, Au deposits have been found in this region so far. So metallogenic potential of southern Anhui is tremendous. This study aims to analyze the granitic petrogenesis, oxygen fugacity, and mineralization potential by selecting multiple small granites in study area. Results showed that there are two-episodic granites with entirely different features: the one formed in the 160 similar to 140 +/- 5Ma is mainly composed of granodiorite, and maybe related to northwestward subduction of oceanic plate during Late Jurassic; the other formed in the 140 +/- 5 similar to 120Ma is mainly composed of granite, syenogranite, alkali granite, and formed in a within-plate extensional setting during the Early Cretaceous. The content of trace elements in zircon showed that the granites formed during 160 similar to 140 +/- 5Ma generally have higher Ce4+/Ce3+ value, namely the granitic magma have high oxygen fugacity; whereas the granites formed during 140 +/- 5 similar to 120Ma generally have lower Ce4+/Ce3+ value, indicating the magma with low oxygen fugacity. By analyzing the relationships between oxygen fugacity and mineralization, we believed that the granites formed during 160 similar to 140 +/- 5Ma in southern Anhui have a good copper, gold, molybdenum prospecting potential.

In the range of our study, the liquid CO2-N-2 mixture undergoes a continuous transition from molecular to atomic fluid state and liquid polymerization inferred from pair correlation functions (PCFs) and the distribution of various molecular components.

It is discovered that V776 Cas is an early F-type (F2V) overcontact binary with a very high contact degree (f = 64.6%) and an extremely low-mass ratio (q = 0.130), which indicate that it is at the final evolutionary stage of cool short-period binaries. The mass of the primary and secondary stars are calculated to be M-1 = 1.55 (+/- 0.04) M circle dot, M-2 = 0.20(+/- 0.01) M circle dot. V776 Cas is supposed to be formed from an initially detached binary system via the loss of angular momentum due to the magnetic wind. The initial masses of the present primary and secondary components are calculated to be M-1i = 0.86(+/- 0.10) M circle dot and M-2i = 2.13(+/- 0.04) M circle dot. The observed-calculated curve exhibits a cyclic period variation, which is due to the light-travel time effect caused by the presence of a third component with a period of 23.7 years. The mass of the third component is estimated to be M3 = 1.04(+/- 0.03) M circle dot and the orbital inclination of the third component is calculated to be i' = 33 degrees.1. The distance of the binary system to the mass center of the triple system is calculated to be a'(12) = 3.45 AU. The presence of the close-in tertiary component may play an important role in the formation and evolution of this binary system by drawing angular momentum from the central system.

In this study, acid tolerance response of T. halophilus was investigated based on physiological and proteomic analysis. The optimal acid-adaptation condition was optimized to stimulate acid tolerance response effectively. After acid adaptation at pH 4.0 for 1 h, the highest survival rate at lethal pH 2.5 was observed. Analysis of the physiological data showed that higher intracellular pH and NH4+ pool were detected in cells adapted at pH 4.0 compared with cells without acid adaptation. In addition, the activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were determined, and significantly higher activities were monitored in cells after acid adaptation. Comparison of the intracellular amino acid pools indicated that six amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, isoleucine, leucine, citrulline, ornithine) exhibited notable alternations during acid treatments, and acid pre-adaption led to higher pools of amino acid compared to that without acid pre-treatment. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that eight proteins (Glk, Pfk, Fba, Gap, Gpm, Eno, Pyk, and Ldh) involved in carbohydrate metabolism and three classic stress response proteins (Ssb, UspA, and GroL) were up-regulated after acid adaptation. Results presented in this study may help to further understand the acid tolerance response in T. halophilus and improve the industrial performance of this species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The reactive radicals during the photocatalytic reaction were detected by scavenger experiments. BiOI/TiO2 composites exhibit higher performance than the pure TiO2 towards photocatalytic decolorization of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution, when the molar ratio of Bi/Ti is 2%, the sample has the highest photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of BiOI/TiO2 could be ascribed to the separation properties of photo-induced charge carriers and strong interaction between BiOI and TiO2. Based on the observations, a Z-scheme charge separation mechanism was proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Under the situation of increasingly strict environmental legislation, all kinds of ecofriendly fungicides were explored recently to replace the currently used noxious ones in leather industry. Meanwhile, a non-traditional new type of leather, called antimicrobial function leather, attracted more and more attention from leather chemists and technologists, because of its tempting antimicrobial protection provided and wide application prospects in many fields such as medical materials, health products, daily products, public transport vehicles, and so on. Based on the literatures published in the past decade, especially in the past five years, this review systematically and comprehensively summarizes current status and development trend about leather fungicides and antimicrobial function leather. The discussed antimicrobials contain traditional organic synthetic fungicides with small molecular weight, natural essential oils, macromolecular polymers and chitosan derivatives, and nano-inorganic antimicrobials (nanosilver, nano-ZnO, nano TiO2, nano-SiO2, etc.). Finally, several proposals are addressed for the development of new leather fungicides and antimicrobial function leather, and especially, a new viewpoint, in which the antimicrobial leather is prepared based on various tanning mechanisms, is demonstrably presented to solve the problem of loose combination between antimicrobial substances and leather fibers.

In this study, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was added to a cold caustic extraction (CCE) process to promote removal of hemicelluloses from a softwood sulfite dissolving pulp. The content of hemicelluloses was considerably decreased from 11.4 % in the original sample to 5.3 % in the PEG/CCE-treated sample under the studied conditions. This positive result of PEG addition can be explained by (1) improved inward penetration and diffusion of NaOH into the fiber structure and outward diffusion of hemicelluloses from the fiber structure to the bulk phase, and (2) enhanced fiber swelling due to inclusion of PEG in the fiber walls and improved NaOH diffusion. Moreover, the effects of PEG/CCE treatment on the distribution of hemicelluloses in the fiber walls and the molecular weight of the residual hemicelluloses in the resulting pulp were investigated.

Interestingly, the target DNA (T-DNA) could hybridize with the inert dumbbell-shaped DNA (D-DNA) to form a duplex DNA containing two sticky termini. The duplex DNA was then hybridized with the capture DNA (C-DNA) and the DNA concatamer reaction proceeded. The ternary self-assembly method was chosen to obtain the low-density C-DNA without reciprocal winding on the gold electrode for high-efficient concatamers hybridization. Hexaammineruthenium chloride was herein used as an electrochemical probe and could intercalate into the groove of double-helix DNA via electrostatic effect. The resultant supersandwich biosensor showed a high sensitivity for the T-DNA detection and a linear dependence between the reduction peak currents and logarithm of T-DNA concentrations in the range of 100.0 fM-10.0 nM with a relatively low detection limit of 30.0 fM. Moreover, the proposed biosensor exhibited favorable specificity and regenerability, and provided a new alternative to detect various target analytes by changing the sequence of capture probe and dumbbell probes, holding great potential for early diagnosis in gene-related diseases.

The photocatalytic activity of alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 for decolorization of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution was evaluated. The results show that alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic performance than the pure g-C3N4 under simulated sun light irradiation. The remarkably increased performance of alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 in photocatalysis could be attributed to the increased specific surface area, the enhanced light absorbance, the improved separation efficiency of photo-induced charge carriers and the strong interaction between alpha-Fe2O3 and g-C3N4. The enhanced mechanism was proposed and proven by SPS analysis.

The hairpin DNA (H-DNA) was wisely designed with thymine-rich recognition termini and a G-quadruplex sequence in the loop and employed as a signal probe for specially recognizing trace Hg2+ by a stable T-Hg2+-T structure, which automatically triggered Exonuclease III (Exo-III) digestion to recycle Hg2+ and liberate the G-quadruplex sequence. The free G-quadruplex sequences were self-assembled into guanine nanowire (G-wire) superstructure in the presence of Mg2+ and demonstrated by gel electrophoresis. The RRS intensity was dramatically amplified by the resultant G-wires, and the maximum RRS signal at 370 nm was linear with the logarithm of Hg2+ concentration in the range of 50.0 pM to 500.0 nM (R = 0.9957). Selectivity experiments revealed that the as-prepared RRS sensor was specific for Hg2+, even coexisting with high concentrations of other metal ions. This optical aptasensor was successfully applied to identify Hg2+ in laboratory tap water and river water samples. With excellent sensitivity and selectivity, the proposed RRS aptasensor was potentially suitable for not only routine detection of Hg2+ in environmental monitoring but also various target detection just by changing the recognition sequence of the H-DNA probe.

This chemistry highlights a novel utilization of the inherent CF3S skeleton of Langlois' reagent as a CF3S feed-stock under mild conditions. The CuSCF3 intermediate generated by this protocol can react with a wide array of supporting ligands to furnish several air-stable [LCu(SCF3)] complexes as valuable trifluoromethylthiolating agents. In addition, the CuSCF3 intermediate can be directly employed for the trifluoromethylthiolation of (hetero) aryl iodides with operational simplicity and atomic efficiency.

Until now, the one-step synthesis of copper phthalocyanine micro/nano-crystals is mainly limited to the high cost physical vapor deposition technology. Herein, for the first time, we proposed a green and low-cost solvothermal method for direct synthesis of highly crystalline copper phthalocyanine needles in nontoxic anhydrous ethanol medium at 190 degrees C. The purification of the as prepared copper phthalocyanine needles just required washing unreacted reactants with ethanol. The structures and morphologies of the copper phthalocyanine needles were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffractometor, and scanning electronic microscopy, respectively. Moreover, the thermal and photoelectronic performances were investigated preliminarily. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BiOBr and IL-BiOBr were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), particle size analyzer and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), respectively. The results reveal that [EMIm]NO3 increases the specific surface area, decreases the particle size, and greatly enhances separation rate of the photo-induced charge of BiOBr. The photocatalytic activity of IL-BiOBr for decolorization of rhodamine B aqueous solution was evaluated. The results illustrate that the photocatalytic performance of IL-BiOBr is more than 2.3 times of that of the reference BiOBr and the possible reason was suggested. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The adsorption abilities of ZC and PZC to linear alkylbenzene sulfonate ( LAS) were studied. The results indicated that the Si/Al ratio of PZ was 2, 58.8% lower than that of Z( 4. 85); the point of zero net charge( PZNC), specific surface area, pore radius and pore volume of PZ were higher than those of Z; the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 4 h. ZC and PZC had a maximum adsorption capacity for LAS at pH = 2. The adsorption process was well fitted with pseudo-second order kinetic equation and Langmuir isothermal adsorption model. The amount of saturated adsorption of ZC and PZC are 12. 658 and 27. 100 mg/g, respectivey, showing that the adsorption process is described primarily for the monolayer and chemical adsorption, the adsorption of LAS on PZC is better than that on ZC in view of point of capacities and velocities.

The variations in chemical bonds are measured to elaborate reaction process and characterize ignition performance. It is found that the longer interval is, the higher ignition temperature and the longer ignition delay system has. Additionally, the heating rate has much effect on ignition temperature. Under the temperature of 1450 K, oxygen is directly released from hematite nanotube, thermite reaction is deemed as a multiphase process. And, release energy of System2 is abotit 3.96 kJ/g. However, much energy rises from alloy reaction. Thermite reactions do not follow the theoretical equation, but are a complicated process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accumulating evidence showed that puerarin (PU) possessed comprehensive biological effects. The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that the puerarin protects against enhanced liver injury caused by Ni in mice. ICR mice received intraperitoneally nickel sulfate (20 mg/kg/body weight, daily) for 20 days, and puerarin (200 and 400 mg/kg/body weight) was applied before Ni exposure. The results indicated that puerarin markedly inhibited Ni-induced liver injury, which was characterized by decreased aminotransferase activities and inflammation. Puerarin also inhibited the oxidative stress and decreased the metallothionein (MT) levels. Puerarin decreased the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 in livers. Puerarin significantly inhibited the TLR4 activation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which in turn inhibited NF-kappa B activity. Likewise, Ni-induced inflammatory responses were diminished by puerarin as observed by a remarkable reduction in the levels of phosphorylated CREB. Furthermore, puerarin also reduced inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in livers. Data from this study suggested that the inhibition of Ni-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses by puerarin is due to its ability to modulate the TLR4/p38/CREB signaling pathway.

First, a single-particle model based on kinetics of electrochemical reactions was built in this article. Then, the lithium-ion concentration and evolution of diffusion induced stresses within the single-particle model under galvanostatic operating conditions were analyzed by utilizing a mathematical method. Next, evolutions of stresses or strains in the single-particle model, together with mechanical degradation of anode materials, were elaborated in detail. Finally, in order to verify the aforementioned hypothesis, surface and morphology of the graphite-based anode dismantled from fresh and degraded cells after galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that large volume changes of anode materials caused diffusion-induced stresses during lithium-ion insertion and extraction within the active particles. The continuous accumulations of diffusion-induced stresses brought about mechanical failure of the anode eventually.

A new type of distributed faulttolerance consensus filter is designed, where each sensor can communicate with the neighbouring sensors, and filtering can be performed in a distributed coordinated function. Because the sensor networks may be disturbed by loss of transmitting effectiveness, the performance of sensor network will be degraded by using the faulted signals. Under the unknown assumption for the failures, adaptive laws are proposed to estimate the failures factors. Then based on the information of adaptive schemes, a distributed fault-tolerance consensus filter scheme is designed to guarantee that all sensors asymptotically trace the target in the presence of the uncertain faults. Simulation results are given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed distributed fault-tolerance consensus filter.

The catalytic capacity of the lanthanum complexes was investigated under different pH and the concentrations. The rate of the phosphoester hydrolysis was measured kinetically with Uv-vis spectrophotometric method, and the first-order rate constant k(cat) for the phosphoester catalytic hydrolysis was obtained through a double-reciprocal method. The results indicated that the title complex exhibited relatively high catalytic function, and the reaction rate of the phosphoester catalytic hydrolysis was about 10(8) - fold faster than that of its spontaneous hydrolysis. A pH-dependence of the reaction rate indicated that the active species as real catalyst come from the deprotonation of the water-coordinated molecules in the complex. The pUC19 DNA cleavage was completed by the gel electrophoresis. The results showed that the title complex can accelerated the breakage of supercoiled DNA at the almost physiological conditions, and both DNA and the phosphoester catalytic hydrolysis followed the same qualitative trends, and the supercoiled DNA (form I) was thoroughly cleaved to the nicked form (form II) under the appropriate conditions.

The catalytic capacity of the lanthanum complexes was investigated for the hydrolysis of bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate ester (BNPP) in aqueous solution and in CTAB micelles. Kinetic studies show that the catalytic efficiency of complex LaL is obviously higher than that of complex LaL0, and introducing acetamide into the ring of the diaza-crown ether can improve the catalytic ability of the complexes for BNPP hydrolysis. A rate enhancement of about two times was observed for the complex micelle in contrast with the complex water system for BNPP catalytic hydrolysis. The optimal pH for the catalytic reaction in the two kinds of media systems show an approximately 0.4 pH unit difference. The two complexes possess higher thermostability, and are more stable in the micelle than in aqueous solution. Based on the results and their analysis, a catalytic mechanism with cooperation of acetamide is proposed.

In the paper, an approach to incorporate classical elastic damage model in the nonordinary, state-based peridynamics is introduced. This method can model the dynamic damage process and stress change of rock-like materials. Then two instances about three-point bend experiment are simulated in the rock-like materials. Finally the conclusions are drawn that numerical results are close to the experimental results. So the method has a great predictable value in the geotechnical engineering.	[Gu, X.

First, a single particle model (SPM) based on kinetics of electrochemical reactions was built in this paper. Then the Li-ion concentration and evolution of diffusion induced stresses (DISs) within the SPM under galvanostatic operating conditions were analyzed by utilizing a mathematical method. Next, evolution of stresses or strains in the SPM, together with mechanical degradation of anode materials, was elaborated in detail. Finally, in order to verify the hypothesis aforementioned surface and morphology of the graphite-based anode dismantled from fresh and degraded cells after galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that large volume changes of anode materials caused DISs during Li-ion insertion and extraction within the active particles. The continuous accumulations of DISs brought about mechanical failure of the anode eventually.

The kinetics of hydrolysis of bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) in the catalytic system containing the surfactant ligand and cobalt(II) were investigated. The analysis of specific absorption spectra of the hydrolytic reaction systems indicated that key intermediates made up of BNPP and the Co(II) complex are formed. Here, the proposed mechanism of BNPP catalytic hydrolysis is based on the analytical result of the specific absorption spectrum and the corresponding kinetic constants are calculated. The results show that the Co(II) complex as a hydrolase mimic exhibits good catalytic activity and similar catalytic character to the natural enzyme.

Their nuclease activities on pUC19 DNA cleavage were investigated using agarose gel electrophoresis, and pseudo-first-order rate constants kobs of 0.067 h(-1) for LaL, 0.041 h(-1) for CeL, 0.013 h(-1) for LaLo, and 0.027 h(-1) CeLo were obtained (L-0 = 1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-thazacyclooctadecane). The results indicated that the CeL complex was more efficient than the LaL complex for DNA cleavage at low concentrations, but the LaL complex was more efficient than the CeL complex at high concentrations. Moreover, kinetic studies demonstrated that introducing hydroxypropyl side arms in the ring of the diazacrown ether can improve the catalytic ability of the complexes in DNA cleavage, which may be due to the hydroxypropyl side arms enhancing the bonding interaction between the complex and the DNA molecule by hydrogen bonding. A hydrolytic mechanism for DNA cleavage was demonstrated by applying several oxygen scavengers to the DNA catalytic cleavage. A proposed mechanism for the DNA cleavage shows that the hydroxypropyl side groups can recognise and bind the phosphodiester bond of DNA by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction.

The triterpenoid ganoderic acids are the main constituents of G. lucidum. To determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganoderic acids, we developed and validated a sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to determine simultaneously the concentration of 4 representative ganoderic acids in rat plasma after oral administration of the extract from G. lucidum. Because of the similarity of their chemical structures, the 4 components exhibited similar pharmacokinetic behaviors in some aspects. However, some of the pharmacokinetic parameters and the reabsorption peaks in the plasma concentration-time curves of ganoderic acids B and E after oral administration of the extract were different from those of ganoderic acids D and A because of the metabolic transformation among the ganoderic acids. These results increase our knowledge about the use of G. lucidum.

J	Wu, SL				Wu, Shu-Lin			SCHWARZ WAVEFORM RELAXATION ALGORITHM FOR HEAT EQUATIONS WITH DISTRIBUTED DELAY	THERMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Schwarz waveform relaxation; heat equation; distributed delay; parameter optimization; convergence analysis	DIFFUSION	Heat equations with distributed delay are a class of mathematic models that has wide applications in many fields. Numerical computation plays an important role in the investigation of these equations, because the analytic solutions of partial differential equations with time delay are usually unavailable. On the other hand, duo to the delay property, numerical computation of these equations is time-consuming. To reduce the computation time, we analyze in this paper the Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm with Robin transmission conditions. The Robin transmission conditions contain a free parameter, which has a significant effect on the convergence rate of the Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm. Determining the Robin parameter is therefore one of the top-priority matters for the study of the Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm. We provide new formula to fix the Robin parameter and we show numerically that the new Robin parameter is more efficient than the one proposed previously in the literature.

Immobilised trypsin was prepared using a covalent binding method, and then was added to degrade egg yolk phosvitin for the production of phosphopeptides. In our results, the prepared immobilised trypsin demonstrated a higher hydrolysing activity toward phosvitin than free trypsin, and the hydrolysing activity was retained well even after trypsin was repeatedly used up to five times. Interestingly, the phosvitin phosphopeptides prepared with immobilised trypsin demonstrated a lower N/P ratio and a higher calcium-binding efficiency than those prepared with free trypsin. Furthermore, phosphopeptides significantly increased the rate of calcium absorption and serum calcium content in vivo. Based on these results, we conclude that trypsin immobilised onto chitosan has a greater phosvitin hydrolysing activity than free trypsin, and the prepared phosphopeptides can be used as a new calcium supplement to significantly increase calcium absorption in growing rats.

Structural analysis shows that the crystal structure of 1 contains 1D infinite chains formed by intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions, and the ordered-layer-lattice BF4- are located between the chains. For 2, intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions lead to the construction of 1D supramolecular arrays and 2D networks, and the ordered-layer-lattice CH3CN and BF4- are located between these networks. Density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) studies indicate that the constitution of energy bands might be related to the change of ligands, with PPh2(o-C6H4CHO) showing the largest contributions to the HOMO of 2 and LUMO of 1. The UV-vis absorption spectra of 1 and 2 reveal that the absorption spectrum of 2 is red-shifted compared with 1. Moreover, the emission spectra of 1 and 2 in acetonitrile are also observed in the region of 480-700 nm.

XRD, SEM-EDS, H-2-TPR, XPS, TG-DTG, TEM, N-2 physisorption and H-2-chemisorption were used to investigate the structure and the deactivation characteristics of the catalysts. All the catalysts exhibited the formation of Mg(Ni,Al)O periclase with a mesoporous structure. The initial activity of the catalysts decreased in the sequence: NiCo > Ni > NiCu > NiMn > NiZr. The NiCo catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity due to its enhanced metal dispersion and increased active-metal content. However, the decoration of Ni clusters with Mn2O3 and ZrO2 species on the NiMn and NiZr catalysts retarded the accessibility of Ni-active centres, thereby reducing their initial catalytic activity. Compared to the Ni catalyst, the NiCu catalyst improved significantly the reforming stability because of the formation of the NiCu alloy and the lower rate of coke deposition. The superior reforming stability of the NiCo catalyst resulted from its strong resistance to carbon deposition and improved metal-sintering resistance. The NiCo catalyst effectively inhibited coking, which could be associated with its small metal size and its high metal dispersion. The decreased stability was observed for the NiMn and NiZr catalysts owing to their increased rate of coke deposition and the formation of carbon filaments.

A new fractional-order controller for outer synchronization of complex networks is presented. And some new sufficient synchronization criteria are proposed based on the LaSalle invariance principle and the Lyapunov stability theory. This method can apply to arbitrary fractional-order complex networks in which the coupling-configuration matrix and the inner-coupling matrix are not assumed to be symmetric or irreducible. It means that this method is more general and effective. Numerical simulations of three fractional-order complex networks demonstrate the universality and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

By constructing a proper exponential-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing Jensen integral inequality, free-weight matrix method, some novel delay-dependent stability criteria that ensure the robust exponential stability inmean square of the trivial solution of the considered networks are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed results do not require the derivatives of discrete and distributed time-varying delays to be 0 or smaller than 1. Moreover, the main contribution of the proposed approach compared with related methods lies in the use of three types of impulses. Finally, two numerical examples are worked out to verify the effectiveness and less conservativeness of our theoretical results over existing literature.

The effect of parameters in the deacidification process was investigated systematically. The process parameters included mass fraction of deacidification agent, volume ratio of deacidification agent to diesel, reaction time, reaction temperature, and resting time. On the basis of single-factor experiments, orthogonal experiments were done to optimize the deacidification process. The results showed that the optimum deacidification process was that mass fraction of deacidification agent was 3.5%, volume ratio of deacidification agent to diesel was 0.25, reaction time was 50 min, reaction temperature was 323 K, and resting time was 30 min. the acidity in diesel was reduced from 135.52 to 4.07 mgKOH/100 mL, and deacidification rate reached 97.0%.

The new phase is mechanically and dynamically stable, as verified by its elastic constants and phonon dispersion. The formation enthalpy-pressure curves show that the predicted P6(3)/mmc-Tc2C is more energetically favorable than the previously proposed Mo2C-, anti-MoS2-, Re2P-, and Fe2N-type structures in the considered pressure range. The calculated mechanical properties show that it is an ultra-incompressible and hard material. Meanwhile, the directional dependences of the Young's modulus, bulk modulus, and shear modulus for Tc2C are systematically investigated. The analyses of the density of states and electronic localization function reveal the presence of strong covalent bonding between Tc and C atoms, which is of crucial importance in forming a hard material.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a new modified artificial bee colony algorithm in view of the initial population structure, subpopulation groups, step updating, and population elimination. Further, depending on opposition-based learning theory and the new modified algorithms, an improved S-type grouping method is proposed and the original way of roulette wheel selection is substituted through sensitivity-pheromone way. Then, an adaptive step with exponential functions is designed for replacing the original random step. Finally, based on the new test function versions CEC13, six benchmark functions with the dimensions D = 20 and D = 40 are chosen and applied in the experiments for analyzing and comparing the iteration speed and accuracy of the new modified algorithms. The experimental results show that the newmodified algorithm has faster and more stable searching and can quickly increase poor population diversity and bring out the global optimal solutions.

The new phase is stable against decom position into the mixture of Tc and N at ambient condition. The stability is confirmed by the subsequent calculations on the phonon dispersion curves and elastic constants. An analysis of the mechanical properties indicates that imm2-TcN is incompressible and common hard material. The evidence of strong covalent bonding of Tc-N, which plays a leading role to form a hard material, is manifested by the partial densities of state analysis. In addition, the thermodynamic properties, such as Debye temperature, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, and Gruneisen parameter of TcN are investigated by the quasi-harmonic Debye model.

Single-crystal X-ray analyses reveal that compound 1 has a dinuclear Mn(II) unit linking by four carboxylate groups. The bridging N-donor ligand with mi links the Mn(II) centers into a 1D double chain. The detailed analyses of Hirschfeld surface and fingerprint plots provide insight into the nature of non-covalent interactions in the title compound. Furthermore, an attempt was made to explain the magnetic property of compound 1 using atoms in molecule (AIM) theory.

As the content of perfluorooctyl groups increases, the water contact angle of the solid acid catalyst ranges from 151 to 951, demonstrating that the surface properties transforms from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. These solid acid catalysts showed excellent catalytic performance in the condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with ethylene alcohol. It was found that the surface wettability influences the catalytic activity significantly and catalytic results demonstrated that a hydrophobic surface is beneficial for activity due to enhanced mass transport. It can be noted that the stability of the solid acid catalyst with hydrophobic properties could also be greatly enhanced from that of the hydrophilic solid catalyst.

Herein, we report a simple yet sensitive multilayer sensor based on the colorimetric odor reaction between polyphenols and Fe3+. The sensor was fabricated by alternative assembly of a chitosan layer, Fe3+ complexes and an alginate sodium layer on filter paper modified with a TiO2 membrane. After five times repeated assembly, the resultant sensor achieved good super-hydrophobicity, and together with the specific affinity of chitosan, polyphenols in aqueous samples can be pre-concentrated on the surface of the sensor, leading to improvement of the sensor sensitivity. The detection limits for model polyphenols gallic acid and tannic acid were 1.2 mu M and 0.2 mu M with a wide linear range between 2 mu M and 6.1 mM, and between 2.3 mu M and 5.2 mu M, respectively. The colorimetric multilayer sensor was further applied to discriminate plant-derived drinks including 5 red wine samples and Chinese green tea samples. Statistical analysis including HCA and LDA showed that it realized successful discrimination within five closely similar red wines and five Chinese green teas of different quality grades. The sensor presented here can serve as a cheap, convenient and simple "electronic tongue" for real-time discrimination of plant-derived drinks of different brands and/or quality grades.

In the report, the cerium complex and its metallomicellar systems were used as catalysts in the hydrolysis of bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate ester (BNPP), and their catalytic activity was studied by the comparative method. The interaction between the metallomicelle and BNPP was proved by the fluorescence spectrum. The catalytic rate of BNPP hydrolysis was measured kinetically using the UV-Vis spectrophotometric method. The results indicated that the metallomicellar system of the anionic surfactant exhibited excellent catalytic function and relatively higher catalytic activity than that of the complex solution, the metallomicelle of nonionic and cationic surfactants, and the micelle provided an effective catalytic environment for the catalytic reaction. The experimental results also showed that the best acidity for the metallomicelle catalysis is pH 8.0, and the mono-hydroxy complex may be the real active species uaed as a catalyst in BNPP catalytic hydrolysis. The reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the research results.

Structural analysis shows that the Ag4S4 cores in 1 are interconnected by one pbaa ligand in a tetradentate mode and four Etdtc(-) anions in a mu-kappa S-1,kappa S-2 mode to form a three-layer conformation, whereas the Ag4S4 cores in 2 are linked by ligands pbaa (the tetradentate mode) and Etdtc(-) (the mu-kappa S-1,kappa S-1 and mu-kappa S-1,kappa S-2 modes) to yield the other type of three-layer conformation.

Potential hepatoprotective effects of fullerenol nanoparticles on alcohol-induced oxidative stress by ROS	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							INDUCED LIVER-INJURY; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES; FATTY LIVER; TNF-ALPHA; C-60(OH)(24); RATS; C-60; DOXORUBICIN; MECHANISM	The free radical scavenging ability of fullerenols is their most exploited property in biomedical studies. The antioxidant properties and associated mechanisms of fullerenol have been previously investigated, but less research has been done to examine the hepatoprotective effects of fullerenol nanoparticles on alcohol-induced oxidative stress. This study examined the antioxidant effects in rat liver primary hepatocyte exposure to fullerenols dissolved in ethanol. In this study, liver primary hepatocytes of Wistar rats were divided into nine experimental groups that were exposed to ethanol (0.1, 1.0 and 10%), fullerenol dissolved in ethanol (0.1, 1.0 and 10%) and controls (PBS; PBS + fullerenol; Vitamin C (Vc) in 10% ethanol). The results demonstrated that fullerenol nanoparticles in 400 mu mol L (1) exhibited excellent ROS scavenging abilities. This contributed to the anti-inflammatory effects involving reduced alcoholic oxidative damage and the regulated promotion of the tumor necrosis factor. The intracorporeal metabolism of rat-intake fullerenol was also evaluated by examining precision-cut rat slices of liver and kidney. All results demonstrated the potential hepatoprotective effects of fullerenol nanoparticles in the preventive treatment of alcoholic hepatopathy.	[Li, Y.; Liu, Z.

The net of GDMU-3 is uninodal and is closely related to the lvt net, which has the same Schlafli symbol of 4(2).8(4). GDMU-3 displays selective properties for the detection of nitrobenzene and Fe3+ ions. Remarkably, GDMU-3 exhibits an excellent capability to adsorb methylene blue with high selectivity. The present work indicates that GDMU-3 could be a potential candidate for developing novel luminescence sensors for the selective sensing of nitrobenzene which can be deployed for explosives, Fe3+ and organic dyes.

Single-crystal X-ray analyses reveal that compounds I and III have mononuclear Cd(II) units linking by three carboxylate groups, complex II shows dinuclear motif, whereas IV exhibits 1D chain constructed by bridging 4,4'-Bipy ligand. The assistant effect of chelating N-donor ligands with 2,2'-Bipy and Phen bind and bridging 4,4'-Bipy, as well as the flexibility of carboxylate, play an important to modulate on the resulting motifs. The detailed analyses of Hirshfeld surface and fingerprint plots provide insight into the nature of non-covalent interactions in the title compounds.

The effect of all factors on removing basic nitrogen compounds was investigated systematically. On the basis of single-factor experiments, the orthogonal experiments were done to optimize denitrification process. The optimum denitrification process was that volume ratio of formic acid to hydrogen peroxide was 3.0:1, volume ratio of oxidation system to diesel was 0.16:1, ultrasonic power was 64W, reaction temperature was 313K, ultrasonic radiation time was 2min, and volume of alcohol was 16mL. The content of basic nitrogen compounds in diesel was reduced from 85.79 to 3.56g/g, and the denitrification rate reached 95.85% under the optimum denitrification process. The treated diesel met the quality requirements.

The interaction of CeL with calf thymus DNA was investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Furthermore, studies on the effects of pH, reaction time, and the concentration of CeL on cleavage of pUC19 DNA were carried out by gel electrophoresis. The results indicate that CeL can bind to DNA electrostatically with a binding constant of 2.18x10(4) M-1; CeL can promote the cleavage of plasmid pUC19 DNA from supercoiled to the nicked form under the appropriate conditions, and the optimal pH value is 7.54. The lack of effect of radical scavengers indicates that the cleavage involves hydrolytic cleavage.

The physical mechanism behind the light phenomena is discussed: the coupling between localized plasmon resonances and surface plasmon polaritons is found to play a crucial role on the optical properties, while the hole shape plays an important role on the coupling mechanism. Interesting light phenomena are observed in thick metal films perforated with rectangle nanohole arrays; the antisymmetric coupling between surface plasmon polaritons near the top and bottom film plane, and the antisymmetric coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances near the two long sides of the rectangular hole are excited in it.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of quercitrin against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced brain injury and further to elucidate its probable mechanisms. ICR mice received CCl4 intraperitoneally with or without quercitrin co-administration for 4 weeks. Our data showed that quercitrin significantly suppressed the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reduced tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities and abrogated cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) induction in mouse brains. Quercitrin also prevented CCl4 induced cerebral function disorders associated with its ability to inhibit the activities of monoamine oxidase (MAO), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit (NR2B). In addition, western blot analysis showed that quercitrin suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Taken together, our findings suggested that quercitrin may be a potential candidate to be developed as a neuroprotective agent.

This work reports the catalytic activation of two aza-crown ether Ce(III) complexes and their metallomicelles as artificial hydrolase in bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate ester (BNPP) hydrolysis. The chemical composition of two complexes was determined by the fluorescence spectra and the mole ratio method for electronic absorption spectra. The bonding effect of BNPP and solubilizing effect of the complexes were proved by a method of fluorescence spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of different catalytic systems in BNPP hydrolysis was measured with UV-vis spectrophotometric method. These catalytic systems showed high catalytic activity for promoting BNPP hydrolysis at the almost physiological conditions. BNPP hydrolysis rate in these catalytic system is about 10(7) - to 10(9)-fold faster than that of the BNPP spontaneous hydrolysis in aqueous solution at the same conditions. The metallomicelle systems exhibited higher catalytic activity compared with the complex solution systems in BNPP hydrolysis, and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide micelle provides a useful catalytic environment for reaction. The acid effect of the catalytic system is ascribed to the formation of metal-bound hydroxide serving as a better kind of nucleophile.

Under simulated sunlight illumination, the Ag3PO4/ZnO composites exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with the pure ZnO toward the decolorization of rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution, and the Ag3PO4/ZnO composite with 4 % Ag/Zn molar ratio exhibits the highest activity. The quenching effects of scavengers indicate that O-2 center dot(-) plays the major role in RhB decolorization. Ag3PO4 deposited on the ZnO surface can promote the separation rate of photoinduced charge carriers, proven by the SPV results. Based on all the observations, the charge separation mechanism with a typical Z-scheme was proposed.

Efficient Quantum Information Processing via Quantum Compressions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Lossless quantum compression; Quantum transmission; Butterfly network; Entanglement creation; Bipartite entanglement	ENTANGLEMENT PURIFICATION; TELEPORTATION; STATE; COMMUNICATION; TOMOGRAPHY; ROTATION; NETWORK; LIGHT	Our purpose is to improve the quantum transmission efficiency and reduce the resource cost by quantum compressions. The lossless quantum compression is accomplished using invertible quantum transformations and applied to the quantum teleportation and the simultaneous transmission over quantum butterfly networks. New schemes can greatly reduce the entanglement cost, and partially solve transmission conflictions over common links. Moreover, the local compression scheme is useful for approximate entanglement creations from pre-shared entanglements. This special task has not been addressed because of the quantum no-cloning theorem. Our scheme depends on the local quantum compression and the bipartite entanglement transfer. Simulations show the success probability is greatly dependent of the minimal entanglement coefficient. These results may be useful in general quantum network communication.

An appropriate augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established by partitioning the delay in all integral terms. Since the relationship between each subinterval and time-varying delay has been taken a full consideration, and some tighter bounding inequalities are employed to deal with (time-varying) delay-dependent integral items of the derivative of LKF, less conservative delay-dependent stability criteria can be expected in terms of e(s) and LMIs. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show that the proposed conditions are less conservative than existing ones. (C) 2016 All rights reserved.

The calculated crystal structures indicate that Se-implanted Si at concentration of 1.56% show minimum lattice distortion and formation energy. Intermediate band caused by introduction of chalcogen impurities is beneficial to strong optical absorption in the infrared range. The calculations carried out demonstrate that energy band structure and optical absorption coefficient are all associated with the doping concentration. The bandwidth of intermediate band and forbidden energy gap are broadened due to the increase of impurities concentration. The dependence of optical absorption on doping concentration is confirmed by the calculations. The results reveal that S/Se/Te-doped silicon at concentration on the order of 1.04% is probably suitable candidate for intermediate band materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structural analysis reveals that the change of bridging ligands from dppe to dppp lead to the formation of centrosymmetric cations [Ag-2(Phterpy)(2)(NO3)(2)(dppe)] and [Ag-4(Phterpy)(2) (NO3)(2)(dppp)(2)](2+), especially complex 2 containing two independent centrosymmetric tetramers with the central (obligate) Ag2O2 planes. Complexes 1 and 2 consist of the 1D infinite chains, with different variations in pi-stacking patterns. Crystal structure of 1 contains ID infinite chains constructed by pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions between Phterpy, while 2 is built by pi center dot center dot center dot pi interaction of phenylene rings from dppp. All these reveal that the change of phosphine ligands might be the key of construction of different types of polynuclear structures and 1D pi-stacking chain. Moreover, the solid-state emission spectra of complexes 1 and 2 display broad emission bands at 420-600 nm. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The petrological study based on thin section observations was carried out using a polarizing microscope indicating that the Danxia rocks are mainly composed of quartz, plagioclase, and lithic grains, with hematite, limonite, and calcite cements. Some plagioclase and lithic grains are altered to clay minerals, while quartz grains are resistant to such alterations. The reflectance spectra of Danxia rocks were determined with an ASD spectrometer. All the measured spectra share similar characteristics that are different from those of granitic rocks and other land covers, such as vegetation, water, and soil. The spectra also have absorption features at similar to 840, similar to 2210, and similar to 2339 nm that are respectively related to hematite and limonite cements, altered clay minerals, and calcite cement. Application experiments suggest that remote sensing can be a useful tool for Danxia surveying and monitoring, but its capability relies on spectral and spatial resolutions.

The optical oxygen sensing film containing fluorescence indicator Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2 was used to detect the consumption of oxygen in solution. Moreover, a lock-in amplifier was used to determine the lifetime of the sensor head by detecting its phase delay change. The results reveal that the sensor has a linear detection range of 1.0 x 10(-6) - 9.0x10(-5) mol/L and a response time of 5 min. The sensor also has high selectivity, good repeatability and stability. It can be used effectively to determine DCP concentration in real samples.

This is because indole groups possess N-H groups as hydrogen-bonding donors. The introduction of amide groups in the indole framework can induce strong binding properties and good water solubility. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of N-(indol-3-ylglyoxylyl)benzylamine derivatives as novel and simple anion receptors. The receptors derived by aryl and aliphatic amines can selectively recognize F- based on a color change from colorless-to-yellow in DMSO. The receptors derived by hydrazine hydrate can recognize F-, AcO-, and H2PO4- by similar color changes in DMSO and can even enable the selective recognition of F- in a DMSO-H2O binary solution by the naked eye. Spectrographic data indicate that complexes are formed between receptors and anions through multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions in dual solutions.

Probe 1 displayed high selectivity for Fe3+ in CH3CN-H2O (95: 5 v/v) in the presence of other relevant metal cations. Interaction with Fe3+ in 1:1 stoichiometry could trigger a significant fluorescence enhancement due to the formation of the ring-open form. The fluorescent response images were investigated by a novel Euclidean distance method based on red, green, and blue values.

The two sets of derived light curves show a large difference in their shape, i.e., the 2013 light curves show big asymmetry, whereas the 2014 light curve is almost symmetric. All light curves were analysed using the 2013 version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The obtained solutions show that 1SWASP J075102.16+342405.3 is of the A subtype WUMa contact system with an extremely high fill-out of f approximate to 96% and a high mass ratio of 0.70-0.78. Furthermore, a third light contributing to the total flux of the system was found. All these properties make the system a very special short-period source. The analysis of the 2013 light curves proved that the changes in the light curve shape are caused by magnetic activities. By means of all available times of minimum light, the variation of the orbital period was studied. It was found that the O-C diagram implies an increasing orbital period over a time span of eight years, which may be caused by the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one; however, we are more inclined to say that it is only a part of a long period cyclic variation which can be explained by the light-travel time effect (LTTE) via the third body.

In our research, a composite flame retardants system composed of polysiloxane and perfluorinated sulfonate combined with a macromolecular charring agent, linear phenolic resin (LPR) could endow PC sheets (thickness: 0.4 mm) with UL94-V0 rating, showing high flame resistance efficiency. Regrettably, this efficient flame retardant system made the aging properties of PC seriously deteriorated due to the transesterification reaction between the phenolic hydroxyls and PC macromolecular chains, thus losing practical applied value. Introducing a small amount of boron acid (HB) could solve the fatal shortcoming through a quick coordination reaction between the boron atom and phenolic hydroxyl to effectively protect the PC backbone chains, and meanwhile further improve the flame retardance by increasing the charring stability of LPR due to the formed B-O bond with higher energy.

Applying the law of total expectation, the closed-form expressions for the first two moments of the busy period initiated with an arbitrary number of customers are firstly derived. Then, by employing the queue length distribution at vacation termination and the quantities that mentioned above, we give the stochastic decomposition structure of the busy period. Finally, in order to ensure the reliability of the analytical approach, an effective way to validate the correctness of our results along with a numerical example is also provided. We may find that these simple tips and tricks can greatly reduce the difficulty of problem solving.

The surface parameters, the distribution of particle size, structure, morphology, and the photo-induced charge separation rate of the photocatalyst prepared (CTAB-Fe2O3) were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, particle size analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, respectively. The results reveal that CTAB alters the surface parameter and the morphology, decreases the particle size, and enhances the photo-induced charge separation rate of oc-Fe203. The photocatalytic activity of CTAB-Fe2O3 for decolorization of methyl orange (MO) solution was evaluated. The results show that the photocatalytic activity of CTAB-Fe2O3 is more than five times of that of the reference Fe2O3 and the possible reason was discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Acid sulfite (AS) and prehydrolysis kraft (PHK) are the main commercial processes for the production of dissolving pulps. In this paper, the properties of dissolving pulps obtained from the AS and PHK processes, with respect to purity, molecular weight distribution (MWD), porosity, surface area, accessibility and reactivity, were comparatively evaluated. The results indicated that the PHK pulps had higher alpha-cellulose, lower S-10/S-18 content, and narrower MWD than the AS pulps, which can be ascribed to the different reaction mechanisms in the acid and alkaline pulping processes. The traditional parameters (S-10/S-18, alpha-cellulose and intrinsic viscosity) were insufficient to evaluate the pulp quality when comparing with dissolving pulps from different pulping processes. The Fock reactivity and the Chinese filterability tests were applied to evaluate their end-use properties in the rayon production process. The AS pulps had better accessibility than the PHK pulps (larger pore size and volume and thinner primary wall), supporting the conclusion that the AS samples exhibited higher reactivity that the PHK samples. The results from the Fock reactivity and Chinese filterability corresponded well.

Solving implicit mathematical programs with fuzzy variational inequality constraints based on the method of centres with entropic regularization	FUZZY OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Fuzzy mathematical program; Fuzzy implicit variational inequality; Parametric membership function; Tolerance approach; Method of centres with entropic regularization	LINEAR MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; ENVIRONMENT	The purpose of this paper is to consider a class of mathematical programs with fuzzy implicit variational inequality constraints in finite dimension real spaces. By using the "tolerance approach" and the fuzzy set theory, we also show that solving the fuzzy mathematical program problem with fuzzy implicit variational inequality constraints is equivalent to solving a fuzzy implicit complementarity constrained optimization problem, and the fuzzy implicit complementarity constrained optimization problem can be converted to a regular nonlinear parametric programming problem. Further, a new smoothing approach based on a version of the "method of centres" with entropic regularization for solving the resulting optimization problem and our main results are presented and a numerical example is provided to illustrate our main results applying quasi-Newton line search of MATLAB software.

The obtained samples are studied via various characterizations, and compared with different commercial TiO2 (P25, ST-21, ST-31), which have mixed structures, to investigate the photocatalytic performance from water splitting. The experimental results show that the photocatalytic activity of samples depends on the surface properties and particle sizes. Moreover, compared with the TiO2 of single crystal structure, P25 and ST-21 mixed crystal structures show superior photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. According to experimental results, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of TiO2 with mixed crystal structure is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The photocatalysts were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface photovoltage (SPV) specttoscopy, respectively. The separation efficiency of photo-generated charge was investigated using benzoquinone as scavenger. The results demonstrate that sulfating of g-C3N4 increases the adsorption of rhodamine B on g-C3N4, the hydroxyl content and the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge. The photocatalytic activity of SO42-/g-C3N4 for decolorization of rhodamine B and methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution was evaluated. The result shows that loading of 6.0 wt% SO42- results in the best photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation and SO42- play an important role in boosting the photocatalytic activity.

The optimised geometries show that the structures of [AunRb](-) clusters favour the three-dimensional structure at n 8. The Rb atoms tend to occupy the most highly coordinated position and form the largest probable number of bonds with gold atoms. One Au atom capped on [Aun-1Rb](-) structures is the dominant growth pattern for n = 2-8 and Rb atom capped on Au-n(-) structures for n = 9-10. The averaged atomic bonding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order difference of energies, and highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps exhibit a pronounced even-odd alternations phenomenon. The charges in [AunRb](-) clusters transfer from the Rb atoms to Au-n host. In addition, it is found that the most favourable dissociation channel of the [AunRb](-) clusters is to eject a Rb atom and the highest energy dissociation path is Rb- anion ejection.

The samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, and N-2 physisorption. Though both the individual BiOBr and Bi2O3 showed very low photo-catalytic efficiency under visible light irradiation, the BiOBr/Bi2O3 composites exhibited superior activity for MO and MB under visible light, and 75% BiOBr/Bi2O3 (pH = 6) composite showed the highest degradation rate, which was 1.4 times than that of pure BiOBr. The photocatalytic activity investigating on MB also showed a same result. In addition, the catalyst can be separated easily for reuse and no obvious loss of photocatalytic activity were observed after three consecutive runs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, J; Luo, WP; Wang, YH; Cheng, J				Yang, Jun; Luo, Wen-Pin; Wang, Yong-Hu; Cheng, Jun			Further improved stability criteria for uncertain T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delay by (m, N)-delay-partitioning approach	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems; Time-varying Delay (mN)-delay-partitioning approach; Stability Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF); Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs); Free-Matrix-based integral inequality (FMII)	DEPENDENT STABILITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LINEAR-SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION	This paper mainly focuses on the robust stability criteria for uncertain T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delay by (m,N)-delay-partitioning approach. A modified augmented LKF is established by partitioning the delay in all integral terms. Via taking into account of (i) the relationship between each subinterval and time-varying delay and (ii) the independent upper bounds of the delay derivative in the various delay intervals, some new results on tighter bounding inequalities such as Peng-Park's integral inequality and Free-Matrix-based integral inequality are introduced to effectively reduce the enlargement in bounding the derivative of LKF as much as possible, therefore, significant less conservative results can be expected in terms of e(s) and LMIs, which can be solved efficiently with the Matlab LMI toolbox. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that, when the delay-partitioning number m is fixed, the conservatism is gradually reduced with the increase of another delay-partitioning number N, but without increasing any computing burden. Finally, two numerical examples are included to show that the proposed method is less conservative than existing ones. (C) 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the Co(salen)catalyzed oxidization of synthetic lignin-like polymer (S- and G-type lignin model polymer) by H2O2 in alkaline aqueous solution in the presence of pyridine was elucidated with FTIR, C-13 NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Co(salen) was active catalyst, increasing the oxidation rate of the S- and G-type lignin model polymer. The oxidation of lignin model polymer, irrespective of the S- and G-type, occurs selectively at benzylic position as in all experiments as benzaldehyde was the main observed product. The effect of pyridine was noted to be critical and the reactivity of the catalyst increased with addition of pyridine.

Single-crystal X-ray analyses reveal that compound 1 exhibits threading network constructed by a 2D sheet and 1D chain. The photoluminescent property of I indifferent solvents has been investigated and corroborated by theoretical calculations. The obtained results are in good agreement with the results of solvent-dependent luminescence experimental behaviors. An extended analysis of experimental and computational result for 1 indicates that strong metal solvent bonding interaction plays a dominant role in the sensing of various solvents.

The method was based on the complexation of OFL with Cu2+, which was investigated by UV-visible spectrophotometry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). When OFL was added into the electrolyte solution containing Cu2+, the electro-reduction peak current of Cu2+ on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was decreased. Some influencing factors in terms of pH, quiet time, and reaction time were systematically studied. Under optimal conditions, the Cu2+ reduction peak current difference (Delta I (p)) before and after adding OFL was found to be linear to the concentration of OFL in the range from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-4) M. The detection limit (3S/N) was 8.2 x 10(-8) M. Moreover, the proposed sensor displayed high selectivity and good reproducibility, which was successfully applied to the detection of OFL in pharmaceutical tablet and chicken fodder.

The separation efficiency of photogenerated charges was investigated using benzoquinone as scavenger. An obvious redshift of the absorption edge of TiO2 was observed owing to C and N doping. Moreover, doping C and N into TiO2 increases the content of hydroxyl content on the surface of photocatalysts and photoinduced charge separation efficiency. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by decolorization of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution under simulated sun light and visible light irradiation. The results show that photocatalytic activities of the TiO2 are greatly improved by C and N co-doping, which can be further confirmed by the removal of COD of MO aqueous solution. In general, the strong SPS response corresponds to the high separation rate of photoinduced charge carriers on the basis of the SPS principle. Thus, it can be confirmed that the C-, N-TiO2 sample has a higher charge separation rate than the pure TiO2 sample, and the 4 % C-, N-TiO2 shows the highest charge separation rate. [GRAPHICS] .

Therefore, it is essential to conduct an electromechanical dynamic analysis for the drum driving system of the long-wall shearer. First, a torsional dynamic model of planetary gears is proposed which is convenient to be connected to the electric motor model for electromechanical dynamic analysis. Next, an electromechanical dynamic model for the drum driving system is constructed including the electric motor, the gear transmission system, and the drum. Then, the electromechanical dynamic characteristics are simulated when the shock loads are acted on the drum driving system. Finally, some advices are proposed for improving the reliability, monitoring the operating state, and choosing the control signals of the long-wall shearer based on the simulation.

The total elastic stress-field distributions is determined using the elastodynamic equation. The effects of unloading rate and dynamic mechanical parameters of isotropic deep rock masses on the zonal disintegration phenomenon of the surrounding rock masses around a deep spherical tunnel as well as the total elastic stress field distributions are considered. The number and size of fractured and non-fractured zones are determined by using the Hoek-Brown criterion. Numerical computation is carried out. It is found from numerical results that the number of fractured zones increases with increasing the disturbance coefficient, in-situ stress, unloading time and unloading rate, and it decreases with increasing parameter geological strength index, the strength parameter and the uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock.

The dissolution of n-type silicon wafers in etching solution conforms Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The fabricated macroporous silicon with different porosity corrosion in 1.0 M NaOH was systemically investigated by weight loss measurements, electrochemical methods and scanning electron microscope. Results show that with the porosity increasing, the corrosion rate of macroporous silicon in 1.0 M NaOH increases linearly. In addition, the increase of corrosion rate of macroporous silicon with relative higher porosity was determined by the pre-exponential factor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction of different central spacers (ethyl, propyl, phenyl, biphenyl) into ligands, leading to the size variance of copper(I) complexes, aims to improve the luminescence of these complexes. The structural analysis shows that each Cu+ in 1-3 is four coordinate N2P2, and adopts a distorted-tetrahedral geometry, and intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are observed in the packing structures. The pmb-containing complex indicates better emission relative to the corresponding pmbb complex. In the solid state, the tendency toward an increased lifetime, as well as for a red-shifted emission, goes with the size increase of phosphine ligands. However, the tendency of increased quantum yield and lifetime, as well as the blue-shifted emission in solution goes with the size increase of complexes. All these reveal that the central spacers (ethyl, propyl, phenyl, biphenyl) might be the key of the final photoluminescent properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose theoretical schemes to generate entanglements among several trapped atoms with the help of quantum dots in single-side optical microcavities. In the first scheme, a basic architecture will be built to produce arbitrary N-atom GHZ state by using only one auxiliary photon. Moreover, using a photon state with multiple modes, we can realize -atom W state. All these schemes are insensitive to the variation of the atom-photon coupling rates and are also right for remotely trapped atoms by using the photonic transmissions, local quantum operations, and classical channel. Simulations show that our schemes are faithful and available with present physical techniques.

Once an operating component breaks down, it is repaired by a repair facility. Moreover, the repair facility is subject to failure during the repair period which results in repair interruptions. Failed repair facility resumes repair after a random period of time. Under such assumptions, applying the quasi-birth-and-death process and the matrix-analytical approach, the system state probabilities are derived. In addition, various steady-state system performance measures such as the availability and the rate of occurrence of failure along with some numerical illustrations are reported. Finally, under a profit structure, we use the direct search method and the parabolic method to search for the optimal system parameters.

SERS-activity of the rGO/Ag NPs nanocomposite was mainly affected by the structure and size of the fabricated rGO/Ag NPs nanocomposite. In the experiments, the operational conditions of electrodeposition process were studied in details. The electrodeposited time was the important controllable factor, which decided the particle size and surface coverage of the deposited Ag NPs on ITO glass. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit for rhodamine6G (R6G) was as low as 10(-11) M and the Raman enhancement factor was as large as 5.9 x 10(8), which was 24 times higher than that for the ITO-Ag NPs substrate. Apart from this higher enhancement effect, it was also illustrated that extremely good uniformity and reproducibility with low standard deviation could be obtained by the prepared ITO-rGO/Ag NPs nanocomposite for SRES detection.

There might be some cross-talking pathways between statins and ARBs to produce additive beneficial effects on lipid metabolism in dyslipidemia. However, few studies investigate the effects of ARBs on the therapeutic efficacy of statins in dyslipidemia. The present study was designed to systematically evaluate the effects of telmisartan on the therapeutic efficacy of pitavastatin on lowering lipid level and reducing fat deposition by employing a dyslipidemia model, guinea pigs. 48 Male guinea pigs fed with high-fat diet were randomly grouped and treated with vehicle, telmisartan, pitavastatin or telmisartan/pitavastatin combinations. After treatment for eight weeks, telmisartan could significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of pitavastatin by extremely reducing body weight gain, weight of adipose tissue and adipocyte size. However, telmisartan/pitavastatin combinations could not further improve lipid levels on the basis of pitavastain, though single telmisartan markedly decreased triglyceride (TG) and slightly increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, telmisartan/pitavastatin combinations significantly upregulated the gene expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta, but no effects on the expression of PPAR-alpha/gamma, leptin and adiponectin compared to monotherapy. Taken together, our studies provided new evidences that telmisartan has an additive beneficial influence on decreasing fat deposition and weight gain through PPAR-delta pathway but cannot enhance the therapeutic efficacy of pitavastatin on lowering lipid levels.

In this study, a novel three-dimensional (3D) flower-like CdS is synthesized via a facile template-free hydrothermal process using Cd(NO3)(2)center dot 4H(2)O and thiourea as precursors and L-Histidine as a chelating agent. The morphology, crystal phase, and photoelectrochemical performance of the flower-like CdS and pure CdS nanocrystals are carefully investigated via various characterizations. Superior photocatalytic activity relative to that of pure CdS is observed on the flower-like CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, which is nearly 13 times of pure CdS. On the basis of the results from SEM studies and our analysis, a growth mechanism of flower-like CdS is proposed by capturing the shape evolution. The imidazole ring of L-Histidine captures the Cd ions from the solution, and prevents the growth of the CdS nanoparticles. Furthermore, the photocatalytic contrast experiments illustrate that the as-synthesized flower-like CdS with L-Histidine is more stable than CdS without L-Histidine in the hydrogen generation.

Moreover, the electrochemical properties and conductivities of complex 1 were studied by cyclic voltammetry and four-probe AC technique, respectively. Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 21/ n with a = 8.1815( 2) angstrom, b = 12.8701( 5) angstrom, c = 23.2681( 7)angstrom, beta = 90.922( 3)degrees, Z = 4, V = 2449.75( 14) angstrom 3, Dc = 2.114 g center dot cm-3. The crystal structure shows that the dihedral angle of two dmit ligands of [ Hg( dmit) 2] 2- anion is closed to vertical, which results in the formation of a distorted HgS4 tetrahedral geometry. The S center dot center dot center dot S short contacts assemble [ Hg( dmit) 2] 2anions into 1D, 2D, and 3D supramolecular network. The DPyE2+ cations are located in the caves, providing additional stabilization to crystal packing via C- H center dot center dot center dot S hydrogen bonds to [ Hg( dmit) 2] 2- anions. The crystal packing of 1 is characterized by face-to- face pi-pi contacts between DPyE2+ cations and [ Hg( dmit) 2] 2- anions, which result in two orthogonally oriented and mixed stacking columns. These stacking columns interweave into a 2D network, which is further connected to a 3D network via interplanar S center dot center dot center dot S contacts. In addition, the temperaturedependent conductivity in the range of 50- 300 K reveals semi-conducting properties of complex 1, and a room temperature conductivity of 1.53 x 10(-3) S cm- 1 is observed.

The dissolution of n-type silicon wafers in etching solution conform Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The fabricated n-type macroporous silicon with different porosity and thickness corrosion in 1.0 M NaOH was systemically studied by weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization measurements and scanning electron microscope. Results show that the corrosion rate of n-type macroporous silicon in 1.0 M NaOH increases with anodization current density and porosity increasing, respectively. In addition, the increase of corrosion rate for n-type macroporous silicon prepared with relative higher anodization current density was determined by the activation energy.

A modified augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established by partitioning the delay in all integral terms. Then some tighter bounding inequalities, i.e., Peng-Park's integral inequality (reciprocally convex approach) and the Free-Matrix-Based integral inequality (which yields less conservative stability criteria than the use of Wirtinger-based inequality does) are introduced to reduce the enlargement in bounding the derivative of LKF as much as possible, therefore, less conservative results can be expected in terms of e(s) and LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is included to show that the proposed methods are less conservative than existing ones. (C) 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liao, YH; Qin, DT; Liu, CZ				Liao, Ying-hua; Qin, Da-tong; Liu, Chang-zhao			Time-dependent reliability analysis for a herringbone planetary gear set with failure dependency under random loads	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						herringbone planetary gearset; failure dependency; strength degradation; tooth surface wear; random process; time-dependent reliability	DYNAMIC RELIABILITY; MODEL; WEAR; DEGRADATION	A gear-bearing coupling dynamic model that includes bearing stiffness, mesh stiffness and mesh errors for a herringbone planetary gear set (HPGS) is proposed. The proposed model is used to predict the random stress process of the gears and bearings along with Monte Carlo simulation, when the effects of tooth surface wear on meshing errors are considered. A calculation model for the random strength process is derived by applying the linear fatigue damage criterion and regarding the Poisson random process as a counting process of the random stress. Assuming that the stress and strength are random processes, a time-dependent reliability model for HPGS with failure dependency is proposed to predict the time-dependent reliability of HPGS based on the failure mode groups that are obtained by the correlation coefficient. The results show that, the meshing errors caused by the tooth surface wear, make the dynamic loads and failure dependency of the parts of HPGS gradually increase over service time. At the same time the fatigue damage, which is caused by the load action, makes the strength of parts of HPGS gradually decrease over service time. Therefore the reliability of HPGS quickly decreases over service time. If the shafts of the planets and sun gear are free in their axial direction, the failure dependency of the parts will significantly decrease, and the reliability of a herringbone planetary gear set will significantly be improved.

The results show that the microstructure of the weld joint contains F+(epsilon+alpha)+gamma, where F is ferrite, gamma(Fe2W) is intermetallic compound, and (epsilon+alpha) is the granular binary phase solid solution; (epsilon+alpha) phase solid solution and gamma-phase dispersion strengthening effect improves the strength and hardness of the weld joint. The weld joint is pulled off after only a elastic deformation stage and a very short plastic deformation. The fracture of the weld joint is located in the fusion zone with lower strength and ductility. The strength of the weld joint is reduced because of the fine pores and coarse holes, resulting in intergranular fracture.

However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced injury in liver have not been clarified. The aim of the present study is to illustrate the effects of QE on hepatic oxidative injury and inflammation in mice exposed to CCl4. ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were exposed to CCl4 with or without QE co-administration for one week. Our results showed that QE administration significantly inhibited CCl4-induced liver injury. One of the potential mechanisms of QE action was decreasing the oxidative stress, which is consistent with decreasing of lipid peroxidation level and increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities in livers of mice. Furthermore, QE significantly decreased cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression and production of pro-inflammatory markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide (NO) in livers of CCl4-treated mouse. In the process of exploring the underlying mechanisms of QE action, we found that QE significantly inhibited the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, which in turn inactivated NF-kappa B and the inflammatory cytokines in livers of the CCl4-treated mice. In conclusion, these results suggested that the inhibition of CCl4-induced inflammation by QE is due to its anti-oxidant activity and its ability to modulate the TLR2/TLR4 and MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

Importantly, this work investigated the effects of varied micelles of four surfactants, e.g., cationic gemini 16-2-16 and 16-6-16, single-chain CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide), and LSS (n-lauroylsarcosine sodium), on the PNPP hydrolysis by the as-prepared copper(II) complexes. The experimental results indicate that at neutral pH both of complexes exhibited much better activity by excess four-order of magnitude rate enhancement. For instant, rate constants of PNPP hydrolysis by Cu(2)L1 and bromo-containing Cu(2)L2 are approximate 49,569.6- and 31,123.5-fold than that of PNPP spontaneous hydrolysis. In addition, the hydrolytic reactivity of the bromo-containing Cu(2)L2 is subordinate to that one without bromine, Cu(2)L1. Moreover, it is found that the micellar solution of gemini 16-6-16 is proved to be the best medium, and whereas LSS micellar solution is the worst one. Particularly, the pK (a) values of the Cu(II)-bound H2O are determined by a new methodology which is correlative to second derivatives.

In this study, a sequential treatment consisting of pulp fractionation, followed by caustic treatment to remove hemicelluloses from a softwood sulfite pulp, was investigated. The long-fiber fraction obtained after pulp fractionation, had a lower hemicelluloses content and smaller specific surface area, but larger pore diameter than the short-fiber fraction. The fiber fractions were subsequently treated in a cold caustic extraction (CCE) or hot caustic extraction (HCE). Results showed that hemicelluloses removal in the long-fiber fraction was more pronounced than the short-fiber fraction in both CCE and HCE processes. Other parameters, such as hemicelluloses removal selectivity, yield were studied. The underlying explanations were given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a process of combined mechanical refining and cold caustic extraction (CCE), which was applied to a softwood sulfite sample, was investigated. The results showed that the hemicelluloses removal efficiency and selectivity were higher for the combined treatment than that for the CCE alone. The combined treatment can thus decrease the alkali concentration (from 8% to 4%) to achieve a similar hemicelluloses removal. The improved results were due to the fact that the mechanical refining resulted in increases in pore volume and diameter, water retention value (WRV) and specific surface area (SSA), all of which can make positive contributions to the hemicelluloses removal in the subsequent CCE process.

In contrast to previous constructions of qubit systems, we investigate the possibility of ququart systems (four-dimensional states) dependent on two DOFs of photon systems. We propose some useful one-parameter four-dimensional quantum transformations for the construction of universal ququart logic gates. The interface between the spin of a photon and an electron spin confined in a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity is applied to build universal ququart logic gates on the photon system with two freedoms. Our elementary controlled-ququart gates cost no more than 8 CNOT gates in a qubit system, which is far less than the 104 CNOT gates required for a general four-qubit logic gate. The ququart logic is also used to generate useful hyperentanglements and hyperentanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code, which may be available in modern physical technology.

The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy (UV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The amount of g-C3N4 was systematically varied, and it was found that the g-C3N4 content not only plays an important role in the formation of g-C3N4/ZnS rod-like composites but also the improvement of the photocurrent response. The photocatalytic experimental results indicated that the 10 wt.-% g-C3N4/ZnS nanocomposite enhances photocatalytic performance with 93.0% decomposition of methyl orange (MO) after 100 min under simulated sunlight irradiation. This new composite is expected to show considerable potential in the treatment of wastewater containing organic pollutants.

This receptor selectively F-, AcO- and H2PO4- recognizes by visible color changes. It binds with F-, AcO- and H2PO4- by double hydrogen bonding interactions, and favorable color changes of violet-to-colorless are observed clearly. The addition of excessive F- induces further deprotonation of the receptor, exhibiting the color change from violet to yellow. Due to the positive charge in the molecular structure of the receptor, it can even binding with F- and AcO- in water-containing solution by color change.

The relationship between catalytic activity and C-N structures of CoMe/C was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results show that the nitrogen atom exists as Co-N, pyrrolic C-N and pyridinic C-N structures in the CoMe/C catalyst. The Co-N structure has no activity to oxygen reduction reaction. Both pyrrolic and pyridinic C-N structures are the active sites of CoMe/C. The pyrrolic C-N structure is unstable than the pyridinic C-N structure in H2SO4 solution. In heat treating process, the Co(II) ion is reduced to metallic beta-cobalt which facilitates the formation of pyrrolic and pyridinic C-N structures to ensure the better activity of CoMe/C catalyst.

However, its protective effects against nickel (Ni) induced injury in liver have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of quercetin on hepatic DNA methylation and inflammation in mice exposed to nickel. ICR mice were exposed to nickel sulfate with or without quercetin co-administration for 20 days. Our results showed that quercetin administration significantly inhibited nickel-induced liver injury, which was indicated by diagnostic indicators. In exploring the underlying mechanisms of quercetin action, we found that quercetin decreased total DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity and DNA methylation level of the NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) DNA in livers of nickel-treated mice. Quercetin also induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity. Moreover, quercetin decreased production of pro-inflammatory markers including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and iNOS. Quercetin significantly inhibited the p38 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation, which in turn inactivated NF-kappa B and the inflammatory cytokines in livers of the nickel-treated mice. In conclusion, these results suggested that the inhibition of nickel-induced inflammation by quercetin is associated with its ability to modulate Nrf2/HO-1 and p38/STAT1/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

For achieving battery SoE accurately, the main work can be summarized in three aspects. (1) In considering that different kinds of batteries show different open circuit voltage behaviors, the Gaussian model is employed to construct the battery model. What is more, the genetic algorithm is employed to locate the optimal parameter for the selecting battery model. (2) To determine an optimal tradeoff between battery model complexity and prediction precision, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to determine the best hysteresis order of the combined battery model. Results from a comparative analysis show that the first-order hysteresis battery model is thought of being the best based on the AIC values. (3) The central difference Kalman filter (CDKF) is used to estimate the real-time SoE and an erroneous initial SoE is considered to evaluate the robustness of the SoE estimator. Lastly, two kinds of lithium-ion batteries are used to verify the proposed SoE estimation approach. The results show that the maximum SoE estimation error is within 1% for both LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 battery datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, SL				Wu, Shu-Lin			Convergence analysis of some second-order parareal algorithms	IMA JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						parareal algorithm; implicit Euler method; TR/BDF2 method; trapezoidal method; 2s-DIRK method	DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; TRANSIENT SIMULATION; SILICON DEVICES; TIME; SYSTEMS; PRECONDITIONERS; CIRCUITS; PDES	In the past 10 years, the 'parareal' (parallel-in-time) algorithm has attracted lots of attention thanks to its excellent performance in scientific computing. The parareal algorithm is iterative and is characterized by two propagators G and F which are associated with a coarse step size Delta T and a fine step size Delta t, respectively, where Delta T = J Delta t and J >= 2 is an integer. When we apply this algorithm to large-scale systems of ordinary differential equations obtained by semidiscretizing partial differential equations, two questions arise naturally. (I) Is the error between the iterate and the target solution contractive at each iteration for any choice of the discretization parameters Delta T, J and Delta x? (II) How small can the contraction factor be and can such a contraction factor be independent of the discretization parameters? For linear problems u' = Au + g with symmetric negative-definite matrix A, when the implicit Euler method is used as both the G-and F-propagators, positive answers to these two questions were given by Mathew et al. (2010, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 32, 1180-1200) and the contraction factor can be bounded by 0.298 for any choice of the discretization parameters. In this paper, for the case that the implicit Euler method is used as the G-propagator, we provide a positive answer to (I) for three second-order F-propagators: the trapezoidal method, the TR/BDF2 method and the two-stage diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (2s-DIRK) method. For (II), we prove that the contraction factors can be bounded by 0.316 and 1/3 for the 2s-DIRK method and the TR/BDF2 method (provided the parameter gamma involved in TR/BDF2 satisfies gamma is an element of[0.043, 0.977]), respectively, and both bounds are independent of the discretization parameters. For the trapezoidal method, we show that a uniform bound (less than 1) of the contraction factor does not exist. Numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical prediction.

The results demonstrated that the bioflocculant prepared with Bacillus subtilis was able to treat total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour, successfully removing the compounds from tannery wastewater. Component analysis revealed that the bioflocculant contained saccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, osamines, and fats; the bioflocculant did not contain nucleic acid. It is expected that these results will contribute to future research into the application and the mechanism by which bioflocculants remove contaminants from tannery wastewater.

After growth, the supernatants were collected and added to kaolin suspensions to determine whether these Bacillus strains produced flocs that could be filtered out. Efficient bacteria and media were then selected to produce bioflocculants which were subsequently extracted using pre-cooled ethanol. After freeze drying, the flocculants were used to treat tannery wastewater. Results showed cultures of B. subtilis CZ1002 growing in media No. 4, B. cereus CZ1001 growing in media No. 1, and B. fusiformis CZ1003 growing in media No. 1. All had better flocculation effects. Treatment of the tannery wastewater with the bioflocculants produced under three conditions revealed bioflocculant produced by B. cereus CZ1001 growing in media No. 1 was best for treatment of tannery wastewater. This work contributes to application of bioflocculants for removal of tannery wastewater.

The effects of heat-treating temperature and duration, the content of hexamethylenetetramine and cobalt chloride are all investigated. The results show that the ORR activity of the CoHMTA/C catalyst is not obviously affected by the content of hexamethylenetetramine. But the content of cobalt chloride, heat-treating temperature and duration will significantly influence the performance of the catalyst. More or less content of cobalt chloride both go against the ORR activity. A better catalyst with a 0.58 V (vs. SCE) of ORR onset potential can be obtained by heat-treating a precursor containing 0.1 g of acetylene black, 0.1 g of hexamethylenetetramine and 0.05 g of cobalt chloride at 600. for 2 hours. The 0.58 V (vs. SCE) of ORR onset potential is closed to the value of a platinum-disc electrode. Cobalt ions are reduced to metallic beta-cobalt by carbon black at a higher temperature in the heat-treating process. Then the metallic beta-cobalt facilitates nitrogen atoms replace carbon atoms in the graphene sheet of carbon black to form the ORR active sites with the structures of pyrrolic C-N and pyridinic C-N.

Structural information obtained by spectroscopies suggested that geometry was correlated to the enhanced chemical behavior of the complexes. Characterization using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that catalyzed reactions of kraft lignin in the presence of CH3COOOH produced major products including 2-methoxy phenol, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl ethanone. The encapsulation and hydrogenation of complexes could improve reactivity. There was a greater improvement in reactivity for complexes on the immobilization by ship-in-a-bottle method (SB) as compared with by impregnation method, and additionally a methanol fraction in the solvent proved beneficial effect for the product generation over these complexes in the oxidation of kraft lignin. Cu([H-4]salen)/SB was proved to be most active as giving the highest kraft lignin converted per mole metal ion and selectivity.

Reaction synthesis of ultrafine titanium diborides and nitrides reinforced steel matrix composites in situ by spark plasma sintering	POWDER METALLURGY			English	Article						Metal matrix composites; Spark plasma sintering; X-ray analysis; Microstructure	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES	A novel technique for synthesis of in situ titanium diborides and nitrides reinforced steel matrix composite (TiB2-TiN/Fe) was put forward. In situ TiB2-TiN/Fe composite was synthesised by spark plasma sintering of mechanically mixed ferrotitanium and boron nitride (BN) powders. The phase evolution during sintering indicates that the TiB2-TiN reinforcements are formed in situ as follows: first step, the solid/solid interface reaction between ferrotitanium and BN, resulting in the formation of a small amount of TiB2 and TiN below 1000 degrees C; second step, the solid-liquid solution precipitation reaction in the Fe-Ti-B-N system, resulting in most of TiB2 and TiN reinforcement formation at similar to 1100 degrees C. The microstructure investigation reveals that utrafine TiB2 and TiN reinforcements with a size of similar to 1 mu m are homogeneously distributed in the Fe matrix.

Given that infinite service time is not commonly encountered in practical situations, we suppose that the distribution of the service time has a finite support. Recently, a similar continuous-time system with Poisson input process was discussed by Banerjee and Gupta (2012). But unfortunately, their method is hard to apply in the analysis of discrete-time case with versatile Markovian point process due to the fact that the difference equation governing the boundary state probabilities is more complex than the continuous one. If we follow their ideas, we will eventually find that some important joint queue length distributions cannot be computed and thus some key performance measures cannot be derived. In this paper, replacing the finite support renewal distribution with an appropriate phase-type distribution, the joint state probabilities at various time epochs (arbitrary, pre-arrival and departure) have been obtained by using matrix analytic method and embedded Markov chain technique. Furthermore, UL-type RG-factorization is employed in numerical computation of block-structured Markov chains with finitely-many levels. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for several service time distributions. Moreover, the impact of the correlation factor on loss probability and mean sojourn time is also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

A fractional order controller for synchronization of complex network is presented. Some new sufficient synchronization criteria are proposed based on the Lyapunov stability theory and the LaSalle invariance principle. These synchronization criteria can apply to an arbitrary fractional order complex network in which the couplingconfiguration matrix and the inner-coupling matrix are not assumed to be symmetric or irreducible.

The specific binding of free Hg2+ with the thymine-thymine (T-T) mismatches termini of H-DNA could immediately trigger the Exo III digestion, and then set free G-quadruplex segments and Hg2+. The Exo III impellent recycling of ultratrace Hg2+ produced numerous G-quadruplexes. The corresponding DNAzymes catalyzed efficiently the H2O2-mediated oxidation of the ABTS(2-) to the colored product in the presence of hemin. Using the color change as the output signal, and the Exo III-aided Hg2+ recycling and DNAzyme as the signal amplifier, the ultrasensitive assay system successfully achieved visual detection of Hg2+ as low as 1.0 nM by the naked eye, and was suitable for field monitoring. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 50.0 pM to 20.0 nM for Hg2+ (R=0.9962) with a detection limit of 10.0 pM. Moreover, this proposed strategy showed excellent selectivity, portability and low-cost, and was successfully applied to colonmetric detection of Hg2+ in laboratory tap water and Jialing river water samples.

The following prominent periods are found: (1) the rotation cycle signal; (2) several mid-term periods including 122, 162.9 and 225 days, annual-variation periodicities (319 and 359 days), quasi-triennial oscillations (3.46 and 3.94 years); (3) the 11-year Schwabe cycle, which is in anti-phase with solar activity. This result indicates that the strong magnetic field associated with the Sun has a greater inhibitive effect on the radius variation.

Structural analyses show that both of them contain 1D inorganic Zn(II)-chains as rod-shaped secondary building units (SBUs) but they are in different forms. The rod-shaped Zn(II)-chain of 1 is only Zn-carboxylate chain, while the one in 2 is formed by the independent Zn-5(COO)(6) clusters connected by hydroxyl oxygen. Furthermore, the thermal and luminescent properties of both compounds have been studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To compare characteristics of innate immunity between Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs, we investigated the mRNA abundance of TLR genes (TLR1-TLR9) and two AMP-encoding genes (PBD-1 and PR-39) in thymus, spleen, blood, palatine tonsils, and mesenteric and pulmonary hilar lymph nodes of the two breeds at ages of 6, 12 and 24weeks using quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that all mRNAs were detected in all tissues. Transcript levels of the major TLR genes of Tibetan pigs were significantly higher than those of Yorkshires in most tissues of the immune system, with a higher abundance of porcine (PBD-1) (beta-defensin-1) and PR-39 mRNA in lymphoid organs and tissues, especially blood, palatine tonsils, and mesenteric and pulmonary hilar lymph nodes. Our data suggest that Tibetan pigs have stronger innate immunity for triggering local and/or systemic immune responses to eliminate infections with pathogenic microorganisms.	[Cheng, C.; Sun, W.

The specific surface parameters, the crystal structure, the morphology, the distribution of particle size, the chemical states, and the photo-induced charge separation rate of the photocatalyst prepared (PEG-BiOCl) were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, particle size analyzer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and surface photovoltage spectroscopy, respectively. Adding PEG 6000 into the synthesis system greatly changes the specific area parameters of BiOCl, decreases the particle size, and enhances the photo-induced charge separation rate and hydroxyl content. The superoxide radical is the main active species during the photocatalytic process. The photocatalytic activity of PEG-BiOCl for decolorization of methyl orange aqueous solution under both ultraviolet light and simulated solar light irradiation was investigated. The results show that PEG-BiOCl exhibits higher photocatalytic performance than that of the reference BiOCl, and the possible mechanism was discussed.

The results revealed that [OMIM]Br and [AOIM]Br acted as modest cathodic inhibitors, and due to the electron-donating effect of allyl group, [AOIM]Br showed better inhibitive performance. The adsorption of both inhibitors on steel surface obeyed El-Awady thermodynamic-kinetic model, thus the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were calculated and discussed. Moreover, theoretical calculation was used to investigate inhibition mechanism of studied inhibitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, it is crucial to develop processes that can destroy these azo dyes completely. It has been reported that a methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution can be effectively decolorized in KIO3 homogeneous system under UV light irradiation. In this study, the kinetics and effects of KIO4, H2O2, K2S2O8, and KBrO3 on the decolorization of MO with KIO3 under UV light irradiation were investigated in detail. The results show the decolorization reaction is a zero-order reaction when the concentration of MO is above 25 mg/L. [GRAPHICS] , [GRAPHICS] , [GRAPHICS] , and H2O2 can greatly inhibit the photocatalytic decolorization reaction of MO. Several observations indicate the photocatalytic decolorization of MO with KIO3 under UV irradiation occurs by [GRAPHICS] attack only. A more detailed mechanism of KIO3 photocatalysis will be further investigated in the near future.

Then, the surface and cross-sectional morphologies, elemental compositions and phase structure of the resulting coatings were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The corroskin behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by potential dynamic polarization (PDP) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The results show that the self-sealing MAO coating which consists of MgO, MgF2, t-ZrO2, MgSiO3 and amorphous phosphate related to Mg can be fabricated in a K2ZrF6-containing electrolyte solution. With increasing K2ZrF6 content the coating exhibits a more dense cross-sectional morphology and less coating defects, along with better anticorrosion properties than the traditional MAO coating. The ZrF62- plays an important role in producing the self-sealing MAO coating, which results in a three-layer structure: MgO-rich inner layer, MgF2-rich sealed pore layer and porous outer layer. The hydrolysed ZrO2 can promote the formation of the seal pores during MAO process due to its high boiling point (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influence of calcination temperature on phase structure was evaluated by X-ray diffraction. The mass change accompanied with the process of the precipitate converted to the oxide was analyzed by TG. In addition, the synthesized cerium (IV) oxide as oxygen-storage material was further characterized by OSC, H-2-TPR and BET. The results suggest that the prepared cerium oxide is nano-scale mesoporous material with good tolerance of high temperature aging and good redox potential. Besides, oxygen storage and release capability loss is attributed to high calcination temperature. The synthesized material has large specific surface area and appropriate average pore size. The cubic fluorite structure and porous structure are kept perfectly even after calcination at 1000 degrees C.

After fabricating, the corrosion of fresh porous silicon (f-PS) in potassium hydroxide solution in the absence and presence of ethanol was systemically studied by electrochemical methods, weight loss measurements and scanning electron microscope. The effect factors for f-PS corrosion in KOH solution were investigated. It found that the temperature and composition of corrosion solution can affect the detection accuracy of weight loss measurements to measure the porosity of f-PS. In addition, the activation parameters (E-a, A, Delta H-a and Delta S-a) for f-PS in 1.0 M KOH were obtained.

Org. Chem. 2001, 66, 1163) found that the reaction depends strongly on the medium; and the fastest rate constant was observed in pure acetone. The present work tries to explore why acetone can enhance the reactivity of the title reactions. Accordingly we make a mechanistic study on the reactions of sodium p-nitrophenoxide with halomethanes (CH3X, X = Cl, Br, I) in acetone by using a supramolecular/continuum model at the PCM-MP2/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311-04+G(d,p) level, in which the ion pair nucleophile is microsolvated by one to three acetone molecules. We compared the reactivity of the microsolvated ion pair nucleophiles with solvent-free ion pair and anionic ones Our results clearly reveal that the microsolvated ion pair nucleophile is favorable for the S(N)2 reactions; meanwhile, the origin of the enhanced reactivity induced by microsolvation of the nucleophile is discussed in terms of the geometries of transition state (TS) structures and activation Strain model, suggesting that lower deformation energies and stronger interaction energies between the deformed reactants in the TS lead to the lower overall reaction barriers for the S(N)2 reaction of microsolvated sodium p-nitrophenoxide toward halomethanes in acetone.

J	Zhong, HM; Du, PG; Tang, FN; Wang, L				Zhong, Hongmin; Du, Pingan; Tang, Fangning; Wang, Li			Lagrangian dynamic large-eddy simulation of wind turbine near wakes combined with an actuator line method	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Lagrangian dynamic LES; Actuator line method; Wind energy; Near wakes; Velocity deficit; MEXICO	COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS; TURBULENCE; MODEL; ENERGY; IDENTIFICATION; AERODYNAMICS; VORTEX; ROTOR	Wind turbine wakes have significant effects on the production efficiency and fatigue loads, and these effects should be considered in the optimization of wind turbine structure and wind farm layouts. In this paper, a numerical model combining Lagrangian dynamic large-eddy models and actuator line methods (ALMs) is implemented to investigate the wind turbine near wakes at three representative tip speed ratios (TSRs). In the model, several model parameters that have been. justified based on the existing literature and experiments are utilized to enhance the numerical stability and accuracy. These parameters are related to a physically meaningful length scale in the Gaussian smoothing function, a Prandtl tip/hubloss factor and a 3D correction for airfoil data. The model is compared to the MEXICO measurements, in which a detailed stereo Ply measurement is carried out. According to the comparison of rotor power coefficients between the prediction and the measurements, there is a slight overestimate at TSRs of 6.67 and 10, while a slight underestimate at TSR of 4.17. Additionally, according to the comparison of streamwise traverses and spanwise distribution of axial velocities, good agreement is achieved at both TSRs of 4.17 and 6.67, while visible difference is found at TSR of 10. Moreover, the simulation result shows a helical behavior of wake tip vortices induced by the turbine rotor. This behavior gets more pronounced with a decreasing TSR. The tip vortices also give a reasonable explanation of why the maximum velocity deficit and turbulence intensity occur near the blade tip of wind turbines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Qualitative analysis revealed that the bioflocculant contained saccharides and proteins, which might have existed as glycoprotein, in addition to osamines and fats, but not nucleic acid. Quantitative analysis showed the mass composition of the bioflocculant to be as follows: saccharides (0.8963 g/g); proteins (0.0206 g/g); osamines (0.0081 g/g); and fats (0.055 g/g).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of ursolic acid in liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Methods: ICR mice were randomly divided into six groups (Group 1: normal; Group 2: CCl4-treated group; Group 3: CCl4 plus ursolic acid 25 mg/kg group; Group 4: CCl4 plus ursolic acid 50 mg/kg group; Group 5: CCl4 plus colchicine 1 mg/kg group; Group 6: ursolic acid 50 mg/kg group). Mice were administered with CCl4 (2 mL of CCl4 in olive oil (1:1, v/v) per kg body weight twice weekly) by intraperitoneal injection and oral injection of colchicine (1 mg/kg) or ursolic acid (25, 50 mg/kg) daily. After six weeks, serum aminotransferase activity, hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidase (SOD, CAT, GPx) activity and histopathological analysis were performed. The levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were measured. Results: Ursolic acid significantly prevented CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity and fibrosis, indicated by both diagnostic indicators and histopathological analysis. CCl4-induced profound elevations of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in liver were suppressed by ursolic acid. Conclusions: These results suggest that ursolic acid has the hepatoprotective actions. The inhibition of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis by ursolic acid is due at leastin part to its ability to modulate the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway.

Non-isothermal and isothermal oxidation behaviors of AlON translucent ceramic in air	MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION			English	Article							ALUMINUM OXYNITRIDE; PHASE-RELATIONS; THERMODYNAMICS	The oxidation behavior of AlON translucent ceramic was investigated both in non-isothermal (from room temperature to 1573 K) and isothermal (at 1373 and 1473 K) conditions. The mass gains, phase compositions and micromorphology of oxidized samples were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The results suggest that in non-isothermal environment the oxidation reaction starts at about 1173 K for both AlON bulk sample and powder. In isothermal condition, the mass gain indicates the two-stage reaction mechanism which starts with chemical reaction, followed by diffusion controlled stage. XRD patterns suggest that AlON is thermodynamically unstable and it partly decomposes into corundum phase Al2O3 and AlN during the oxidation process. SEM results indicate that different micromorphology is obtained at different temperatures in the oxidation process. The estimated apparent activation energy for the diffusion rate controlled stage from isothermal experiment is about 245.2 kJ/mol.	[Qi, J. Q.; Xie, X. M.; Wang, Y.; Xiao, L.; Wei, N.; Lu, T.

Considering one network as the drive network and the other as the response network, the drive-response networks achieve synchronization through a suitably designed adaptive controller. The stochastic LaSalle invariance principle is employed to theoretically prove the almost certain synchronization between two complex networks. The proposed controller is applicable to complex networks that have either intrinsic time delay or coupling delay or both. Two examples are examined to illustrate the proposed synchronization scheme and demonstrate its effectiveness.

The effect of the applied voltage, concentration of H3PO4 and anodization time on the microstructure and optical property of blackened coatings was investigated. The results show that the applied voltage plays the most important role during the formation of the ultra-black coatings. The concentration of H3PO4 is the next-important factor, then anodization time. The optimum process parameter for obtaining ultra-black coatings is at 0.9V in 3 mol/L for 40 min, in which the reflectance is only 0.14-0.21% in the visible region. The low reflectance is mainly attributable to the unique array structure of conical cavities ranging 1-3 mu m in size, in which the innumerable tiny pits distribute on the cavity wall. In contrast, the black coatings etched by chemical etching method by strong oxidizing acid (HNO3) have larger conical cavities (10-20 mu m) with smooth cavity wall, and thus lead to higher reflectance of 0.69-2.44%.

This approach is based on the competitive binding between NCA and AuNPs to positively charged coralyne. In the presence of NCA, the electrostatic attraction between NCA and coralyne is stronger than AuNPs binding to coralyne. The competitive interactions are programmable and can be utilized to regulate the absorbance and solution color of AuNPs via Boolean logic (such as YES, NOT, OR, INHIBIT, IMPLICATION logic gates). These integrated logic circuits are constructed based on dispersion-dominated AuNPs sensing progress, which avoids false results generated from the aggregation-dominated AuNPs sensor. The new concept of Boolean-logic-based nano-platform may find applications in a wide range of biological digital diagnosis and practical environmental applications and extend to further development of molecular computing circuits.

J	Jiang, H; Cheng, XL; Zhang, H; Tang, YJ; Wang, J				Jiang, Hao; Cheng, Xin-Lu; Zhang, Hong; Tang, Yong-Jian; Wang, Jun			Molecular dynamic investigations of hydrogen storage efficiency of graphene sheets with the bubble structure	STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Graphene bubble; Molecular dynamic; Hydrogen	MONOLAYER GRAPHENE; FORCE-FIELD; CARBON; SIMULATIONS; PRESSURE; SURFACE; FILMS	In this paper, we designed a new type of 3D graphene bubble structure for hydrogen storage in theory. The graphene-based structures are constructed with different sizes of semi-ellipsoidal graphene bubbles. The hydrogen storage efficiency of the graphene bubble structures at ambient conditions (P = 1.0 bar and T = 300 K) is calculated using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The effects of number of graphene layers and density and size of bubbles are systematically investigated in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. The MD results reveal that at ambient conditions, the bubble models can achieve the highest volumetric hydrogen storage efficiency of 45 kg/m(3) and gravimetric hydrogen storage efficiency of 3.75 wt%. The maximum pressures in the bubbles are also evaluated.

In the presence of three basic anions F-, AcO- or H2PO4-, 1 exhibited two novel partially overlapped red-shift absorption bands at 718 nm and 757 nm, respectively. The formation of allotropic structures, after deprotonation of phenol OH, is responsible for these two emerging bands. Fluorescence quenching was also observed due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from phenolate to BODIPY core. As results revealed, the anion affinity mainly depended on the acidity of binding site OH and the basicity of the target anion. Moreover, two bulky tert-butyl groups cannot effectively exclude the approach of large anions to phenol OH, but can facilitate the formation of allotropic resonance structures.

However, in the research and application of the CACO algorithm for solving complex optimization problems, the CACO algorithm presents some disadvantages. In order to resolve these disadvantages, an improved CACO algorithm based on adaptive multi-variant strategies (CACOAMS) is proposed in this paper. The CACOAMS algorithm takes full advantage of multi-population strategy, the neighborhood comprehensive learning strategy, the fine search strategy, the chaotic optimization strategy, the super excellent ant strategy, the punishment strategy and min-max ant strategy in order to avoid the local optimization solution and stagnation, guarantee learning rate of the different dimensions for each ant and the diversity of the search, eliminate the self-locking trap between environmental boundary and obstacles, improve the search efficiency, search accuracy and robustness of the algorithm. In order to testify to the performance of the CACOAMS algorithm, the CACOAMS algorithm is applied to test the benchmark functions and dynamically adjust the values of PID parameters. The simulation results show that the CACOAMS algorithm takes on the strong flexibility, adaptability and robustness. It can effectively improve system control precision and guarantee feasibility and effectiveness.

Previous schemes focus on circuit complexity using implicit decomposition schemes for global evolutions and are difficult in quantum experiments because the generation circuit can be completed for given coefficients each time. One protocol is firstly proposed in this paper in order to deterministically generate arbitrary four-qubit states with any coefficients. In order to complete this scheme with present physical techniques, we present an explicit quantum circuit with unknown coefficients of prepared states using elementary quantum gates. The key of our scheme is constructing the Cartan KAK decomposition of special transformations in SO(4) and SO(8). And then, this protocol is extended to arbitrary five-qubit states and sixqubit states.

The observations reveal that the as-prepared dinuclear copper(II) complexes exhibited better activity by two to three orders of magnitude rate enhancement in comparison with the autohydrolysis rate of PNPP. Chloro-containing Cu2L22 aroused approximately three times kinetic advantage over chloro-free Cu2L21 at pH 7.0, which is probably contributed to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the 5-chloride group. Moreover, it was found that the pH-responded kinetic behavior displayed an enzyme-like property for the PNPP hydrolysis by the two complexes.

According to our calculation results, the four channels have been well-established and the reactivity patterns on the singlet and triplet PESs are almost similar. And the reaction proceeds in three distinct manners yielding the [V(OCH2)(+) + H2O] products, the [V(OH2)(+) + CH2O] products, the [OV(OCH2)(+) + H-2] products and the [VO+ + CH3OH] products. Specially, the crossing points (CPs) between the different PESs have been located by means of the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach used by Yoshizawa et al., and corresponding minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) that we obtained by the mathematical algorithm proposed by Harvey et al. has also been employed. In addition, the frontier molecular orbital interaction analysis about (1)TS1, (3)TS1, (1)TS4 and (3)TS4 are used to gain useful information about the C-H bond of CH4 activation by VO2+.

The results show that the dual rare-earth conversion film treated in the mixture solution containing cerium nitrate and lanthanum nitrate is denser and more uniform than that in single rare-earth solution. EDX and XPS analysis demonstrates that the coatings are composed of rare earth oxides and hydrated hydroxides. The cerium and lanthanum conversion coatings can improve the corrosion resistance of AZ63 magnesium alloy evidently. The inhibition effect of dual rare-earth film on magnesium alloy increases with the increase of immersion time. With the extension of aging time, the inhibition effect increases first and then decreases. The coating aged for 48 h possesses the best inhibition effect.

Antibody is a key factor for immunoassay against toxic stuff like AFB(1), and single-chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) has become a popular format of genetically engineered antibody. In this study, four hybridoma cell lines against AFB(1) were obtained, and then scFvs 2E6 derived from hybridoma cell line 2E6 were constructed in different V-H/V-L orientations. Subsequently, scFvs 2E6 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) mainly in the form of inclusion body. SDS-PAGE, Western blot and ELISA were employed to characterize scFvs 2E6. The results revealed that the yield of inclusion body of scFvs 2E6 in either V-H/V-L orientation was similar; however, only the scFv in V-H-linker-V-L orientation showed anti-AFB(1) bioactivity after refolding. The present study underscores the importance of choosing optimal V-H/V-L orientation for scFv construction, and scFv may be favorable for immunoassays in food industry.

In our calculations, we found that the adsorption energies calculated with PW91 (Perdew and Wang) functional are greater than with RPBE (Revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof). Adsorption energies show that water molecule is adsorbed preferentially on top-Hf site of HfB2 (0001) surface, whereas the preferential position is top-B site on TaB2 (0001). And there exists a tilt angle between the plane of water molecule and HfB2 and TaB2 (0001) surfaces, respectively. On the preferential sites, the adsorption energy calculated with PW91 is -0.43 eV on HfB2 (0001) and -0.29 eV on TaB2 (0001) surface. The H-O bond length and bond angle of water molecule do not change greatly compared with isolated water molecule. The charges of H and O atoms on TaB2 (0001) surface are closer to those of isolated water molecule than on HfB2 (0001) surface. Furthermore, the charge density differences between water molecule and the (0001) surfaces are very small. The differences around O atom on TaB2 (0001) are about eight times smaller than those on HfB2 (0001). Our results indicate that the interactions between water molecule and the (0001) surfaces are very weak. Moreover, the interaction of water molecule with TaB2 (0001) is weaker than with HfB2 (0001). No dissociation of water molecule is found in our investigations. Therefore, HfB2, especially TaB2, may not be oxidized by water molecule at initial adsorption stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper designs a real-time virtual-real fusion framework for multiview surveillance of large-scale scene, in which 2D panorama, satellite texture, and 3D model are merged. The system is implemented with the following contributions. First, a novel automatic mosaic algorithm for multiview overlapped images is proposed. Feature points between adjacent cameras are detected via comotion statistics map. In addition, transformation model is obtained using random sample consensus algorithm. Second, multiview images are morphed to a same overhead viewpoint. Finally, 2D panoramic road image and 3D scene model are combined based on high-precision ground control points. The proposed framework has been successfully applied to a large road intersection. With the virtual-real fusion approach, observers can freely monitor and ramble in the largescale 3-D road scene.

The hairpin capture probe DNA (C-DNA) with an Exo-III 3' overhang end was self-assembled on a gold electrode. In the presence of target DNA (T-DNA), C-DNA hybridized with the T-DNA to form a duplex region, exposing its 5' complementary sequence (initiator). Exo-III was applied to selectively digest duplex region from its 3-hydroxyl termini until the duplex was fully consumed, leaving the remnant initiator. The intact T-DNA spontaneously dissociated from the structure and then initiated the next hybridization process as a result of catalysis of the Exo-III. HCR event was triggered by the initiator and two hairpin helper signal probes labeled with methylene blue, facilitating the polymerization of oligonucleotides into a long nicked dsDNA molecule. The numerous exposed remnant initiators can trigger more HCR events. Because of integration of dual signal amplification and the specific HCR process reaction, the resultant sensor showed a high sensitivity for the detection of the target DNA in a linear range from 1.0 fM to 1.0 nM, and a detection limit as low as 0.2 fM. The proposed dual signal amplification strategy provides a powerful tool for detecting different sequences of target DNA by changing the sequence of capture probe and signal probes, holding a great potential for early diagnosis in gene-related diseases.

The interaction between these two complexes and DNA was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. Moreover, a series of experiments of cleavage of pUC19 DNA were conducted to illustrate the acidity, time and concentration effects. The results indicated that the two metal complexes can accelerate the breakage of DNA from its supercoiled form (form I) to the nicked form (form II) at near-physiological conditions, and the optimum acidity of DNA catalytic cleavage is pH=6.5 and pH=7.0 for LaL1 and LaL2, respectively. Furthermore, the LaL1 exhibited better cleavage activity than LaL2 under the same conditions, thus supercoiled DNA was thoroughly cleaved to the nicked form under the appropriate conditions. The hydrolytic mechanism was verified by applying several oxygen-scavengers to the DNA catalytic cleavage.

Automatic vision-based driver fatigue recognition is one of the most prospective commercial applications based on facial expression analysis technology. Deriving an effective face location from original driver face images is a vital step for successful fatigue facial expression recognition. In this paper, we empirically adopt fast and robust face detection algorithm to describe and normalizing facial expression images. We evaluate facial representation based on statistical local features, Local Binary Patterns, for person-independent fatigue facial expression recognition, and observe that LBP features perform stably and robustly over a useful range of fatigue face images. Moreover, we adopt AdaBoost to learn the most discriminative fatigue facial LBP features from a large LBP feature pool, which is a critical problem but seldom addressed in the existing work. We observe in our experiments that Boost-LBP features perform stably and robustly, and best recognition performance is obtained by using SVM with Boost-LBP features. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Within the chain, a racemic dimer of Co-2(3-ppap)(2)(2-) is found, where the Co atoms are doubly bridged by O-P-O units from the (S)-and (R)-3-ppap3-ligands. The dimers are connected by another crystallographically independent Co atom through O-P-O linkages to form an infinite racemic chain. The packing modes of the layers in 1-3 are quite different, however, which are ABAB in the cases of 1 and 3 while ABCDABCD in the case of 2, attributed to the positional isomerism of the bix co-ligands. Compound 4 displays a chain structure in which the 1,2-bix bridges the Co atoms in cis-mode within the chain. Magnetic properties are investigated for all compounds.

The composition and structure of the films were investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), TEM, and Raman spectra, respectively. The substrate temperature effect on microstructure and mechanical and tribological properties of the films was studied. A structural transition of the films from nanoparticle containing to fullerene-like was observed. Correspondingly, the mechanical properties of the films also had obvious transition. The tribological results in ambient air showed that high substrate temperature (>573 K) was disadvantage of wear resistance of the films albeit in favor of formation of ordering carbon clusters. Particularly, the film deposited at temperature of 423 K had an ultralow friction coefficient of about 0.01 and high wear resistance.

The effects of residence time (15, 60 min) and reaction temperature (130, 180, 230 degrees C) on yields of oils and phenolic compounds were studied in detail. Total oil yield was found to range between 7% and 10%. The compositions of oils were analyzed by GC-MS to confirm the main compound to be guaiacol (2-methoxy phenol) in the range of 12-55% of oil depending on different reaction conditions. The most interesting was the finding that maximum value of total oil yield (10% of kraft lignin) and guaiacol amount (55% of oil) was obtained at 130 degrees C/15, 60 min which is a low reaction temperature/short time, while the residual kraft lignins were analyzed by FTIR with respect to the conversion mechanism of kraft lignin by this process.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the particle sizes of FK/CdS nanocomposites were smaller than pure CdS. The coexistence of FK and CdS in the photocatalysts was further confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results of photocatalytic experiments demonstrated that the FK/CdS composites exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB compared with pure CdS under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the FK/CdS composites can be attributed to the similar affinity between FK and RhB, which can effectively separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This method not only improves the photocatalytic activity of CdS, but also reduces the environmental pollution of waste feathers. In addition, the possible degradation mechanism of RhB is proposed.

J	Zhang, LP; Wu, SL				Zhang, Liping; Wu, Shu-Lin			A Convergence Study of Multisubdomain Schwarz Waveform Relaxation for a Class of Nonlinear Problems	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS; PARABOLIC PROBLEMS; HEAT-EQUATION; ALGORITHM	Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) is a new type of domain decomposition methods, which is suited for solving time-dependent PDEs in parallel manner. The number of subdomains, namely, N, has a significant influence on the convergence rate. For the representative nonlinear problem partial derivative(t)u = partial derivative(xx)u + f (u), convergence behavior of the algorithm in the two-subdomain case is well-understood. However, for the multisubdomain case (i.e., N >= 3), the existing results can only predict convergence when f' (u) <= 0 (for all u is an element of R). Therefore, there is a gap between N >= 3 and f' (u) > 0. In this paper, we try to finish this gap. Precisely, for a specified subdomain number N, we find that there exists a quantity d(max) such that convergence of the algorithm on unbounded time domains is guaranteed if f' (u) <= d(max) (for all u is an element of R). The quantity d(max) depends on N and we present concise formula to calculate it. We show that the analysis is useful to study more complicated PDEs. Numerical results are provided to support the theoretical predictions.

This problem is well known to be NP-hard. When only one minimal attribute reduction is required, it was transformed into a nonlinearly constrained combinatorial optimization problem over a Boolean space and some heuristic search approaches were used. In this case, the fitness function is one of the keys of this problem. It required that the fitness function must satisfy the equivalence between the optimal solution and the minimal attribute reduction. Unfortunately, the existing fitness functions either do not meet the equivalence, or are too complicated. In this paper, a simple and better fitness function based on positive domain was given. Theoretical proof shows that the optimal solution is equivalent to minimal attribute reduction. Experimental results show that the proposed fitness function is better than the existing fitness function for each algorithm in test.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides is the best-characterized photosynthetic bacterium and exhibits potential as a novel expression system. Up to date, no literature has been reported regarding expression of HNP3 in Rb. sphaeroides. In the present study, the HNP3 gene fragment was amplified by SOE PCR and ligated into photosynthetic bacteria light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2) expression vector leading to HNP3 fusion protein expression vector. The HNP3 fusion protein was successfully expressed as rapidly evaluated by the LH2 characteristic peaks at similar to 800 nm and similar to 850 nm before purification and SDS/PAGE. Subsequently, the HNP3 fusion protein was purified by one-step affinity chromatography, and could be rapidly detected by the color and the spectral absorption at similar to 800 nm and similar to 850 nm before SDS/PAGE. Antimicrobial activity assay suggested that the HNP3 fusion protein exhibited high antimicrobial activity towards E. coli. The present study may supply an insight into employing the novel Rb. sphaeroides expression system, exhibiting dramatic advantages over currently used commercial expression system, to heterologously express human neutrophil peptides.

The basic nitrogen compounds (BNC) in diesel was removed by phosphomolybdic acid/hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, alcohol was used as extractant to extract oxidation products from diesel. The effect of factors on removing of BNC was reviewed systematically. On the basis of single factor investigations, orthogonal experiments were done to optimize the denitrification process. The result showed that the optimum process conditions is that usage of phosphomolybdic acid is 0.020 g, volume of hydrogen peroxide is 2.5 mL, reaction temperature is 318 K, and reaction time is 35 min. The BNC in diesel is reduced from 85.79 to 21.28 mu g/g, and the denitrification rate reaches 75.2% under the optimum condition.	[Hu, Z.; Yu, H.

Furthermore, the aging phenomena are extremely complicated to describe due to the coupling of various factors. In this review, we give an interpretation of capacity/power fading of electrode-oriented aging mechanisms under cycling and various storage conditions for metallic oxide-based cathodes and carbon-based anodes. For the cathode of lithium-ion batteries, the mechanical stress and strain resulting from the lithium ions insertion and extraction predominantly lead to structural disordering. Another important aging mechanism is the metal dissolution from the cathode and the subsequent deposition on the anode. For the anode, the main aging mechanisms are the loss of recyclable lithium ions caused by the formation and increasing growth of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the mechanical fatigue caused by the diffusion-induced stress on the carbon anode particles. Additionally, electrode aging largely depends on the electrochemical behaviour under cycling and storage conditions and results from both structural/morphological changes and side reactions aggravated by decomposition products and protic impurities in the electrolyte.

J	Li, FZ; Xie, JQ; Feng, FM				Li, Fang-zhen; Xie, Jia-qing; Feng, Fa-mei			Copper and zinc complexes of a diaza-crown ether as artificial nucleases for the efficient hydrolytic cleavage of DNA	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DIPHOSPHATE ESTER HYDROLYSIS; PHOSPHATE DIESTER CLEAVAGE; MOLECULAR SCAFFOLDS; CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY; BINDING; DERIVATIVES; CARBOXY; MODELS; ALKALI; IONS	Artificial nucleases are a kind of new non-enzymatic breakage tool, which mimic the function of a restricted enzyme and can catalyze nucleic acid cleavage highly efficiently and selectively. Some metal complexes are highly efficient cleavage agents for DNA. In this report, a diaza-crown ether (L) was synthesized and its copper and zinc complexes (CuL and ZnL) were prepared to serve as artificial nucleases. The compositions of the two metal complexes were confirmed by LC-MS analysis, and the nuclease activity of the complexes towards pUC19 DNA cleavage was studied using agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicate that the two metal complexes can accelerate the breakage of DNA from the supercoiled (form I) to the nicked form (form II) under appropriate conditions; the optimal pH value for the DNA catalytic cleavage is 8.01 for both CuL and ZnL; the complex ZnL was a better catalyst in the DNA cleavage process than the complex CuL at low concentrations; and unreactive m-hydroxo dimers were formed hampering the DNA cleavage process at high concentrations. In the presence of free radical scavengers, the supercoiled plasmid DNA cleavage catalyzed by these complexes has been performed and the catalytic mechanism has been investigated.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The separation efficiency of photogenerated charges was investigated using ammonium oxalate as scavenger. The photocatalytic activity of catalysts was evaluated by decolorization of methyl orange aqueous solution under ultraviolet light irradiation. The relationship between Pd loading and the photocatalytic performance was discussed and the optimization of the Pd/alpha-Fe2O3 composites was obtained. The result shows that Pd decorated Fe2O3 with 3% Pd (Pd/Fe) possesses the best photocatalytic activity.

J	Liu, ST				Liu, Shitian			OD-characterization of some alternating groups	TURKISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Order component; element order; alternating group; degree pattern; prime graph; Simple group	FINITE-GROUPS	Let G be a finite group. Moghaddamfar et al. defined prime graph Gamma(G) of group G as follows. The vertices of Gamma(G) are the primes dividing the order of G and two distinct vertices p,q are joined by an edge, denoted by p similar to q, if there is an element in G of order pq. Assume vertical bar G vertical bar = p(1)(alpha 1) ... p(k)(alpha k) with P-1 < ... < p(k) and nature numbers alpha(i) with i = 1, 2, ... , k. For p is an element of pi(G), let the degree of p be deg(p) = vertical bar{q is an element of pi(G) vertical bar q similar to p}vertical bar, and D(G) = (deg(p(1)), deg(p(2)), ... , deg(p(k))). Denote by pi(G) the set of prime divisor of vertical bar G vertical bar. Let GK(G) be the graph with vertex set pi(G) such that two primes p and q in pi(G) are joined by an edge if G has an element of order p . q. We set s(G) to denote the number of connected components of the prime graph GK(G). Some authors proved some groups are OD-characterizable with s(G) >= 2. Then for s(G) = 1, what is the influence of OD on the structure of groups? We knew that the alternating groups A(p+3), where 7 not equal p is an element of pi(100!), A(130) and A(140) are OD-characterizable. Therefore, we naturally ask the following question: if s(G) = 1, then is there a group OD-characterizable? In this note, we give a characterization of A(p+3) except A(10) with s(A(p+3)) = 1, by OD, which gives a positive answer to Moghaddamfar and Rahbariyan's conjecture.

Here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the coherent resonance of quantum plasmons in the graphene-gold cluster hybrid system by using time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). This plasmon coherent effect is mainly attributed to the electromagnetic field coupling between the graphene and the gold cluster. As a result, the optical response of the hybrid system exhibits a remarkably strong, selectable tuning and polarization dependent plasmon resonance enhanced in wide frequency regions. This investigation provides an improved understanding of the plasmon enhancement effect in a graphene-based photoelectric device.

The coarse propagator G is fixed to the backward-Euler method and three time integrators are chosen for the F-propagator: the trapezoidal rule, the third-order diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) (DIRK) method, and the fourth-order Gauss RK method. It is well known that the Parareal-Euler algorithm using the backward-Euler method for F and G converges rapidly, but less is known when one uses for F the trapezoidal rule, or the fourth-order Gauss RK method, especially when the mesh ratio J (= Delta T/Delta t) is small. We show that for a specified lambda(max)(the maximal eigenvalue of A or its upper bound), there exists some critical J(cri) such that the parareal solvers derived from these three choices of F converge as fast as Parareal-Euler, provided J >= Jcri. Precisely, for F the trapezoidal rule and the fourth-order Gauss RK method, Jcri depends on Delta T, Delta t, and lambda(max) and we present concise formulas to calculate Jcri, while for F the third-order DIRK method, J(cri) = 4, independently of these parameters. Numerical examples with applications in fractional PDEs and uncertainty quantification are presented to support the theoretical predictions.

A series of mesoporous NiO with different textural parameters such as specific surface area, pore size, pore wall thickness were achieved by selecting mesoporous silica with different pore sizes as templates. The gas sensing properties for formaldehyde (HCHO) of the NiO specimens were examined. The results show that this mesoporous NiO possesses a much higher response to HCHO even at low concentration levels than the bulk NiO, and a larger specific surface area and pore size as well as thinner pore walls would be beneficial for enhancing the sensing properties of NiO.

By employing the reductive perturbation method, we obtain a Burgers equation that describes the two-ion fluid dynamics. The dust charge variation is found to play an important role in the formation of such dust-ion acoustic shock structures. The viscosity only affects the thickness of the shock waves. The dependences of the shock wave's velocity, height and thickness on the system parameters are investigated.

The Pb(II) center is coordinated by six O and two N atoms showing a distorted dodecahedron configuration. The multidentate ligand of NNDS dianion exhibits peculiar coordination mode, and the two O atoms of two sulfonate anions bridge two Pb(II) cations into a dimer, and the O atom of nitroso group links the other dimer into 2D sheets extending in the [011] plane. There exist significant p-p stacking interactions between adjacent phen and NNDS. The 3D network is formed by 2D sheets interlinked by hydrogen bonds and pi-pi stacking interactions.

A kinetic model of PNPP cleavage catalyzed by these complexes is proposed. The effects of complex structures and reaction temperature on the rate of catalytic PNPP hydrolysis have also been examined. The rate increases with pH of the buffered Brij35 micellar solution under 25 degrees C; all four complexes exhibited high activity in the catalytic PNPP hydrolysis. The catalytic activity of the phenyl-bridged Schiff base complex is larger than that of ethyl-bridged Schiff base complex for the same substituent and metal. The catalytic activity of manganese(III) complex is superior over cobalt(II) complex in catalyzing hydrolysis of PNPP under the same ligand. The pseudo-first-order rate for PNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by CoL1 containing aza-crown ether is 2.96 x 10(4) times that of spontaneous hydrolysis of PNPP in Brij35 surfactant micellar solution at pH = 7.60, [S] = 2.0 x 10(-4) mol dm(-3).

Some stabilization conditions will be derived via the single state feedback control scheme. The robust performance of controlled unified chaotic systems with uncertain parameter will be investigated based on maximum and minimum analysis of uncertain parameter, the robust controller which only requires information of a state of the system is proposed and the controller is linear. Both the unified chaotic system and the designed controller are synthesized and implemented by an analog electronic circuit which is simpler because only three variable resistors are required to be adjusted. The numerical simulation and control in MATLAB/Simulink is then provided to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method which is robust against some uncertainties. The results presented in this paper improve and generalize the corresponding results of recent works.

A Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is obtained by using reductive perturbation method. The effect of positron density and positron-electron temperature ratio on dust-acoustic solitary structures are studied. Numerical results show that the increase in positron number density increases the amplitude of hump-like solitons but decreases the dip-like solitary waves. Furthermore, increase in the positron-electron temperature ratio results in the decrease of the amplitude of dip-like solitary waves. It seems that both the dip and hump-like solitary waves can exist in this system. Our results also suggest that the dust-size distribution has a significant role on the amplitude of the solitary waves.

The bound rubber of natural rubber (NR)/HCNFs were also prepared in this study. The results of thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) for cupric tartrate nanoparticles show that the transformation of C4H4CuO6 -> Cu reaction occurs at similar to 250-310 degrees C. The characterization of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectrum for the synthesized products confirms that the synthesis of HCNFs is highly temperature-dependent. The straight fibers with the fiber diameter of 100-400 nm are obtained at 280 degrees C and HCNFs can be synthesized at higher temperature, with the coil diameter of 0.5-1 mu m and fiber diameter of 100-200 nm at 380 degrees C, and the coil diameter of 100 nm and fiber diameter of similar to 80 nm at 480 degrees C. The maximum of the bound-rubber content (37%) can be obtained with the addition of similar to 100 wt.% HCNFs in NR, which indicates that the coiled configuration of HCNFs makes a noticeable contribution to the reinforcement of NR/CB system.

Through surface analyses and investigation into the corrosion behavior, this hydrophobicity is ascribed to a combination of the MAO coating's rough micro-pore structure and the formation of a stearic acid monolayer through bidentate bonding. The hydrophobic MAO coating effectively inhibits corrosion of the Mg alloy, especially pitting corrosion, and demonstrates that surface modification could further increase or accelerate the application of MAO treatment to Mg alloys.

The working time of each component is an exponentially distributed random variable and the repair time of each failed component is governed by an arbitrary distribution. Moreover, we assume that every component is "as good as new" after being repaired. Under these assumptions, several important reliability measures such as the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, and the mean time to first failure of the system are derived by employing the supplementary variable technique and the Laplace transform. Meanwhile, their recursive expressions are obtained. Furthermore, through numerical examples, we study the influence of various parameters on the system reliability measures. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation and two special cases of the system which are (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system and 1-out-of-n:G repairable system are presented to illustrate the correctness of the analytical results.

PVNPAK was synthesized by a post-azo-coupling reaction, with an azo derivative as the electrooptic chromophore and carbazolyl as photoconductive moiety. The asymmetric two-beam coupling gain of 13.9 cm(-1) and diffraction efficiency of 1.2% for poled polymer film fabricated using a corona poling are obtained at the wavelength of 647.1 nm, confirming photorefractivity. We interpreted this result as the orientational enhancement, in which the spatial charge field may enhance the modulated orientation of the azobenzen chromophore. It is unexpected that the photorefractive gain of 9.5 cm(-1) for the unpoled polymer film also was observed without external field in two-beam coupling (TBC) experiment. This phenomenon is attributed to a light-induced orientational grating when the azobenzene groups are illuminated by polarized light.

Then, in the fully observable case, we first consider the joining strategy in a decentralized manner, that is, arriving customers observe the queue size and then decide whether or not to join the queue based on the net benefit they will obtain upon the completion of service. Secondly, we derive the threshold strategy that will yield the system's maximal expected profit, to reach the so-called social welfare optimization. Finally, Nash equilibrium and socially optimal mixed strategies are derived in the fully unobservable case. Moreover, some numerical examples are provided to explore the impact of system parameters on customer's joining behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The structure, band structure, density of states, and frequency-dependent complex dielectric function epsilon(omega) are calculated. The direct band gap of LiInSe2 is smaller than that of LiInS2. The birefringence Delta n (0) is negative for LiInS2 and LiInSe2. The imaginary and real parts of the second-order susceptibility are evaluated. It is found that chi((2))(333)(omega) is the dominant component which shows the largest total Re chi((2))(ijk)(0) values. The contribution from the intra-band and inter-band to the second harmonic generation is increased when S is replaced by Se. It is found that a compound with smaller energy band gap has larger values of chi(333)(0) which would lead to a possible route to further enhancement of Im chi(333)(omega) by band gap engineering.

The result shows that the method is effective, and a best catalyst can be obtained by heat-treating the precursor at 600 degrees C for 2 hours. In heat-treating, the cobalt ion is reduced to metallic beta-cobalt and the metallic cobalt simultaneously facilitates the nitrogen source reacting with acetylene black to form the active sites to oxygen reduction reaction. The nitrogen source can also react with acetylene black to prepare a metal-free catalyst without the existence of cobalt at a higher temperature, but the activity of resulted catalyst is worse.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/Vis diffuse reflectance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) techniques, and surface photovoltage (SPV), respectively. The results indicate that Pd-doped enhances the photo-induced charge separation efficiency and leads to different electronic properties when Pd-doped Bi2O3 photocatalysts are illuminated by different wavelengths of light: one is an electron acceptor in the UV light region, while the other is an electron donor in the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity of Pd-doped Bi2O3 photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange aqueous solution was evaluated, the result shows that 4% Pd possesses the best photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation and 3% Pd possesses the best photocatalytic activity under simulated sun light irradiation, and the possible reason is suggested. Doping with Pd is an effective way to promote the photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3.

The specific surface area, structure, morphology and the photoinduced charge separation efficiency of BiVO4 microcrystals were characterized by means of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), respectively. The results show that SOBS surfactant alters the surface parameters and the morphology, enhances the photo-induced charge separation efficiency of BiVO4 under solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of catalysts for photocatalytic decolorization of Rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution under solar light irradiation was investigated. The results demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity for degradation of RhB relate to SDBS-BiVO4 microcrystals is 7.5 times that of the reference BiVO4 microcrystals and the underlying reason is suggested.

Survey of trapping and solution of Xe have been presented. Incorporation and solution energies of Xe for various solution sites have been calculated by Mott-Littleton approach. Results suggest that the most stable trapping site for Xe depends on stoichiometry regions. The effect on diffusion of oxygen and uranium introduced by Xe has been estimated by classical molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that Xe atoms in any trapping site raise the values of oxygen diffusion coefficients and depress activation energies. Besides, the effect introduced by Xe decreases with an increase in trapping site size.	[Deng, B. L.] Chengdu Univ Technol, Dept Appl Phys, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tian, X.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of puerarin on hepatic oxidative stress and hyperlipidaemia in mice exposed to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Male ICR mice were injected with CCl4 with or without puerarin co-administration (200 and 400mg/kg intragastrically once-daily) for 8weeks. Our data showed that puerarin significantly prevented CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of the liver damage (serum aminotransferase levels) and histopathological analysis. Puerarin decreased the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and the protein carbonyl content (PCO) in the liver of CCl4-treated mice. Puerarin also restored the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the liver. Furthermore, the increase in serum cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) induced by CCl4 was effectively suppressed by puerarin. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in the CCl4 treatment mice was also increased by puerarin. Western blot analysis showed that puerarin remarkably inhibited hyperlipidaemia by regulating the expression of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), phosphorylated c-Jun protein and cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the liver of CCl4-treated mice. Altogether, these results suggest that puerarin could protect the CCl4-induced liver injury and hyperlipidaemia by reducing reactive oxygen species S production, renewing the total antioxidant capacity and influencing expression of hepatic lipid biosynthesis and metabolism genes.

However, the function and mechanism of extracellular UDP and P2Y(6) in antiviral immunity remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo protection of UDP/P2Y(6) signaling in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. First, we demonstrated that VSV-infected cells secrete UDP from the cytoplasm as a danger signal to arouse surrounding cells. Meanwhile, expression of the UDP-specific receptor P2Y(6) also was enhanced by VSV. Consequently, UDP protects RAW 264.7 cells, murine embryonic fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and L929 cells from VSV and GFP lentivirus infection. This protection can be blocked by the P2Y(6) selective antagonist MRS2578 or IFN-alpha/beta receptor-blocking Ab. VSV-induced cell death and virus replication were both enhanced significantly by knocking down and knocking out P2Y(6) in different cells. Mechanistically, UDP facilitates IFN-beta secretion through the p38/JNK- and ATF-2/c-Jun-signaling pathways, which are crucial in promoting antiviral immunity. Interestingly, UDP was released through a caspase-cleaved pannexin-1 channel in VSV-induced apoptotic cells and protected cells from infection through P2Y(6) receptor in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Furthermore, UDP also protected mice from VSV infection through P2Y(6) receptors in an acute neurotropic infection mouse model. Taken together, these results demonstrate the important role of extracellular UDP and P2Y(6) as a danger signal in antiviral immune responses and suggest a potential therapeutic role for UDP/P2Y(6) in preventing and controlling viral diseases.

The obtained results revealed that [Omim]Lpro was a mixed-type inhibitor with a predominantly cathodic action for mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, and inhibition efficiency reached nearly 80% at the concentration of 10mM, in which the Omim cation played a major role in the corrosion inhibition of [Omim]Lpro.

Single-phase aluminum oxynitride (AlON) can be prepared at a relatively low temperature (1700 degrees C) with a holding time of 3 h. The powder is ball milled, doped with different amounts of Y2O3 (0.1-0.9 wt%) as a sintering additive, and then shaped into pellets. The pellet sintering is carried out at two relatively low temperatures (1860 and 1880 degrees C) for 10 h. The transmittance and hardness of the obtained samples varies as the amount of Y2O3 varies. The sample sintered under optimal conditions can reach an ultimate transmittance of 65% with 2 mm thickness. The Vickers hardness of highly transparent AlON ceramic is about 15.95 +/- 0.17 GPa, indicating that our method has a promising future in transparent AlON ceramic production. The sintering promoting mechanisms of Y2O3 are also discussed in detail.

Combining backstepping technique with fuzzy neural network identifying, an adaptive backstepping fuzzy neural controller (ABFNC) for uncertain chaotic systems with unknown backlash is proposed. The proposed ABFNC system is comprised of a fuzzy neural network identifier (FNNI) and a robust controller. The FNNI is the principal controller utilized for online estimation of the unknown nonlinear function. The robust controller is used to attenuate the effects of the approximation error so that the stability and control performance of the closed-loop adaptive system is achieved always. Finally, simulation results show that the ABFNC can achieve favorable tracking performances.

The surface parameters, structure, morphology, the adsorption ability of light, the binding energy of Ti2p and O1s, and the formation rate of (OH)-O-center dot radicals produced during the photocatalytic reaction process were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and terephthalic acid photoluminescence probing technique (TA-PL), respectively. The results reveal that sulfating of SiO2-TiO2 induces the shift of Ti2p and O1s, and increases the adsorption of rhodamine B on the sulfated photocatalysts and the formation rate of (OH)-O-center dot radicals produced during the photocatalytic reaction process. The photocatalytic activity of SO42-/SiO2-TiO2 for de-colorization of rhodamine B aqueous solution was evaluated. The result shows that when wt% of SO42- is 8.6%, SO42-/SiO2-TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet light irradiation and the possible reason is discussed.

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction. The effects of elemental substitution in the LaCoO3 perovskite were studied, and the catalytic performance and primary stability of the hydrogen production from SRE were investigated. In the highly substituted samples, only the Ce-doped sample was isolated as the pure perovskite phase. The presence of a Co3O4 phase in the Ca-doped or Sr-doped samples was beneficial for the reduction of the active Co component, while Sr-doped or Ce-doped samples showed good activity and stability. The sample incorporating Sr demonstrated better catalytic performance than those of other samples. (C) 2014, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this study, we examined the protective effect of PCs against lead-induced inflammatory response in the rat brain and explored the potential mechanism of its action. The results showed that PCs administration significantly improved behavioral performance of lead-exposed rats. One of the potential mechanisms was that PCs decreased reactive oxygen species production and increased the total antioxidant capacity in the brains of lead-exposed rats. Furthermore, the results also showed that PCs significantly decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1 beta and cyclooxygenase-2 in the brains of lead-exposed rats. Moreover, PCs significantly decreased the levels of beta amyloid and phosphorylated tau in the brains of lead-treated rats, which in turn inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. PCs also decreased the phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2, inositol-requiring protein-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 and inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B nuclear translocation in the brains of lead-exposed rats. In conclusion, these results suggested that PCs could improve cognitive impairments by inhibiting brain oxidative stress and inflammatory response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, we can conclude that the rate of the trajectories of the system going from the exterior of the attractive set I broken vertical bar (lambda) to the interior of the attractive set I broken vertical bar (lambda) is an exponential rate. The rate of the trajectories is also obtained. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

J	Yin, F; Guo, K; Huang, GX; Huang, BM				Yin, Feng; Guo, Ke; Huang, Guangxin; Huang, Bormin			The inverse eigenproblem with a submatrix constraint and the associated approximation problem for (R, S)-symmetric matrices	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Inverse eigenproblem; Approximation problem; (R, S)-symmetric matrix; Leading principal submatrix; Moore-Penrose inverse	CENTRO-SYMMETRIC MATRICES; CENTROSYMMETRIC MATRICES; SOLVABILITY CONDITIONS; GENERALIZED SYMMETRY; EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS; REFLEXIVE SOLUTIONS; SKEW SYMMETRY; EIGENVECTORS	Let R epsilon R-nxn and S epsilon R-nxn be nontrivial involutions, i.e., R = R-1 not equal +/- I and S = S-1 not equal +/- I. A matrix A epsilon R-nxn is called (R, S)-symmetric if RAS = A. This paper presents a (R, S)-symmetric matrix solution to the inverse eigenproblem with a leading principal submatrix constraint. The solvability condition of the constrained inverse eigenproblem is also derived. The existence, the uniqueness and the expression of the (R, S)-symmetric matrix solution to the best approximation problem of the constrained inverse eigenproblem are achieved, respectively. An algorithm is presented to compute the (R, S)-symmetric matrix solution to the best approximation problem. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

The single X-ray diffraction indicated that the coordination polymer 1 had a three-dimensional (3D) framework. A trinuclear Mn unit is utilized as a building block connected via oxygen atoms of carboxylate group to form a two-dimensional layer structure. The interlayers connected by the ligands result in a 3D architecture. The coordination polymer 1 was characterized by the infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and powder XRD. According to magnetic susceptibility measurements the coordination polymer 1 can be characterized with the antiferromagnetic coupling interaction of J = -3.21 cm(-1). Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis revealed good thermal stability for the coordination polymer 1. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

So, it is crucial to develop processes that can destroy these dyes effectively. It has been generally agreed that methyl orange (MO) solution can be effectively decolorized in KIO4 homogeneous system under UV light irradiation. The knowledge on the influence of several reagents possesses both practical and theoretical values. The effects of H2O2, K2S2O8, and KBrO3 were investigated in detail. The results of the effects of five [GRAPHICS] scavengers are presented. The results show that [GRAPHICS] and [GRAPHICS] can promote the photocatalytic decolorization of MO solution and H2O2 can enhance the decolorization efficiency of MO in the dark. However, the results of the effects of five [GRAPHICS] scavengers cannot substantially support the argument that the degradation mechanism of KIO4 involves hydroxyl radical attack. A more detailed mechanism needs to be further investigated in the near future.

J	Zhu, YH; Zhuang, J; Zeng, XG				Zhu, Yanhua; Zhuang, Jia; Zeng, Xianguang			Mechanism of (NH4)S2O8 to enhance the anti-corrosion performance of Mo-Ce inhibitor on X80 steel in acid solution	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Acid condition; Mo-Ce composite corrosion inhibitor; Persulfates; Enhancement effect of anti-corrosion; Thermodynamics and kinetics	CORROSION-RESISTANCE; CERIUM; ALLOY; NACL	Ce(NO3)(3) and Na2MoO4 are adopted to form (Mo-Ce) composite corrosion inhibitor in allusion to the corrosion problem of steel in acidic conditions. The experimental results showed that the anticorrosion effects were enhanced and the inhibition efficiencies were increased by (NH4)(2)S2O8. The reason of enhancement is the increase of coordination bonds amount between Ce4+ and MoO42-, the augment of combining sites of interface between anti-corrosion film and steel, and the reinforce of adsorption caused by the transformation of Ce(3+)to Ce4+ by oxidants. The process and conditions for transformation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ and formation of complexes are discussed. The related thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calculated and the possibility for (NH4)(2)S2O8 to improve the performance of Mo-Ce corrosion inhibitor is proved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Semi-discrete Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithms for reaction diffusion equations	BIT NUMERICAL MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Schwarz methods; Waveform relaxation; Semi-discrete; 2nd-order/4th-order finite difference method	SHALLOW-WATER EQUATIONS; HEAT-EQUATION	For time dependent problems, the Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) algorithm can be analyzed both at the continuous and semi-discrete level. For consistent space discretizations, one would naturally expect that the semi-discrete algorithm performs as predicted by the continuous analysis. We show in this paper for the reaction diffusion equation that this is not always the case. We consider two space discretization methods-the 2nd-order central finite difference method and the 4th-order compact finite difference method, and for each method we show that the semi-discrete SWR algorithm with Dirichlet transmission condition performs as predicted by the continuous analysis. However, for Robin transmission condition the semi-discrete SWR algorithm performs worse than predicted by the continuous analysis. For each type of transmission conditions, we show that the convergence factors of the semi-discrete SWR algorithm using the two space discretization methods are (almost) equal. Numerical results are presented to validate our conclusions.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of puerarin on oxidative stress and inflammation in kidney induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and explored the potential mechanisms underlying this effect. Our results showed that puerarin administration significantly inhibited CCl4-induced kidney injury, which indicated by both diagnostic indicators and histopathological analysis. One of the potential mechanisms of puerarin action was decreased the oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreasing of lipid peroxidation level, increasing of SOD, CAT and GPx activities and GSH level. Puerarin also decreased 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (one product of oxidative DNA damage) level and increased the expression levels of NQO1, GST and HO-1 in kidneys of CCl4-treated mice. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that puerarin decreased production of pro-inflammatory markers including iNOS and COX-2 in CCl4-treated mouse kidney. We found that puerarin significantly inhibited the ERK phosphorylation and increased the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nuclear fraction, which in turn inactivated NF-kappa B and the inflammatory cytokines in kidneys of the CCl4-treated mice.

J	Yu, MM; Tang, YH; Wu, WQ; Zhou, J				Yu, Miaomiao; Tang, Yinghui; Wu, Wenqing; Zhou, Jie			Optimal order-replacement policy for a phase-type geometric process model with extreme shocks	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Shock model; Maintenance; Phase-type distribution; Geometric process; Procurement	DETERIORATING-SYSTEM; REPAIRABLE SYSTEM; MAINTENANCE MODEL; LEAD-TIME; PROCUREMENT	A system is subject to random shocks that arrive according to a phase-type (PH) renewal process. As soon as an individual shock exceeds some given level the system will break down. The failed system can be repaired immediately. With the increasing number of repairs, the maximum shock level that the system can withstand will be decreasing, while the consecutive repair times after failure will become longer and longer. Undergoing a specified number of repairs, the existing system will be replaced by a new and identical one. The spare system for the replacement is available only by sending a purchase order to a supplier, and the duration of spare system procurement lead time also follows a PH distribution. Based on the number of system failures, a new order-replacement policy (also called (K, N) policy) is proposed in this paper. Using the closure property of the PH distribution, the long-run average cost rate for the system is given by the renewal reward theorem. Finally, through numerical calculation, it is determined an optimal order-replacement policy such that the long-run expected cost rate is minimum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction, UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope. The separation efficiency of photo-generated charge was studied using benzoquinone as scavenger. Hydroxyl radicals produced during photocatalytic process were detected by a terephthalic acid photoluminescence probing technique. Doping Ga3+ into SnO2 can greatly enhance the separation efficiency of photo-induced charge and the formation rate of hydroxyl radicals. The superoxide radical is the main active species during the photocatalytic process. The catalytic activity of photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange in aqueous solution was investigated. Among the photocatalysts prepared, Ga-doped SnO2 with 3 %Ga possesses the best photocatalytic activity and the underlying mechanism is suggested.

Some neuroimaging studies have reported that PNES exhibits aberrant functional connectivity in specific brain networks. Thus, advanced neuroimaging technologies may aid clinical diagnosis and treatment of PNES. Methods: We investigated changes in brain functional connectivity in 18 patients with PNES and 20 healthy controls. Functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM), a voxelwise data-driven technique, was employed to compute local and global FCD maps. Then, short-range and long-range FCD values were calculated and group analyses performed between patents with PNES and healthy controls. A correlation analysis with clinical variables was also performed. Results: We found that patients with PNES showed abnormal FCD regions mainly in the frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula and occipital cortex. Seed-voxel correlation analyses also showed disrupted functional connectivity between these regions. In addition, the occipital cortex FCD correlated with duration of disease. Conclusion: The present results support the hypothesis that patients with PNES are associated with altered attention, sensorimotor and emotion systems. Furthermore, correlations between altered regions in the occipital cortex and duration of disease may reflect an adaptation in these patients for long-term hypervigilance and increased response to external stimuli. This study adds new knowledge to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PNES. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Also the introducing of a Gemini surfactant, bis(hexadecyldimethylammonium)hexane bromide (16-6-16, 2Br(-)), gave interested observations relative to those controlled trials preformed in buffer and a micellar solution of traditional single-chain surfactant, CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). The results indicated that the dinuclear Cu2L efficiently accelerated PNPP hydrolysis with 18,096- and 49,569.6-fold rate enhancement under moderate conditions (pH 7.00, 25 degrees C) in buffer and 16-6-16 micellar solution, respectively. Much greater rate enhancement was observed in 16-6-16 micelles in contrast with CTAB micelles, launching 1.6-2.6 folds difference in hydrolysis rate of PNPP at pH 7.00. Additionally, the Cu2L-induced PNPP hydrolysis showed a bell-shaped rate-pH profile, which is an enzyme-like behaviour. Interestingly, rate-pH curves could provide the direct evidence for the interfacial effects of Gemini 16-6-16 micelles on the deprotonation of coordinated water, indicating about 0.2 unit pK(a1) difference of the Cu2L-bound H2O between in micellar phase and bulk phase. Cu2L was found to be approximately 199.3- and 288.7-fold reactive than CuL in buffer and 16-6-16 micellar solution, respectively. Significant activity difference between both complexes probably results from the bimetallic coorperation of the two catalytic copper sites and more open binding site of Cu2L. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An extensive structural search shows that the relative stable structures of AunNi- (n = 1-9) clusters adopt 2D structure for n = 1 - 5, 7 and 3D structure for n = 6, 8 - 9. And the substitution of a Ni atom for an Au atom in the Au-n+1(-) cluster obviously changes the structure of the host cluster. Moreover, an odd-even alternation phenomenon has been found for HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, indicating that the relative stable structures of the AunNi- clusters with odd-numbered gold atoms have a higher relative stability. Finally, the natural population analysis (NPA) and the vertical detachment energies (VDE) are studied, respectively. The theoretical values of VDE are reported for the first time to our best knowledge.

The chemical composition of the complexes (CeL and LaL) was determined by a UV-Vis spectrophotometric method and kinetic Job plot. Two metallomicellar systems made of an lanthanide metal complex and n-lauroylsarcosine (LSS) micelle were used as catalyst in the hydrolysis of bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate ester (BNPP), and their catalytic activity was studied by the comparative method. The interaction between the complex and BNPP in the metallomicelle was studied by its fluorescent spectroscopy. The catalytic rate of BNPP hydrolysis was measured kinetically by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The results indicate that CeL systems (aqueous solution and metallomicelle) exhibit higher catalytic activity than those of the LaL systems in BNPP hydrolysis, and the micelle provides an effective catalytic environment in the catalytic reaction. A reaction mechanism was also proposed on the basis of the results.

Employing dimeric metalloporphyrins, metallosalphen complexes, and chemically responsive dyes as the sensing elements, the developed sensor array of artificial nose shows a unique pattern of colorific changes upon its exposure to eight less-reactive VOCs and their mixture gas at a concentration of 735 nmol/L within 3 min. Potential of quantitative analysis of VOCs samples was proved. A good linear relationship of 490-3675 nmol/L was obtained for benzene vapor with a detection limit of 49 nmol/L(S/N=3). Data analysis was carried out by Hierarchical cluster analysis(HCA) and principal component analysis(PCA). Each category of breath VOCs clusters together in the PCA score plot. No errors in classification by HCA were observed in 45 trials. Additionaly, the colorimetric sensor array showed good reproducibility under the cyclic sensing experiments. These results demonstrate that the developed colorimetric artificial nose system is an excellent sensing platform for the identification and quantitative analysis of breath VOCs of patients with lung cancer.

The coordination polymer shows a new (2D -> 3D) polythreaded array that is obtained from the self-assembly of adjacent 2D layers with dangling lateral arms, in which each large hexagonal void of one layer is threaded by two dangling lateral arms of two adjacent layers belonging to two identical spatial orientations. The luminescence study indicates that the title compound emits bright red fluorescence compared to the free ligand at room temperature. In addition, the small-sized and non-polar pores do not enable 1 to attract CO2 and N-2 strongly, which can be confirmed by the computational method based on Connolly's algorithm.

However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced injury in kidneys are not yet clear. In the current report, we investigated whether UA inhibited the oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidneys of CCl4 treated mice. Male ICR mice were injected with CCl4 with or without UA co-administration (25 and 50 mg/kg intragastrically once daily) for six weeks. Our data showed that UA significantly prevented CCl4-induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of kidney damage and histopathological analysis. Moreover, CCl4-induced profound elevation of ROS and oxidative stress, as evidenced by the increase of lipid peroxidation level and the depletion of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level in the kidney, was suppressed by treatment with UA. UA also decreased 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (one product of oxidative DNA damage) levels. Furthermore, protein expression by Western blot analysis showed that UA significantly decreased production of pro-inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in CCl4-treated mouse kidney. In exploring the underlying mechanisms of UA action, we found that UA increased the phosphorylation of transcription 3 (STAT3), which in turn activated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and the inflammatory cytokines in the kidneys. In conclusion, these results suggested that the inhibition of CCl4-induced inflammation by UA is due at least in part to its anti-oxidant activity and its ability to modulate the STAT3 and NF-kappa B signaling pathways.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, X-ray diffraction, UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope. The photogenerated charges separation efficiency of different photocatalysts was investigated using benzoquinone as scavenger. The formation rate of (OH)-O-center dot radicals produced during the photocatalytic reaction process was studied by a terephthalic acid photoluminescence probing technique. Doping Ga3+ into alpha-Fe2O3 increases the specific surface area and the separation efficiency of photo-induced charges. The catalytic activity of the photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange aqueous solution was investigated. The results show that alpha-Fe2O3 doped with 3% Ga possesses the best photocatalytic activity. The underlying mechanism is suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The theory of symbolic dynamics reduces chaos to a shift map that acts on a discrete set of symbols, each of which contains information about the system state. Using this transformation, a coder-decoder scheme is proposed. A model for the relationship among word length, region number of a partition, and synchronization error is provided. According to the model, the fundamental trade-off between word length and region number can be optimized to minimize the synchronization error. Numerical simulations provide support for our results.

The advanced instruments such as MAR, FTIR, and SEM were used to characterize the two copolymers. Their hydrophobic association properties in water were investigated by viscosimetry as well as the dewatering performance studied by the sludge dewatering experiment. The results showed that the optimum conditions for preparation of PAA were that the initiator concentration, urea concentration, molar ratio of AODBAC to AM, and irradiation time were 0.3 parts per thousand, 1.0%, 10:90, and 60 min, respectively. Also, it was found that PAA had a stronger hydrophobic interaction with a lower intrinsic viscosity and longer dissolution time as well as a better dewatering performance. Furthermore, the charge neutralization and bridging effects were found to contribute much to the sludge dewatering by PAA in which the dewatering performance was able to be enhanced further by the hydrophobic interaction.

The main objective of the present work is to compare low temperature softness of leather lubricated with various types of fatliquors. In this work, a softness tester and dynamic mechanical analysis were used to investigate the softness variation of leather which was lubricated with different types of fatliquors, such as polyether silicone, sulphonated rapeseed oil, modified soybean lecithin and so on, at temperatures within the range of -15 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The results indicate that the smallest variation in softness ratio is shown by polyether oil lubricated leather and imply that silicone oil is superior to sulphonated rapeseed oil and modified lecithin for manufacturing a leather with excellent low temperature softness. Therefore there is great value in effectively utilizing silicone oil as a main component in fatliquoring agents to meet the new growing demand for low temperature softness of leather.

The results showed that the 10%MoO3/SiO2 catalyst prepared by TS (10%MoO3/SiO2-TS) exhibited higher catalytic performance compared with the 10%MoO3/SiO2 catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (10%MoO3/SiO2-C). The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, pyridine-IR spectroscopy, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. These analyses indicated that weak Lewis acid sites were formed on the catalyst surfaces and that the Mo species were present as monomeric MoO3 rather than as isolated molybdenum oxide or polymolybdate species on both catalysts, although the 10%MoO3/SiO2-TS exhibited better dispersion of MoO3 and a higher surface Mo content than the 10%MoO3/SiO2-C.

Surface examinations were carried out using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and microscopic Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Experimental results show that the corrosion current decreases with prolonged immersion time, the three stages of hydrogen evolution rate correspond with the growth processes of the surface film on AZ63 magnesium alloys, and charge transfer resistance increases with the accumulation of corrosion products. A layer of MgO with sulfate salt grains underneath seems smooth at first. However, a few surface micro-cracks caused by inner stress appear on the smooth base film after 5 h of immersion, followed by the aggregation of spherical grains and the formation of cracks after 12 h. It is suggested that sulfate salt, carbonate salt, and hydroxide of magnesium should be the main composition of the surface film.

Compared to traditional rice-koji, Panax quinquefolius Yaoqu demonstrated apparently higher saccharifying and liquefying power in shallow tray fermentation, and the Panax quinquefolius Sake's indexes were better than rice-koji Sake's. A sensitive determination method of ginsenosides Rg1, Rb1, Re in Panax quinquefolius Yaoqu and Panax quinquefolius Sake using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated with electrospray ionization in positive multiple reactions monitoring mode. The physical and chemical indexes of Panax quinquefolius Yaoqu and Panax quinquefolius Sake were better than rice-koji's and rice-koji Sake's. Specifically, saccharifying power, liquefaction power, amino acid nitrogen, total acid, and total sugar were improved to 1,764.95 U/g dry Qu, 56.61 U/g dry Qu, 0.56 g/L, 3.23 g/L, and 85 g/L, respectively, which were 31.52, 48.70, 211.10, 18.75, and 18.06 % higher than the rice-koji's and rice-koji Sake's.

The results were used to compute the zircon Ce anomaly, Ti-in-zircon temperature, and the magma oxygen fugacity. Generally, the Ce anomalies determined with La-Pr interpolation are prone to be underestimated due to the influence of tiny inclusions or analytical errors. This underestimation can markedly influence the data processing and generate unrealistically low oxygen fugacity values. In contrast, the lattice strain model yields more reliable results, and offers a robust tool in determining the magma oxidation state. The calculated magma oxygen fugacities are in the range of FMQ-1.41 to +3.21, FMQ-3.25 to +3.74, FMQ +3.66 to +5.27, and FMQ +2.51 to +4.67, respectively. The high average oxygen fugacities of FMQ +4.51 and FMQ +3.46 for a 1881 Ma old pegmatitic granite and 1866 Ma old granitic veins suggest these rocks were probably formed in arc setting, which further supports the similar to 1.8 Ga collision between the Western and Eastern Blocks of the North China Craton.

The effects of the power-law distribution of dust and other plasma parameters on the dust-acoustic solitary waves are studied. Numerical results show that the dust size distribution has a significant influence on the propagation properties of dust-acoustic solitons. The amplitudes of solitary waves in the case of a power-law distribution is observed to be smaller, but the soliton velocity and width are observed to be larger, than those of mono-sized dust grains with an average dust size. Our results indicate that only compressed solitary waves exist in dusty plasma with different dust species. The relevance of the present investigation to interstellar clouds is discussed.

Further, the related mononuclear zinc(II) and cobalt(II) complexes were prepared and used as mimic hydrolases to catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of p-nitrophenyl picolinate (PNPP) in buffered aqueous solution and a micellar solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Observations show that for all of catalytic systems, the hydrolysis of PNPP was pH-dependent in the pH range of 7.00-8.20. Besides, hydrolysis rates of PNPP displayed a constant increase with the increasing concentration of substrate. In the case of CoL-containing system, moreover, much greater acceleration for PNPP hydrolysis was observed in comparison with the ZnL-containing system. However, micellar effect of CTAB micelle aggregates on the PNPP hydrolysis was not obvious only showing 1.0 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 1.3 folds rate difference in contrast to buffered aqueous solution.

The calculated electron affinities and neutral fundamental vibrational frequencies of both isotopomers are in good agreement with available experimental data. The measured photoelectron spectra are also accurately reproduced, further validating the accuracy of the potential energy surfaces.

Firstly, ZCuSn10 alloy is cast, and samples are cut from ingot casting. Secondly, the samples are rolled with 2 similar to 4 passes after holding at 450 degrees C for 15 min, then the new samples are cut from deformed alloy. Lastly, the new samples are reheated up to 850 degrees C or 875 degrees C for 15 min, then water quenching. Semi-solid microstructure is observed and compared with microstructure of ZCuSn10 alloy directly reheated after casting. The distribution of Sn element in microstructure under different conditions is measured by using EDS function of SEM, and the microstructure changes during the SIMA process are observed by means of OM and TEM. Based on the experiments, the microstructure evolution is synthetically analyzed and explained during the course of semi-solid billet of ZCuSn10 alloy prepared by SIMA method. The results indicate that semi-solid microstructure of ZCuSn10 alloy by rolling-remelting SIMA process is equal-fine grain, and spheroidization of solid particle is well. The optimum semi-solid microstructure is obtained when alloy deformed 19.7% is remelted at 875 degrees C for 15 min, the average grain diameter is 75.8 mu m, shape factor is 1.62, and volume fraction of liquid phase is 17.28%. Deformation process plays a crucial role in grain refinement and spheroidization during SIMA process for preparing the semi-solid billet of ZCuSn10 alloy, as deformation and remelting temperature increases, the size and shape of solid phase in semi solid microstructure are smaller and more round, volume fraction of liquid phase increases. The main mechanism of SIMA process preparing semi-solid billet of ZCuSn10 alloy is that predeformation breaks dendrites and stores energy of deformation into dendrites, and promotes dendrites melting through remelting process. Meanwhile, liquid phase occupies sharp corners of solid particles by Sn element diffusing from liquid phase into alpha solid phase, so that fine, uniform and roundness alpha solid particles are gained.

However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced hepatotoxicity have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of UA on oxidative stress and inflammation in liver of CCl4 treated mice. Male ICR mice were injected with CCl4 with or without UA co-administration (25 and 50 mg/kg intragastrically once daily) for one week. Our data showed that UA significantly prevented CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of liver damage (serum aminotransferase activities) and histopathological analysis. Moreover, CCl4-induced profound elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress, as evidenced by increasing of lipid peroxidation level and depleting of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level in liver, were suppressed by treatment with UA. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that UA significantly decreased CYP2E1 expression levels and production of pro-inflammatory markers including TNF-alpha, IL-beta and COX-2 in CCl4-treated mouse liver. In exploring the underlying mechanisms of UA action, we found that UA decreased the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (JNK, p38 MAPK, ERK), which in turn inactivated the immunoregulatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) in liver of CCl4 treated mice. In conclusion, these results suggested that the inhibition of CCl4-induced inflammation by UA is due at least in part to its anti-oxidant activity and its ability to modulate the MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

The characterization results confirmed that the ordered mesoporous structure was well sustained in the Ce-incorporated NiAl materials (Ce/Al molar ratio<4%). Compared with NiAl mesoporous materials, Ce-incorporated mesoporous materials demonstrated higher specific surface areas, larger pore volumes, and more uniform pore sizes. The catalytic test conducted by using methane dry reforming revealed that compared with NiAl catalysts, all the Ce-promoted catalysts demonstrated improved initial catalytic activity, which was due to the high dispersion and the high reduction degree of active Ni species in NiCeAl catalysts. The stable alumina framework, confinement effect of ordered mesopores, and high oxygen mobility contributed to the improved catalytic stability of NiCeAl catalysts. For comparison, the mesoporous NiCeAl catalyst (denoted as NiCeAl-IMP) was also prepared by using the conventional impregnation method. The agglomeration of Ni particles was observed during the stability test for the Ni-impregnated catalyst, which accelerated the rate of carbon deposition. The NiCeAl catalyst (Ce/Al molar ratio=1%) demonstrated excellent resistance to the formation of graphitic carbon species owing to the redox property, while a large amount of graphitic carbon species was deposited over the NiAl sample, which was responsible for deactivation.

The phenomena and progress of f-PS corrosion in 1.0 M NaOH at 318 K was obtained and described. Weight loss measurements show that the corrosion rate increases with increasing temperature and concentration of NaOH solution. Meanwhile, the corrosion rate first increases with increasing volume ratio of ethanol in 1.0 M NaOH, and then decreases. Additionally, the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters (E-a, A, Delta H-a and Delta S-a) for f-PS corrosion were obtained and discussed. And the effect factors (T, c and v) of f-PS corrosion in NaOH solution were studied in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our results suggest that for starting materials with low gamma-Al2O3/total Al2O3 ratio R (0 and 0.15), a calcination temperature of 1 750 C is required to obtain single-phase AlON. This temperature is about 50 C higher than for other batches starting with larger R values (0.5, 0.85, and 1.0). The AlON powders fabricated from reactants with a high R value in this work show narrower particle size distribution and better particle homogeneity than those prepared from batches with lower R values.

In 1 and 2, both of them are mononuclear structures, which could be linked by the hydrogen-bonded interactions into 3D motifs. However, the types of the hydrogen interactions and resulting motifs are different. The difference of final structures can be attributed to the effect of carboxylate ligands.

In the proposed MSCQPSO algorithm, the population is divided into multi-populations according to the computed fitness value. The SA and diversity-guided mutation strategy are introduced to enhance the global search ability. The quantum behavior theory is introduced into co-evolution theory to change the updating mode of the particles in order to guarantee the simplification and effectiveness. In order to prove the validity of the proposed MSCQPSO algorithm, the ten high-dimensional complex benchmark functions are selected in here. The experiment results show that the proposed MSCQPSO algorithm takes on the fast convergence, the high searching accuracy, the better robustness for solving the high-dimensional complex problems than the PSO algorithm, the CPSO algorithm and HPSO algorithm.

The textures of the coals were characterized through N-2 adsorption at 77 K. Their surface morphologies were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The high pressure adsorption data of methane on the coals were obtained at supercritical temperatures. The data were analyzed using the Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) and Langmuir models. The methods for estimating pseudo-saturation vapor pressure were investigated. And the influence of the characteristic curve form on the D-A equation prediction was investigated. The results show that the constants derived by matching the experimental data to the Langmuir model might lack physical significance, though the Langmuir model was of the correct qualitative form to represent the isotherms of methane on coals. The method for estimating pseudo-saturation vapor pressures proposed by Schwarz failed to render the experimental data to fall onto one characteristic curve. A modified procedure of determining the value of parameter k in Schwarz's equation, i.e. p(s) = p(c)(T/T-c)(k) was proposed. It was found that the modified approach gave the most suitable temperature-independent characteristic curves with determination coefficient R-2 > 0.9943. The form of the characteristic curve could influence the D-A model prediction. Using cubic polynomial as characteristic curve form would result in an abnormal prediction i.e. the adsorption amount would increase with the pressure dropping when the pressure is less than approximately 0.9 MPa for Xingq-1-5# and Xujd-1#, 0.8 MPa for Qingh-2-3#, and 0.5 MPa for Leiy-1#. A new form of the characteristic curve deduced from D-A equation was proposed. The prediction uncertainty of D-A equation by using this new characteristic curve form is less than 2.43%.

Time-delay coupling, derivative coupling, nonlinear coupling etc. exist universally in real-world complex networks. The adaptive synchronization scheme is designed for the complex network with multiple class of coupling terms. A criterion guaranteeing synchronization of such complex networks is established by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem and adaptive control schemes. Finally, an illustrative example with numerical simulation is given to show the feasibility and efficiency of theoretical results.

We depict formally related problems of multiple ontology versions query and prove the equality between our description and a logic-based one. Supporting various requirements on multiple ontology versions, our approach can save more running time than previous algorithms, which is explained by analyzing our algorithms. Also experiments show that the advantage of running speed is more remarkable for ontology versions which are large in quantity and scale.

Further, by using Alber's inequalities, the definition of normalized duality mapping on the dual spaces of Banach spaces and the new proximal mapping technique associated with the general A-monotone operators, we discuss the approximation solvability of general A-monotone nonlinear inclusion forms in Banach spaces and prove the convergence analysis of iterative sequences generated by the algorithm frameworks via applying the Lipschitz continuity of M-1 (that is, the inverse of multi-valued operator M) and the Lipschitz continuity of proximal mapping associated with the general A-monotone operators, respectively. Finally, some applications are given to show that the results presented in this paper improve, generalize and unify the corresponding results of recent works. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that the MgnFe, MgnCo, and MgnNi clusters have similar geometric structures and that the X atom in MgnX clusters prefers to be endohedrally doped. The average atomic binding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order differences in energy, and HOMO-LUMO gaps show that Mg4X (X = Fe, Co, Ni) clusters possess relatively high stability. Natural population analysis was performed and the results showed that the 3s and 4s electrons always transfer to the 3d and 4p orbitals in the bonding atoms, and that electrons also transfer from the Mg atoms to the doped atoms (Fe, Co, Ni). In addition, the spin magnetic moments were analyzed and compared. Several clusters, such as Mg1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9Fe, Mg1,2,4,5,6,8,9Co, and Mg1,2,5,6,7,9Ni, present high magnetic moments (4 mu(B), 3 mu(B), and 2 mu(B), respectively).

J	Liu, CJ; Zhang, Y; Tan, KK; Yang, HY				Liu, Changjiang; Zhang, Yi; Tan, Kokkiong; Yang, Hongyu			Sensor Fusion Method for Horizon Detection From an Aircraft in Low Visibility Conditions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Approach and landing; instrument landing system; multisensor fusion; region growing; synthetic vision	MICRO AIR VEHICLES; VISION; SYSTEM; NAVIGATION; GPS	The approach and landing of an aircraft under low visibility has been a subject of great interest in recent years. Although much advanced equipment has been designed and used on airplanes to improve the safety threshold in manipulating it, low visibility has remained the potential threat of causing controlled flight into terrain and runway intrusion. Besides, low visibility is also the main cause for flight delay, which reduces the efficiency of transportation systems. Clear landmarks on the ground will significantly improve pilots' spatial awareness under low visibility conditions, and among all landmarks, horizon position is the key one to count on for successfully controlling an aircraft during landing. The purpose of this paper is to design a horizon detection method based on a multisensor fusion strategy suitable for poor visibility conditions. With the fusion approach, pilots are able to recover/reconstruct the horizon under low visibility conditions. Analysis of experimental results and comparisons with reported methods are furnished at the end of this paper.

The obtained results reveal that BMBIMI is an effective mixed-type corrosion inhibitor for mild steel, and the adsorption of BMBIMI on the mild steel surface is found to obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, thus the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the adsorption process are calculated and discussed. Moreover, theoretical calculations give further insight into the mechanism of inhibition of BMBIMI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adsorption isotherm fitting revealed that the Langmuir model was preferred for the aminated ACs. The adsorption capacity per unit surface area (q(m)/SSA(BET)) was linearly correlated with the amount of pyridinic and pyrrolic N, which suggested that these two functional groups played a critical role in phenol adsorption. The enhancement of adsorption capacity was attributed to the strengthened pi-pi dispersion between phenol and basal plane of AC by pyridinic, pyrrolic N. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo-secondorder kinetic model, and intraparticle diffusion was one of the rate-controlling steps in the adsorption process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Printing nanoporous porphyrin, dimeric metalloporphyrins, metallosalophen complexes and chemically responsive dyes on a hydrophobic membrane, the developed sensor array of artificial tongue and nose showed a unique pattern of colorimetric change upon exposure to green tea liquids or gases. All green tea samples, both in liquid and gas analysis, gave distinct patterns according to geographical origin and grade level, thus resulting in their facile identification. The good reproducibility of colorimetric artificial tongue and nose was proved. Data analysis was performed by chemometric techniques: hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA). Chinese green tea from the same geographical origin could cluster together in PCA score plot. No errors in classification by HCA were observed in 90 trials. The colorimetric artificial tongue and nose can be used to discriminate Chinese green tea according to geographical origin and grade level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By employing a combination of Lyapunov functional, the free-weighting matrix method and stochastic analysis technique, several delay-dependent criteria for the passivity of the addressed neural networks are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be checked numerically using the effective LMI toolbox in MATLAB. An example with simulations is given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed criteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ru/CeO2 showed the best performance in the reaction, which is associated with its smaller metal particle size and the weak surface basicity feature of CeO2. 1,2-Propanediol is obtained as the main product through a dehydrogenation-dehydration-hydrogenation mechanism.

The chemical functional groups of these CBs were determined by the neutralization titration method. The nanomorphologies of these CBs were observed by atomic force microscope (AFM). It was found that the primary particle of DZ(13) is about 50 nm in diameter, almost the same as that of N330 and but less than that of N660. The SBR coating on the surface of DZ(13) is smooth and complete. The carboxyl group content, DBP adsorption and N-2 adsorption values of DZ(13) are rather higher than those of N330 and N660. The measurements of bound rubber at high temperatures in an ammonia atmosphere suggest that bound rubber is caused corporately by physical and chemical adsorption. The high bound rubber content (46.32% at 20 degrees C) and extrapolated extraction temperature (about 360 degrees C) of DZ(13) result mainly from its high structure and surface chemical activity.

However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced injury in liver have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of sesamin on oxidative stress and apoptosis in mice exposed to CCl4. Our data showed that sesamin significantly prevented CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of liver damage (serum aminotransferase activities) and histopathological. analysis. Moreover, CCl4-induced profound elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress, as evidenced by increasing of lipid peroxidation level and depleting of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in liver, were suppressed by treatment with sesamin. Furthermore, TUNEL assay showed that CCl4-induced apoptosis in mouse liver was significantly inhibited by sesamin. In exploring the underlying mechanisms of sesamin action, we found that activities of caspase-3 were markedly inhibited by the treatment of sesamin in the liver of CCl4 treated mice. Sesamin increased expression levels of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinases (INK) in liver, which in turn inactivated pro-apoptotic signaling events restoring the balance between mitochondrial pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and decreasing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in liver of CCl4 treated mice. INK was also involved in the mitochondrial extrinsic apoptotic pathways of sesamin effects against CCl4 induced liver injury by regulating the expression levels of phosphorylated c-Jun proteins, necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Bak. In conclusion, these results suggested that the inhibition of CCl4-induced apoptosis by sesamin is due at least in part to its anti-oxidant activity and its ability to modulate the JNK signaling pathway.

In the monometallic nickel catalyst, the plasma pretreatment increased the dispersion of nickel but decreased its degree of reduction, whereas the addition of platinum facilitated the reduction of nickel. As a result, the plasma-treated bimetallic Ni-Pt catalyst exhibited a high reforming activity. It also displayed an improved stability because of its enhanced resistance to sintering and excellent anti-coking performance. The plasma-assited Ni-Pt catalyst effectively inhibited coking by improving metal dispersion, reducing Ni-0 size and modifying nickel ensembles.

In our investigation, the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (RPBE) generalized gradient approach (GGA) was used to treat the exchange and correlation potential. We modeled the (0 0 1) surfaces with (root 2 x root 2) R45 degrees supercell. Every supercell contains five atomic planes. Our calculations show that the adsorption energies of H2O are low. The energies are -0.44 eV/molecule and -0.65 eV/molecule on HfC and TaC (0 0 1) surfaces, respectively. On both the (0 0 1) surfaces, molecular water prefers to be adsorbed on top of surface metal atom. However, only the oxygen atom of water molecule is bound with surface metal atom. And the plane of water molecule tends to be parallel to the surfaces. Compared with the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of an isolated water molecule, the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in H2O/HfC (0 0 1) and H2O/TaC (0 0 1) have less negative and positive charges, respectively. Our results show that water molecule is adsorbed molecularly on HfC and TaC (0 0 1) surfaces at initial adsorption stage. Moreover, the interaction of water molecule with the (0 0 1) surfaces is weak. Charge density differences and density of states show that O-Ta bond is slightly stronger than O-Hf bond. Due to the strong O-Ta bond, the oxidation resistance of TaC may stronger than HfC in water vapor atmosphere. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this report, egg yolk antibody (IgY) against N-terminal of VP60 was evaluated and developed as a new strategy for RHDV therapy. Briefly, N-terminal of VP60 (similar to 250aa) fragment was cloned and inserted into pET28a expression vector, and then the resultant plasmid, pET28a/VP60-N, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for recombinant VP60-N protein (rVP60-N) expression. Next, the rVP60-N was purified by Ni+-affinity purification chromatography and identified by Western blotting with RHDV antiserum. After immunizing the chickens with rVP60-N, the anti-rVP60-N IgY was isolated, and the activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were analyzed by ELISA and Western blotting. In our results, the rVP60-N could be expressed in E. coli as soluble fraction, and the isolated anti-rVP60-N IgY demonstrated a high specificity and titer (1:22,000) against rVP60-N antigen. For further evaluation of the IgY efficacy in vivo, rabbits were grouped randomly and challenged with RHDV, and the results showed that anti-rVP60-N IgY could significantly protect rabbits from virus infection and promote the host survival after a sustained treatment with anti-rVP60-N IgY for 5 days. Taken together, our study demonstrates evidence that production of IgY against VP60 could be as a novel strategy for the RHDV therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The plasmon resonance peak of gold nanotube assemblies is strongly dependent on the polarization direction and gap distance. The optical absorption exhibits that the resonances correspond to different modes. These modes can be regarded as dipole interaction from their charge distribution. The interaction between nanotubes is opposite for different polarization direction, which causes distinct anisotropy effects in the spectral behavior. These results offer us alternative ways to tune the plasmon resonance in this structure.

The kinetics of hydrolysis of bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (BNPP) in the catalytic system containing macrocyclic ligand and praseodymium(III) was investigated. The analysis of specific absorption spectrums of the hydrolytic reaction systems indicated that key intermediates made up of BNPP and praseodymium(III) complexes are formed in the reaction process of BNPP catalytic hydrolysis. In this, the mechanism of BNPP catalytic hydrolysis proposed is based on the analytic result of specific absorption spectrum, and the corresponding kinetic constants are calculated. The results showed that the praseodymium(III) complexes as hydrolase mimics exhibit good catalytic activity and similar catalytic character to natural enzyme.

The kraft lignins isolated from eucalyptus (EKL) and bamboo (BKL) had a low hydroxyl (oxygen) contents, a low molecular weights (similar to 3000 g.mol(-1)) and a uniform molar mass distribution with promising results for oxidative conversions. EKL shows a tendency to higher purity and higher functional group content in hydroxy group, methoxy group, beta-O-4 linkage than BKL. Oxidations cause depolymerization of kraft lignin, in which kraft lignin was selectively oxidized by the catalyst. Oxidation products, 2-methoxy phenol and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy benzaldehyde, can be observed on treatment of kraft lignin. Catalytic oxidation of EKL lignin shows a higher yield of products, most likely due to the high content of beta-O-4 ether linkages, hydroxyl groups. Both structural and oxidative characteristics suggest that EKL would be a better feedstock in the production of aromatic products, as it presents higher amounts of hydroxyl functional groups, beta-O-4 linkages, and as it presents higher molecular weight and higher purity.

Real-time panorama is conducive to timely treat traffic accidents and to greatly improve traffic capacity. This paper designs a 3D road scene monitoring framework based on real-time panorama. The system is the combination of large scale panorama, satellite map textures, and 3D scene model, in which users can ramble freely. This paper has the following contributions. Firstly, land-points were extracted followed by motion detection, then comotion algorithm was applied to land-points from adjacent cameras, and homography matrix was constructed. Secondly, reference camera was chosen and transformed to overhead viewpoint; subsequently multiviews were morphed to the same viewpoint and stitched to panorama. Finally, the registration based on high-precision GPS information between 2D road panorama and 3D scene model was also proposed. The proposed framework has been successfully applied to a large road intersection monitoring. Experimental results are furnished at the end of the paper.

Denote by pi(G) the set of prime divisors of |G|. Let GK(G) be the graph with vertex set pi(G) such that two primes p and q in pi(G) are joined by an edge if G has an element of order p center dot q.

Alavi and Daneshkhah proved that the groups, A(n) where n = p p 1, p t 2 with s(G) >= 2, are characterized by N(G). As a development of these topics, we will prove that if G is a finite group with trivial center and N(G) = N(A(p+3)) with p I 2 composite, then G is isomorphic to A(p+3).

This type of ligand possesses specific complexation with metal ions, such as those of transition-metals, rare earths, alkali metals and alkaline earths, which form metal complexes whose structures are similar to those of some biological enzymes. In recent decades, research on aza-crown ethers and their metal complexes as mimics of nucleases in hydrolysing nucleic acids has attracted increasing attention. These studies illuminate the mechanism of nucleic acid hydrolytic cleavage as catalysed by natural nucleases. In order to assist the design and synthesis of highly active, selective and stable mimic nucleases, this paper reviews recent progress in the investigation of aza-crown ether metal complexes as mimic nucleases, including: the relationship between the structures and activities of synthetic metallonucleases; multicentre synergistic catalysis of metal ions in multinuclear complexes; bifunctional cooperative catalysis of the branches and ions in the complexes; and especially, the structural characteristic and catalytic mechanism of aza-crown ether metal complexes as mimic nucleases.

However, high-grade mutant OmpF and its function in decreasing bacterial survival rate have not been reported to date. In the present study, we cloned a high-grade mutant OmpF (mOmpF) and sequence analysis suggested that over 45 percent of the DNA sequence was significantly mutated, leading to dramatic changes in over 55 percent of the amino acid sequence. mOmpF protein was successfully expressed. When grown in the presence of antibiotic, the bacterial survival rate decreased and the antibiotic inhibition zone became larger with the increase of the mOmpF. It was concluded that concentration of high-grade mutant mOmpF dramatically influenced the bacterial survival rate. The study presented here may provide insights into better understanding of the relationships between structure and function of OmpF.

A robust adaptive feedback controller is proposed based on Gronwally's inequality, drive-response concept, and adaptive feedback control technique with the update laws of nonidentical parametric uncertainties as well as linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The sufficient conditions for robust adaptive exponential synchronization in mean square of uncoupled uncertain stochastic chaotic delayed neural networks are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effect of nonidentical uncertain parameter uncertainties is suppressed by the designed robust adaptive feedback controller rapidly.

The results show that the difference in O, O'-diaryldithiophosphate anions hardly brings about any influence on the structure of complex cation [Ni(hmtade)](2+). In the packing of 1, the molecules self-assemble into a folded two-dimensional (2D) network and which further links into a complicated 3D supramolecular framework. Two different kinds of 2D networks form independently via intermolecular hydrogen bonds and alternatively arrange into a novel 3D lamellar sandwich-layer structure in the packing of 2.

The results indicate that doping La and Rh into Bi2O3 increases the BET surface area, induces the Bi4f(7/2) shift, and promotes the photo-induced charge separation rate. The photocatalytic performance for decolorization of rhodamine B aqueous solution under sunlight was evaluated, the results show that La-doped Bi2O3 with 2mol% possesses the best photocatalytic activity and the possible reason was suggested.

The N(CH3)(4) (+) cation was generated in situ by the decomposition of a large number of DMF molecules. The potential porosity of the coordination framework of 1 has been estimated using a computational method based on Connolly's algorithm, indicating that compound 1 presents a kinetic radius greater than 1.61 angstrom. Because unremovable guest cations are clogged in the channels, 1 presents no significant adsorption for CO2 gas upon desolvation by long-duration thermal activation. In addition, the magnetic behavior of the two compounds was explored.

We propose the definition of Mittag-Leffler stability of time-delay system and introduce the fractional Lyapunov direct method by using properties of Mittag-Leffler function and Laplace transform. Then some new sufficient conditions ensuring asymptotical stability of fractional-order nonlinear system with delay are proposed firstly. And the application of Riemann-Liouville fractional-order systems is extended by the fractional comparison principle and the Caputo fractional-order systems.

J	Fang, Y; Yan, K; Li, KL				Fang, Yang; Yan, Kang; Li, Kelin			Synchronization of Chaotic Delayed Neural Networks via Impulsive Control	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							TIME-VARYING DELAYS; ADAPTIVE SYNCHRONIZATION; SECURE COMMUNICATION; DISTRIBUTED DELAYS; SYSTEMS; STABILITY; STABILIZATION; INTERVAL; DESIGN	This paper is concerned with the impulsive synchronization problem of chaotic delayed neural networks. By employing Lyapunov stability theorem, impulsive control theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, several new sufficient conditions ensuring the asymptotically synchronization for coupled chaotic delayed neural networks are derived. Based on these new sufficient conditions, an impulsive controller is designed. Moreover, the stable impulsive interval of synchronized neural networks is objectively estimated by combining the MATLAB LMI toolbox and one of the two given equations. Two examples with numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
