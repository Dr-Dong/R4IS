The carbon nanodots solution had a maximal fluorescent light emission at 425 nm and the excitation wavelength at 315 nm. Fluorescent light emission intensity of carbon nanodots solution could be effectively quenched by picric acid (PA) in 0. 2 mol/L phosphate (pH 5. 8) buffer conditions. Based on this, a novel method for the determination of picric acid was developed using carbon nanodots as fluorescent probe. This method had broad linear range from 0. 4. mol/L to 80. mol/L with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9978. The limit of detection (LOD, 3 sigma) was 0. 11. mol/L. Furthermore, it exhibited good selectivity and fast response time (within 2 min). The method was successfully applied in the detection of PA in real water samples with spiked recoveries ranging from 92. 0% to 110. 0%.

Among different methods developed, transition metal-catalyzed intermolecular arylation of alkanes, which couples machvated C(sp(3))-H bonds with aryl moieties, is recognized as one of the most powerful strategies to construct valuable arylated alkyl scaffolds. Tremendous progress has thus been made in this field, which usually require harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and inert atmosphere as well as additives. Furthermore, the reaction media were usually organic solvents with undesirable toxicity and volatility, such as toluene, xylene, tert-amyl alcohol, dichloroethane etc. Therefore, the development of efficient catalytic unactivated C(sp(3))-H arylation under mild reaction conditions is still highly demanded. Herein, we reported a general and practical palladium-catalyzed arylation of beta-methylene C(sp(3))-H under aqueous conditions by the use of 8-aminoquinoline as directing groups. This method exhibited good to excellent yields up to 96% and good functional group tolerance without other additives and inert gas atmosphere. Meanwhile, the reaction showed good regioselectivity to the beta-position of carbonyl group. Mechanism studies showed that the aliphatic Ag-carboxylate salt was critical for this reaction. The silver ion might weaken the C-I bond and function as halogen scavenger for the transformation, while pivalic acid ion might act as base during reaction. A representative procedure for this reaction is as following: To a 10 nit, glass tube, N-(quinolin-8-yl)butyramide (42.8 mg, 0.2 mmol), iodobenzene (67 mu L, 0.4 mmol), Pd(OAc)(2) (4,5 mg), AgPiv (83.6 mg, 0.4 mmol) in 0.4 mL H2O were stirred at 60 degrees C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated. The crude product was purified with column chromatography (petroleurn/EtOAc) to provide the products in 61%similar to 96% yields.

The FA-500 was obtained by membrane separation technology and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with the retention index. Forty-seven constituents were identified, including structures with ester, acid and alcohol groups, which accounted for 95% of the total composition. The highest relative content of compounds was diethyl succinate and diethyl malonate, accounting for 29% and 17% of the total, respectively. Yannong 19 and Luyuan 301 wheat seeds were steeped with the FA-500 solution of different concentration respectively for two hours. Several markers were assessed: germination rate, coleoptile and radicle length, germination index, vitality index and the activity of alpha-amylase and (alpha+beta) amylase. The results indicated that FA-500 had a significant effect on promoting seed germination within an appropriate concentration range. The best concentration was 0.5%, and an inhibiting effect would appear with the increase of concentration. In the process of seed germination, FA-500 may affect the growth of the seed through influencing the amylase activity, which was related to respiration.

Transformation from monoclinic to cubic crystal structures was obtained by gradually increasing doping concentrations of both rhenium (Re) and electrons inside the monoclinic WO3, whereas a large distortion of WO6 octahedra was observed by gradually increasing doping concentrations of both niobium (Nb) and holes inside the monoclinic WO3. It was verified that RexW1-xO3 has a cubic structure if x is larger than 0.375, and the transformation from monoclinic to cubic structure is mainly dependent on the occupancy of the W 5d orbital. The elastic characteristics of the RexW1-xO3 decrease with the increase of the content of Re in the range of 0.375 <= x <= 0.875. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of spin-orbit coupling and rotation on the ground state vortex structures are investigated. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, new nucleated vortices gradually form vortex lines and annular vortex structures with the increase of the rotation frequency. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, part of the vortices arrange in a line and form a stable vortex chain, and the remanent vortices coexist in pairs aside such vortex chain. More specially, the remanent vortices of each component repel each other and form vortex pair for isotropic spin-orbit coupling, while attract each other and locate in the same positions for anisotropic spin-orbit coupling.

Substitutional nitrogen, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen doping has been considered. It was found that hydrogen prefers to be physically adsorbed on the pristine and substitutional nitrogen doped graphene, whereas hydrogen prefers to be chemically adsorbed on the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen doped graphene.

The pristine SiCNTs were semiconductors with band-gaps of 2.03, 2.17 and 2.25 eV for (6,6), (8,8) and (10,10) SiCNTs, respectively. It was found the band gaps was reduced with the external transverse electric filed applied. The (8,8) and (10,10) SiCNTs changed from semiconductor to metals as the intensity of electric field reached 0.7 and 0.5 V/angstrom. The results indicate that the electronic properties of SiCNTs can be tuned by the transvers electric field with integrality of the nanotubes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phase composition and morphology of the NCOFs were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), respectively. In addition, the deposition kinetics of nano-Co3O4 particles using C-EPD process were investigated in detail. The electrochemical capacitance behaviors of the NCOFs electrode were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge studies, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 2 M KOH solution. The electrochemical experiments revealed that the highest capacitance of 233.6 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), 93.5 % of which still be maintained after 2000 charge-discharge cycles.

Effects of annealing temperature (T (a) ) on the microstructural and electrical properties of Si/SiCxOy multilayer films were systematically investigated using high resolution transmission electron microscope, grazing incident X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and Hall measurements. The T (a) has great effects on the optical properties of Si/SiCxOy multilayer thin films. It is found that the onset of nanocrystalline Si phase (Si quantum dots) formation occurs at 800 A degrees C. SiC crystalline phases are not formed in Si/SiCxOy multilayer film even at the T (a) 1000 A degrees C. It is indicated that the method of depositing a Si/SiCxOy multilayer followed by thermal induced crystallization gives flexibility to suppress the crystallization of an a-SiC phase. With increasing T (a) the grain size, dot density, and optical bandgap increase, the conductivity also increase. These results demonstrate that high quality Si QDs embedded in Si/SiCxOy multilayer films deposited by magnetron sputtering can be obtained by properly controlling the annealing condition.

The parallel and vertical configurations of H-2 on the Be(0001) surface were considered and the results show that H-2 adsorption on the Be(0001) surface is a weak physisorption and hydrogen atom (H) adsorption is a strong chemisorption. The critical dissociation distance of vertical H-2 adsorption (similar to 0.6-0.8 angstrom) is found to be shorter than that of parallel H-2 adsorption (similar to 1.2-1.5 angstrom) on perfect Be(0001) surface. Interestingly, the parallel H-2 adsorption along the [1 1 (2) over bar2 0] direction on perfect Be(0001) surface is found to be stable without dissociation. The dissociation barriers and the dissociated configurations of H-2 depend on the initial H-2 configurations and adsorption sites. In addition, our results show that vacancy defects on the Be(0001) surfaces have a notable effect on the interaction of H-2 and the surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

So far, the multiple specific binding sites remain a major obstacle in developing an efficient prediction method for P-gp substrates. Herein, emerging chemical pattern (ECP) combined by hierarchical cluster analysis was utilized to predict P-gp substrates as well as their potential binding sites. An optimal ECP model using only 3 descriptors was established with prediction accuracies of 0.80, 0.81 and 0.74 for 803 training samples, 120 test samples, and 179 independent validation samples, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the ECPs of P-gp substrates derived 2 distinct ECP groups (ECPGs). Interestingly, HCA of the P-gp substrates based on ECP similarities also showed 2 distinct classes, which happened to be dominated by the 2 ECPGs, respectively. In the light of available experimental proofs and molecular docking results, the 2 distinct ECPGs were proved to be closely related to the binding profiles of R-and H-site substrates, respectively. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, a successful ECP model, which can not only accurately predict P-gp substrates, but also identify their potential substrate-binding sites.

To study the influence of deposition pressure on the deposition rate, optical band gap and structure factor, a surface profilometer, an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the deposited thin films. It is found that the deposition rate firstly increased and then decreased and the optical band gap monotonically decreased with the increasing deposition pressure. Moreover, the formation of SiH bond was preferable to the formation of SH2 or SiH3 bond when the deposition pressure was less than 210 Pa, while it was opposite when the deposition pressure is higher than 210 Pa.

The structure morphology and the phase constitution of 3DNFs were characterized by FESEM, EDS and XRD. Adsorption process of Ca (II), Cr (III), Mg (II) ions was fast as the equilibrium was established within 30 min, and the maximum adsorption at equilibrium was 44.1 mg/g, 46.4 mg/g and 32.7 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetics well fitted using a pseudo second-order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm data of all the three metals fit well the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. It was found out that kinetics of adsorption varies with initial concentration of metal ions. Thermodynamic parameters (i.e., the standard Gibbs free energies (Delta G), enthalpy change (Delta H), standard entropy change (Delta S)) were also evaluated. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that a high temperature is favored for the adsorption of metal ions by 3DNFs. These results suggest that 3DNFs have good potential application in effective adsorption of metal ions with satisfactory results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The adsorption of Co(II) on GO was studied as a function of contact time, pH, ionic strength, humic acid, Co(II) concentration, and temperature. The adsorption of Co(II) is strongly dependent on the pH values and weakly dependent on ionic strength. The adsorption thermodynamics of Co(II) on GO was carried out at 303, 313, and 333 K to obtain the corresponding thermodynamic data (Delta H-0, Delta S-0, and Delta G(0)), which suggested that the adsorption of Co(II) on GO is a spontaneous and endothermic process. GO provided a promising candidate for the preconcentration and solidification of Co(II) from large volumes of aqueous solutions.

The structural changeover as a function of concentration of Pluronic triblock copolymers is investigated. At lower concentration (e.g. 5%), a shell-layered film structure self-assembled on NP surfaces is observed. Above 5%, the stretching growth of polymer chains takes place during the adsorption process and the star-shaped film on NP surfaces is formed. As the simulation results show, the radius of gyration of F127 assembled on the NPs would increase with increase of polymer concentration. A transition from incomplete to complete stretching polymer chain structure growth in solvent is encountered with increasing concentrations, which appears as a high phase separation film in terms of order parameter. These changes of the self-assembled films are not majorly initiated by the hydrophobic degrees of NP surfaces, but originate from the domination of polymer concentration.

Based on the constitutional, topological and conformational descriptors, R-2 and Q(2) values of the obtained SRA model are 0.931 and 0.856. The R-2 and Q(2) values of the constructed HQSAR and almond models are 0.903 and 0.767, 0.904 and 0.511, respectively. Based on the pharmacophore alignment, R-2 and Q(2) values of the optimal CoMSIA model are 0.936 and 0.654. Moreover, R-test(2) and Q(ext)(2) of values of SRA, HQSAR, almond and CoMSIA models are 0.611 and 0.565, 0.753 and 0.750, 0.612 and 0.582, 0.582 and 0.571, respectively. So, QSAR models have good predictive capability. They can be further used to evaluate and screen new compounds. Moreover, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic factors have high contributions to activities. To understand molecular interactions between natural compounds and NA from Clostridium perfringens, molecular docking is investigated. The docking results elucidate that Arg266, Asp291, Asp328, Tyr485, Glu493, Arg555, Arg615 and Tyr655 are especially the key residues in the active site of 2bf6. Hydrogen bonds and electrostatics are key factors, which impact the interactions between NIs and NA. So, the influential factors of interactions between NIs and NA in the docking results are in agreement with the QSAR results.

Potential hepatoprotective effects of fullerenol nanoparticles on alcohol-induced oxidative stress by ROS	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							INDUCED LIVER-INJURY; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES; FATTY LIVER; TNF-ALPHA; C-60(OH)(24); RATS; C-60; DOXORUBICIN; MECHANISM	The free radical scavenging ability of fullerenols is their most exploited property in biomedical studies. The antioxidant properties and associated mechanisms of fullerenol have been previously investigated, but less research has been done to examine the hepatoprotective effects of fullerenol nanoparticles on alcohol-induced oxidative stress. This study examined the antioxidant effects in rat liver primary hepatocyte exposure to fullerenols dissolved in ethanol. In this study, liver primary hepatocytes of Wistar rats were divided into nine experimental groups that were exposed to ethanol (0.1, 1.0 and 10%), fullerenol dissolved in ethanol (0.1, 1.0 and 10%) and controls (PBS; PBS + fullerenol; Vitamin C (Vc) in 10% ethanol). The results demonstrated that fullerenol nanoparticles in 400 mu mol L (1) exhibited excellent ROS scavenging abilities. This contributed to the anti-inflammatory effects involving reduced alcoholic oxidative damage and the regulated promotion of the tumor necrosis factor. The intracorporeal metabolism of rat-intake fullerenol was also evaluated by examining precision-cut rat slices of liver and kidney. All results demonstrated the potential hepatoprotective effects of fullerenol nanoparticles in the preventive treatment of alcoholic hepatopathy.	[Li, Y.; Liu, Z.

HL-2A Team	Behaviour of runaway electrons in the HL-2A plasmas with LHCD and ECCD	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS			English	Article							HYBRID CURRENT DRIVE; TOKAMAK; DISRUPTIONS; DYNAMICS; ENERGY	The behaviour of runaway electrons have been investigated in lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) and electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) plasmas as well as the LHCD only plasmas in the HL-2A tokamak. The fast electrons generated by lower hybrid waves (LHWs) and electron cyclotron waves (ECWs) can act as a seed population for runaway electrons. In the LHCD only discharges, a large number of runaway electrons are produced after the termination of lower hybrid (LH) power by conversion of fast electrons into runaway electrons due to the fast electron tail which extends above the runaway critical energy. However, in contrast to LHCD only discharges, during the simultaneous application of LHCD and ECCD discharges, runaway electrons cannot be created by the termination of LH power when the ECCD is on duty. The runaway production is observed to be enhanced until the EC power termination. The loop voltage increase due to the termination of EC power gives rise to a decline in the critical runaway energy, which leads to some of the energetic fast electrons converting into runaway electrons via the acceleration from the toroidal electric field. That is, the fast electrons created by waves can be accelerated into the runaway regime due to the Dreicer process.	[Zhu, J.

The bond length of octahedral site is R-i = 2.19 angstrom, which can be determined by the cubic crystal-field parameter and optical spectral data. The lattice distortion of the Ni2+ center in Ca3Sc2Ge3O12 crystal is also obtained from the calculations. In addition, the result has shown that the covalent effect of Ni2+ ion in the octahedral site of Ga3Sc2Ge3O12 is obvious and cannot be ignored. The calculated d-d transition bands agree well with that of the experimental findings, suggesting that the present methods can explain reasonably the optical spectral data and covalent effect of 3d(8) ions in octahedral lattices.

Furthermore, compounds No. 8 and 14 showed good inhibitory activity against influenza A virus with IC50 = 835.4 and 860.6 mu g/mL. Then, to investigate interactions between NIs and neuraminidase (NA), molecular docking was performed. Docking results indicated that Arg118, Asp151, Arg292 and Arg371 were the key residues in the active pocket of 2ht8. Main influencing factors of interactions between NIs and NA were hydrogen bond and electrostatic, then hydrophobic factor. Moreover, experimental activities of NIs were consistent with total scores of the docking. In order to understand the chemical-biological interactions governing their activities toward NA, QSAR models of 14 NIs were developed. The obtained HQSAR (hologram quantitative structure activity relationship), PLS (partial least squares) and SRA (stepwise regression analysis) models were robust and had good exterior predictive capabilities. Moreover, squared multiple correlation coefficients (R-2) and squared cross-validated correlation coefficients (Q(2)) of HQSAR and PLS models based on descriptors by Gaussian and Sarchitect were 0.832 and 0.721, 0.925 and 0.688, 0.892 and 0.692, respectively. R-2 and SE (standard error) of SRA model based on descriptors by Gaussian were 0.922 and 0.072. Therefore, these models may be further used to design and evaluate the bioactivity of new compounds.

We examined how the flow rate of NH3 influenced the structural properties of the annealed films by using Raman scattering, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it was found that the appropriate flow rate of NH3 is 3 sccm. For the sample deposited at the flow rate of 3 sccm, TEM image showed that Si NCs were formed with a mean size about 3.7 nm and the density of similar to 2.1 x 10(12) cm(-2); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization showed the existence of Si-P bonds, indicating effective P doping; the average absorptance of higher than 65% and a significant amount of photocurrent makes it suitable for photoactive. Moreover, the experimental P-doped Si NCs:Si3N4/p-Si heterojunction solar cell has been fabricated, and the device performance was studied. The photovoltaic device fabricated exhibits an open-circuit voltage (V-OC) and a short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of 470 mV and 3.25 mA/cm(2), respectively.

R-2 and Q(2) of PLS, HQSAR, CoMSIA and Almond models are 0.950 and 0.846, 0.789 and 0.751, 0.991 and 0.672, 0.917 and 0.762, respectively. In addition, R-test(2) and Q(ext)(2) of PLS, HQSAR, CoMSIA and Almond models are 0.897 and 0.787, 0.937 and 0.700, 0.848 and 0.835, 0.932 and 0.851, respectively. Therefore, QSAR models were excellent, robust and had good predictive capability. These models can be further used to evaluate and screen new compounds with a similar structure. Moreover, hydrogen bonds highly contributed to activity, followed by electrostatic and hydrophobic factors. Docking indicated that Arg118, Glu119, Asp151, Arg152, Arg156, Trp178, Glu227, Ser246, Arg292 and Tyr406 were important residues in the active pocket of 2hu4. The main influential factor of interactions between NIs and neuraminidase was the hydrogen bond, followed by electrostatic and hydrophobic factors. Therefore, docking results were unanimous in QSAR results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, XB; Chen, GP				Chen, Xiaobo; Chen, Guangping			ENHANCED FORMATION OF Si NANOCRYSTALS IN SiO2 BY LIGHT-FILTERING RAPID THERMAL ANNEALING	SURFACE REVIEW AND LETTERS			English	Article						Silicon quantum dots; silicon oxide; rapid thermal processing	SILICON NANOCRYSTAL; THIN-FILMS; MATRIX; TEMPERATURE; SUBSTRATE; OXIDE	In this work, silicon-rich oxide (SRO) films with designed thickness of similar to 100 nm were deposited by a bipolar pulse and radio frequency magnetron co-sputtering. For comparison, the samples were then treated in a nitrogen atmosphere by conventional rapid thermal annealing (CRTA) or light-filtering rapid thermal annealing (LRTA) at 900-1100 degrees C for 2 min. Raman spectra, grazing incident X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Hall measurements, and current density-voltage measurements were carried out to analyze the microstructural and electrical properties of samples. Compared with the control sample using CRTA method, the crystalline volume fraction and number density of Si nanocrystals (Si NCs) in silicon oxide prepared by LRTA were greatly increased. The quantum effects of the short wave-length light (less than 800 nm) of these tungsten halogen lamps during the rapid thermal annealing process have negative effects on the formation of Si NCs in SiO2 films. Si NCs with crystal volume fraction of 73%, average size of 2.53 nm, and number density of similar to 1.1 x 10(12) cm(-2) embedded in the amorphous SiO2 matrix can be formed by LRTA at 1100 degrees C. Enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in conductivity and higher current density were obtained from the LRTA annealed sample compared to the CRTA annealed sample. The improvements in conductivity and current density were attributed to the high density Si NCs. Our results show that the LRTA method is a suitable annealing tool for the formation of Si NC in thin SiOx films.

After deposition, the films were annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere by rapid photo-thermal annealing at 1 050 degrees C for 3 minutes. This thermal step allows the formation of the silicon quantum dots. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the bonding configurations, microstructures and luminescence properties of the films. The experimental results showed that: silicon-rich Si-N bonds were found in Fourier transform infrared spectra, suggesting that the silicon-rich SiNx films were successfully prepared; when the substrate temperature was not lower than 200 degrees C, the Raman spectra of the films showed the transverse optical mode of Si-Si vibration, while the significant diffraction peaks of Si(111) and Si(311) were shown in grazing incidence X-ray diffraction spectra, confirming the formation of silicon quantum dots; our work indicated that there was an optimal substrate temperature (300 degrees C), which could significantly increase the amount and the crystalline volume fraction of silicon quantum dots; three visible photoluminescence 'bands can be obtained for both 300 degrees C sample and 400 degrees C sample, and in combination with Raman results, the emission peaks were reasonably explained by using the quantum confinement effect and radiative recombination defect state of Si nanocrystals; the average size of the silicon quantum dots is 3. 5 and 3. 4 nm for the 300 degrees C sample and 400 r sample, respectively. These results are useful for optimizing the fabrication parameters of silicon quantum dots embedded in SiNx thin films and have valuable implications for silicon based photoelectric device applications.

These compounds are recognized as environmental contaminants and as toxic to living organisms. Therefore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for TNP detection was developed on the basis of spectral overlap between the fluorescence spectrum of copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) and absorption spectrum of TNP (the calculated Forster distance R (0) of the donor CuNCs and the acceptor TNP is 2.8 nm). Water-soluble fluorescent CuNCs capped with bovine serum albumin have fluorescence emission from 350 nm to 500 nm with maximum fluorescence emission at 400 nm, which overlaps with the absorption spectra of TNP from 350 nm to 450 nm. Inspired by FRET structures, an unprecedented energy-donor-and-acceptor pair of fluorescent CuNCs and TNP is developed in this work. Fluorescence of CuNCs is quenched in the presence of TNP as a result of FRET from fluorescent CuNCs to TNP. Therefore a fluorescence quenching method for the determination of TNP is developed. It achieves TNP detection from 0.8 mu mol L-1 to 100 mu mol L-1, with response within 1 min and with good selectivity compared with that for other nitroaromatic compounds, including 2,4-dinitrotoluene, p-nitrotoluene, and nitrobenzene, and phenol.

The effects of Sn impurity on the Si crystallization behavior and photoluminescence (PL) in SRN films were investigated. Doping with Sn dopants enhances phase separation in SRN and thus accelerates the crystallization of silicon nanoparticles. It was also found that the existence of Sn decreases crystallization temperature, and could be as low as 800 degrees C. In the Sn-doped samples, the crystalline volume fraction increases monotonically from 16.2% to 78.5% with increasing annealing temperature and the area densities of about similar to 2.2 x 10(12) cm(-2) can be achieved after annealing at 1100 degrees C. In addition, the intensity of PL of the SRN film could be enhanced by adding Sn impurity.

Isopropyl alcohol is demonstrated to act as the suitable dispersion agent for the EPD. The SEM and EDS results show that the obtained ANECCs are relatively smooth and evenly distributed. Both the phase constitution and exothermic behavior of the ANECCs are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis at the same while. In addition, the kinetics of the nanopartides during the EPD process are investigated in detail. The exothermic performance of products studies show that the ANECCs prepared by EPD exhibit the great combustion performance and thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the combustion processes of samples are recorded and analyzed by the-high-speed photography. This work demonstrates that EPD method is a facile and effective approach in the preparation of Al/Ni energetic coatings with the widespread application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stable suspensions consisted of isopropyl alcohol and trace additive-polyethyleneimine. Deposition was achieved on the cathode at applied field strengths of 5-25 V mm(-1)using a total solids loading of 0.5-2 g L(-1)at ambient temperature and pressure. The deposition mechanism of Bi(2)O(3)coatings was firstly given, and deposition kinetics were investigated in detail. The deposits were characterized qualitatively by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) observation, atomic force microscope( AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalytic activities of obtained coatings were evaluated through degradation of Rhodamine B under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By introducing a newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and considering the relationship between time-varying delays and their upper delay bounds, sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the filtering error system is finite-time bounded and a prescribed noise attenuation level is guaranteed for all non-zero noises. Thus, a finite-time filter is designed for switched linear systems with a mode-dependent average dwell time. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

To explore a possible solution to the urgent problem, in this paper, we first introduced the quaternion into the representation of color image. In this way, a color can be represented and analyzed as a single entity. Then a novel artificial bee colony method named improved artificial bee colony which can improve the performance of conventional artificial bee colony was proposed. In this method, in order to balance the exploration and the exploitation, two new search equations were presented to generate candidate solutions in the employed bee phase and the onlookers phase, respectively. Additionally, some more reasonable artificial bee colony parameters were proposed to improve the performance of the artificial bee colony. Then we applied the proposed method to the quaternion vectors to perform the edge detection of color remote sensing image. Experimental results show that our method can get a better edge detection effect than other methods.

Yet most of the existing strategies still fail to bring about an optimal performance on system mean response time metrics, and new strategies which can achieve better performance in terms of mean response time become indispensable for parallel file systems. This paper, while addressing the issue of assigning nonpartitioned files in parallel file systems where the file accesses exhibit Poisson arrival rates and fixed service times, presents an on-line file assignment strategy, named prediction-based dynamic file assignment (PDFA), to minimize the mean response time among disks under different workload conditions, and a comparison of the PDFA with the well-known file assignment algorithms, such as HP and SOR. Comprehensive experimental results show that PDFA is able to improve the performance consistently in terms of mean response time among all algorithms for comparison.

Ab initio calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to investigate the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus of the beta-MH2-xHex (M = Er, Sc) systems, with the variety of the x (the ratio of He to M atoms), ranging from 0 to 0.1875. The changes in the mechanical properties of beta-ErH2-xHex and beta-ScH2-xHex exhibit two regimes, which is in agreement with the experimental observations. It appears that the different He concentrations cause the different interactions between metal atoms and their neighbors in beta-MH2-xHex, a key factor which gives rise to the observed two regimes. When x is about 0.13, the mechanical properties of metal hydrides degrade significantly. Furthermore, the degradation mechanisms of the mechanical properties in the beta-MH2-xHex systems depend mainly on the crystal structure of metal hydrides.

Raman spectroscope, grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscope and photoluminescence (PL) were used to analyze the structure, bonding configurations and luminescence of the films. Raman, GIXRD and TEM results show that the crystalline fractions of G-SRSN and S-SRSN thin films are 41.7% and 39.2%, respectively. Quantum dots density of G-SRSN thin film is 4.4 times higher than that of S-SRSN thin film. The FTIR spectra demonstrate that both G-SRSN and S-SRSN films are Si-rich SiNx but Si content of the former is lower than that of the later. PL spectra suggest that the G-SRSN thin films possess a lower radiative recombination defect density than the G-SRSN thin films.

For comparison, two sets of identical samples were then treated in a nitrogen atmosphere by conventional rapid thermal processing (CRTP) and light-filtering rapid thermal processing (LRTP) at temperature in a range of 950-1,100 A degrees C, respectively. Raman spectroscopy, grazing incident X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, photoluminescence (PL) and Hall measurements were used to analyze the structure, luminescence, and conductivity of the films. Experimental results show that the samples treated with LRTP posses higher dot number density, crystalline volume fraction, PL intensity and conductivity than the CRTP samples.

The spacings of the quantized entropy spectrum and area spectrum are found to be equal to the values given by Bekenstein. Interestingly, we find the spectra are independent of the hairs of the black holes and the mode of motion of a particle outside the spacetime, which depends only on the intrinsic properties of the gravity. Our result shows that the spectra are universal provided the spacetime owns a horizon.

It is demonstrated by an oligonucleotide sequence of wild-type HBV (target DNA) as a model system. In this strategy, the fluorophore of MB is designed to be 6-carboxyfluorescein group (FAM), and the maximum excitation wavelength and maximum emission wavelength are both very close to that of SYBR Green I. In the presence of targets DNA, the MBs hybridize with the targets DNA and form double-strand DNA (dsDNA), the fluorophore FAM is separated from the quencher BHQ-1, thus the fluorophore emit fluorescence. At the same time, SYBR Green I binds to dsDNA, the fluorescence intensity of SYBR Green I is significantly enhanced. When targets DNA are detected by synchronous fluorescence analysis, the fluorescence peaks of FAM and SYBR Green I overlap completely, so the fluorescence signal of system will be significantly enhanced. Thus, highly sensitive fluorescence quantitative detection for DNA can be realized. Under the optimum conditions, the total fluorescence intensity of FAM and SYBR Green I exhibits good linear dependence on concentration of targets DNA in the range from 2 x 10(-11) to 2.5 x 10(-9) M. The detection limit of target DNA is estimated to be 9 x 10(-12) M (3 sigma). Compared with previously reported methods of detection DNA with MB, the proposed method can significantly enhance the detection sensitivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is assumed that the prey population has a lower critical point, which is also referred to as extinction threshold. Such behavior has been reported for many flowering plants, many fishes, epidemiology, and so on. The existence and stability of nonnegative fixed points are explored. The conditions for the existence of flip bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation are obtained by using manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations, including bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits and Maximum Lyapunov exponents, not only show the consistence with the theoretical analysis but also exhibit other complex dynamics and certain biological phenomena. Complex dynamics include quasi-periodicity, period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaos, chaotic bands with periodic windows, intermittent, supertransient, and so on. Simulations suggest that appropriate growth rate can stabilize the system, but the high growth rate may destabilize the stable system into more complex dynamics. As well, simulations suggest that the system is stable when the lower critical point parameter c is small, but when c increases beyond the critical values, the system changes from quasi-period to collapses. Furthermore, the simulated results are explained according to a biological point of view. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, XB				Chen, Xiaobo			Fabrication and characterization of high density silicon quantum dots in gradient Si-rich carbide films	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Si quantum dots; SiC matrix; magnetron sputtering; electrical property	NANOCRYSTALS; MATRIX; CELLS	Gradient Si-rich carbide (GSRC) thin films were deposited on monocrystalline silicon wafers and quartz substrates by magnetron co-sputtering, with subsequent thermal annealing by rapid thermal processing. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, grazing incident X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and Hall measurements were used to analyze the microstructure and conductivity of the films. It was observed that bonding configurations, microstructure and conductivity properties changes with the annealing temperature from 700 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. The experimental results demonstrate that Si QDs with crystal volume fraction of 72.5%, average size of 4.5 nm, and number density of similar to 2x10(12) cm(-2) embedded in the amorphous SiC matrix can be formed using a GSRC multilayer structure, with subsequent annealing at 1000 degrees C. The 1000 degrees C annealed thin film possesses a conductivity of similar to 5 S . cm(-1), which can be attributed to high carrier transport efficiency caused by high Si QD density.

Based on the electronic hybridization between Er and He atoms, an s-band model, along with a repulsive pair potential, has been derived to describe the Er-He interaction. The atomic configurations and the formation energies of single He defects, small He interstitial clusters (He-n) and He-vacancy (HenV) clusters obtained by ab initio calculations are used as the fitting database. The binding energies and relative stabilities of the HnVm clusters are studied by the present potential and compared with the ab initio calculations. The Er-He potential is also applied to study the migration of He in hcp Er at different temperatures, and He clustering is found to occur at 600K in hcp Er crystal, which may be due to the anisotropic migration behavior of He interstitials.

The interaction between cysteamine-CdTe quantum dots and dermatan sulfate was studied by resonance Rayleigh scattering spectra. It showed that the intensities of resonance Rayleigh scattering of cysteamine-CdTe quantum dots - dermatan sulfate were enhanced greatly, the resonance Rayleigh scattering intensities (Delta I-RRS) was directly proportional to the concentration of dermatan sulfate. The linear ranges and the detection limits were 0.0039-0.6 and 1.2 ng mL(-1). The proposed methods exhibited higher sensitivity, so that they are more suitable for the determination of trace amounts dermatan sulfate. The optimum conditions, the influencing factors and the effects of coexisting substances on the reaction were investigated. The result indicated that the method can be applied to the determination of dermatan sulfate in serum and urine samples with satisfactory results. The reasons of resonance Rayleigh scattering enhancement were also discussed.

This spacing is shown to be corrected with inverse area terms from the perspective of periodicity, which indicates that the area spectrum in this case is no longer evenly spaced. Concretely we study the corrected area spectrum by equaling the motion period of an outgoing wave to the period of gravitational system in Kruskal coordinate with respect to the Euclidean time with consideration of quantum corrections to the semiclassical action. To check our result, we also study the corrected area spectrum in the framework of Generalized Uncertainty Principle. We find the area spectrum produced from the perspective of periodicity takes the same form as the one obtained by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle. As examples, area spectrum with quantum corrections of a Schwarzschild black hole and a Kerr black hole are studied. Our result shows that the formula for area spectrum with quantum corrections is universal though it is not independent of the black hole parameters. In addition, we also discuss the motion period of fermions and find that the area spectrum of a black hole is independent of particle statistics when the black hole is perturbed by an outgoing fermion.

The structural evolution with the calcination temperature of the photocatalyst was studied. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained photocatalysts was investigated using X-3B dye as a model pollutant. The as-prepared anatase TiO2 crystallites were highly resistant to thermal sintering, and the calcinations up to 800 degrees C were shown to enhance the crystallinity of the anatase phase without any rutile phase, which is attributed to the protection of traces of sulfate ions that are produced during the precipitation of titanium sulfate. The gradually increased photocatalytic activity of the anatase TiO2 calcined from 110 to 800 degrees C demonstrated strong dependency on its crystallinity. The anatase TiO2 calcined at 800 degrees C afforded the highest photocatalytic activity, which was obviously higher than that of commercial Degussa P25 on the photodegradation of X-3B dye in water under ultraviolet light irradiation, and exhibits much faster sedimentability.

Another set of useful regime-switching models has been given for both fixed transition probability Markov switching models and time-varying transition probabilities. Based on the knowledge of average dwell time and multiple Lyapunov function, a novel sufficient condition for finite-time boundedness of H-infinity filtering is derived and the system trajectory stays within a prescribed bound. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The effects of explicit and implicit solvent molecules on the hydrolysis cleavage of N-Glycosidic bond in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) have been systematically clarified in the present work based upon two types of computational models. Detailed potential energy surface (PBS) scans and full unconstraint optimizations for all the representative points on PESs were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory. The effect of implicit solvent was tested by single-point calculation at the SCRF/IEF-PCM model. The results illustrate that the direct hydrolysis model involving one explicit water molecule can't provide a complete depiction of the hydrolysis process of 8-oxo-dG, attributed to the insufficiency of nucleophile activation and leaving group stabilization. The expansion hydrolysis model involving four explicit water molecules, however, facilitates discrete proton transfer and therefore produces smooth reaction surfaces for both the dissociative (S(N)1) and concerted (S(N)2) pathways. The presence of the implicit solvent substantially lowers all activation energies and the S(N)1 process is more favorable than the S(N)2 process. The data and insights present here agree well with the experimental results and have given out a baseline for the enzymatic deglycosylation reaction of 8-oxo-dG.

We find that the area spectrum and the entropy spectrum are independent of the properties of particles. Furthermore, in the presence of higher-order quantum corrections, the area spectrum is found to be corrected by inverse area terms while the entropy spectrum is found to have a universal form,Delta S-BH = 2 pi. Both results show that the entropy spectrum is independent of not only the BTZ black hole parameters but also the higher-order quantum corrections, which implies that the entropy spectrum is more natural than the area spectrum in quantum gravity theory.

The calculated results in binary hydrides show that the beta-phase MH1.5[1 0 0] (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) are more stable than other possible structures. At the Fermi level, the density of states for metal d state increases with increasing the H concentration in MHy (y ranged from 1.5 to 2), which leads to the instability of their fcc structures and induces the tetragonal distortion. Ti0.75Hf0.25H1.5 and Zr0.25Hf0.75H1.5 exhibit the highest mechanical stability, while Ti0.25Zr0.75H1.5 has the lowest mechanical stability among the corresponding ternary systems considered. Moreover, the systems studied in the present work are all anisotropic and show a ductile behavior. The tetragonal distortion in Ti1-xHfxH1.5, Ti1-xZrxH1.5 and Zr1-xHfxH1.5 is not observed, retaining their fcc structures. The electronic structure of A(1-x)B(x)H(y) (A and B = Ti, Hf, Zr) exhibits metallic character. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The model is fitted to some properties of Y, e.g., the lattice parameters, elastic constants, bulk modulus, cohesive energy, vacancy formation energy, and the structural energy differences. The present potential has ability to reproduce defect properties including the self-interstitial atoms formation energies, vacancy formation energy, divacancy binding energy, as well as the bulk properties and the thermal dynamic properties.

Effects of different concentrations of hydrogen and helium on the elastic properties of ErA(x) systems have been investigated in detail. Results show that the elastic constants, Young's modulus, bulk modulus and shear modulus of ErHx systems increase mainly with increasing hydrogen concentration, whereas, those elastic properties of ErHex systems almost decrease with increasing helium concentration. We have investigated the changes in the charge densities of Er atoms produced by A atoms. It was found that the mechanism for the change of the elastic properties of hexagonal phase ErHx with increasing hydrogen atoms is different from that of ErHex with increasing helium atoms.

It is based on the ECRET of Ru(phen)(3)(2+)-doped silica nanoparticles (RuSiNPs) to indigo carmine. In the absence of ozone, the ECL of RuSiNPs is quenched as a result of the EGRET of RuSiNPs to indigo carmine. In the presence of ozone, the ECL of the system is "turned on" because ozone can oxidize indigo carmine and interrupt the ECRET from RuSiNPs to indigo carmine. In this way, it provides a simple ECL sensing of ozone via the proposed RuSiNP-based ECRET strategy with a linear range from 0.05-3.0 mu M and a limit of detection (LOD) of 30 nM. The detection takes less than 5 min. This method is also successfully applied in the analysis of ozone in human serum samples and atmospheric samples.

Ab initio study of helium behavior in titanium tritides	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Helium; Titanium tritides; Ab initio calculation	AUGMENTED-WAVE METHOD; METAL TRITIDES; HE; SYSTEMS; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; DITRITIDE; DIFFUSION; RADIATION; MIGRATION; RELEASE	Ab initio calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to investigate the relative stability of titanium tritides and the helium behavior in stable titanium tritides. The results show that the beta-phase TiT1.5 without two tritium along the [100] direction (TiT1.5[100]) is more stable than other possible structures. The stability of titanium tritides decrease with the increased generation of helium in TiT1.5[100]. In addition, helium generated by tritium decay prefers locating at a tetrahedral site, and favorably migrates between two neighbor vacant tetrahedral sites through an intermediate octahedral site in titanium tritides, with a migration energy of 0.23 eV. Furthermore, helium is easily accumulated on a (100) plane in beta-phase TiT1.5[100]. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.	[Liang, J. H.; Peng, S. M.; Long, X. G.; Zhou, X.

Main influencing factors of interactions between flavonoids derivatives and neuraminidase (NA) were hydrogen bond and electrostatic. Meanwhile, 3D-QSAR models of flavonoids derivatives were constructed to understand chemical-biological interactions governing their activities toward NA. The developed 3D-QSAR models were robust and had good predictive capabilities. R (2), Q (2), R (test) (2) , and Q (ext) (2) of the CoMFA and CoMSIA models were 0.816 and 0.929, 0.607 and 0.750, 0.507 and 0.642, and 0.478 and 0.568, respectively. Moreover, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic factors highly contributed to inhibitory activity, which were unanimous in the docking results. In addition, based on the most active sample ID33, seven new compounds with high inhibitory activity and docking score were obtained.

TOC and XRD analysis showed FA-ferrihydrite contained about 14.7% (w/w) of FA which coated a part of the ferrihydrite surfaces. Compared to ferrihydrite, the total pore volume, BET surface area and surface fractal dimension of FA-ferrihydrite increased. As for ferrihydrite and FA-ferrihydrite, the pH of the point of zero charge (pHpzc) was 7.8 and 5.4, and the surface charge at pH 6.0 was 0.41 and -0.43 mmol/g, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) for Pb(II) by FA-ferrihydrite (19.26 mg/g) was significantly higher than that by ferrihydrite (11.84 mg/g). The correlation coefficients (R-2) of fitting Langmuir and Freundlich models (21, 22) to the adsorption data for Pb(II) by ferrihydrite were 0.993 and 0.953, and by FA-ferrihydrite were 0.981 and 0.987, respectively. This indicates that FA-ferrihydrite is a relatively high efficient adsorbent for Pb(II), and the adsorption behavior can be well described by Freundlich model(22).

The as-prepared photoluminescent C-Dots show favorable blue color photoluminescence at the peak wavelength of 430 nm with a quantum yield of approximately 11.5%. It has been successfully applied as a novel probe for the detection of Hg2+. This novel probe exhibits excellent sensitivity and selectivity toward Hg2+ in the broad linear range from 50 nM to 100.0 mu M with a limit of detection as low as 8.2 nM. The practical use of this system was tested in river water by adding 10.0 mu M and 50.0 mu M Hg2+. The recoveries ranged from 101.0% to 104.0% and from 99.2% to 101.2%, respectively. These stable and economical photoluminescent C-Dots show promise as a powerful tool for environmental analysis.

The obtained HQSAR (hologram quantitative structure activity relationship), Topomer CoMFA and CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity indices analysis) models were robust and had good exterior predictive capabilities. Moreover, QSAR modeling results elucidated that hydrogen bonds highly contributed to the inhibitory activity, then electrostatic and hydrophobic factors. Squared multiple correlation coefficients (R-2) of HQSAR, Topomer CoMFA and CoMSIA models were 0.994, 0.978 and 0.996, respectively. Squared cross-validated correlation coefficients (Q(2)) of HQSAR, Topomer CoMFA and CoMSIA models were in turn 0.951, 919 and 0.820. Furthermore, squared multiple correlation coefficients for the test set (R-test(2)) of HQSAR, CoMFA and CoMSIA models were 0.879, 0.912 and 0.953, respectively.

Ball-milling treatment on carbon can not only reduce its particle size but also functionalize the surface with oxygen-containing groups, resulting in good affinity to Co2+ ions. The non-aqueous solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is beneficial to improve the immersional wetting and adsorption of the cobalt salt solution on the surface of carbon, leading to uniform deposition of cobalt nanoparticles upon chemical reduction. The carbon-supported cobalt catalyst with the Co loading of 13.20 wt% obtained under optimum conditions exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward NaBH4 hydrolysis and the average hydrogen generation rate at 27 degrees C is 10.29 L-H2 min(-1) g((cobalt))(-1) corresponding to a turnover frequency of 1473.4 mol H-2 (mol cobalt)(-1) h(-1), which is higher than the most reported data. Furthermore, the effects of the cobalt loading, catalyst dosage, concentration of NaOH and NaBH4, and reaction temperature on the hydrogen generation have been investigated by hydrolysis of alkaline NaBH4 solution, and the corresponding rate equation can be described as r = A exp(-42190/RT)[cobalt](0.16)[NaOH](0.23)[NaBH4](0.30).

Finally, BSA was employed to block the possible remaining active sites of the nano-Au@SiO2 layer to avoid non-specific adsorption. The modification procedure was electrochemically monitored by cyclic voltammetry. The performance and influencing factors of the resulting immunosensor were studied in detail. Under the optimized conditions, there is a linear relation between response current and the logarithm of the concentrations of AFP in the concentration range of 0.05-200 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.02 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3).

This method can be extended to the rotating black holes. As an example, this method is applied to the rotating BTZ black hole and the quantized spectrum of the horizon area is obtained. It is shown that the area spectrum of the rotating BTZ black hole is also equally spaced and irrelevant to the rotating parameter, which is consistent with the Bekenstein conjecture.

Their work can be extended to background space-times with gauge potential. The result shows that the energy flux of charged particles, which is shown to be equal to the energy-momentum tensor flux, contains not only the contribution of thermal flux but also that of particle flux. It is found that the charge can also be transported by the 1D quantum channel. Moreover, the entropy production rate is also investigated, which is shown to be larger than the case without chemical potential.

Compared to the average values of magnetite and vermiculite, the BET surface area, total pore volume, surface fractal dimension and hydroxyl density of Mag-Ver increased. The pH of point of zero net proton charge (pHpznpc) of vermiculite, magnetite and Mag-Ver appeared at 2.9, 8.3 and 6.2, respectively. At pH 5.0, the surface charge of vermiculite, magnetite and Mag-Ver was -0.541, 0.354 and 0.187 mmol/g, respectively, and that of Mag-Ver shifted to the positive side in comparison with vermiculite. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) for selenate by the three samples followed the order of magnetite>Mag-Ver>vermiculite, and the q(max) of Mag-Ver was higher than the average value of magnetite and vermiculite. The adsorption data for selenate by magnetite and vermiculite could be well fitted by Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.987 and 0.992, respectively), and Freundlich model can describe the selenate adsorption by Mag-Ver (R-2 = 0.981).

The period of the Einstein-Maxwell system, which is related to the surface gravity of a given spacetime, is determined by Kruskal-like coordinates.

The concrete value of critical temperature is produced by calculating the minimum eigenvalue of Sturm-Liouville equation in high frequency regime. The condensed solution is calculated too. It is shown that the phase transition temperature enhances and the condensate superconducts easier as the frequency of the time-dependent chemical potential raises.

A wide range of aromatic, hetero-aromatic and alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes could react with less active methylene compounds acetylacetone and ethyl acetoacetate. The products were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with Z/E selectivities of up to 100:0. This case of biocatalytic promiscuity not only widens the application of papain to new chemical transformations, but also could be developed into a potentially valuable method for organic synthesis.

Moreover, the adsorption characteristics for fluoride by the three samples were studied. Compared to the average values of the K and F samples, the BET surface area, external surface area, total pore volume and surface fractal dimension of the KF increased; however, the hydroxyl density and proton charge of the KF decreased. The pH of point of zero net proton charge (pHpznpc) of the K, F and KF appeared at pH 3.6-4.3, 8.0 and 6.2-7.2, respectively. The adsorption capacities ((q(e)) for fluoride by the three samples followed the order of F > KF > K, and the maximum adsorption capacity (q(max).) of the KF was much higher than the average value of the K and F samples. The adsorption data for fluoride by the three samples could be well fitted by one-site Langmuir and two-site Langmuir models (R-2 = 0.981-0.992), but the Freundlich model can only describe the adsorption for fluoride by the KF sample (R-2 = 0.975).

By comparison of the results catalyzed by these gamma-amino alcohols with those by the beta-amino alcohols based on pyrrolidine architecture reported in the literature references, we have observed that the gamma-amino alcohols are superior to the corresponding beta-amino alcohols when the nitrogen and the oxygen are unsubstituted. Among the homoprolinols we tested, 2b gave the best results (45-88% yields, 44-81% ee) in the addition reactions.

Localized calcium release events, i.e. Ca(2+) puffs, are subjected to stochastic channel dynamics and fluctuations of environmental calcium. Driven by the internal channel noise or external calcium noise, the localized calcium puffs show a coherence resonance phenomenon at weak stimulus. Our study indicates that coherent calcium puffs with an enhanced periodicity can be achieved with external calcium noise more easily than with internal channel noise. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J.; Wei, S. P.; Lan, J. B.; Wang, J. Z.; Xie, R. G.; You, J. S. J. Org. Chem. 2008, 73, 8256]. In this work, the mechanism of the title reaction has been intensively studied computationally by employing the density functional theory (B3LYP) method in conjunction with 6-31+G(d) and 6-311+G(2d,p) basis sets. Our results indicate that path A (in which a sequence of intermolecular proton transfers between two carbene/benzaldehyde coupling intermediates affords enamine) and path B (in which a t-BuOH assisted hydrogen transfer generates enamine) proposed on the basis of the Breslow mechanism are competitive for their similar barriers. In path A, the first intermolecular proton transfer between two N-heterocyclic carbene/benzaldehyde coupled intermediates to form tertiary alcohol and enolate anion is theoretically the rate-determining step with corresponding barrier (30.93 kcal/mol), while the t-BuOH assisted hydrogen transfer generating Breslow enamine is the rate-determining step with corresponding barrier (28.84 kcal/mol) in path B. The coupling of carbene and benzaldehyde, and the coupling of enamine and another benzaldehyde to form a C C bond are partially rate-determining for their relatively significant barriers (24.06 and 26.95 kcal/mol, respectively), being the same in both paths A and B. Our results are in nice agreement with the experimental result in a kinetic investigation of thiazolium ion-catalyzed benzoin condensation performed by White and Leeper in 2001.

We consider the case that the dynamical coupling constant lambda = 1, when it reduces to Einstein's General Relativity at large scales and the black hole behaves like the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The result shows that though the black hole entropy bears logarithmic correction, the tunneling probability is still related to its differences for the scalar particles and Dirac particles.

The asymptotic stability analysis of the system is performed. For a biologically reasonable range of parameter values, the global dynamics of the system have been studied numerically. In particular, the effect of prolonged diapause and parasitism on the system has been investigated. Many forms of complex dynamics are observed. The complexities include: (1) chaotic bands with periodic windows; (2) pitchfork and tangent bifurcations; (3) period-doubling and period-halving cascades; (4) intermittency; (5) supertransients; (6) non-unique dynamics, meaning that several attractors coexist; and (7) attractor crises. Furthermore, the complex dynamic behaviors of the model are confirmed by the largest Lyapunov exponents. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The set S is called a divisor chain if there is a permutation sigma of {1,...,h} such that x(sigma(1))vertical bar...vertical bar x(sigma(h)). We say that the set S consists of two coprime divisor chains if we can partition S as S = S(1) boolean OR S(2), where S(1) and S(2) are divisor chains and each element of S(1) is coprime to each element of S(2). The matrix having the ath power (x(i), x(j))(a) of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x(i) and x(j) as its (i, j)-entry is called the ath power GCD matrix defined on S, denoted by (S(a)). Similarly, we can define the ath power least common multiple (LCM) matrix [S(a)]. In the first paper of the series, Tan [Q. Tan, Divisibility among power GCD matrices and among power LCM matrices on two coprime divisor chains, Linear Multilinear Algebra 58 (2010), pp. 659-671] showed that if S consists of two coprime divisor chains and 1 is an element of S and a vertical bar b, then (S(a)) j(S(b)), [S(a)]vertical bar[S(b)] and (S(a))vertical bar[S(b)] hold in the ring M(h)(Z) of h x h matrices over integers. But such factorizations need not hold if a x b. In this second paper of the series, we assume that S consists of two coprime divisor chains and 1 is not an element of 2 S. We show the following results: (i) If a x b, then (S(a)) x (S(b)), [S(a)] x [S(b)] and (S(a)) x [S(b)]. (ii) If a vertical bar b, then det(S(a)) vertical bar det(S(b)), det[S(a)] vertical bar det[S(b)] and det(S(a)) vertical bar det[S(b)]. (iii) If a vertical bar b, then (S(a)) vertical bar (S(b)), [S(a)] vertical bar [S(b)] and (S(a)) vertical bar [S(b)] hold in the ring M(h)(Z) if and only if both x(a)y(b)-1/x(a)y(a)-1 and x(b)y(a)-1/x(a)y(a)-1 are integers, where S = S(1) boolean OR S(2) with S(1) and S(2) divisor chains and x = min(S(1)) and y = min(S(2)). Our results extend Hong's results and complement Tan's results.

Firstly, the permanence, locally and globally asymptotic stability analyses of the model with constant attacking rate are explored. After that, sufficient conditions for the permanence of the corresponding nonautonomous system with periodic attacking rate are obtained. Furthermore, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effects of periodic attacking rate. Simulation results show that the system with periodic attacking rate shows a rich behaviors, including period-doubling and period-having bifurcations, chaos and windows of periodicity.

Four possible pathways have been investigated. A new proposed pathway on the basis of the Lapworth mechanism is determined to be the dominant pathway in aprotic solvent, in which the formation of the Lapworth's cyanohydrin intermediate is a sequence including three steps assisted by benzaldehyde, clearly manifesting that the reaction can take place in aprotic solvents such as DMSO. In this favorable pathway with six possible transition states located along the potential energy surface, the reaction of the cyanide/benzaldehyde complex with another benzaldehyde to afford an a-hydroxy ether is the rate-determining dynamically with the activation free energy barrier of 26.9 kcal/mol, and the step to form cyanohydrin intermediate from a-hydroxy ether is partially rate-determining for its relatively significant barrier 20.0 kcal/mol.

The geometric networks are constructed by adding geometric links to two-dimensional regular lattices. It is found that the agreement time is a non-monotonic function of the geometric distance and there exists an optimal value of the geometric distance resulting in the shortest agreement time. All these results show that the geometric distance plays an important role in the evolutionary process of the language game.

To get the corrections correctly, we regard the proportionality constants of quantum correction terms to the semi-classical term of action as the inverse of the square of the Planck Length but not that of the Planck Mass. Our study shows that corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, namely the logarithmic term and the inverse area term, may be reproduced as the quantum effect is considered.

In this paper, we further extend this idea to the stationary Kerr black hole to discuss its entropy correction. To get the corrections correctly, the proportionality parameters of quantum corrections of action I (i) to the semiclassical action I (0) in this case are regarded as the inverse of the product of Planck Length and Planck Mass. The result shows that entropy corrections to the stationary black hole also include the logarithmic term and inverse area term in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy beyond semiclassical approximation.

We consider not only the quantum corrections in the single particle action revealing that these are proportional to the usual semiclassical contribution but also the quantum effects of space time arising from the change of energy of probe particles moving in it. The result shows that as the high order terms with respect to a" of the action is considered, the first and second corrections, namely the logarithmic term and the inverse area term respectively, are produced.

The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, The vibration analysis and the IRC analysis demonstrated the authenticity of transition states, and the reaction processes were confirmed by the changes of charge density at bond-forming critical point. The results indicated that magnesium ethoxide is an effective catalyst in the synthesis of 2-dicyanomethylene-4,5,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-carbonitrile from malononitrile and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone. The activation energy of reaction with magnesium ethoxide decreased by 102.37 kJ mol(-1) compared with that of the reaction without it.

We rewrite the electromagnetic field tensor and the Lagrangian of the field corresponding to the source with electric and magnetic charges to redefine an equivalent charge. We only consider the case that the ratio of the electric charge and magnetic charge of the emission is constant and equal to the source. The result shows that when the energy conservation together with the electric charge and magnetic charge conservations are taken into account in the dynamical background space time, the emission rate agrees with the underlying unitary theory and the actual radiation spectrum of charged and magnetized fermions also derivates from the pure thermal one.

Because the electromagnetic field would couple with the gravity and matter fields, we introduce the Dirac equation of charged particles. We further discuss the correction spectrum of the radiant spin 1/2 particles by considering energy conservation and charge conservation. Our result shows that the tunneling rate of fermions also agrees with the underlying unitary theory as the unfixed background space-time is taken into account.

J	Hu, QS; Li, LC; Wang, X				Hu, Qi-Shan; Li, Lai-Cai; Wang, Xin			Theoretical study on the mechanism of reaction between 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone and malononitrile catalyzed by lithium ethoxide	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						density functional theory; lithium ethoxide; transition state; reaction mechanism	CHROMOPHORES	The The mechanism of reaction between 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone and malononitrile for the synthesis of 2-dicyanomethylene-4, 5, 5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-carbonitrile catalyzed by lithium ethoxide was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The vibration analysis and the IRC analysis verified the authenticity of transition states. The reaction processes were confirmed by the changes of charge density at the bond-forming critical point. The results indicated that lithium ethoxide is an effective catalyst in the synthesis of 2-dicyanomethylene-4, 5, 5-trimethyl-2, 5-dihydrofuran-3-carbonitrile from malononi-trile and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone. The activation energy of the reaction with lithium ethoxide was 115.86 kJ center dot mol(-1) less than the uncatalyzed reaction. The mechanism of the lithium ethoxide catalyzed reaction differed from the mechanism of the uncatalyzed reaction.

J	Yang, CF; Yi, Z				Yang, Chengfu; Yi, Zhang			Document clustering using locality preserving indexing and support vector machines	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN 2007)	JUN 03-07, 2007	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, KC Wong Educ Fdn, SE Univ China, Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Univ Illinois, Chicago		document clustering; locality preserving indexing; support vector machines; Gaussian kernel; support vectors clustering		A method of document clustering based on locality preserving indexing (LPI) and support vector machines (SVM) is presented. The document space is generally of high dimensionality, and clustering in such a high-dimensional space is often infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, by using LPI, the documents are projected into a lower-dimension semantic space in which the documents related to the same semantic are close to each other. Then, by using SVM, the vectors in semantic space are mapped by means of a Gaussian kernel to a high-dimensional feature space in which the minimal enclosing sphere is searched. The sphere, when mapped back to semantics space, can separate into several independent components by the support vectors, each enclosing a separate cluster of documents. By combining the LPI and SVM, not only higher clustering accuracies in a more unsupervised effective way, but also better generalization properties can be obtained. Extensive demonstrations are performed on the Reuters-21578 and TDT2 data sets.

The geometries of reactants, intermediates, transistion states and products have been calculated. In addition, nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to discuss bond natures and orbital interactions. The two simplified models of single ZnO with hydroxyl group and double ZnO with hydroxyl group have been used in the research respectively. The results of two different levels indicated that the reaction mechanism and the change trend of correspondence energy were consistent, and the reaction which was catalyzed by double ZnO with hydroxyl group was easier to occur.
