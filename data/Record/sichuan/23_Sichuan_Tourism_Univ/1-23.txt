After 7 day incubation, 90.73% of CTN was removed from mineral salt medium (MSM) by CDS-8 with the optimal condition at pH 7.0 and 30 degrees C. Single biodegradation or photocatalytic degradation could not degrade CTN completely, and many toxic and persistent intermediate metabolites remained. However, simultaneous biological-photocatalytic treatments could markedly remove CTN and reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) which could not be removed by single biodegradation or, photocatalytic degradation. In MSM, treatment with CDS-8/40 mg L-1 TiO2 showed the highest COD removal rate (84.10%). Furthermore, combined CDS-8/TiO2 treatments could effectively degrade CTN in soil. In treatments with CDS-8/20 mg kg(-1) TiO2 of soil, the maximum CTN removal rate reached 97.55% in turned soils. However, with CDS-8/40 mg kg(-1) TiO2 of soil, the maximum CTN removal rate (94.94%) was found in static soil. In general, the combined biological-photocatalytic treatments provided a promising alternative candidate for the remediation of CTN-contaminated sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Proteomic changes in maize as a response to heavy metal (lead) stress revealed by iTRAQ quantitative proteomics	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Pb pollution; Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification; Differentially expressed proteins	OXIDATIVE STRESS; GENE-EXPRESSION; OAT ROOTS; PLANTS; TONOPLAST; TRANSPORT; TOXICITY; DYNAMICS; SOILS	Lead (Pb), a heavy metal, has become a crucial pollutant in soil and water, causing not only permanent and irreversible health problems, but also substantial reduction in crop yields. In this study, we conducted proteome analysis of the roots of the non-hyperaccumulator inbred maize line 9782 at four developmental stages (0, 12, 24, and 48 h) under Pb pollution using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification technology. A total of 252, 72 and 116 proteins were differentially expressed between M12 (after 12-h Pb treatment) and CK (water-mocked treatment), M24 (after 24-h Pb treatment) and CK, and M48 (after 48-h Pb treatment) and CK, respectively. In addition, 14 differentially expressed proteins were common within each comparison group. Moreover, Cluster of Orthologous Groups enrichment analysis revealed predominance of the proteins involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones. Additionally, the changes in protein profiles showed a lower concordance with corresponding alterations in transcript levels, indicating important roles for transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation in the response of maize roots to Pb pollution. Furthermore, enriched functional categories between the successive comparisons showed that the proteins in functional categories of stress, redox, signaling, and transport were highly up-regulated, while those in the functional categories of nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, RNA, and protein metabolism were down-regulated. This information will help in furthering our understanding of the detailed mechanisms of plant responses to heavy metal stress by combining protein and mRNA profiles.	[Li, G. K.; Peng, H.; Shen, Y.

Temperature-controlled fermentation shortened the production time with no significant (p < 0.05) differences between sample types in amino nitrogen, total acid, reducing sugar, and organic acid concentrations observed at the end of fermentation. Naturally fermented SFP exhibited higher concentrations of free amino acids than temperature-controlled fermented SFP. Analysis of SFP volatile compounds showed that naturally fermented SFP samples had higher concentrations of aroma constituents. Ethyl palmitate was the dominant ester in SFP with a 5.2x higher content of ethyl palmitate than for naturally fermented SFP. In addition, 4-ethyl guaiacol and 4-vinyl guaiacol were only identified in naturally fermented SFP samples. Temperature-controlled fermentation accelerates the production process, and naturally fermented SFP exhibited a higher quality.

Plant miRNAs have been implicated in developmental processes and adaptation to environmental stress including biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs and associated target genes under banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) stress caused by R. solani in maize. Eight differentially expressed miRNAs were randomly selected from deep sequencing results and validated by qRT-PCR together with their putative target genes, most of which are transcription factors as well as metabolic genes involved in auxin signaling. The results revealed that majorities of the analyzed miRNAs show an inverse correlation with their corresponding predicted target genes. In addition, a putative regulatory network of miRNAs-mRNAs responsive to R. solani was constructed. This study provides insight into the regulatory functions of miRNAs, thereby expanding our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pathogen resistance.

Here, a novel R2R3-type MYB gene, designated FtMYB12, was isolated from the cultivated tartary buckwheat F. tataricum. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the FtMYB12 was greatly induced by low temperature. Sub-localization and yeast transactivity assay demonstrated that the FtMYB12 gene encodes a nuclear transcription activator. Overexpression of FtMYB12 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced cold tolerance. The FtMYB12 overexpressing Arabidopsis lines showed higher root length and had elevated levels of proline content and lower levels of malondialdehyde under cold stress conditions compared to the wild-type plants. The results revealed that FtMYB12 may play an essential role in regulation of cold stress-responsive signaling in F. tataricum.

The peroxide (POV) and the 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values were determined for 8 biogenic amines. Treatment with AOB combined with TP showed a significant (p < 0.05) antioxidative effect with lower POV and TBA values, and suppression of accumulation of the total level of biogenic amines, and the individual biogenic amines tryptamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, and tyramine, compared to control sausages. Treatment with AOB combined with TP is a promising candidate for retardation of lipid oxidation and prevention of biogenic amine formation in pork sausages.

Current treatment options cannot reverse or halt liver fibrosis, motivating a search for newer treatment options. Previously, we showed that asiaticoside, a bioactive triterpene glycoside from Centella asiatica, has anti-fibrotic properties. Here, the aglycone asiatic acid was chemically modified, and these derivatives were evaluated for their potential as anti-fibrotic agents. The data obtained from in vivo testing of these compounds in a rodent CCl4-induced liver injury model are discussed. The information obtained from these studies may be useful in the design of novel anti-fibrotic agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With allocating a relatively higher proportion of its biomass in roots, maize could be a potential important model to study the phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated soil. Here we analyzed the maize root transcriptome of inbred lines 9782 under heavy metal lead (Pb) pollution, which was identified as a non-hyperaccumulator for Pb in roots. In the present study, more than 98 millions reads were mapped to define gene structure and detect polymorphism, thereby to qualify transcript abundance along roots development under Pb treatment. A total of 17,707, 17,440, 16,998 and 16,586 genes were identified in maize roots at four developmental stages (0,12 h, 24 h and 48 h) respectively and 2,825, 2,626, 2161 and 2260 stage-specifically expressed genes were also identified respectively. In addition, based on our RNA-Seq data, transcriptomic changes during maize root development responsive to Pb were investigated. A total of 384 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log2Ratio >= 1, FDR <= 0.001) were identified, of which, 36 genes with significant alteration in expression were detected in four developmental stages; 12 DEGs were randomly selected and successful validated by qRT-PCR. Additionally, many transcription factor families might act as the important regulators at different developmental stages, such as bZIP, ERF and GARP et al. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in maize root development and provide a foundation for future study on root development in maize under heavy metal pollution and other cereal crops.

Cd accumulated to a greater degree in roots than in shoots and resulted in oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde. In addition, Cd exposure markedly hindered root and shoot elongation and biomass production, reduced the activities of H+-ATPase in the plasma membranes (PMs) and tonoplasts (V), and inhibited the absorption of mineral nutrition. However, the addition of various SNP doses alleviated the inhibitory effects on plant growth caused by Cd, elevated the activity of the PM H+-ATPase in both shoots and roots, enhanced the activity of V-H+-ATPase in roots, and partially enhanced the uptake of minerals (shoots: Mg and Cu; roots: Ca, Mg, and Fe) in Cd-treated plants. Shoot and root Cd accumulation significantly diminished when plants were subjected to Cd plus SNP treatments, though the level of root Cd accumulation was not dependent on the SNP dosage level. Moreover, the addition of SNP considerably upregulated ascorbate peroxidases (APX), catalases and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in shoots under Cd stress, but downregulated APX and SOD activity in roots. The addition of SNP did not influence glutathione reductase (GR) activity in roots, but markedly increased its activity in shoots. Similar to root GR levels, shoot ascorbate content experienced no significant change between Cd plus SNP treatment and Cd treatment alone; however, root ascorbate and glutathione levels decreased in plant tissues in the treatments with Cd and SNP. The results obtained in this work indicate that SNP applied exogenously, particularly at lower doses, can effectively deplete the detrimental effects on white clover growth, likely by reducing oxidative damage, modulating mineral absorption, and re-establishing the levels of ATPases.

L Liu, Fagopyrum pugense T. Yu, Fagopyrum qiangcai D. Q. Bai and Fagopyrum wenchuanense J. R. Shao, have been identified and described based on their morphological characters. This study investigates the phylogenetic relationship, nucleotide sequence polymorphisms of internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) and the maturase K (matK) gene within four wild species related to western Sichuan buckwheat. F. wenchuanense is closely related to Fagopyrum gracilipes while E qiangcai is closely related to Fagopyrum esculentum based on their morphological differences. However, E wenchuanense is more closely related to Fagopyrum cymosum and E qiangcai is closer to Fagopyrum lineare and Fagopyrum leptopodum from the viewpoint of the ITS, and matK analysis. In addition, E gracilipes is closer to E pugense and Fagopyrum crispatofolium than to E qiangcai. E wenchuanense belongs to the cymosum group, while E qiangcai, F. pugense and E crispatifolium are classified into the urophyllum group based on their morphological and molecular analysis. Conducting morphological and molecular studies provide a better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms and genetic relationships of cultivated and wild buckwheat in western Sichuan, China.

In this paper, we may determine indicators' weight using improved group AHP (analytic hierarchy process) combined with objective weight of each decision-maker, and according to this, the most important index is "technical difficulty of reserve", to which the government should pay more attention to. Then we added these weights into indicator variables of hierarchical clustering analysis in order to classify mineral reserve more reasonably taking the typical resources as an example, and the obtained result was consistent to the government's macroeconomic qualitative analysis. We divided typical mineral resources into four batches for reserving; among these batches, coal was taken granted as the intensive reserve object. Those scarce resources that China has advantage of should also be immediately included in the reserve object such as Tungsten, Tin, and Rare earth. To a certain extent, the results can lay foundation for the establishment of strategic reserve mechanism of mineral resources in China.

We examined the effects of grazing intensity and grass planting system on soil C and nitrogen (N) dynamics, and microbial biomass and respiration in a long-term field experiment in Goldsboro, North Carolina, USA. A split-plot experiment was initiated in 2003 on a highly sandy soil under treatments of two grass planting systems (ryegrass rotation with sorghum-sudangrass hybrid and ryegrass seeding into a perennial bermudagrass stand) at low and high grazing densities. After 4 years of continuous treatments, soil total C and N contents across the 0-30 cm soil profile were 24.7% and 17.5% higher at the high than at the low grazing intensity, likely through promoting plant productivity and C allocation belowground as well as fecal and urinary inputs. Grass planting system effects were significant only at the low grazing intensity, with soil C, N, and microbial biomass and respiration in the top 10 cm being higher under the ryegrass/bermudagrass than under the ryegrass/sorghum-sudangrass hybrid planting systems. These results suggest that effective management could mitigate potential adverse effects of high grazing intensities on soil properties and facilitate sustainability of pastureland.

Plant miRNAs regulate gene expression mainly by guiding cleavage of target mRNAs and subsequently play important roles in diverse developmental processes, nutrient homeostasis and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. MiRNA393 plays important and diverse roles in defense against bacterial pathogens by negatively targeting transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) in plant development. It will be essential for understanding complex feedback regulations in the development pathway by unraveling the miR393 network in a temporal and spatial manner. Here, we report that Zma-miR393b down-regulates its putative target TIR1-like (F-box) gene by guiding the cleavage of their mRNAs in development of leaf sheaths in response to R. Solani infection, Zma-miR393b and its putative target gene TIR1 were confirmed through Q-PCR and the spatial expression of Zma-miR393b was further analyzed by in situ hybridization. These findings suggested that, as a negative feedback regulation of TIR1-like (F-box) gene, Zma-miR393b plays an important role in defense against R. Solani infection.

The exon/intron structures and motif compositions of these WRKY genes were highly conserved in each subfamily suggesting their functional conservation. Moreover, based on qTellier analyses, the majority of these WRKY genes showed a specific temporal and spatial expression pattern. These WRKY genes, within the same group, manifested a distinct expression, indicating a similar function in their expression during the evolutionary process; this is reflected by their sub-functionalizations in their expression pattern concerning leaf developmental gradient, while mature bundle sheath, and mesophyll cells had a similar cellular localization and modality of expression. This study has also provided evidence of the presence of a subset of WRKY genes exhibiting a putative functional role in leaf sheath when infected with Rhizoctonia solani. This finding appears helpful for future functional investigations to unravel the roles of WRKY genes in plant pathogen resistance. Interestingly, in this study we have identified three WRKY genes that are predicted to be potential targets of miR160 and miR171b families. Therefore, this finding appears relevant in elucidating the biological functions of these transcription factors to clarify the molecular mechanisms affecting leaf sheath growth and development during fungal infection and plant resistance.

The control and the treated sausage samples added with 0.03 % tea polyphenol were analyzed periodically for microbiological (total viable counts and lactic acid bacteria counts), physical (Hunter color of L*, a*, b*), chemical (pH, TBA value) and sensory characteristics. It was found that samples added with tea polyphenol showed lower changes in total viable count, pH, TBA value and sensory characteristics than control samples, respectively. The results indicated that the sausage samples with tea polyphenol added was to enable the good quality and sensory characteristics than the control sausage samples and prolonged the shelf life of the sausages.

To study this in pork sausages during storage, kinetic models were developed to predict TBARS content changes of pork sausages at different temperatures. The predictive models of TBARS content with respect to storage time and temperature were developed based on primary and Arrhenius equations. The regression coefficients (R-2 > 0.95) indicated the acceptability of the primary reaction and Arrhenius model for predicting TBARS content changes of pork sausages. The activation energy (E-A) of TBARS is 14.12 kJ mol(-1), and the corresponding rate constant (k(0)) is 9.262 x 10(10). Relative errors between predicted and measured values of TBARS content are all within +/- 8%. Thus, the established model could effectively predict the TBARS content of pork sausages between 5 and 35 degrees C during storage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the topological structure of the Guangzhou urban rail transit network was made by space L and space P methods. The network characteristics, such as average path length, clustering coefficient and degree distribution were selected in each method. Then the network's reliability was discussed, and the results show that the Guangzhou rail transit network at present is classified as a random network. When suffered from selected attack, the average travel length and the global efficiency are increasing; the local efficiency keeps the same. As long as most of the stations work well, the entire rail network structure is relative stable.

Microbiological changes (total viable count - TVC), physicochemical changes (water loss, pH, total volatile nitrogen - TVB-N, trimethylamine - TMA-N, and 2-thiobarbituric acid - TBA), and sensory changes were determined during chilled storage. The results indicated that the coating treatments could effectively retard the water loss, inhibit the growth of total viable counts, reduce chemical spoilage, which reflected itself in TVB-N, pH, TMA-N, and TBA, and increase the overall sensory quality of silver carp in comparison with the control sample. The study suggests that chitosan coating containing AOB can be a promising candidate for extending the shelf life of silver carp during chilled storage.
