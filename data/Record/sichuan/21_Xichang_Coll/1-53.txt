Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT) stabilizes anthocyanin by attaching the glucosyl moiety from UDP-glucose to the C-3 hydroxyl of anthocyanin. In this study, we characterized three UFGT-like genes, designated FtUFGT1, 2, and 3 from tartary buckwheat. The results revealed that FtUFGT1, FtUFGT2, and FtUFGT3 can convert cyanidin to cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, with specific activities of 20.01 X 10(-3), 8.93 X 10(-3), and 20.24 X 10(-3) IU/mg, respectively. The active-site residues of the C-terminal domains and the N-terminal domains are important for the donor and acceptor recognition of these proteins. The expression of the three FtUFGTs paralleled the tissue-specific anthocyanin accumulation. After cold treatment, the increased content of anthocyanin was accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the three FtUFGTs. Among these three UGFT gene members, FtUFGT3 showed the highest expression level and the highest specific activity, suggesting that FtUFGT3 might be the major gene involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results suggested that the FtUFGT genes, FtUFGT3 in particular, might be important candidates for anthocyanin formation in tartary buckwheat sprouts.

Unlike 1 and 2, 3 was a modified Diels-Alder adduct, characteristic by a 1'-OH and a Delta(5'(6')) double bond. Furthermore, the relative configuration of 1'-OH in 3 was assigned as beta-configuration by comparison the experimental NOESY data with those of its two possible epimers. The exo/endo stereochemistry of 1-3 was determined by the spectrographic features of 2,4-linked SLDs that we discovered in our previous works.

The proteins of the R2R3-MYB superfamily play key roles in the growth and development processes as well as defense responses in plants. However, their characteristics and functions have not been fully investigated in tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), a strongly abiotic resistant coarse cereal. In this article, eight tartary buckwheat R2R3-MYB genes were isolated with full-length cDNA and DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the members of the R2R3-MYB superfamily between Arabidopsis and tartary buckwheat revealed that the assumed functions of the eight tartary buckwheat R2R3-MYB proteins are divided into five Arabidopsis functional subgroups that are involved in abiotic stress. Expression analysis during abiotic stress and exogenous phytohormone treatments identified that the eight R2R3-MYB genes responded to one or more treatments. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the R2R3-MYB gene family in tartary buckwheat under abiotic stress.

Muscle fiber types were very important to meat quality traits, however, the molecular mechanism by which miRNAs regulate the muscle fiber type composition is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miRNA-23a can affect muscle fiber type composition. Luciferase reporter assays proved that miRNA-23a directly targets the 3' untranslated region (UTRs) of MEF2c. Overexpression of miRNA-23a significantly suppressed the expression of MEF2c both in mRNA and protein levels, thus caused down regulation of the expression of some key downstream genes of MEF2c (PGC1-alpha, NRF1 and mtTFA). More interestingly, overexpression of miRNA-23a significantly restrained the myogenic differentiation and decreased the ratio of slow myosin heavy chain in myoblasts (p < 0.05). Our findings hinted a novel role of miRNA-23a in the epigenetic regulation of meat quality via decreasing the ratio of slow myosin heavy chain isoforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The DREB transcription factor family genes contains candidate genes for improving plant stress tolerance. Results: From cold-treated H. compressa plants, a putative DREB2 gene (HcDREB2) was cloned using the RACE-PCR method. HcDREB2 was 1296 bp in length and encoded a putative protein 264 amino acid residues long. HcDREB2 shared the highest sequence identity with DREB2 in sorghum. The expression of HcDREB2 was independent of ABA treatment, but inducible by low temperatures as well as drought and high salinity treatments. Yeast one-hybrid assays showed that HcDREB2 directly bound the DRE cis-acting element to transactivate the expression of the downstream reporter genes. Conclusions: HcDREB2, a stress-inducible but ABA-independent transcription factor gene, can transactivate downstream genes by binding to the DRE cis-element. The current results are a foundation for making use of this stress tolerance gene in future H. compressa studies.

A large number of microRNAs are involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation, many of which remain undiscovered. In this study, we found that miR-143-3p was upregulated during C2C12 myoblast differentiation and over-expression of miR-143-3p significantly inhibited the relative expression levels of MyoD, MyoG, myf5, and MyHC genes, especially in the later stages of differentiation. In addition, miR-143-3p inhibited expression of genes involved in the endogenous Wnt signaling pathway during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, including Wnt5a, LRP5, Axin2, and -catenin. These results indicate that miR-143-3p represents a new myogenic differentiation-associated microRNA that can inhibit C2C12 myoblast differentiation, especially in the later stages of differentiation.

The influences by pH value, dosage, initial concentration, temperature, and adsorption time on its performance to absorb copper and chromium were investigated. The experimental data were fitted according to the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models, the pseudo-first-order kinetics, the pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the intra-particle diffusion model. The results indicated that when the reaction system was with its pH = 5, the dosage of carbonized Eupatorium adenophorum was 0.1 g, the adsorption time was 30 min, and the temperature was 25 degrees C; the adsorption capacities for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) reached 27.62 mg/g and 9.68 mg/g, respectively. The process of carbonized Eupatorium adenophorum to absorb Cr(VI) is also accompanied by redox reactions. The Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order model can better ?t the experimental data. Observation by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) found no significant change of functional groups before and after the adsorption by carbonized Eupatorium adenophorum, and this adsorption process is mainly a physical adsorption.

Liangshan pig is a special Chinese indigenous pig breed with two completely different coat colors, solid black and blond. In this study, we detected polymorphisms of the above three genes and assessed the relationships between the variations and coat color phenotypes in Liangshan pigs. The findings revealed that the blond phenotype of Liangshan pig was related to dominant mutations in TYRP1, but not related to mutations in MC1R or ASIP. We found three closely linked mutations in TYRP1, g.8406G>A in intron 4, g.11100A>G in intron 5, and g.17599_17604del in exon 8, that were completely associated with blond coat color in Liangshan pigs. Further analysis revealed that a 6-bp deletion mutation resulted in deletion of Met and Gly residues at positions 495 and 496 in TYRP1 protein, and altered the structure of transmembrane domain of TYRP1. Together, our findings indicated that these three mutations in TYRP1 cause the blond phenotype in Liangshan pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To date, it is not fully understood how miRNAs regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. This study aimed at the identification of the role of miRNA-27b in mitochondria biogenesis. The mitochondria content in C2C12 cells was significantly increased during myogenic differentiation and accompanied by a marked decrease of miRNA-27b expression. Furthermore, the expression of the predicted target gene of miRNA-27b, forkhead box j3 (Foxj3), was also increased during myogenic differentiation. Luciferase activity assays confirmed that miRNA-27b directly targets the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Foxj3. Overexpression of miRNA-27b provoked a decrease of mitochondria content and diminished expression of related mitochondrial genes and Foxj3 both at mRNA and protein levels. The expression levels of downstream genes of Foxj3, such as Mef2c, PGC1 alpha, NRF1 and mtTFA, were also decreased in C2C12 cells upon overexpression of miRNA-27b. These results suggested that miRNA-27b may affect mitochondria biogenesis by down-regulation of Foxj3 during myocyte differentiation.

Since previous studies regarding the role of miRNAs in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation have shown that miRNA-27a, one member of miRNA-23a similar to 27a similar to 24 cluster, could suppress adipogenesis. We now investigated whether miRNA-23a regulates adipogenic differentiation. In the present study, we showed that the expression of miRNA-23a is decreased during the process of adipogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miRNA-23a decreased lipid accumulation and triglyceride content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results also demonstrated that miRNA-23a decreases mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific genes involved in lipogenic transcription, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid transport. These findings suggested miRNA-23a to be a new type of adipogenic depressor and to play an important role in regulating adipocyte differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we found that the expression of miR-145a-5p was gradually increased during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, and miR-145a-5p inhibitors or mimics significantly suppressed or promoted the relative expression of specific myogenesis related marker genes. Moreover, overexpression or inhibition of miR-145a-5p enhanced or repressed the expression of some special genes involved in the endogenous Wnt signaling pathway during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, including Wnt5a, LRP5, Axin2, and beta-catenin. These results indicated that miR-145a-5p might be considered as a newmyogenic differentiation-associated microRNA that can promote C2C12 myoblast differentiation by enhancing genes related to myoblasts differentiation.

After induction of type 2 diabetes, diabetic rats were randomly divided into five groups: diabetic control group, low-dose TBF treated group, middle-dose TBF treated group, high -dose TBF treated group, and glibenclamide treated group, with normal rats used as the control group. After treatment for 28 days, body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were measured and oral glucose toler ance test (OGTT) was performed. The results showed that TBF significantly decreased FBG and serum insulin levels, increased body weights and improved glucose intolerance in diabetic rats. Furthermore, it decreased TC, TG, and LDL-C levels and increased HDL-C levels in these rats. These evidences indicated that TBF possesses hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in type 2 diabetic rats and suggested that TBF has the potential to be a candidate for investigation as an anti-diabetic agent in humans.

However, mechanisms of pollen abortion and fertility restoration remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of CMS-C pollen abortion and fertility restoration, particularly based on epigenetics, and to understand the relationship between male fertility performance and DNA methylation status. Methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique was conducted to analyze DNA methylation levels and patterns of tassels at pollen-mother cell, tetrad, mononuclear, and binuclear stages among four half-sib hybrids and their parents with different fertility. Results showed that DNA methylation levels in fertility restored hybrids were higher than those in sterility maintained hybrids. Nine CCGG sites, which displayed methylation polymorphism between male-fertile and male-sterile hybrids, were screened. To validate MSAP results, we performed methylation-sensitive PCR (MS-PCR) and found consistent observations in cloned methylation sites. Interestingly, a specific site named 16-1 was discovered in the region of Rf5 gene, which is one of the restorer genes of CMS-C. Thus, DNA methylation may participate in regulating the expression of fertility restorer genes of maize CMS-C.

It is widely acknowledged that exercise induces a number of physiological adaptations that have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of these chronic metabolic diseases. Unfortunately, exercise compliance is extremely low and often not possible. The development of exercise science and molecular techniques has increased our understanding of the molecular pathways responsive to exercise. Knowledge of these molecular targets has led to the development of chemical interventions that can mimic the beneficial effects of exercise without requiring actual muscle activity. This review focuses on the concept of 'exercise pills' and how they mimic the effects produced by physical exercise including oxidative fiber-type transformation, mitochondria, biogenesis, increased fat oxidation, angiogenesis, and improvement of exercise capacity. We also review candidate exercise pills, and contrast the beneficial effects and molecular mechanisms between physical exercise and exercise pills.

In this study, we investigate miRNAs in Honghua Dajinyuan, an agronomically important species of tobacco in China. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles in the leaf, stem and root using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 165 miRNAs, representing 55 conserved families, and 50 novel miRNAs, representing 19 families, were identified in three libraries. In addition, 12 miRNAs were randomly selected from a differentially expressed conserved miRNA family in three libraries with expression alterations and subjected to qRT-PCR validation. Of these, the expression level of nta-miR167d is highly enriched in the leaf tissue. In addition, the expression level of nta-miR319a is prominently enriched in the stem, while nta-miR160c is highly enriched in the root. Moreover, the target prediction showed that most of the targets coded for transcription factors that are involved in cellular and metabolic processes. GO analysis showed that most of the targets were involved in organelle function, served binding functions, and take part in cellular and metabolic processes. This study helps shed new light on understanding the role of miRNAs in different parts of the tobacco plant and adds a significant number of novel miRNAs to the tobacco miRNA transcriptome.

Here, we report a genome-wide transcriptional profile analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of maize leaf development after inoculation with B. zeicola. We performed High-Throughput Digital Gene Expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in resistant inbred Mo17 lines after infection with B. zeicola at four successive disease development stages-CP (contact period), PP (penetration period), IP (incubation period), and DP (disease period); the expression of the genes was compared with those in a CK (mock-treatment) control. In addition, a sensitive maize line (Zheng58) was used for the comparisons with the Mo17. Among all tested genes, 466 differentially expressed genes were identified in all libraries, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these genes suggested that they are involved in many biological processes related to systemic symptom development, such as plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis. Our systematic analysis provides comprehensive transcriptomic information regarding systemic symptom development in fungal-infected plants. This information will help in furthering our understanding of the detailed mechanisms of plant responses to fungal infection.

MicroRNAs are a type of single strand small non- coding RNA molecule and are implicated in the regulation of many crucial pathways during cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Here, we present a comprehensive comparison of miRNA expression profiling in three main stages during porcine spermatogenesis using high-throughput sequencing. We built three small RNA libraries for the testis, the epididymis and the ejaculated sperm from a Landrace boar, and in total obtained 3821 precursor hairpins encoding for 4761 mature miRNAs, of which 23 are miRNA*. Notably, 940 precursor miRNAs produced both the 5'- and 3'- strands as sister pairs, indicating the distinctive expression patterns of germ cell miRNAs. Additionally, 418 out of 710 co-expressed miRNAs were identified as being differentially expressed between libraries (P < 0.001). Apart from the sexual specific X chromosome, many miRNAs were found to be located on chromosome 12, which may play potential roles in spermatogenesis according to the result of synteny analysis with human and mouse. The Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of co-expressed miRNAs were highly involved in the cell cycle process, metal ion binding, modification of plasma membrane, and the p53 signal pathway.

However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in tobacco root development in response to drought stress are not well-known. To gain insight into the transcriptome dynamics associated with drought resistance, genome-wide gene expression profiling of roots from a tobacco cultivar (Honghua Dajinyuan, a major flue-cured tobacco cultivar in Southwest China) under 20% PEG6000 treatment for 0, 6 h and 48 h were conducted using Solexa sequencing (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Over five million tags were generated from tobacco roots, including 229,344, 221,248 and 242,065 clean tags in three libraries, respectively. The most differentially expressed tags, with either log2FC > 2.0 for up-regulated genes or log2FC < -2.0 for down regulated genes (p < 0.001), were analyzed further. In comparison to the control, 1476 up-regulated and 1574 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, except for unknown transcripts, which were grouped into 43 functional categories involved in seven significant pathways. The most enriched categories were those that were populated by transcripts involved in metabolism, signal transduction and cellular transport. Many genes and/or biological pathways were found to be common among the three libraries, for example, genes participating in transport, stress response, auxin transport and signaling, etc. Next, the expression patterns of 12 genes were assessed with quantitative real-time PCR, the results of which agreed with the Solexa analysis. In conclusion, we revealed complex changes in the transcriptome during tobacco root development related to drought resistance, and provided a comprehensive set of data that is essential to understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms involved. These data may prove valuable in future studies of the molecular mechanisms regulating root development in response to drought stress in tobacco and other plants.

The biosorbent was used for Cr(VI) removal. The effect of experimental parameters, such as pH, sorbent dosage and temperature were examined and the optimal experimental condition was determined. Solution pH is found influencing the adsorption. Cr(VI) removal efficiency is found to be maximum (98%) at pH = 1. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were applicable to the adsorption process and their constants were evaluated. The adsorption data obtained agreed well with the Langmuir sorption isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities for Cr(VI) ranged from 46.23 to 55.19 mg center dot g(-1) for temperature between 298 K and 308 K under the condition of pH = 1.0. Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy change (Delta G), enthalpy (Delta H) and entropy (Delta S) indicate a spontaneous, endothermic and increased randomness nature of Cr(VI) adsorption. Studies found that the raw E. adenophorum and buckwheat straw mixed materials with simple treatment had a high efficiency for the removal of Cr(VI) and would be a promising adsorbent.

Six pairs of highly polymorphic primers were selected from 100 pairs of RAMP primers to amplify the 20 Lilium species. The results showed that a total of 147 DNA bands were amplified, 145 of which were polymorphic, accounting for 98.81%. The number of effective alleles (Ne) was 1.2684. The difference value between number of alleles (Na) and effective alleles (Ne) was 0.7180. The Nei's genetic diversity index (H) was 0.2009 and the Shannon's information index (I) was 0.3446. These figures indicated that there was high genetic diversity among Lilium species in China. Taking the average genetic similarity coefficient (Gs) 0.688 as the threshold, the 20 tested Lilium species were clustered into 5 categories which were not entirely consistent with the outcome of traditional clustering by morphological traits. The genetic diversity and genetic relationships in Lilium species revealed by this study can provide reference for effective germplasm resources conservation, germplasm innovation and selection of parents for breeding.

In this study, we investigate miRNAs in an agronomically important common tobacco in China, named Honghua Dajinyuan (a drought-tolerant cultivar). Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles in mock-treat grown (CK) and 20 % polyethylene glycol-grown (PEG-grown) tobacco roots using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 656 unique miRNAs representing 53 miRNA families were identified in the two libraries, of which 286 unique miRNAs representing 162 microRNAs were differentially expressed. In addition, nine differentially expressed microRNAs selected from different expressed miRNA family with high abundance were subjected to further analysis and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). In addition, the expression pattern of these identified candidate conserved miRNA and target genes of three identified miRNA (nta-miR172b, nta-miR156i, and nta-miR160a) were also validated by Q-PCR. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggests that the putative target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in metabolic process and response to stimulus. In particular, 25 target genes are involved in regulating plant hormone signal transduction and metabolism, indicating that these association microRNAs may play important regulatory roles in responding to PEG resistance. Moreover, this study adds a significant number of novel miRNAs to the tobacco miRNome.

The Pt site is the favored one for the adsorptions of AunPt (n=1-12) clusters for a H-2 molecule. The introduction of impurity Pt may reinforce the adsorption of H-2 molecules and thus promote the reactivity enhancement of H-2 molecules. In addition, the odd-even alterations of magnetic moment, electronic configuration and stability for AunPtH2 clusters and Aun+1H2 clusters are clearly observed and can be simply understood by considering the electron-pairing effect.

The results showed that the water lettuce had higher removal efficiency with low concentrations of livestock wastewater. The removal efficiency of water lettuce for different initial concentrations of livestock wastewater within 8 d was as follows: chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) (68-82%)> NH3-N (57-69%) > TP (27-45%). The speed of purification of water lettuce for CODcr, NH3-N and TP conformed to first order kinetics equations. The water quality indices CODcr, NH3-N and TP had a higher linear correlation with peroxidase (POD) activity (R-2>0.9(2)) than with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, which indicates that the main reacting enzyme of water lettuce under high CODcr stress is peroxidase.

Compared with the P-2n(+/-) (n = 1-7) clusters, the HP2n +/- (n = 1-7), cluster has shorter average P-P bond length, larger binding energy and HOMOLUMO gap (HLG), higher chemical hardness and frequency of P-P mode. After binding with one hydrogen atom, the electronic structure is changed from open electronic shell to closed electronic shell. Geometrical stability, chemical stability and electronic stability are strengthened. These stability enhancements may be simply understood considering the electron pairing effect.

The effect of surface modification on mechanical properties was evaluated by tensile and impact tests under controlled conditions. Compared with the untreated cellulose filled epoxy composites, the NaOH solution treatment increased the tensile strength by 34% and elongation at break by 31%. While silane coupling agent treatment produced 71% enhancement in tensile strength and 53% increase in elongation at break. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the surface feature of the cellulose fibers and the tensile fractures as well as cryo-fractures of the composites. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was employed to analyze the chemical structure of the cellulose fibers before and after modifications. The results indicated different mechanisms for the two modifications of cellulose. The NaOH solution partly dissolved the lignin and amorphous cellulose, which resulting in splitting the fibers into smaller size. This led to easier permeating into the gaps of the fibers for epoxy resin (EP) oligmer and forming effective interfacial adhesion. Based on the emergence of Si-O-C and Si-O-Si on the cellulose surface, it was concluded that the enhancement of mechanical properties after coupling agent modification could be ascribed to the formation of chemical bonds between the cellulose and the epoxy coupled with the coupling agent.

This extract enriched in polyphenols, showed a potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity with maltose as a substrate in enzyme assay. The extract was then applied to MCI-gel column chromatography with a water-methanol gradient to give three fractions: fraction 1 (F-1, water), fraction 2 (F-2, 80% methanol in water), and fraction 3 (F-3, 100% methanol). F-2 showed the highest maltase inhibitory activity compared with F-1 and F-3, and down-regulated alpha-glucosidase activity for the maltose hydrolysis in Caco-2 monolayer. In maltose-loaded SD-rats, F-2 significantly reduced postprandial blood glucose level. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid was found to be the potent maltase inhibitor, whereas chlorogenic acid and rutin showed a weak inhibitory activity against maltase. This is the first report on the mammalian alpha-glucosdiase inhibition of L. japonica. The result presented here suggests a use of the extract of L. japonica for antidiabetes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

China, for over 30 years. The benefit is evident. It helps significantly reduce the number of dropouts because bilingual education ensures the monolingual Yi pupils to start learning with their mother tongue. Consequently, more Yi students can go for higher levels of education. However, since the dominant Han culture is exerting strong influence upon the Yi, the Chinese language is paid great attention in its bilingual education and the education of the Yi language is watered down. To change this, the prefecture government hopes to find a way, through appropriate policy process, for the Yi students to maintain the minority language and at the same time master the national lingua franca Chinese. But the central-local conflicting policies put the stakeholders in dilemma. The present article attempts to investigate the status quo of bilingual education and its policy process in Liangshan so as to interpret the dilemma and hopefully provide reference for policy improvement.

In order to get a high-efficiency C-band superradiance BWO with a low beam voltage and a low guiding magnet field, the mechanism of superradiance in a BWO is explored in particle-in-cell simulation. With the oversized structure, the simulation shows that a microwave power of 405 kW with a frequency of 5.6 GHz and a spectrum width of 500 MHz can be obtained with a voltage of 23 kV and magnetic field of 0.1 T.

The results showed that a total of 127 bands were amplified by 14 pairs of high polymorphism primers, among which 113 (88.90%) were polymorphic bands, and that the effective number of alleles (N-e), Nei's gene diversity (H), and Shannon's information index (I) for pomegranate were 1.3345, 0.2126 and 0.2126, respectively. These results showed that there is the significant genetic diversity among pomegranate germplasm in China. When the genetic similarity coefficients (G(s))was 0.75, the 46 pomegranate cultivars were completely clustered into five groups by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). The cluster results indicated that the molecular classification was not consistent with the morphological/agronomical classification or geographic origin. The obtained genetic information assists toward the effective protection and sustainable utilization of pomegranate resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle contains more type IIB fibers (75.10%) than does the psoas major (PM) muscle (41.58%), while the PM has more type I (3.65 vs 0.94%), type IIA (34.15 vs 10.63%), and type IIX (20.62 vs 13.33%) fibers. Compared with PM, glycolytic potential (GP), pH(45) (min), and Delta pH from 45 min to 24 h post-mortem were all relatively higher in LD. Glycogen metabolites (lactate and GP) were negatively correlated with pH(24) (h) and positively correlated with Delta pH. Expression of GYG was generally higher in LD. GYG expression was positively correlated with glycogen metabolite (lactate and GP) content and Delta pH, and was negatively correlated with pH(24 h). These data confirm that the muscle-fiber type and GP have significant effects on ultimate pH and pH decline, and suggest that expression of GYG in muscles is related to the metabolism of glycogen and may impact GP, Delta pH, and ultimate pH. High expression of GYG was associated with a high glycogen content, large pH decline, and low ultimate pH in muscles post-mortem.

Secondary users in cognitive networks may select from a set of available channels to use provided that the occupancy does not affect the prioritized licensed users. However, CRNs produce unique routing challenges due to the high fluctuation in the available spectrum as well as diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In CRNs, distributed multihop architecture and time varying spectrum availability are some of the key factors in design of routing algorithms. In this paper, we develop an ant-colony-optimization-(ACO-) based on-demand cognitive routing algorithm (ACO-OCR), jointly consider path and spectrum scheduling, and take advantage of the availability of multiple channels, to improve the delivery latency and packet loss rate. Then, an analytical framework based on M/G/1 queuing theory is introduced to illustrate the relay node queuing model. The performances of ACO-OCR have been evaluated by means of numerical simulations, and the experimental results confirm its effectiveness. Simulation results show that ACO-OCR outperforms other routing approaches in end-to-end path latency and package loss rate.

Since the 1990s, many studies have shown that miRNAs act in many ways to regulate target expression in plant growth, development and stress response. The recent draft genome sequence of Nicotiana benthamiana has provided a framework for Digital Gene Expression (DGE) and small RNA sequencing to understand patterns of transcription in the context of plant response to environmental stress. We sequenced and analyzed three Digital Gene Expression (DGE) libraries from roots of normal and drought-stressed tobacco plants, and four small RNA populations from roots, stems and leaves of control or drought-treated tobacco plants, respectively. We identified 276 candidate drought responsive genes (DRGs) with sequence similarities to 64 known DRGs from other model plant crops, 82 were transcription factors (TFs) including WRKY, NAC, ERF and bZIP families. Of these tobacco DRGs, 54 differentially expressed DRGs included 21 TFs, which belonged to 4 TF families such as NAC (6), MYB (4), ERF (10), and bZIP (1). Additionally, we confirmed expression of 39 known miRNA families (122 members) and five conserved miRNA families, which showed differential regulation under drought stress. Targets of miRNAs were further surveyed based on a recently published study, of which ten targets were DRGs. An integrated gene regulatory network is proposed for the molecular mechanisms of tobacco root response to drought stress using differentially expressed DRGs, the changed expression profiles of miRNAs and their target transcripts. This network analysis serves as a reference for future studies on tobacco response stresses such as drought, cold and heavy metals.

Of these, 137 samples were BVDV-positive and the BVDV prevalence rate was 23.1% (9/39) in 2007,27.7% (44/159) in 2008,33.6% (34/101) in 2009, and 23.6% (50/212) in 2010. Twenty of 137 BVDV-positive samples were used for further genetic analysis of the 5'-UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were BVDV-1 and subtyped into BVDV-la, BVDV-1b, BVDV-1m, BVDV-1o and an unknown subgenotype. This study showed that BVDVs were highly prevalent in Chinese pig herds and appropriate measures should be taken to control BVDV prevalence in pig herds. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology, structure and spectroscopic properties of the prepared samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflection spectra, photoluminescence spectra and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, respectively. The effect of Sm3+ doping concentration on the photoluminescence intensity of the prepared samples is also investigated. The results indicate that the crystal structure of Li2SrSiO4 is not changed with the Eu2+, Sm3+ co-doping. The spherical-like particle size of the obtained product is about 20-30 nm in diameter. When the Sm3+ concentration is 0.3 mol% and the Eu2+ concentration is 0.7 mol%, the phosphors show the maximum emission intensity, which is 50% higher than that of Eu2+ doped Li2SrSiO4. Excited at 420 nm, the phosphor presents a single broad emission band peaking at 558 nm, which is ascribed to the 4f(6)5d(1) -> 4f(7) transitions of Eu2+ and (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2) and (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transitions of Sm3+.

Consequently, musk deer farming was introduced as a measure to not only protect musk deer but also to provide a means for sustainable musk supply. An increased understanding of the social structure of captive populations is essential for both successful farming and improved welfare of individuals. This study recorded agonistic interactions between captive individuals at Xinglongshan Musk Deer Farm (XMDF), northwest China. The relationship between aggressive interactions and the individual's age and gender and opponent health was analysed. From our observations we found that stable social hierarchies developed within both captive male and gender-mixed musk deer groups. There was no significant correlation found between only age of individual and their status in the social hierarchy, and it was thus concluded, as social rank was not determined singularly by age, that a combination of other factors, such as experience and origin of the individual, better explain rank orders. Three forms of aggressive behaviour were expressed between males, in which threatening (56.38% +/- 7.28%) was significantly more frequent than attacking (17.86% +/- 5.94%) and displacing behaviours (25.78% +/- 3.66%). There was no attacking behaviour observed in interactions initiated by males towards females, however displacing (70.85% +/- 4.15%) was more common than threatening (29.15% +/- 4.15%). Conflict-initiating male deer demonstrated more attacking and threatening behaviour towards male opponents than to female ones, however the differences were statistically insignificant. These results can be implemented into musk deer farming management practices through 1) rotating individuals within an enclosure on a frequent basis; 2) removing males from female enclosures after successful mating and 3) enclosing males in single sex enclosures. Furthermore, in order to improve musk deer forming and captive musk deer welfare, management systems should be kept relatively consistent in order to assist in establishing the stable social hierarchy patterns in captive populations.

After induction of diabetes, diabetic mice were randomly divided into four groups: one diabetic control group and three different doses of FTB (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) treated groups, with non-diabetic mice used as the normal control group. The mice were intragastrically administered once daily for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The results showed that FTB could significantly reduce FBG levels and MDA contents, and increase serum insulin levels, SOD, GPx and CAT activities. These data suggested that FTB possess hypoglycemic effects and could reduce alloxan-induced oxidative stress in mice. Therefore, FTB might be of use as an antidiabetic drug.

The phase of the as-prepared powders was measured by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and the chemical composition was characterized using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The luminescent properties of Li2SrSiO4:Dy3+ were systematically investigated by concentration quenching, decay behavior and thermal stability measurements. The results suggested that the emission intensity of the Li2SrSiO4:Dy3+ was much stronger than that of Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+. It was worth to mention that Li2SrSiO4:Dy3+ phosphor possessed excellent thermal stability for use in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and the emission intensity measured at 300 degrees C was only decreased 8% comparing with that measured at room temperature. Furthermore, the Commission International del'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of Li2SrSiO4:Dy3+ moved toward the ideal white light coordinates (0.33, 0.33). All results demonstrated that Li2SrSiO4:Dy3+ might be a potential phosphor for NUV-based white light-emitting diodes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The PCR detection results showed that PBoV was significantly more prevalent in weanling piglets (69.7%, 69/99) with respiratory tract symptoms than that in other samples (0-13.6%) (P < 0.01). Sequence analysis showed that the partial VP1/2 genes were highly conserved (99-100% identity), and only five frequent nucleotide mutation positions existed in Chinese PBoV strains. These data indicate that PBoV might be an emerging virus for swine respiratory tract diseases. This study could help us to better understand the epidemiology of PBoV.

These results suggested that conventional UASB could be modified to MUASB aiming to cultivate aerobic granules, by taking off gas-liquid-solid separator on the top and putting a fine-bubble diffuser at the bottom of the reactor. As for mature granules, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observation revealed that a lot of filamentous bacteria were presented in the fringe region, while cocci were predominant and formed a relatively condensed region in the granule interior. Proteins and lipids were distributed throughout the granules, whereas a-polysaccharides were mainly distributed in the core of granules. Few p-polysaccharides and dead cells were detected in the granules.

The highest yield of protoplasts was up to 8.9 x 10(6) cells/ml in digestion solution containing 2.0% lywallzyme and 0.6 M KCl after incubation of four-day-old mycelia at 30 degrees C for 3 h; among which, about 1.4% protoplasts could be regenerated into mycelia after 4 - 6 days of incubation at 25 degrees C in CYM medium with 0.6 M mannitol as osmotic stabilizer. The results are beneficial for breeding new cultivars by the methods such as protoplast fusion, mutagenesis as well as transformation. Moreover, the stepwise procedure for protoplast liberation and regeneration could be referred in other species.

Preliminary findings of behavioral patterns in captive alpine musk deer (Moschus sifanicus) and prospects for future conservation	TURKISH JOURNAL OF VETERINARY & ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Alpine musk deer (Moschus sifanicus); captivity; wild-caught; captive-born; domestication	DOMESTICATION; POPULATIONS; ETHOLOGY	Captive farming of alpine musk deer (Moschus sifanicus) in China has been used for conservation and harvesting of musk since the mid 1950s. Despite this long history, management practices and captive breeding have been primarily based on trial and error due to lack of behavioral and ecological information about this vulnerable species. Understanding behavioral patterns plays a vital part in determining appropriate management systems; hence the aim of this study was to determine the effect of captivity on behavioral patterns of alpine musk deer by comparing wild-caught and the captive-born alpine musk deer. From August 2002 to January 2003, the behavioral patterns of 30 wild-caught (WC) and 15 captive-bred (CB) adult alpine musk deer were recorded at Xinglongshan Musk Deer Farm (XMDF), located in Xinglongshan National Nature Reserve, Gansu province, China. Focal sampling was used to observe the frequencies of 12 behavior categories. The behavioral patterns of WC and CB musk deer were found to be similar; however, when gender was considered, male WC deer showed a significantly higher frequency of agonistic interaction. These preliminary results suggest that captivity has had no immediate impact on the behavioral patterns of captive alpine musk deer despite 10 generations of captivity. Therefore, the alpine musk deer is not suited for domestication and further investigation into the effectiveness of musk deer farming for the purpose of harvesting musk should be undertaken.

It is found that the harden time of silica sol ceramic mold is only 0.5 to 1.5 h under the amount of NH4Cl solution of 7% to 8% with 15% concentration, and less surface cracks occur by using vacuum drying. The proper vacuum drying process parameters: vacuum drying temperature is 80 to 100 degrees C, drying time is 5 h, and vacuum is 0.06 to 0.07 MPa. The harden mechanics, vacuum drying mechanics and the reason of less surface cracks of silica sol ceramic mold by vacuum drying were also analyzed in this paper.

Various optical switchings have been developed in recent years as a way to improve reliability problems and to build small size, robust integrated devices. A novel low crosstalk, high switching speed, compact in structure, efficient in performance, polarisation independent, and reversible 2 x 2 optical switching is proposed using a phase spatial light modulator (PSLM), a polarising beam-splitter (PBS), a mirror, a half-wave plate (HWP) and a quarter-wave plate (QWP). The optical switching should be helpful in the design of a large-scale switch matrix, and show considerable promise in the future of fibre optic networks.
