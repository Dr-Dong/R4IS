In order to understand the relationship between network structure and coloring problem, we investigate the effects of WS, BA networks and different macro-scale parameters on the K-proper coloring. We find that the maximum clique number can generally reflect the trend of K value change, the average degree and the degree correlation have a greater impact on the K value than the heterogeneity and the clustering coefficient. These results are verified on some real-world networks. After coloring the complex networks properly, the independent sets of networks can be obtained. According to the characteristic that any two vertices are not connected in an independent set, we propose a random immunization strategy based on the independent set. Compared with the random immunization, the proposed strategy can make the network more vulnerable, and thus effectively mitigate epidemic spreading. This immunization strategy is simple and practical, which helps to design more efficient immunization strategy.

This study analyzes the seismic attenuation of P- and S-waves in one tight sandstone gas reservoir and attempts to give the quantitative distinguishing results of gas and water by the characteristics of the seismic attenuation of P- and S-waves. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is used to better measure attenuation associated with gas saturation. A formation absorption section is defined to compute the values of attenuation using the common frequency sections obtained by the HHT method. Values of attenuation have been extracted from three seismic sections intersecting three different wells: one gas-saturated well, one fully water-saturated well, and one gas- and water-saturated well. For the seismic data from the Sulige gas field located in northwest Ordos Basin, China, we observed that in the gas-saturated media the S-wave attenuation was very low and much lower than the P-wave attenuation. In the fully water-saturated media the S-wave attenuation was higher than the P-wave attenuation. We suggest that the joint application of P- and S-wave attenuation can improve the direct detection between gas and water in seismic sections. This study is hoped to be useful in seismic exploration as an aid for distinguishing gas and water from gas- and water-bearing formations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This model shows the clustering phenomenon of opinions in dynamic network evolution. The simulation results show that the model can fit the data from a social network site. The dynamic evolution of networks accelerates the opinion, separation and aggregation. The scale and the number of clusters are influenced by confidence limit and rewiring probability. Dynamic changes of the topology reduce the number of isolated nodes, while the increased confidence limit allows nodes to communicate more sufficiently. The two effects make the distribution of opinion more neutral. The dynamic evolution of networks generates central clusters with high connectivity and high betweenness, which make it difficult to control public opinions in SNS.

The calculated lattice parameters, elastic constants of C2N2X (X=O, NH and CH2) are in good agreement with the experimental data and previous calculated values. C2N2X (X=O, NH and CH2) are also found to be thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The mechanical moduli (bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus) are evaluated by Voigt-Reuss-Hill approach. The hardness of C2N2X (X=O, NH and CH2) is calculated using both the ab initio and semiempirical model calculations. The Vickers hardness of C2N2X (X=O, NH and CH2) is approximate to 40 GPa of the superhard materials. In conclusion, these materials can be regarded as potential candidate of ultra-incompressible and hard materials. Furthermore, the mechanical anisotropy is also discussed in details.

We prove that the reversed flow solutions exist for each parameter in (-1/6,0). This is an extension of results on nonexistence of reversed flow solutions obtained recently by the authors. As applications of our new results, we obtain existence of reversed flow similarity solutions of the boundary layer equations governing the flow of fluids over surfaces often arising from engineering problems.

The structures, elasticity properties, intrinsic hardness and Debye temperature of the cubic ternary spinel nitrides are studied by first principles based on the density-functional theory. The results show that -CSn2N4, -SiC2N4, -GeC2N4 and -SnC2N4 are not mechanically stable. The elastic constants C-ij of these cubic spinel structures are obtained using the stress-strain method. Derived elastic constants, such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson coefficient and brittle/ductile behaviour are estimated using Voigt-Reuss-Hill theories. The B/G value, the Poisson's ratio and anisotropic factor are calculated for eight ternary stable crystals. Based on the microscopic hardness model, we further estimate the Vickers hardness of all the stable crystals. From the calculated hardness of the stable group IVA ternary spinel nitrides by Gao's and Jiang's methods, it is observed that the stable group IVA ternary spinel nitrides are not superhard materials except for -CSi2N4. Furthermore, the Debye temperature for the eight stable crystals is also estimated.

Accurate prediction of the inflow performance for perforated vertical wells is of great significance to reservoir analysis and perforation optimization. Under steady-state inflow, a reservoir/well-bore-coupling model is proposed that combines a numerical reservoir model and a semianalytical wellbore model. One type of optimization problem is also established that considers the effects of perforation density on the productivity of a vertical well, for which the vertical-well production is treated as an objective function. A number of experiments are presented demonstrating how the model could be used to obtain the optimum perforation distribution for infinite-conductivity and finite-conductivity wells.

Methods: This study was conducted using a case-control method. Genotypes of apolipoprotein E (APOE e4) and CLOCK gene 3111T/C were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism method and TaqMan assay method, respectively. Results: In this study, we gathered 296 unrelated AD patients and 423 control subjects. Both in the whole sample and APOE e4 noncarriers, prevalence of C carriers in CLOCK gene 3111T/C in AD patients was significantly higher than that in control subjects (in the whole sample: chi(2) = 37.615, P < 0.0001; in APOE e4 noncarriers: chi(2) = 46.809, P G 0.0001). However, among APOE e4 carriers, prevalence of C carriers in CLOCK gene 3111T/C between patients and control subjects presents nonsignificant difference (chi(2) = 0.812, P = 0.451). Conclusions: Among APOE e4 noncarriers, C carriers in CLOCK gene 3111T/C were associated with a high susceptibility of AD, but among APOE e4 carriers, the functional polymorphism of CLOCK gene 3111T/C was not associated with the susceptibility of AD.

The results showed that the film thickness of the SmCo-based films presented complex effect on the intrinsic coercivity H-ci. Optimal H-ci for the films with Mo underlayer, Cr underlayer, and without underlayer was observed with different film thicknesses. Furthermore, the monotonous temperature dependence of H-ci was found to be strongly correlated with the magnetic parameters for the 3.0 pm thick SmCo7 films with Mo underlayer. From 25 to 300 degrees C, the H-ci decreased from 281.6 to 211.2 kA/m with a temperature coefficient of-0.091%/degrees C, exhibiting good temperature stability.

Specific surface area measurements (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO-chemisorption, H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the effect of BaO on the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. Their catalytic activities towards methanol, CO and C3H8 conversions were evaluated. The results show that the addition of BaO makes palladium highly dispersed, enhances the amount of active oxygen and promotes the reductive ability. The electron effects between Pd and support is improved. It is favorable for maintaining Pd in a higher oxidized state and transiting Ce4+ to Ce3+, thus accelerating the activated oxygen migration between Pd and the support and consequently increasing the catalytic activities for methanol and CO oxidation at low temperature. The light-off temperature of T50 is lowered by 26 and 21 degrees C to methanol and CO, respectively compared with unmodified only-Palladium catalysts. Whereas the conversion of C3H8 falls directly because of the higher oxidized Pd2+ and the amount and intensity of the acid sites decreasing obviously.

By introducing a a-dominance relation based on inclusion measures between two interval numbers, we propose a variable-precision-dominance-based rough set approach based on the substitution of indiscernibility relation by the a-dominance relation. The knowledge discovery framework is formulated for interval-valued information systems. Furthermore, knowledge reduction of interval-valued decision systems based on the variable-precision-dominance-based rough set model is postulated. Relationships between these reducts and discemibility matrices are also established to substantiate knowledge reduction in the variable-precision-dominance-based rough set model.

J	Tang, TT				Tang, Tingting			Generation of Guiding Modes by Surface Modes in Anisotropic Metamaterial Waveguide	IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Anisotropic; metamaterial; slow propagation		We explore the possibility of the existence of guiding modes generated by surface modes in a three-layer waveguide composed of anisotropic single-negative metamaterial. The conditions for generation of even or odd guiding modes are deduced in eight subcases of single-negative (SNG) metamaterials with a different combination of positive or negative components of permittivity and permeability tensors, including the requirements for real propagation of surface and guiding modes as well as a solvable dispersion equation. The theoretical prediction is verified by simulation results, and the generated guiding modes are much more controllable and practicable in the three-layer symmetric waveguide consists of anisotropic SNG metamaterial.

According to the law of approach to saturation (LATS) and high temperature magnetization curves of the films, the effect of temperature on the magnetic anisotropy constant K-1 is observed, which clearly suggests that the preferred orientation of SmCo crystalline is destroyed at a certain extent by elevated temperatures. Effect of temperature on the magnetic parameters is observed from the aging treatment results and high temperature magnetic hysteresis loops for the films, which determines the temperature dependence of the intrinsic coercivity H-ci.

The structure and static magnetic properties of Ni0.4Zn0.5Co0.1SnxFe2-xO4 ferrite thin films have been investigated. The diffraction peak shifted towards the lower angle and the lattice parameter increased with Sn substitution. The average grain size of Sn-substituted NiZnCo ferrtie thin films decreased with Sn substitution. The saturation magnetization gradually decreased with the increase of Sn substitution. However, the coercivity initially increased with the increase of Sn substitution when x <= 0.04, and decreased when x > 0.04.

A trend of total organic carbon (TOC) > total nitrogen (TN) > total inorganic carbon (TIC) was observed for both sites. Variation of inorganic ions indicated that inorganic pollutants were not accumulated in the fog. Concentrations of n-alkanes (C11-C37) at the urban site ranged from 7.58 to 27.75 ng/mL while at the suburban site concentrations were 2.57-21.55 ng/mL. The highest concentration of n-alkanes was observed in the mature period of fog (393.12 ng/mL) which was more than ten times that in the fog formation period (27.83 ng/rnL) and the fog dissipation period (14.87 ng/mL). Concentrations of Sigma 15PAHs were in the range of 7.27-38.52 ng/mL at the urban site and 2.59-22.69 ng/mL at the suburban site. Contents of PAHs in the mature period of fog (27.15 ng/mL) > fog dissipation period (11.59 ng/mL) > fog formation period (6.42 ng/mL). Concentrations of dicarboxylic acids (C5-C9) ranged from 10.92 to 40.78 ng/mL, with glutaric acid (C5) as the dominant dicarboxylic acid. These data provide strong indications of the accumulation of certain organic chemicals of environmental concern in fog and fog water, and provide additional insights about processes in urban and suburban air acting on organic chemicals with similar physical chemical properties.

Two linear-temperature terms, i.e., thermal voltage V-T and threshold voltage V-TH, are utilized to realize a low-temperature-dependent voltage reference with a significant reduction of nonlinear temperature terms. A self-biased threshold-voltage extractor circuit without any resistor is used to obtain the V-TH and bias currents of the whole circuit. Based on ratioed transistors biased in a strong inversion region and the inverse-function technique, a temperature-insensitive gain can be applied to the proportional-to-absolute temperature term in the reference, and a weighted sum of V-T and V-TH is achieved. Experimental results of the proposed voltage reference implemented with a 0.35-mu m CMOS process demonstrate that the output of voltage reference is 905.5 mV, a temperature coefficient of 14.8 ppm/degrees C with a temperature range of 0 degrees C-100 degrees C is obtained at a 3.3-V power supply, and a power-supply noise attenuation of 61 dB is achieved without any filtering capacitor while dissipating a maximum supply current of 65 mu A. The active area is 100 mu m x 100 mu m.

In the calculations, the defect models suggested in the previous paper that center A is due to Gd3+ ion at the octahedral Zn2+ site without any local charge compensation and center B is due to Gd3+ ion at the nine-coordinated TI2+ site associated with a Li+ ion at the nearest Zn2+ site along C-4 axis for charge compensation are applied. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The suggested defect models of both Gd3+ centers are therefore confirmed and the respective defect structural data are obtained. The results, including the validity of defect structural data, are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The catastrophic earthquake not only created tremendous changes in the external environment but also caused stress and difficulties for the people in the affected areas which were felt long after the event. In this study, we attempt to examine the consequences of the earthquake to assess level of exposure to the disaster and well-being after this event. 2,080 survivors from nineteen counties freely participated in the survey which used self-report psychological questionnaires, including SF-12-v2, stress risk and social psych resources. We estimated regression models to identify stress risk and social psych resources associated with the presence of mental symptoms after the disaster. Disaster exposure did have a lasting impact on variation in local resident well-being. Experiencing negative life events and disease related to poorer physical health and better social psychological resources had improved mental health and decreased PTSD symptom. Female respondents or respondents aged 40-50 were more likely to suffer from poorer mental health compared male and other aged groups. Survivors aged 40-50 should take recuperation therapy. Local educators, psychological workers and volunteers should be trained on psychology intervention and government should make mental health policies.

The bypass couplings are realized with the nonresonating TE10 mode, so that arbitrarily positioned transmission zeros (TZs) can be obtained. To demonstrate the design flexibility, the approach is illustrated at example of a second-order filter providing Chebyshev, elliptic function type, and asymmetric characteristics. In addition, the modularity of the filter design is validated by the individual control of each TZ. A second-order 15GHz SIW bandpass filter with 150MHz bandwidth is then fabricated and measured. Comparison between the measurement values and simulation results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed configurations.

Five-particle cluster state particles are used for both detecting eavesdroppers and transmitting secret messages. All of the five-particle cluster states' photons for detection are mixed to the sending sequence to detect eavesdroppers. The detection rate approaches 88% per qubit. The five-particle cluster states needed are only one fifth of the photons in the sending sequence. In this protocol, there is no photon carrying secret information transmitting in quantum channel, and the classical XOR operation which serves as a one-time-pad is used to ensure the security of the protocol. Compared with three photons of each five-particle cluster state as detection photons, the five photons in this study will decrease the five-particle cluster states needed for detection greatly.

The necessary conditions for the appearance of large lateral shift are obtained by theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the validity of these conditions. Further calculation shows that in our system large lateral shift exhibits super-high sensitivity to the thickness change of cladding layer and substrate compared with other prism-waveguide systems with a guiding layer composed of thin metal or other ordinary materials.

The average of the 30 cases shows an obvious increase of anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and a decrease of root mean square error (RMSE) of the geopotential height over global, hemispherical, and tropical zones. Significant amelioration on tropical circulation is displayed within the first-week prediction. The forecasting skill is extended by 0.6day in terms of days of the ACC greater than 0.6 for 500hPa 30case averaged geopotential height on global scale. The 30case mean ACC and RMSE of 500hPa temperature show the increment of 0.2 and -1.6K, respectively, in the first-week prediction. In the case of January 2008, much more reasonable horizontal distribution and vertical structure are achieved in bias-corrected model geopotential height, temperature, relative humidity, and horizontal wind components in comparison to reanalysis data. In spite of a need for additional storage of historical modeling data, the new method does not increase computational costs and therefore is suitable for routine application.

J	Wang, H; Wei, M; Li, GP; Zhou, SH; Zeng, QF				Wang, Hao; Wei, Ming; Li, Guoping; Zhou, Shenghui; Zeng, Qingfeng			Analysis of precipitable water vapor from GPS measurements in Chengdu region: Distribution and evolution characteristics in autumn	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Global positioning system (GPS); Precipitable water vapor; Fast Fourier Transform; Autumn rain; Composite analysis	GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM; RADIOSONDES; METEOROLOGY; MONSOON; NETWORK; FLUXES; CYCLE	The rainfall process of Chengdu region in autumn has obvious regional features. Especially, the night-time rain rate of this region in this season is very high in China. Studying the spatial distribution and temporal variation of regional atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV) is important for our understanding of water vapor related processes, such as rainfall, evaporation, convective activity, among others in this area. Since GPS detection technology has the unique characteristics, such as all-weather, high accuracy, high spatial and temporal resolution as well as low cost, tracking and monitoring techniques on water vapor has achieved rapid developments in recent years. With GPS PWV data at 30-min interval gathered from six GPS observational stations in Chengdu region in two autumns (September 2007 December 2007 and September 2008 December 2008), it is revealed that negative correlations exist between seasonally averaged value of GPS PWV as well as its variation amplitude and local terrain altitude. The variation of PWV in the upper atmosphere of this region results from the water vapor variation from surface to 850 hPa. With the help of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), it is found that the autumn PWV in Chengdu region has a multi-scale feature, which includes a seasonal cycle, 22.5 days period (quasi-tri-weekly oscillation). The variation of the GPS PWV is related to periodical change in the transmitting of the water vapor caused by zonal and meridional wind strengths' change and to the East Asian monsoon system. According to seasonal variation characteristics, we concluded that the middle October is the critical turning point in PWV content. On a shorter time scale, the relationship between autumn PWV and ground meteorological elements was obtained using the composite analysis approach. (C) 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray study of thermal expansion behaviors and Gruneisen parameters of cadmium germanium arsenide crystal over the temperature range 25-450 degrees C	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							P-TYPE CDGEAS2; TETRAGONAL DISTORTION; CHALCOPYRITE CDGEAS2; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SUBLATTICE DISTORTION; SEMICONDUCTORS; COEFFICIENT; DEPENDENCE; ANISOTROPY; GROWTH	X-ray diffraction measurements of tetragonal chalcopyrite cadmium germanium arsenide crystal are carried out over the range 25-450 degrees C. The collected patterns show that the powder neither yields a new phase nor structurally transforms to any other architecture. Accurate lattice parameters (including two lattice constants a and c, cell volume V, axial ratio k, and tetragonal distortion delta) are determined by means of Cohen's least square method. Polynomial fit approximation is adopted to quantitatively describe the temperature dependence of lattice parameters. These results are the groundwork that allows the evaluation of thermal expansion coefficients defined as alpha(R) = R-1 (dR/dT) where R represents lattice parameters. The average thermal expansion coefficients are evaluated, 13.9 x 10(-6) K-1 for alpha(a) and 2.8 x 10(-6) K-1 for alpha(c), respectively. It is also found that alpha(a) increases while ac decreases with temperature, which in consequence brings forth the large anisotropy of thermal expansion between the two main axes (a-axis and c-axis). Detailed discussion reveals that the anisotropy behavior is in tight association with the nearest neighboring bonds. Namely, the thermal expansion coefficient perpendicular to c-axis (alpha(a)) depends to a large extent on the ionic Cd-As bonds, while that parallel to c-axis (alpha(c)) depends on the covalent Ge-As bonds. Finally, the Gruneisen parameters at different temperatures are evaluated and also exhibit anisotropic behavior (gamma(a)>gamma(c)). It is found that gamma(a) is temperature-dependent and increases with temperature, while gamma(c) tends to be temperature-independent. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

It is found that glycerol cylclization with 1,2-propanediamine gave a high total yield of pyrazinyl compounds (>80%) over Cu-TiO2/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst, and cyclization was through the reactions between activated 1,2-propanediamine and the intermediates from glycerol dehydration and oxidation. In addition, the regioselectivity of the pyrazinyl compounds was mainly controlled by the steric hindrance of the substrates during the cyclization process. (C) 2013 Cheng-Hua Xu.

The NRN was first implemented as a strongly detuned SIW resonator. This filter can realize a transmission zero either in the upper or in the lower stopband, and only positive coupling coefficient between each resonator and NRN is required. A third-order SIW filter with the center frequency of 15GHz was constructed and measured, in which bandwidth is 300MHz. The measured results agree well with the simulated results.

Here, we demonstrate a novel type of single-component white-light Sr2-xV2-O-7:Eu-x phosphor with dual-luminescence centers (x = 0-0.24) for white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Due to the charge transfer absorption (V5+O42- -> V4+O42-), the white light spectra they emit consist of both a broad photoluminescence band centered at about 518 nm, which would be from VO4 groups with approximate C-3v symmetry, and a sharp characteristic spectrum (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) at about 611 nm from the doped Eu3+ ion at the Sr2+ sites in the Sr2V2O7 crystal. Moreover, to explain the broad emission spectra of these phosphors, a 10 x 10 energy matrix was successfully established based on an effective operator Hamiltonian, including free ion and crystal field interactions. For the first time, the broad emission spectra for VO4 groups with the approximate C-3v symmetry were calculated using a complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method. The fitting and experimental values are close to each other, powerfully demonstrating the nature of this broad emission and the feasibility of using the complete diagonalization method to study the phosphors for white LEDs.

In the model, the thermal effect of formation was simplified as heat conduction, both the steady heat transmission model in the gas wellbore and the unsteady heat conduction model in the formation were considered, and the pressure effect due to variations in temperature was considered according to the gas equation of state, which links the temperature with the pressure. The finite difference method was used to simulate the solutions of the coupled models. The basic data for X Well (high-temperature-high-pressure gas well, 7,100 m deep) in China were used for case history calculations and a sensitivity analysis was performed for the models. Graphs of the curves for gas pressure and temperature along the depth of the well were plotted with different gradients, injection volumes, and the characteristic of heat transfer in the formation. The results provide technical reliability in well test design in high-temperature-high-pressure gas wells and the dynamic analysis of production.

A solution framework shared by the basic models is built, which makes it convenient to perform the solution process. The finite difference method was adopted to simulate the model. Based on the unified solution framework, the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is employed to solve the large linear equations for the proposed model. The average value is adopted to solve the redundancy of model. The basic data for X Well (a 7,110-m-deep HTHP well in Sichuan, China) were used for case history calculations. Pressure, temperature, and velocity curve graphs along the depth of the well were plotted at different times, intuitively reflecting the flow law and the characteristics of heat transfer along a formation. The results can provide technical reliability in the process of designing well tests for HTHP gas wells and a dynamic analysis of production.

The results show that the introduction of alkali earth elements into the CuCr/Al2O3 catalyst can improve the yield of target 3-MI in the order of Mg < Ca < Sr < Ba. CuCr-Ba/Al2O3 gives rise to a high 3-MI yield of 39.09% and 65.17% in N-2 as a carrier gas and 20%H-2-N-2 mixture gas, respectively. According to catalysts characterization and catalytic tests, the reaction pathway of glycerol cyclization with aniline is proposed, the formation of 3-MI and 3H-indol-3-yl methanol is hypothesized to be through the aniline cyclization with 2,3-hydroxypropanal from glycerol dehydrogenation over Cu-0 centers and basic sites. The acidic sites mainly play a role on activating aniline, which interacts with glycerol to form 3-MI or quinoline through cyclization and dehydration. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This article critically reviews the development and charts the direction of disaster social work in China, since the fateful 2008 Wenchuan earthquake jump-started it dramatically. While disaster social work publications, social work projects and organizations surged, young Chinese social workers felt challenged by poor professional recognition, harsh working conditions and limited prospects and support. However, they have been spurred onwards by the resilience and growth of their clients and professional fulfilment in the daunting process of recovery and reconstruction.

The influence of thermal lens effect on laser output mode and beam quality is discussed by means of transmission matrix optics. The functional relations between the thermal lens focal length and the beam spot size for a piano-concave stable resonator have been calculated numerically. Further experiment on the output beam quality of a laser diode pumped acousto-optic Q-switched laser has been also performed by using a Hartmann-Shack (H-S) wavefront sensor and Zernike mode reconstruction theory. In this way, the PV and RMS values of the wavefront aberration, the first 35 orders Zernike aberrations, can be acquired, and point spread function (PSF) of the beam and the distribution of circle energy can also be obtained by calculation, so the output beam quality can be known fully. The experimental results show that the wavefront aberration of laser is mainly includes the defocus Z(3), the low-order astigmatism Z(4) and Z(5), the spherical aberration Z(10), etc. because of the thermal effect of gain medium, which will lay an experimental foundation for solid-state laser optimum design.

We show the reconstruction of GaAs(001) surface may induce a large stress imbalance between the top and bottom surfaces in a GaAs nanofilm. Driven by such intrinsic surface-stress imbalance, a flat GaAs nanofilm with reconstructed surfaces may self-bend into a nanotube. Our findings suggest the possibility of using ultrathin single layer of GaAs films alone to fabricate pure GaAs nanotubes by manipulating their surface structure. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

We propose the concept of Z*-bifunctions as well as the concept of a feasible set for the mixed equilibrium problem. We prove that the feasible set of the mixed equilibrium problem is a sublattice provided that the associated bifunction is a strictly alpha-monotone Z*-bifunction. We establish the equivalence of the mixed equilibrium problem, the least element problem and the minimization problem under strict alpha-monotonicity and Z*-bifunction conditions.

The legitimate identities of communicating parties are encoded to Bell states which act as a detection sequence. Secret messages are transmitted by using the classical XOR operation, which serves as a one-time-pad. No photon with secret information transmits in the quantum channel. Compared with the protocols proposed by Wang et al. [Acta Phys. Sin. 56 (2007) 673; Opt. Commun. 266 (2006) 732], the protocol in this study implements bidirectional communication and authentication, which defends most attacks including the 'man-in-the-middle' attack efficiently.

We used field pea (Pisum sativum L.) as an example and focused during model development on inputs that are relatively easy to measure. We propose a new algorithm, which uses the aboveground biomass of legume crops to estimate the N-2 fixation rate and have incorporated it into the SPACSYS model. The model was parameterized for field pea and validated against published data from two northern European sites in Dijon, France, and Copenhagen, Denmark. The model simulated the dynamic processes of N-2 fixation, N accumulation, and aboveground dry matter accumulation of field pea. Sensitivity analysis showed that N-2 fixation at Dijon was very sensitive to low temperature and photosynthetic rate and that a larger green leaf area and faster establishment in young pea plants coupled with a high photosynthetic rate would enhance N-2 fixation. We suggest that cultivar breeding aimed at cold resistance and a higher photosynthetic rate could increase N-2 fixation under a similar climate.

The results indicate that the produced pyrazinyl compounds mainly include 6-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrazine (6-HMP), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrazine (5-HMP), 2,6-dimethylpyrazine (2,6-DMP) and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-DMP). Characterization results show that ZnO species in catalysts provide acid-base pairs (Zn2+-O2-), catalysts modified by Ce, Ca, Mn and Mo exhibit spillover phenomenon of hydrogen. According to the effect of Zn amount and modification on the physicochemical and catalytic property of ZnO-based catalysts, the cyclization pathway of glycerol with PDA is proposed. The formation of 2,6- and 2,5-DMP is thought to directly take place over acid sites through glycerol dehydration and further cyclization with the activated PDA, also through hydrodehydration of 6- and 5-HMP, respectively. 6- and 5-HMP are mainly produced by the interaction of activated PDA molecules on acidic sites with dihydroxypropanal or dihydroxyacetone from glycerol dehydrogenation on basic sites.

Finite difference methods with Lax-Friedrichs scheme are improved to solve this set of conservation equations. The basic data of X Well (HTHP well), 7,100 m deep, located in Sichuan basin, Southwest China, is used for case history calculations. Gas pressures, temperature curve graphs along the depth of the well are plotted at different time. Comparing with the results without considering the influence of heat-transmission, the calculating results are more fitting to the values of real measurement. The comparison indicates that the new method is of high accuracy.

Because of its function in resolution enhancement, pulse compression technology has been applied in many kinds of radar such as pulse Doppler weather radar. In pulse compression, sidelobe suppression plays a key role for reducing clutter. In this article, a combination of two sidelobe suppression techniques for pulse compression is proposed. Simulation results show that the combination of the two techniques has better sidelobe suppression effectiveness.

CZA are characterized by surface analysis, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen, oxygen storage capacity (OSC), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that ultrasonic vibration promotes the formation of smaller, more uniform pores in CZA, which is beneficial to the dispersion of Pd species. Ultrasonic vibration can also improve the OSC and uniformity of the composition of CZA on its surface and in bulk. Catalytic tests demonstrate that ultrasonic treatment of CZA widens the window of the full use of oxygen from 0-0.64% to 0-1.16% of Pd-CZA catalysts in the purification of gasohol exhaust, and decreases the light-off temperature of ethanol, propane, and carbon monoxide by 30, 28, and 24 C, respectively. Moreover, the interaction between Pd species and CZA can enhance the reaction of NO with propane and ethanol. (C) 2013, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Using the T213 forecast precipitation data during 2007-2010 and the observed rainfall data in June-August of 2001-2010, characteristics of the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the observed and the T213 EPS forecast precipitation were analyzed. Accordingly, in the light of the continuous differences of the CDFs between model climate and EPS forecasts, a mathematical model of Extreme Precipitation Forecast Index (EPFI) was established and applied to forecast experiments of several extreme rainfall events in China during 17-31 July 2011. The results show that the EPFI has taken advantage of the tail information of the model climatic CDF and provided agreeable forecasts of extreme rainfalls. The EPFI based on the T213 EPS is useful for issuing early warnings of extreme rainfalls 3-7 days in advance. With extension of the forecast lead time, the EPFI becomes less skillful. The results also demonstrate that the rationality of the model climate CDF was of vital importance to the skill of EPFI.

Let f(N) denote the maximum integer k for which there exists a Sidon set {a(i) vertical bar 1 <= i <= k} such that 1 <= a(1) < ... < a(k) <= N. Let the Sidon number F(k) = min{n vertical bar f(n) = k}. For given integer k >= 2, a new Ramsey type number based on Sidon set, Sidon-Ramsey number SR(k), is defined to be the smallest n such that in any k-coloring of {1, ... , n}, there is at least one monochromatic subset which is not a Sidon set. In this paper, upper bounds for some Sidon-Ramsey numbers are given based the known results on Sidon numbers, and lower bounds for some small Sidon-Ramsey numbers are obtained by a random algorithm, among which SR(k) is determined for k is an element of {2, 3, 4, 5}.

In this paper, we comparatively analyzed three typical wetland ecosystems in the Huang-Huai-Hai (3H) Area, to clarify the similarities and differences of each pattern and their change process, as well as their intrinsic correlation mechanism. The satellite images were applied to construct the time-series wetland landscape maps in the last 30 years. Then landscape indices and information entropy metric were used to qualify the pattern and its change process respectively. The results showed that, the wetlands in 3H Area reached 32,632.9 km(2) in 2000, with the natural wetlands of 9,817.9 km(2), occupying 2.21 percent of the whole 3H Area, lower than the average national level. In the last 30 years, the wetland area in 3H Area like all typical wetland subsystems decreased significantly, therein, natural wetland shrinking and artificial wetland increasing presented the different processes of wetland components and drive mechanisms, implying a complex ecological response to pattern evolution in 3H Area. The discussion on the driving forces system indicates that it is very necessary for the recovery and reconstruction of wetland system that regulates hydrological process in line with natural rules. It would provide possible measures to regulate and control the wetland ecosystem in 3H Area.	[Li, A. N.; Deng, W.; Kong, B.; Lei, G.

The results show that the TbCu7-type structural SmCo-based film is obtained with adjusted sputtering parameters. The film exhibits a well preferred crystal orientation and fine microstructure, leading to better in-plane magnetic properties and a magnetization reversal process mainly controlled by domain wall pinning mechanism.

Experimental results show that the sensor response decreases linearly with increasing concentration of analyte. Over a range of methylene blue concentrations from 0 to 0.4 mu mol/mL, the sensor response is linear (R = 0.9496). A concentration variation of 0.1 mu mol/mL can cause an absorbance change of 0.402 dB. Moreover, the optical responses of the same sensing fiber without decoration and modified with silver nanoparticles have also been compared. It can be observed that the output intensity of the Ag nanoparticle-modified sensor is enhanced and the sensitivity is higher. Meanwhile, the absorbance spectra are found to be more sensitive to concentration changes compared to the spectra of the peak wavelength.

Enhanced ultrasound strain imaging using chirp-coded pulse excitation	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Chirp-coded excitation; Strain imaging; SNRe; Strain; Chirp pulse; Elasticity imaging	MEDICAL ULTRASOUND; DELAY ESTIMATION; NOISE-REDUCTION; ELASTOGRAPHY; ELASTICITY; DISPLACEMENT; SIGNALS; SYSTEMS; FILTER	To improve the quality of ultrasound strain imaging, chirp-coded pulse excitation which can enhance echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) was used. The effects of various factors on chirp-coded strain imaging were investigated. Five chirp schemes were designed to investigate the relationship of the range side lobe level (RSLL), main lobe width and energy for strain imaging. We use phase zero method with amplitude modulation correction as strain estimator. The simulation results demonstrate that elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) for chirp pulse decreases with the RSLL and the main lobe width, and that there is a tradeoff among choosing a high-energy tapering window function, reducing the RSLL and narrowing the main lobe in designing a chirp scheme for strain imaging. Chirp pulse performs much better than conventional short pulse in low eSNR, great depth or high attenuation conditions due to the increased eSNR with it. However, in high eSNR condition, the increased eSNR with chirp pulse does not improve SNRe, and the performance of chirp pulse mainly depends on the RSLL and main lobe width. Some chirp schemes still achieve higher SNRe than short pulse in high eSNR condition, because these chirp schemes have narrower main lobe than short pulse and have very low RSLL. Chirp pulse has better lesion detectability and axial strain resolution than short pulse especially in low eSNR condition, because chirp pulse can use shorter window length to get the same SNRe that is achieved by short pulse. Within the scope of five window functions (Tukey, Lanczos, Parzen, Dolph-Chebyshev and Kaiser), we tried to find the optimal chirp scheme which is possibly the combination of chirp pulse excitation with 40% tapered Tukey window and matched compression filter. A commercial elastic phantom experiment on a freehand strain imaging system further validates the superior performance of chirp pulse. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our results show that the MI gain spectra consist of only one spectral region instead of one or two regions in ordinary materials, which may be close to or far from the zero point. Particularly, the spectrum far from the zero point has a high cut-off frequency but a narrow spectral width, which is obviously beneficial to the generation of high-repetition-rate pulse trains. Moreover, MI characteristics here will vary with the normalized angular frequency which can be modified by adjusting the structures of negative-refractive MMs, signifying the controllability of bistable solitons and MI based applications. The effects of saturable nonlinearities are similar to those in ordinary materials.

Characterization results of fresh catalysts indicated that the molybdates modification abated the acidity and the stronger metal-support interaction of Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts, leading to a stable catalytic activity. Especially, NiMoLa-CaMg/gamma-Al2O3 (NiMoLa/CMA) catalyst exhibited no deactivation along with glycerol complete conversion to stable gaseous products containing 69% H-2, 20% CO and 10% CO2 during time-on-stream of 42 h. TPO of spent Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts modified by different components showed that the carbon deposit on acidic sites and NiAl2O4 species led to catalysts deactivation. A lower reforming temperature and a higher LHSV and glycerol content were helpful to the production of syngas from GSR over NiMoLa/CMA; the reverse conditions would improve the formation of H-2.

Methods: The case was a cohort that included 50 patients with AD. For each case subject, 1 control who was of similar age, sex, daily activities (scale of Lawton), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and depression (15-item Geriatrics Depression Scale) was recruited. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3), total tetraiodothyronine (TT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) were detected using radioimmunity. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with AD had significantly lower levels of TRH (67.72 +/- 18.44 vs 78.64 +/- 14.31 pmol/L; t = 2.078; P = 0.036), TSH (3.89 +/- 1.22 vs 4.31 +/- 1.07 mIU/L; t = 2.331; P = 0.024), TT3 (1.44 +/- 0.21 vs 1.63 +/- 0.19 nmol/L; t = 3.761; P = 0.018), TT4 (119.71 +/- 18.64 nmol/L vs 129.54 +/- 23.17 nmol/L; t = 1.328; P = 0.044), FT3 (4.01 +/- 1.27 vs 5.41 +/- 0.99 pmol/L; t = 4.976; P = 0.008), and FT4 (9.84 T 1.56 vs 12.96 +/- 2.20 pmol/L; t = 5.381; P = 0.006). In the AD cases, none of the correlations between TRH and TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4, and between TSH and TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 was significant. However, in the healthy controls, TRH was significantly correlated with TSH (R = 0.020; P = 0.042) and FT4 (R = 0.015; P = 0.018), and TSH was significantly correlated with TT4 (R = 0.209; P = 0.017) and FT4 (R = 0.215; P = 0.009). Conclusion: Alzheimer disease was associated with abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence spectrum (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Under the irradiation of visible light, the photocatalytic properties of various samples were investigated by using degradation of 2, 4-Dichlorophenol solution (2, 4-DCP) as the probe reaction. The results show that the impregnation is a good doping method for the preparation of Sn-Bi2O3. And the valence state of doped Sn is +4, it presents in the form of tin oxide which disperses in the lattice gap or on the surface of bismuth oxide. The phase transformation of bismuth oxide from tetragonal to monoclinic can be effectively inhibited by an appropriate tin doping. Therefore, the photocatalytic activities of tin-doped bismuth oxide are improved as a result of the expanded visible-light region response and a lower recombination rate of electron/hole pairs. Furthermore, the bismuth oxide doped with 2% tin (in molar ratio) has the superior photocatalytic degradation efficiency for 2, 4-DCP.

The PMMA layer swelled when it was in exposure to the vapours, which would in turn bring in an extinction efficiency change in the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum for triangular silver nanoprisms. The LSPR spectral response to chloroform and other vapours was measured by a UV-vis spectrometer in real time. Experiment results showed that the PMMA-LSPR sensor indicated a sensitivity of 4.76 x 10(-5) ppm(-1) and a detection limit of 21 ppm. A fast, stable and reversible response was observed during positive and negative test cycles upon variations of the environment in the gas cell between clean air and saturated chloroform contained air. The PMMA-LSPR sensor also showed good selectivity of chloroform when it was exposed to vapours with different functional groups. It has been demonstrated that plasmonic nanostructures coated with PMMA transduction films can be applied to chloroform sensing and vapour classifying applications.

J	Xue, YJ; Cao, JX; Tian, RF				Xue, Ya-juan; Cao, Jun-xing; Tian, Ren-fei			A comparative study on hydrocarbon detection using three EMD-based time-frequency analysis methods	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Hydrocarbon detection; Empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert-Huang transformation; Normalized Hilbert transform; HU method; Frequency division section	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; S-TRANSFORM; HHT; SPECTRUM; SIGNALS	Due to strong heterogeneity of marine carbonate reservoir, seismic signals become more complex, thus, it is very difficult for hydrocarbon detection. In hydrocarbon reservoir, there usually exist some changes in seismic wave energy and frequency. In their instantaneous spectrums there often exist such phenomena that show the characteristics of attenuation of high frequency energy and enhancement of low-frequency energy. The three EMD-based time-frequency analysis methods' instantaneous spectra all have certain oil and gas detection capability. In this paper, we introduced the Normalized Hilbert Transform (NHT) and a new method named the HU method for hydrocarbon detection. The model results in the Jingbian Gas Field which is located in the eastern Ordos Basin, China, show that NHT and HU methods can be adopted. They also detect the gas-bearing reservoir efficiently as the HHT method does. The three EMD-based methods, that is, the Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) and NHT and HU methods, were respectively applied to analyze the seismic data from the Jingbian Gas Field. Firstly, the seismic signals were decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The second IMF signal (IMF2) of the original seismic section better indicates the distribution of the reservoir. Information on hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir is mainly in IMF2. Secondly, the HHT, NHT and HU methods were respectively used to obtain different frequency division sections from IMF2. Hydrocarbon detection was realized from the energy distribution of the different frequency division sections with these three EMD-based methods. The practical application results show that the three EMD-based methods can all be employed to hydrocarbon detection. Frequency division section of IMF2 using NHT method was better for the seismic data from the Jingbian Gas Field than when using the HHT method and HU method. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the calculations, the crystal field parameters used are estimated from the superposition model with the reported defect structural data obtained from the analyses of superhyperfire interaction constants at the same temperature. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. It appears that the above defect structural data reported in the previous paper are suitable and the diagonalization (of energy matrix) method is effective to the studies of spin-Hamiltonian parameters for 4f(7) ions in crystals.

J	Xu, ZF; Wang, Y; Fan, GZ				Xu, Zhifang; Wang, Yi; Fan, Guangzhou			A Two-Stage Quality Control Method for 2-m Temperature Observations Using Biweight Means and a Progressive EOF Analysis	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTION; RADIOSONDE HEIGHTS; NATIONAL CENTERS; EXAMPLES	The relatively smooth terrain embedded in the numerical model creates an elevation difference against the actual terrain, which in turn makes the quality control of 2-m temperature difficult when forecast or analysis fields are utilized in the process. In this paper, a two-stage quality control method is proposed to address the quality control of 2-m temperature, using biweight means and a progressive EOF analysis. The study is made to improve the quality control of the observed 2-m temperature collected by China and its neighboring areas, based on the 6-h T639 analysis from December 2009 to February 2010. Results show that the proposed two-stage quality control method can secure the needed quality control better, compared with a regular EOF quality control process. The new method is, in particular, able to remove the data that are dotted with consecutive errors but showing small fluctuations. Meanwhile, compared with the lapse rate of temperature method, the biweight mean method is able to remove the systematic bias generated by the model. It turns out that such methods make the distributions of observation increments (the difference between observation and background) more Gaussian-like, which ensures the data quality after the quality control.

J	Wang, J				Wang Jiang			An orientation method and analysis of optical radiation sources based on polyhedron and parallel incident light	SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						optical radiation sources orientation; radiation energy; unit normal vector; polyhedron	POSITION; SUN	The spatial orientation of optical radiation sources has long been the hot topic in the aerospace and the military applications. Current researches mainly focus on the high precision orientation on the partial field of view. Thus, combination of several partial fields of view is required to achieve orientation when the field of view exceeds 180 degrees, which results in the increase of size, weight, power consumption and the cost. By defining radiation energy and direction of the optical radiation source as a vector and applying the cosine law of radiation and vector theorem, it is shown that the vector can be obtained from unit normal vectors on the three un-coplanar surfaces and from the energy projected by the optical radiation source. Based on this, an orientation method with 360 degrees full field of view by a polyhedron is suggested, the mathematical formula for anti-multipath interference is supposed and the error upper limit is derived. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method are validated by measurements and simulation. An accuracy better than 2.866 degrees and 0.574 degrees is achieved when the ratio of measurement error of energy on arbitrary surface and the true value are 5% and 1%, respectively, given the matrix composed of unit normal vectors on three measurement surfaces is orthogonal.

We establish some metric characterizations of Levitin-Polyak alpha-well-posedness by perturbations. Under suitable conditions, we prove that Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations of an inverse variational inequality is equivalent to the existence and uniqueness of its solution. Moreover, we show that Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations of an inverse variational inequality is equivalent to Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations of an enlarged classical variational inequality.

Optimisation of perforation distribution in HTHP vertical wells	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						perforation distribution; HTHP; vertical well; coupling model; production optimisation	HORIZONTAL WELLS; PRESSURE; PRODUCTIVITY; GAS	Due to the variation in pressure drawdown along a well, a pressure drop can occur in a vertical well. A mathematical model is described to study how perforation distribution affects production in a vertical well under steady state inflow. Two types of optimisation problems are established which consider the effects of perforation density on the productivity of a vertical well, where the vertical well production is treated as an objective function and the perforation distribution is considered to be a decision-making variable. A programming algorithm is applied to the vertical well optimisation models established under finite and infinite conductivity, respectively. A 7100?m HTHP (high-temperature-high-pressure) gas well is studied to demonstrate how the model could be used to determine the optimal perforation distribution. The results show that inflow rate profiles are effectively improved through optimising the perforation position and there is a reasonable perforation density distribution.

These pollutants (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and toxaphene) can cause serious interferences during SCCPs analysis with GC-MS. Four main columns packed with different adsorbents, including silica gel, Florisil and alumina, were investigated in this study to determine their performance for separating interfering pollutants from SCCPs. These experimental results suggest that the optimum cleanup procedure uses a silica gel column and a multilayer silica gel-Florisil composite column. This procedure completely separated 22 PCB congeners, 23 OCPs and three toxaphene congeners from SCCPs. However, p,p'-DDD, cis-nonachlor and o,p'-DDD were not completely removed and only 53% of the total toxaphene was removed. This optimized method was successfully and effectively applied for removing interfering pollutants from real soil samples. SCCPs in 17 soil samples from different land use areas within a suburban region were analyzed with the established method. The concentrations of SCCPs in these samples were between 7 and 541 ng g(-1) (mean: 84 ng g(-1)). Similar homologue SCCPs patterns were observed between the soil samples collected from different land use areas. In addition, lower chlorinated (CI6/7) C-10- and C-11- SCCPs were the dominant congeners. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed planar end-fire antenna using two meandered dipole drivers, a folded reflector and a rectangular reflector are presented. The new antenna uses low-cost fabrication. The advantage of the end-fire antenna with meander dipole drivers compared to the conventional quasi-Yagi antenna is a reduction in the length of the driver, which allows closer space for RFID reader. the dimension of the antenna is 80 x 59 mm(2) The antenna has maximum gain of 3.6 dB and VSWR better than 2 around the US RFID bands (902-928MHz).

This study is the first to apply PW to the southwest vortex (SWV) and heavy rain events by using the data from an intensive SWV experiment conducted in summer 2010. The PW derived from the local ground-based GPS network was used in the monitoring and analysis of heavy rain caused by the SWV and the Tibetan Plateau vortex (TPV). Results indicate that an increase in GPS precipitable water (GPS-PW) occurs prior to the development of the TPV and SWV; rainfall occurs mainly during high levels of GPS-PW. The evolution features of GPS-PW in rainfall process caused by different weather systems over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) also differ. These results indicate the reference values for operational applications of GPS-PW data in short-term forecasting and nowcasting of high-impact weather in addition to further investigation of heavy rain caused by the TPV, SWV, and other severe weather systems over the TP.

A new dimensional splitting technique with Eulerian generalized riemann problem (GRP) scheme is applied to solve this set of conservation equations, where Riemann invariants are introduced as the main ingredient to resolve the generalized Riemann problem. The basic data of "X well" (HTHP well), 7100 m deep, located in Southwest China, is used for the case history calculations. Curve graphs of pressures and temperatures along the depth of the well are plotted at different times. The comparison with the results of Lax Friedrichs (LxF) method shows that the calculating results are more fitting to the values of real measurement and the new method is of high accuracy.

J	Tang, TT				Tang, Tingting			Trapping of electromagnetic wave in single-negative metamaterial waveguides	OPTIK			English	Article						Anisotropic; Metamaterial; Slow propagation		We study the trapping properties of transverse magnetic (TM) waves in single-negative metamaterial waveguides including epsilon-negative (ENG) metamaterial and mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial. The relationship between effective refractive index and reduced core width is analyzed when the permittivities of ENG and MNG metamaterials are different, and the inflection on this curve can be regarded as the trapping point. Simulation results show that the properties in an ENG-MNG-ENG metamaterial waveguide are contrary to that in a MNG-ENG-MNG metamaterial waveguide. The sensitivity of trapping point to the change of permittivity makes the single-negative metamaterial waveguides to be an effective method to detect the permittivity variation and can be used as a new kind of waveguide sensor.

Due to the difference of refractive index between two polymer materials, stronger energy coupling can be achieved in dual-layer dielectric tube, and the field confinement is enhanced further. After the coupling of the THz pulse using the dual-layer dielectric tube, the THz pulse increased 5.2 times compared with the single-layer dielectric tube at 1 THz. The ratio of power in polymers, air core and air cladding to the total power versus radiation frequency is presented, respectively. The dispersion and loss characteristic of the air-core dielectric tube is also demonstrated by using experimental method.

J	Deng, CJ				Deng, Changjian			The Robustness Analysis of Wireless Sensor Networks under Uncertain Interference	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							COMPLEX NETWORKS; CONTROLLABILITY	Based on the complex network theory, robustness analysis of condition monitoring wireless sensor network under uncertain interference is present. In the evolution of the topology of sensor networks, the density weighted algebraic connectivity is taken into account, and the phenomenon of removing and repairing the link and node in the network is discussed. Numerical simulation is conducted to explore algebraic connectivity characteristics and network robustness performance. It is found that nodes density has the effect on algebraic connectivity distribution in the random graph model; high density nodes carry more connections, use more throughputs, and may be more unreliable. Moreover, the results show that, when network should be more error tolerant or robust by repairing nodes or adding new nodes, the network should be better clustered in median and high scale wireless sensor networks and be meshing topology in small scale networks.

Our MUX-DEMUX can mix and separate two wavelength channels by use of LHM sandwiched between two RHM straight waveguides of a DC. Its operation is by setting the coupling length of one wavelength to be half of that of the other wavelength, which can be easily realized with quite short devices' length due to the enhancement of the coupling efficiency caused by LHM. At last, the loss effect of LHM is considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Nodes of wireless sensor network are different than wired test units, for they need to be distributed and have some constrains. Then online validation method is important to ensure data of networks to be reliable in important and safety related fields. It has been proved that calculation (such as FFT) can be validated by two orders functional (e. g., energy) in time and frequency domain, and with doing different number of times time-frequency signal analysis, the principle of test signal measurement validation method has been introduced. And with steady state signal, metastable signal, and the nonstationary signal the different online validation method is presented.

It is prevalent in fields such as stock market, ecology, and medical care. Segmentation is a key step to accelerate the processing speed of time-series stream mining. Previous algorithms for segmenting mainly focused on the issue of ameliorating precision instead of paying much attention to the efficiency. Moreover, the performance of these algorithms depends heavily on parameters, which are hard for the users to set. In this paper, we propose PRESEE (parameter-free, real-time, and scalable time-series stream segmenting algorithm), which greatly improves the efficiency of time-series stream segmenting. PRESEE is based on both MDL (minimum description length) and MML (minimum message length) methods, which could segment the data automatically. To evaluate the performance of PRESEE, we conduct several experiments on time-series streams of different types and compare it with the state-of-art algorithm. The empirical results show that PRESEE is very efficient for real-time stream datasets by improving segmenting speed nearly ten times. The novelty of this algorithm is further demonstrated by the application of PRESEE in segmenting real-time stream datasets from ChinaFLUX sensor networks data stream.

Gully initiation could be examined by the S-Delta relationship (S = alpha Lambda(-b)) between the critical slope of the gully head (S) and the upstream drainage area (A). Gully erosion plays an important role in sediment yield and land degradation in the Dry-hot Valley region of Southwest China; however, little research has focused on gully development in this region. This study investigated gully morphology and the critical topographic threshold of permanent gullies in Yuanmou Dry-hot Valley. Data for 36 gully heads were derived from the gully digital elevation model created by high-precision real-time kinematic GPS (RTK GPS). A significant relationship between gully length and volume (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.01) was found to exist, indicating that gully length can be used to estimate the gully erosion rate. Additionally, as vegetation coverage inside the gully increases, the gully morphology tends to be stable. The S-A relationship was S = 0.5195A(-0.0899), while AS(2) values ranged between 4.2 and 758.5 m(2). The low value of constant b (0.0899) indicates that collapse of the gully wall is the dominant process of gully erosion in Yuanmou Dry-hot Valley.

Evaluating the predictive skill of post-processed NCEP GFS ensemble precipitation forecasts in China's Huai river basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						ensemble precipitation forecasting; hydrologic ensemble prediction; Huai river basin; ensemble verification; GFS reforecast product	TIGGE; FLOODS; SYSTEM	The National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) has produced an ensemble meteorological reforecast product by using a fixed version of Global Forecast System (GFS) ensemble prediction system since 1 January 1979. The 15-member ensemble product, with a global coverage at a 2.5 degrees Chi 2.5 degrees spatial resolution and a 14-day lead time, has been used successfully by the River Forecast Centers of the National Weather Service (NWS) to produce basin scale precipitation and temperature ensemble forecasts in the US for several years now. This study evaluates the predictive skill of post-processed ensemble forecasts based on GFS precipitation reforecast in China's Huai river basin. The evaluation is carried out in 15 sub-areas of the Huai river basin and covers the 1/1/1981-31/12/2003 period. The Ensemble Pre-Processing system version 3 (EPP3), developed at NWS, is used to develop joint probability distributions between forecasted ensemble mean precipitation and corresponding observations and to generate individual ensemble members that preserve space-time correlation of the observed precipitation data. Several statistical verification measures are used to quantify the goodness of fit between post-processed (i.e. EPP3 processed) ensemble mean and observation and to assess the ensemble spread. Results indicate that the post-processed forecasts have meaningful predictive skill for the first few days for ensemble daily precipitation forecasts. Predictive skill of ensemble forecasts of cumulative precipitation for lead times up to 14 days are significant. The forecast skill is highly dependent on seasonality, with relatively lower skills seen for wet summer season, when convective storm patterns dominate, as compared with other seasons. The predictive skill of the post-processed ensemble precipitation is much better than the raw forecasts and the climatological ensemble forecasts. The results from this study suggest that the NCEP's GFS reforecasts can be a valuable resource for places other than the US. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A right R-module M is called GI-flat if Tor(1)(R)(M, G) = 0 for every Gorenstein injective left R-module C. It is shown that GI-flat modules lie strictly between flat modules and copure flat modules. Suppose R is an n-FC ring, we prove that a finitely presented right R-module M is GI-flat if and only if M is a cokernel of a Gorenstein flat preenvelope K -> F of a right R-module K with F flat. Then we study GI-flat dimensions of modules and rings. Various results in [6] are developed, some new characterizations of von Neumann regular rings are given.

Since this nonlinear filter based on an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter structure can model higher than second-order and third-order nonlinearities for systems where the nonlinearities are harmonically related, the RSOV filter is more effective in NANC systems with either a linear secondary path (LSP) or a nonlinear secondary path (NSP). Simulation results clearly show that the RSOV adaptive filter using the multichannel structure filtered-error least mean square (FELMS) algorithm can further greatly reduce the computational burdens and is more suitable to eliminate nonlinear distortions in NANC systems than a SOV filter, a bilinear filter and a third-order Volterra (TOV) filter.

Moreover, the surface emissivities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are also important for retrieving surface and atmospheric parameters. In the current study, a retrieval algorithm was developed to retrieve the surface emissivities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The developed algorithm was derived from the radiative transfer model and was first validated using simulated data from a one-dimensional microwave simulator. The simulated results show good precision. Then, the surface emissivities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were retrieved using brightness temperatures from the advanced microwave-scanning radiometer and atmospheric profile data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer. Finally, the features of the time and space distribution of the retrieved results were analyzed. In terms of spatial characteristics, a spatial distribution consistency was found between the retrieved results and surface coverage types of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In terms of time characteristics, the changes in emissivity, which were within 0.01 for every day, were not evident within a one-month time scale. In addition, surface emissivities are sensitive to rainfall. The reasonability of the retrieved results indicates that the algorithm is feasible. A time-series surface emissivity database on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau can be built using the developed algorithm, and then other surface or atmospheric parameters would have high retrieval precision to support related geological research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

FIRST PRINCIPLES STUDY ON ELECTRONIC AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF Al-DOPED gamma-Ge3N4	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B			English	Article						gamma-Ge3N4; doping; optical properties; first principles	PLANE-WAVE; GE3N4; PHASE; SPINEL; NITRIDE	First principles study of the structural, electronic and optical properties of Al-doped gamma-Ge3N4 with different concentration has been reported using the pseudo-potential plane wave method within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The binding energy and the formation energy suggest that Aluminum (Al) impurities prefer to substitute Ge at octahedral sites. Different doping concentrations are considered and the corresponding density of states (DOS) are analyzed. Calculated DOS indicates that there are holes in the top of the valance band after doping, meaning a p-type doping. We study the complex dielectric function, the absorption coefficient, and the electron energy loss spectra. It is demonstrated that for the low Al concentration, the material exhibits the dielectric behavior and for the high Al concentration, the material has possibilities to exhibit some metallic behavior. The gamma-Ge3N4 doped with Al has a much higher static dielectric constant than undoped gamma-Ge3N4, implying its potential applications in electronics and optics.	[Ding, Y. C.; Xiang, A. P.; Zhu, X.

The structure and magnetic properties of Ni0.5Zn0.5ZrxFe2-xO4 ferrite thin films have been investigated. The diffraction peak shifted towards the lower angle and the lattice parameter increased with Zr substitution. The average grain size of Zr-substituted NiZn ferrtie thin films increased with Zr substitution. The saturation magnetization gradually increased with the increase of Zr substitution when x <= 0.10, and decreased when x > 0.10. Meanwhile, the coercivity initially decreased with the increase of Zr substitution when x <= 0.10, and increased when x > 0.10. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, Q; Li, SL; Fu, JJ; Li, GP				Wang Qin; Li Shuanglin; Fu Jianjian; Li Guoping			Formation of the anomalous summer precipitation in east China in 2010 and 1998: A comparison of the impacts of two kinds of El Nio	ACTA METEOROLOGICA SINICA			English	Article						El Nino and El Nino Modoki; summer rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; western North Pacific anticyclone; AGCM sensitivity experiments	INDIAN-OCEAN; ASIAN TELECONNECTION; SST ANOMALIES; ENSO CYCLE; PACIFIC; NINO; MONSOON; CLIMATE; MAINTENANCE; ANTICYCLONE	In the summers of 1998 and 2010, severe floods occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Although an El Nio event took place preceding each of the summer floods, significant differences between the two summer floods and the two El Nio events were identified. The 1997/98 El Nio is a conventional one with strongest warming in the central-eastern Pacific, whereas the 2009/10 event is an El Nio Modoki with strongest warming in the central Pacific. In this study, summer rainfall anomalies (SRA) in the two years were first compared based on the rainfall data at 160 stations in mainland China, and a significant difference in SRA was found. To understand the underlying mechanism for the difference, the atmospheric circulation systems, particularly the western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC), the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), and the low-level air flows, were compared in the two years by using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The results display that the WNPAC was stronger in 2010 than in 1998, along with a northwestward shift, causing weakened southwesterly from the Bay of Bengal to the South China Sea but intensified southerly in eastern China. This resulted in less water vapor transport from the tropical Indian Ocean and the South China Sea but more from the subtropical western Pacific to East Asia. Subsequently, the rainband in 2010 shifted northward. The difference in the WNPAC was caused by the anomalous ascending motion associated with the warming location in the two El Nio events. Furthermore, the role of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) in modulating these differences was investigated by conducting sensitivity experiments using GFDL AM2.1 (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model). Two experiments were performed, one with the observed monthly SST and the other with June SST persisting through the whole summer. The results suggest that the model well reproduced the primary differences in the atmospheric circulation systems in the two years. It is found that the difference in El Nio events has shaped the rainfall patterns in the two years of 1998 and 2010. At last, the case of 2010 was compared with the composite of historical El Nio Modoki events, and the results indicate that the impact of El Nio Modoki varies from case to case and is more complicated than previously revealed.

Simultaneously, the effects of the catalysts composition, calcination temperature and ketalization parameters such as reaction time, acetone/glycerol, catalyst amount and reaction temperature on the ketalization were also investigated in detail. The results showed that the main product for the glycerol ketalization with acetone was solketal with a 5-membered ring along with a small amount of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ol with a 6-membered ring. ZrO2-SiO2 with a Zr/Si molar ratio of 0.5 calcined at 500 degrees C exhibited the best catalytic property in ketalization, gave 90.91% of glycerol conversion and 89.69% of solketal selectivity under the optimum conditions. It was also found that glycerol catalytic ketalization with acetone to solketal was mainly governed by kinetics.

But the effectiveness on land use and cover change (LUCC) has not yet been systematically investigated. We undertook a detailed analysis about land use and cover change between 2000 and 2005 in Sichuan province. Our study mainly utilized remotely sensed data of 2005 China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite II (CBERS II) and 2000 Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) data. Land use and cover change between 2000 and 2005 was visually interpreted by CBERS II with ArcInfo Workstation based on land use and cover database interpreted from TM. Then LUCC was validated by ground truth with global positioning system receivers. Our analysis illustrates that the conservation policies to restore the grassland and forestland were successful to a lesser extent. But more measures to restore the grassland and forestland of Sichuan province have to be taken further in the future. (c) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Utilizing exponential curvature compensation (ECC) and translinear loop circuit (TLC), high-order curvature compensation is realized to reduce temperature drift. Besides, two feedback loops are embedded in the circuit to enhance the stability and to reduce the dependence on supply voltage. Experimental results of the proposed BGR implemented with 1-mu m Bipolar process demonstrate that a temperature coefficient (TC) of 3.2 ppm/degrees C is realized, a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of 60 dB is achieved without filtering capacitors, and the line regulation is better than 0.088 mV/V from 3.5 V to 30 V supply voltage dissipating a maximum supply current of 39 mu A. The active area of the proposed BGR is 700 mu m x 750 mu m. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The morphology of the as-deposited Pbl(2) films is typically and highly oriented polycrystalline structure, made up of microcrystal platelets upright on the substrate plane. Two techniques including the surface mechanical cutting and after-growth cadmium telluride coating were employed to improve the films' surface properties. It was shown that both of the film surface treatment methods markedly decreased the dark current of Pbl(2) films. The photo-to-dark current ratio of about 2.05 under Am-241 gamma-ray source with activity of 2.78 mu Ci irradiation was obtained from the film treated using both surface cutting and after-growth CdTe coating. Charge transport characteristics of these films were measured and the hole mobility 7.7 x 10(-2)-1.67 x 10(-1) cm(2)/V s was estimated. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structures, elastic properties, intrinsic hardness and Debye temperature of the new ternary nitrides (CSi2N4 and SiC2N4) are studied by first-principles calculations based on the density-functional theory. The elastic constants C-ij of these new ternary nitrides are obtained using the stressstrain method. Derived elastic constants, such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson coefficient and brittle/ductile behavior are estimated using VoigtReussHill theories. The results indicate that gamma-CSi2N4, p-CSi2N4 and p-SiC2N4 are mechanically stable. Calculated B/G values and Poisson's ratio for gamma-CSi2N4, p-CSi2N4 and p-SiC(2)N4 indicate that these materials are brittle. The calculated anisotropy parameters indicate that gamma-CSi2N4 shows weak anisotropy and p-SiC2N4 and p-CSi2N4 have larger anisotropy. Based on the microscopic hardness model, p-CSi2N4, p-SiC2N4 and gamma-CSi2N4 should be viewed as superhard materials with some peculiar mechanical properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of catalyst preparation and acetalization parameters such as reaction time, acetone/glycerol ratio, catalyst amount and reaction temperature on acetalization are investigated simultaneously. Pyridine adsorption results indicate that Ti-Si mixed oxides naturally only consist of Lewis acidic sites. The results of catalyst preparation and characterization show that Bronsted acidic sites can be produced after Ti-Si mixed oxides adsorb water molecules, and TiO2-SiO2 (Si/Ti = 1) calcined at 550 A degrees C exhibits the most total acidic density leading to the highest catalytic property in glycerol acetalization. The glycerol catalytic acetalization mainly occurs on the Bronsted acidic sites. The effects of acetalization parameters indicate that the formation of the main product 5-membered ring ketal 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-yl methanol (about 90 %) is governed by kinetics. About 95 % glycerol conversion in acetalization is obtained under the optimum conditions.

We analyze the association between cohesive subgraph visualization (CSV) plot and k-clique community detection. Then, we propose an algorithm named LargeKCliqueCSV to detect large k-clique communities, which reduces search space through CSV plot. At last, we conduct experiments on Stock Market Data datasets. Experimental results show the good scalability of our algorithm comparing with the state-of-art methods Clique Percolation Method and Sequential Clique Percolation algorithm when k grows large.

Trivalent europium-doped strontium molybdate red phosphors in white light-emitting diodes: Synthesis, photophysical properties and theoretical calculations	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						White LED; Fluorescent spectra; Complete diagonalization method, SrMoO4:Eu3+	TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SINGLE-CRYSTAL; LUMINESCENCE; PARAMETERS; IONS; EU3+; MODEL	Eu3+-doped strontium molybdate red phosphors (Sr1-xMoO4:Eu-x (x = 0.01-0.2)) for white light-emitting diodes (LED) were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The fluorescent intensities of the as-prepared phosphors were remarkably improved. The excitation and emission spectra demonstrate that these phosphors can be effectively excited by the near-UV light (395 nm) and blue light (466 nm). Their emitted red light peaks are located at 613 nm, and the highest quantum yield value (eta) of the as-grown red phosphor, which is 95.85%, is much higher than that of commercial red phosphor (77.53%). These red phosphors plus commercial yellow powers (1:10) were successfully packaged with the GaN-based blue chips on a piranha frame by epoxy resins. The encapsulated white LED lamps show high performance of the CIE chromaticity coordinates and color temperatures. Moreover, to explain the fluorescent spectra of these phosphors, a complete 3003 x 3003 energy matrix was successfully built by an effective operator Hamiltonian including free ion and crystal field interactions. For the first time, the fluorescent spectra for Eu3+ ion at the tetragonal (S-4) Sr2+ site of SrMoO4 crystal were calculated from a complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method. The fitting values are close to the experimental results. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In experiments, REDD1 messenger RNA and protein expression levels throughout the gestation were determined using immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. Furthermore, REDD1 protein levels in placenta were also compared between normal outcome pregnancies (n = 20, GA >37 weeks) and PE pregnancies (n = 29), which includes early onset PE; n = 15, GA: 24-33 weeks) and late onset PE (n = 14, GA: 34-39 weeks) by Western blot. As a result, REDD1 protein was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of trophoblasts. Moreover, higher levels of REDD1 were found not only at earlier gestational stage but also in the PE groups (P < .05). In conclusion, REDD1 may play an important role in maintaining the normal function of placenta during various stages of gestation and predicted that the increase in REDD1 is related to the pathogenesis of PE.

Flapwise dynamic response of a wind turbine blade in super-harmonic resonance	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							TAPERED TIMOSHENKO BEAMS; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; ROTATING BEAMS; INSTABILITY; REDUCTION	The flapwise dynamic response of a rotating wind turbine blade in super-harmonic resonance is studied in this paper, while the blade is subjected to unsteady aerodynamic loads. Coupled extensional-bending vibrations of the blade are considered; the governing equations which are coupled through linear and quadratic terms arising from rotating and geometric effects respectively are obtained by applying the Hamiltonian principle. The lth flapwise linear frequency and the rotational frequency are assumed to be in an almost 3:1 ratio, so super-harmonic resonance occurs when this linear frequency is close to the associated nonlinear frequency. By using the first n, no less than l, linear uncamped model functions as a functional basis and applying the Galerkin procedure, a 2n-degree-of-freedom discrete model with quadratic and cubic terms owing to geometric effect is derived. The generalized displacements corresponding to the discrete system are disintegrated into static and dynamic displacements. Perturbation method is adopted to get analytical solutions of the discrete dynamic system for positive aerodynamic dampings. The coning angle and the inflow ratio are chosen as two control parameters to analyze aeroelastic behaviors of the blade. By assuming that the static and dynamic displacements are of the same order in resonance region, and there is no other resonance except the super-harmonic resonance, the multiple-scales method is employed to cotain a set of amplitude modulation equations whose coefficients depend on two control parameters. The frequency-response equation is derived from the amplitude modulation equations. A method to estimate the functional dependence of the detuning parameter on two control parameters is introduced. The amplitude of the harmonic response is derived from the frequency-response equation after knowing the detuning parameter. Then he stability of the steady motion with respect to control parameters can be determined. The evolution of the dynamic response of the resonance mode with decreasing aerodynamic damping is discussed by means of both perturbation and numerical methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By this iterative method on the selection of special initial matrices, we can obtain the minimum Frobenius norm solutions or the minimum Frobenius norm least-squares solutions over some constrained matrices, such as symmetric, generalized bisymmetric and (R,S)-symmetric matrices. Meanwhile, the optimal approximate solutions to the given matrices can be derived by solving the corresponding new generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations.

Based on fieldwork, we found the Earthquake heavily destroyed the ecosystem including ecological subsystem such as forests, meadows, farmland and environmental factors such as the climate, mountains, water and forests. The ecosystem became a complex, non-linear, autonomous living system and its carbon equilibrium was broken. The aim of this paper is to explore a low carbon restoration pattern to rebuild equilibrium. Autopoiesis is the natural ability of ecosystem which will self recover after disaster but what form and how long is uncertain. The study analyzed the ecosystem with elements of equilibrium methodology and concluded that in the process of ecological restoration, if ecological cycle was controlled by increasing carbon sink and decreasing carbon source, the ecosystem would get a new equilibrium quickly and keep sustainable development.

The calculated lattice parameters, elastic constants of Si2N2O and Ge2N2O using PBEsol function are consisted with the experimental data and other calculated values. The full set elastic constants of the orthorhombic-A(2)N(2)O (A=C, Si and Ge) are calculated by stress-strain method. The mechanical moduli (bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus) are evaluated by the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approach. The orthorhombic-C2N2O exhibits larger mechanical moduli than the other two structures. The hardness of orthorhombic-A(2)N(2)O (A=C, Si and Ge) is evaluated according to the intrinsic hardness calculation theory of covalent crystal relying on Mulliken overlap population. The results indicate that the orthorhombic-C2N2O is a super hard material. Furthermore, the mechanical anisotropy, Debye temperature and minimum thermal conductivity of the orthorhombic-A(2)N(2)O (A=C, Si and Ge) have been estimated by empirical methods. The orthorhombic-Ge2N2O shows the lowest thermal conductivity, which may have useful applications as gas turbine engines and diesel engines. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We use the empirical equations of state (EOS) to investigate the lattice properties and bulk modulus. It is found that the calculated lattice constants and bulk modulus are in good agreement with previous calculations. And the full set elastic constants are calculated using the stress-strain method. The Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation is used to evaluate the mechanical moduli. The elastic constants show that the two phases of C11N4 are mechanically stable. The tetragonal-C11N4 (alpha-C11N4) exhibits larger mechanical moduli than the orthorhombic-C11N4 (beta-C11N4). The mechanical anisotropy is calculated of several different anisotropic indexes and factors, such as universal anisotropic index (A(U)), the percent anisotropy (A(G) and A(B)) and shear anisotropic factors (A(1), A(2) and A(3)). Furthermore, the hardness of alpha-C11N4 and beta-C11N4 are evaluated according to the intrinsic hardness calculation theory. alpha-C11N4 is predicted to be a superhard material with the Vickers hardness of 67.17 GPa, which is slightly higher than that of the cubic boron nitride. And the beta-C11N4 is also a superhard material with the calculated Vickers hardness of 45.63 GPa. C11N4 can be considered as candidate superhard compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The doping quantity of lanthanum, crystalline phase structures and spectral properties of as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The enhanced visible-light activity was tested by the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). Results of XRD show that appropriate amounts of lanthanum adulteration can effectively prevent the phase transformation of Bi2O3 from tetragonal to monoclinic. UV-Vis DRS results indicate an extension of light absorption into the visible region (higher than 550 nm). The doped lanthanum partially substitutes bismuth in the lattice of Bi2O3, which exists in the form of Bi-O-La chemical bond. And a new complex metal oxide compound (La0.176Bi0.824O1.5) appears in the catalysts, which could inhibit the recombination between photoelectrons and holes, leading to enhanced photocatalytic quantum efficiency. Furthermore, it is found that Bi2O3 doped with lanthanum of 3% (in mole ratio) has the superior photocatalytic performance for 2,4-DCP.

Among all samples, the relative density changes in the range of 94.9-96.4% and reaches the highest value in the composite with 30 wt% Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT). When BIT content increases from 0 to 90 wt%, the magnetic and dielectric properties show different change trends: the permeability (real part) at 1 MHz reaches the maximum 170 in the composite with 10 wt% BIT at first, and then gradually decreases from 170 to 1.4, while the saturation magnetization decrease from 2.85 x 10(5) A/m to 1.6 x 10(4) A/m; the dielectric loss tangent obtains a maximum value about 0.47 in the composite with 10 wt% BIT at first, and then decreases sharply, while the permittivity (real part) at 1 MHz increases from 8.8 to 100.3. The Maxwell Garnett mixing rule was used to predict the magnetic and dielectric properties of the composites with different assumptions. The calculated results basing on BIT matrix were more approximate to the measured in comparison to that basing on ferrite matrix. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The as-synthesized samples were characterized and analyzed by XRD, FT-ER, XPS, UV-Vis and PL. The results indicate that the undoped Bi2O3 displays a single monoclinic phase. While the N-doped Bi2O3 samples are mixed crystals, which were composed of tetragonal beta-Bi2O3 and Bi5O7NO3 phases. The oxygen in the lattice of Bi2O3 is partially substituted by nitrogen atom, existed stably in the form of Bi-N bond. Meanwhile, nitrogen dopant promotes the formation of beta-Bi2O3 phase. Compared with undoped Bi2O3, the light absorption property of N-doped Bi2O3 has apparently extended into visible light region and the fluorescence intensity decreases evidently. Furthermore, the photodegradation performance of methyl orange shows that N-doped Bi2O3 samples have excellent visible light photocatalytic activity.

The elastic constants of four Si2N2O structures are obtained using the stress-strain method. The mechanical moduli (bulk modulus, Young's modulus, and shear modulus) are evaluated using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approach. It is found that the tetragonal Si2N2O exhibits a larger mechanical modulus than the other phases. Some empirical methods are used to calculate the Vickers hardnesses of the Si2N2O structures. We further estimate the Vickers hardnesses of the four Si2N2O crystal structures, suggesting all Si2N2O phases are not the superhard compounds. The results imply that the tetragonal Si2N2O is the hardest phase. The hardness of tetragonal Si2N2O is 31.52 GPa which is close to values of beta-Si3N4 and gamma-Si3N4.

Based on mutual temperature compensation of the threshold voltages of nMOS and pMOS transistors, a temperature-insensitive voltage reference with significant reduction in temperature dependence of mobility is achieved without using subthreshold characteristics. The problem of a fixed voltage reference value is also avoided by different parameter design. Experimental results of the proposed voltage reference implemented with a 0.35-mu m CMOS process demonstrate that the output of the voltage reference is 847.5 mV, a temperature coefficient of 11.8 ppm/degrees C with a temperature range from 0 degrees C to 130 degrees C is obtained at 3-V power supply, a power-supply noise attenuation of 72 dB is achieved without any filtering capacitor, and the line regulation is better than 0.185 mV/V from 1.8-V to 4.5-V supply voltage dissipating a maximum supply current of 8 mu A. The active area of the presented voltage reference is 90 mu m x 120 mu m.

In the method, a 56 x 56 energy matrix concerning the ground multiplet S-8(7/2) and the excited multiplets L-8(7/2) (where L = P, D, F, G, H, I) for 4f(7) ions at a tetragonal crystal field and under an external magnetic field is constructed and used. The crystal field parameters B-k(q) in the energy matrix are obtained from the superposition model. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The defect structure (characterized by the angular distortion Delta theta) of the Gd3+ impurity centers in YBa2Cu3O6+y is also acquired from the calculation. The results are discussed.

Effect of different underlayers on the crystal structure and magnetic properties were investigated. The results show that the Al, Cu, and Ag underlayers can not make positive contributions on the crystal structure and magnetic properties. This is very different for the films with Mo and Cr underlayers, which exhibit well preferred orientation growth and improved magnetic properties. Especially, large intrinsic coercivity of 3.52 kOe and maximum energy product of 6.31 MGOe are observed for the films with Mo underlayers, which are found to be suitable for use in developed micro-magnetic devices from the high temperature aging results.

In this study, we report that the EASM has been recovering since the early 1990s, although its strength is still less than in previous decades (averaged over the period 1965-1980). Following the recovery of the EASM, there has been a tendency in the last decade toward northward-moving rainbands and excessive rainfall in the Huaihe River valley (110A degrees-120A degrees E, 30A degrees-35A degrees N). There is evidence suggesting that the strengthening EASM since the early 1990s is linked to interdecadal change of land-sea thermal contrast.

In this paper, a novel fiber tractography technique, globally optimized fiber tracking and hierarchical fiber clustering, is presented. The proposed technique uses k-means clustering in conjunction with modified Hubert statistic to partition fiber pathways, which are evaluated with simultaneous consideration of consistency with underlying DTI data and smoothness of fiber courses in the sense of global optimality, into individual anatomically coherent fiber bundles. In each resulting bundle, fibers are sampled, perturbed and clustered iteratively to approach the optimal solution. The global optimality allows the proposed technique to resist local image artifacts and to possess inherent capabilities of handling complex fiber structures and tracking fibers between gray matter regions. The embedded hierarchical clustering allows multiple fiber bundles between a pair of seed regions to be naturally reconstructed and partitioned. The integration of globally optimized tracking and hierarchical clustering greatly benefits applications of DTI-based fiber tractography to clinical studies, particularly to studies of structure-function relations of the complex neural network of the human. Experiments with synthetic and in vivo human DTI data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique in tracking complex fiber structures, thus proving its significant advantages over traditionally used streamline fiber tractography.

It is shown that there exist critical values d(c) and alpha(c) for different combination schemes. For 0 < d <= d(c) or 0 < alpha <= alpha(c) the Gaussian-like intensity profile takes place in the geometrical focal plane, so that the transverse gradient force can act as a restoration force to provide stable equilibrium point. For d > d(0,c) or sigma(0) > sigma(0,c) the transverse gradient force can not trap metallic Rayleigh particles. For 0 < d <= d(c) the intensity, the radiation force, the trapping stiffness, and the longitudinal trapping range of coherently combined beam are larger than those of incoherently combined beams. Therefore, a suitable choice of combination scheme, smaller off-axis distance and coherence parameter is beneficial to trapping metallic Rayleigh particles in the use of combined beams.

J	Zhu, JM				Zhu Jing-Min			Entanglement property in matrix product spin systems	CHINESE PHYSICS C			English	Article						matrix product state (MPS); entanglement; von Neumann entropy	QUANTUM PHASE-TRANSITIONS; MULTIPLE ENTROPY MEASURES; PURE STATES; WITNESS	We study the entanglement property in matrix product spin-ring systems systemically by von Neumann entropy. We find that: (i) the Hilbert space dimension of one spin determines the upper limit of the maximal value of the entanglement entropy of one spin, while for multiparticle entanglement entropy, the upper limit of the maximal value depends on the dimension of the representation matrices. Based on the theory, we can realize the maximum of the entanglement entropy of any spin block by choosing the appropriate control parameter values. (ii) When the entanglement entropy of one spin takes its maximal value, the entanglement entropy of an asymptotically large spin block, i.e. the renormalization group fixed point, is not likely to take its maximal value, and so only the entanglement entropy S-n of a spin block that varies with size n can fully characterize the spin-ring entanglement feature. Finally, we give the entanglement dynamics, i.e. the Hamiltonian of the matrix product system.

The catastrophic earthquake not only created tremendous changes in the external environment, but also caused stress and difficulties for the people in the affected areas which were felt long after the event. In this study, we attempt to clarify the correlation between coping strategies and psychological wellbeing among survivors across sex and levels of exposure. Method: A total of 2080 survivors from 19 counties freely participated in the survey which used selfreport psychological questionnaires, the Short Form12, version 2 Scale and Coping Scales. We estimated regression models to identify the coping factors associated with the presence of mental symptoms after the disaster. Results: Four main factors (middle-age, low educational level, low monthly income, and high exposure) were significantly related to poor health. Highly exposed survivors tended to problem-avoidance, fantasy, self-blame and seeking assistance, which was significantly different to those lowly exposed. Women tended to be more vulnerable than men and exhibited problem-avoidance and self-blame. Six coping styles were significant determinants and predicted 64.2% of health. Conclusion: Post-disaster mental health recovery intervention, including early identification, ongoing monitoring, sustained psychosocial support and more mental health services, are required for the high-risk population, especially for women.

The results show that the apparent activation energy for crystallization is observed as 173.7 kJ/mol, and the local activation energy for crystallization decreases with increasing crystal phase transformation fraction in non-isothermal crystallization. For isothermal crystallization, the apparent activation energy for crystallization is 159.8 kJ/mol. The local activation energy for crystallization exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the crystal phase transformation fraction. The crystallization mechanism is obtained from the investigation of Avrami exponent and microstructure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that quite different mathematical expressions from those of initial Gaussian pulses are obtained. Moreover, the wave breaking here will be more intense for more oscillation peaks will appear in the pulse wings and the breaking process will last longer distance before rectangle-shaped pulses form at last. However, the quintic nonlinearity plays a similar role to the case of initial Gaussian pulses in developing chirps and bringing forward or retarding the wave breaking. The wave breaking distance will also decrease with increase of the quintic nonlinearity and the soliton order. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using a frustrated total internal reflection structure composed of glass-MAP-metamaterial-MAP-glass, the flat-top tunneling band can be realized and shifted to other frequency bands by adjusting the permeability of MAP to satisfy permeability and incident angle match conditions. In addition, our filter has a more robust flat-top tunneling band compared with other flat-top filters when the thickness of every layer changes. At last, the effect of metamaterial loss is considered.

The summer daily precipitation records of 158 meteorological raingauges are applied over the HB during the period of 1980-2007, and the precipitation samples are classified into unconditional rainy days and conditional rainy days which have a dry or wet preceding day over the years. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and the comparison between the Gamma distribution probability density function and the sample frequency of daily precipitation records of five representative stations are conducted and analyzed. The results show that the HB is a "scale-dominated" region characterized with large scale parameters of the Gamma distribution, where rainfall is likely to exhibit large variability leading to extreme wet or dry conditions. Further analysis shows that the confluence area of Sha River and Ying River within the stream between Wangjiaba dam and Bengbu station, the eastern branch of the Huaihe River (HR) between Bengbu station and the Hongze Lake, and the downstream area below the Hongze Lake, are all the areas with a high probability of large precipitation under the condition that the rainy day has a dry preceding day. The eastern part of the Yishu River watershed and the region near Wangjiaba darn are the center of a high probability of large precipitation under the condition that the rainy day has a wet preceding day. Moreover, the day following a dry preceding day has a greater probability of small rainfall. The probability distribution of summer daily precipitation of the HB is significantly skewed. The probability distribution could be more applicable if the rainy days are preceded by a dry or wet day.

The proposed antenna occupies only a small footprint of 15 x 25 mm(2) on one corner of the circuit board and a protruded ground of 10 x 15 mm(2) is displaced with close proximity to the antenna portion. The proposed antenna has a very simple structure which is composed of two separate strips: a loop strip with an inserted chip inductor and an L-shaped feeding strip. The loop strip is shorted to the ground and generates a resonant mode at 890MHz to cover the GSM850/900 band (824-960 MHz) while the feeding strip contributes to the GSM1800/1900/UMTS210 band (1710-2170 MHz) operation. With such a small size, the proposed antenna can achieve compact integration on the circuit board of the mobile phone, thus the proposed scheme is quite suitable for the slim mobile phone application. Good agreements between simulations and measurements are obtained. Details of proposed antenna are presented and some key parameters are studied.

It is shown that a left R-module M over any ring R is GI-injective if and only if M is a kernel of a Gorenstein injective precover f : A --> B of a left R-module B with A injective. Suppose R is an n-Gorenstein ring, we prove that a left R-module M is GI-injective if and only if M is a direct sum of an injective left R-module and a reduced GI-injective left R-module. Then we investigate GI-injective dimensions of modules and rings. As applications, some new characterizations of the weak (Gorenstein) global dimension of coherent rings are given.

The selection of different subband coefficients obtained by the NSCT decomposition is critical to image fusion. So, in this paper, firstly, original images are decomposed into different frequency subband coefficients by NSCT. Secondly, the selection of the low-frequency subband coefficients and the bandpass directional subband coefficients is discussed in detail. For the selection of the low-frequency subband coefficients, the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method is adopted. For the selection of bandpass directional subband coefficients, a regional cross-gradient method that selects the coefficients according to the minimum of the regional cross-gradient is proposed. Finally, the fused image is obtained by performing the inverse NSCT on the combined coefficients. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion algorithm can achieve significant results in getting a new image where all parts are sharp.

The proposed BGR utilises a differential amplifier with an offset voltage proportional to absolute temperature to compensate the temperature drift of emitter-base voltage. Besides, a self-biased current source with feedback is used to provide the bias current of the BGR core for reducing current mirror errors dependent on supply voltage and temperature further. Verification results of the proposed BGR implemented with 0.35 mu m CMOS process demonstrate that a temperature coefficient of 10.2 ppm/degrees C is realised with temperature ranging from -40 degrees C to 140 degrees C, and a power supply rejection ratio of 58 dB is achieved with a maximum supply current of 27 mu A. The active area of the presented BGR is 160 x 140 mu m(2).

We prove that there only exist two types of bounded travelling waves, the monotone kink waves and the oscillatory kink waves. For the oscillatory kink wave, the regularity of its maximum oscillation amplitude changing with parameters is discussed. Exact expressions of the monotone kink waves and approximate expressions of the oscillatory ones are obtained in some special cases. Furthermore, all bounded travelling waves of the RLW-Burgers equation under different parameter conditions are identified and the evolution of them is discussed to explain the corresponding physical phenomena.

A left R-module M (resp., right R-module N) is called n-FI-injective (resp., n-FI-flat) if Ext(R)(1)(F, M) = 0 (resp., Tor(1)(R)(N, F) = 0) for any F is an element of FIn. It is proved that a left R-module M is n-FI-injective if and only if M is a kernel of an FIn-precover f : A -> B of a left R-module B with A injective. For a left coherent ring R, it is shown that a finitely presented right R-module M is n-FI-flat if and only if M is a cokernel of an F-n-preenvelope K -> F of a right R-module K with F flat. Some known results are extended. Finally, we investigate n-FI-injective and n-FI-flat modules over left coherent rings with FP-id(R-R) <= n.

Predicting the Dryness Fraction of Gas, Pressure, and Temperature for Steam Injection Based on Unsteady Heat Transmission	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						coupled system; finite difference method; injection well; Runge-Kutta method; sensitivity analysis	FIELD	Presently, a coupled system model of differential equations is proposed to predict the dryness fraction of gas, the pressure, the temperature in the wellbore, and the temperature in the stratum. In this model, the authors consider the energy loss caused by the friction of the stem flow and the unsteady heat transmission, which caused the change of the temperature in the stratum, from the second interface to the stratum. Then the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the finite difference method are interactively applied to solve the model. Finally, a high-temperature high-pressure gas well (7,100 m depth) in the Sichuan province of China is used to check the efficiency of the proposed model and the algorithms.

The results showed that the Mn-modified SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio 15.84 and 6% Mn gave the highest catalytic activity for formation of 2-PMol (53.1%) and 2-MP (42.9%). Mn species could cause the modulation of the acidic species of catalysts, improving the glycerol cyclocondensation with ED to 2-PMol, and also acted as the catalytic centers for the hydrodehydration of 2-PMol to 2-MP. However, too many strong acidic sites could lead to ED self-cyclocondensation to form a by-product pyrazine. The optimum temperature was tested to be 380 degrees C for the cyclocondensation over a 6%Mn-SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

By utilising the subthreshold and substrate currents generated by only a dynamic-threshold MOSFET (DTMOS), a novel mutative curvature-compensation has been realised to reduce the temperature drift within the full temperature range. The proposed mutative curvature-compensation is achieved by a high-order compensation term with changed temperature characteristics in the temperature range. Verification results of the proposed BGR implemented with 0.25 mu m BiCMOS process demonstrate that the proposed BGR can operate down to 1.6V supply voltage and consume a maximum supply current of 17 mu A. A temperature coefficient of 5.2 ppm/degrees C is realised with temperature ranging from -65 degrees C to 140 degrees C, and a power supply rejection ratio of 57.7 dB is achieved without filtering capacitors.

A left R-module M is called Gorenstein FP-injective if there is an exact sequence ... -> E-1 -> E-0 -> E-0 -> E-1 -> ... of FP-injective left R-modules with M = ker (E-0 -> E-1) such that Hom(R)(P, -) leaves the sequence exact whenever P is a finitely presented left R-module with pd(R)(P) < infinity. Some properties of Gorenstein FP-injective modules are obtained. Several well-known classes of rings are characterized in terms of Gorenstein FP-injective modules.

J	Feng, XY; Wang, SG				Feng, Xinyuan; Wang, Shigong			Influence of different weather events on concentrations of particulate matter with different sizes in Lanzhou, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						particulate matter with different sizes; dust event; precipitation event; cold-front event	SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; DUST; AEROSOLS; PM10; CITY; AIR	The formation and development of weather events has a great impact on the diffusion, accumulation and transport of air pollutants, and causes great changes in the particulate pollution level. It is very important to study their influence on particulate pollution. Lanzhou is one of the most particulate-polluted cities in China and even in the world. Particulate matter (PM) including TSP, PM>10, PM2.5-10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations were simultaneously measured during 2005-2007 in Lanzhou to evaluate the influence of three kinds of weather events - dust, precipitation and cold front - on the concentrations of PM with different sizes and detect the temporal evolution. The main results are as follows: (1) the PM pollution in Lanzhou during dust events was very heavy and the rate of increase in the concentration of PM2.5-10 was the highest of the five kinds of particles. During dust-storm events, the highest peaks of the concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM1.0) occurred 3 hr later than those of coarse particles (PM>10 and PM2.5-10). (2) The major effect of precipitation events on PM is wet scavenging. The scavenging rates of particles were closely associated with the kinds of precipitation events. The scavenging rates of TSP, PM>10 and PM2.5-10 by convective precipitation were several times as high as those caused by frontal precipitation for the same precipitation amount, the reason being the different formation mechanism and precipitation characteristics of the two kinds of precipitation. Moreover, there exists a limiting value for the scavenging rates of particles by precipitation. (3) The major effect of cold-front events on particles is clearance. However, during cold-front passages, the PM concentrations could sometimes rise first and decrease afterwards, which is the critical difference in the influence of cold fronts on the concentrations of particulate pollutants vs. gaseous pollutants.

They present an algorithm solution model, along with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The basic data from a high temperature-high pressure gas wells (7,100 m deep) in China were used for a case history calculation and a sensitivity analysis was also carried out. The gas flow law and the characteristic of heat transfer in formation were intuitively reflected in the algorithm and simulation. The results provide some technical insight in the process of designing well testing in high temperature-high pressure gas wells and the dynamic analysis of injection.

The results indicated that the CTA-treated films exhibited poor permanent magnetic properties, and a low intrinsic coercivity of 72.8 kA/m was observed. Wide hysteresis loop was obtained for the RRTA-treated films, providing better permanent magnetic properties. The intrinsic coercivity reached 312.0 kA/m. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results, the magnetic properties of the CTA-treated films and RRTA-treated films were found to be correlated with the crystal structure and microstructure, which were strongly determined by the annealing treatment. CTA treatment led to poor crystallization effects for the films, and a rough surface (RMS=3.47 nm and P-V=35.42 nm) and large grain size of 92.7 nm were observed correspondingly. However, the RRTA treatment exhibited great contributions on the crystallization of the films, which is accountable for the smooth surface (RMS=2.047 nm and P-V=16.43 nm) and fine grain size of 60.8 nm.

J	Wu, SL; Li, CX				Wu, Shi-Liang; Li, Cui-Xia			A Modified SSOR Preconditioning Strategy for Helmholtz Equations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							INDEFINITE LINEAR-SYSTEMS; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; LARGE CAVITY; ALGORITHM; COMPLEX; FACTORIZATION	The finite difference method discretization of Helmholtz equations usually leads to the large spare linear systems. Since the coefficient matrix is frequently indefinite, it is difficult to solve iteratively. In this paper, a modified symmetric successive overrelaxation (MSSOR) preconditioning strategy is constructed based on the coefficient matrix and employed to speed up the convergence rate of iterative methods. The idea is to increase the values of diagonal elements of the coefficient matrix to obtain better preconditioners for the original linear systems. Compared with SSOR preconditioner, MSSOR preconditioner has no additional computational cost to improve the convergence rate of iterative methods. Numerical results demonstrate that this method can reduce both the number of iterations and the computational time significantly with low cost for construction and implementation of preconditioners.

It is proved that a monotone bifunction variational inequality has a nonempty and bounded solution set if and only if it is strictly feasible. Stable solvability of the bifunction variational inequality is discussed under strict feasibility assumption when the domain set is perturbed. Our results generalize earlier results on the classical variational inequality to the case of the bifunction variational inequality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The structure and magnetic properties of Ni(0.5)Zn(0.5)Co(x)Fe(2-x)O(4) ferrite thin films have been investigated. The diffraction peak shifted towards the lower angle and the lattice parameter increased with Co substitution. There is little influence of Co substitution on the microstructure of NiZn ferrite thin films. The saturation magnetization gradually increases with the increase in Co substitution when x <= 0.10, and decreases when x > 0.10.

In addition, the daily evolution of the EASWJ and objective quantification of the EASWJ are investigated for the Meiyu season over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley. It is found that the EASWJ and summer precipitation bands in East China move simultaneously. Especially, the stationary state and northward shift of the EASWJ are closely associated with the beginning, ending and stabilization of the annually first raining season in South China and Meiyu over these reaches. Analysis on the characteristics of the EASWJ in typical (atypical) Meiyu years over these reaches shows that the EASWJ swings steadily around its climatological position in meridional orientation (with large amplitude). Numerical experiments on an example in 2005 shows that indexes proposed in this study can depict the EASWJ well and should be valuable for application in the operation.

This convex nonlinear combination results in improving the convergence speed while retaining the lower steady-state error at the cost of a small increasing computational burden. To further improve the performance of the nonlinear equalizer, we derive here a novel simplified modified normalized least mean square (SMNLMS) algorithm. Moreover, the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Finally, computer simulation results which support analysis are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed equalizer over the functional link neural network (FLNN), radial basis function (RBF) neural network and linear equalizer with decision feedback (LMSDFE) for time-invariant and time-variant nonlinear channel models in digital communication systems.

It was found that the herb residues of ophiopogon japonicus can be used as a raw material for the production of activated carbon. In this study, a modified activated carbon was prepared from the pyrolusite-added herb residues by chemical activation with zinc chloride (ZnCl2). The objectives of this study were to prepare and characterize activated carbon. The effects of several preparation conditions on the iodine adsorption value were studied. The experimental results showed that the optimum preparation condition was as follows: pyrolusite addition of 5%, solid to liquid ratio of 1:2, activator concentration of 3 mol/L, activation temperature of 500 degrees C and activation time of 1 h. The activated carbon made by the above condition attained the specific surface area of 998.984 m(2)/g and the iodine adsorption value of 1178.21 mg/g. And the modified activated carbon with rougher surface and higher adsorption property was substantiated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis.

Asymptotic boundary conditions (ABC) and immersed finite elements (IFE) are relatively new tools to handle open boundaries and interface problems respectively. Compared with the traditional truncation approach, asymptotic boundary conditions need a much smaller domain to achieve the same accuracy. When regular finite element methods are applied to an interface problem, it is necessary to use a body-fitting mesh in order to obtain the optimal convergence rate. However, immersed finite elements possess the same optimal convergence rate on a Cartesian mesh, which is critical to many applications. This paper applies immersed finite element methods and asymptotic boundary conditions to solve an interface problem arising from electric field simulation in composite materials with open boundary. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the high global accuracy of the IFE method with ABC based on Cartesian meshes, especially around both interface and boundary. This algorithm uses a much smaller domain than the truncation approach in order to achieve the same accuracy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A new system of two singular integral equations are proposed and studied, which plays a key role in the study of reversed flow solutions. The properties of the velocity and the shear stress of the reversed flows are provided. These properties describe the shapes and behaviors of the curves of the velocity and the shear stress functions. A new lower bound of the skin-friction which is useful in numerical analysis is given. The results on the nonexistence of reversed flow solutions can be used to estimate the exact critical value which is of importance in aeronautics because separation occurs at this value.

In practice, selective biochemical sensors based on LSPR are constructed by MNPs and selective receptors for specific biochemical molecules. This Letter studies the effects of receptor thickness on LSPR sensing properties experimentally and theoretically. Experimental results demonstrate that an increase in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) receptor thickness induces a red shift of LSPR spectrum. For a 42 nm PMMA receptor, the maximum extinction efficiency is more sensitive to the test chloroform vapour than the peak wavelength. This receptor thickness effect is confirmed by electrodynamics calculations: a relatively thin receptor layer will create high peak wavelength sensitivity and low extinction efficiency sensitivity. However, it is the opposite for a relatively thick receptor layer. The turning point between thick and thin is approximately 20 nm in this Letter. These insights can be used as guidelines in fabricating high-sensitive LSPR-based biochemical sensors.

A high concentration of charges accumulate on the interface, whose density changes with the negative drain voltage, which increase the electric field (E-I) in the dielectric buried oxide layer (BOX) and modulate the electric field in drift region. This results in the enhancement of the breakdown voltage (BV). The values of E-I and BV of an HI PSOI with a 2-mu m thick SOI layer over a 1-mu m thick buried layer are 580V/mu m and -582 V, respectively, compared with 81.5 V/mu m and -123 V of a conventional PSOI. Furthermore, the Si window also alleviates the self-heating effect (SHE). Moreover, in comparison with the conventional device, the proposed device exhibits low on-resistance.

The triangular nanoprisms were fabricated by a nanosphere lithography (NSL) method. They have sharp vertices and edges, and are arranged in an ideal hexangular array. These characteristics ensure that they exhibit an excellent LSPR spectrum and a high sensitivity to the exterior environment changes. The LSPR spectra responding to ethanol vapor and four other volatile organic vapors-acetone, benzene, hexane and propanol-were measured with a UV-vis spectrometer in real time. Compared with the other four vapors, ethanol exhibits the highest sensitivity (similar to 0.1 nm/mg L(-1)) and the lowest detection limit (similar to 10 mg/L) in the spectral tests. The ethanol vapor test process is also fast (similar to 4 s) and reversible. These insights demonstrate that the triangular nanoprism based nano-sensor can be used in ethanol vapor detection applications.

The dispersion relation, instability condition, cut-off frequency, gain spectrum, and their corresponding dimensionless expressions are analytically deduced and then calculated. The results show that, the self-steepening effect will suppress MI by decreasing the cut-off frequency and the maximum gain. And the larger the power density ratio is, more slowly the cut-off frequency and the maximum gain decrease with increase of the self-steepening parameter. Although the sign of the self-steepening parameter does not influence MI but its absolute value must be smaller than a certain value. Depending on different self-steepening parameters, the cut-off frequency and maximum gain may decrease or increase before decrease with increase of the power density ratio. In particular, for large self-steepening parameters, the power density ratio may have a threshold value. When the power density ratio is under this threshold. MI will disappear.

It aims to reduce computational burden and improve nonlinear processing capabilities of the functional link artificial recurrent neural network (FLANN). The proposed equalizer consists of several simple small-scale functional link artificial decision feedback recurrent neural network (FLADFRNN) modules with less computational complexity. Since it is a module nesting architecture comprising a number of modules that are interconnected in a chained form, its performance can be further improved. Moreover, the equalizer with a decision feedback recurrent structure overcomes the unstableness thanks to its nature of infinite impulse response structure. Finally, the performance of the PFLADFRNN modules is evaluated by a modified real-time recurrent learning algorithm via extensive simulations for different linear and nonlinear channel models in digital communication systems. The comparisons of multilayer perceptron. FLANN and reduced decision feedback FLANN equalizers have clearly indicated the convergence rate, bit error rate, steady-state error and computational complexity, respectively, for nonlinear channel equalization.

This workflow is implemented using WebCom, a metacomputer platform based on the Condensed Graph (CG) model. The CG model allows the application to be constructed with a structure that closely mirrors an abstract description of the workflow. By utilising WebCom's Integrated Development Environment, we also create a workbench environment that facilitates construction of related workflows through the reuse of components developed for the TM workflow. As an example of this component reuse, we outline the construction of a workflow for the alternative Unbiased Model reconstruction method. In addition, we demonstrate that using a separate machine for the coordination of such workflows results in improved execution times. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stratospheric temperature and water-vapor anomalies provided good leading indicators of this weather event. The period from December 1st 2007 to February 28th 2008 was divided into 18 pentads. During the 6th pentad, temperature decreased significantly at 10 hPa in the near-polar stratospheric region, and the decreasing trend strengthened and extended downward and southward to middle and lower latitudes. During the 14th-18th pentads, the temperature decrease reached its maximum and extended to 30A degrees N. This coincided with the widespread freezing rain and snow event. By the end of January 2008, the temperature decrease ended in the near-polar stratospheric region, but continued in the mid-latitude area of the troposphere as the freezing rain and snow weather persisted. Similar to the temperature variations, positive anomalies of relative humidity in the stratospheric near-polar region also strengthened and extended downward and southward, coinciding with the freezing rain and snow event. Along with the significant relationship between the freezing rain and snow disaster and stratospheric circulation anomalies, the stratospheric polar vortex changed its shape in late December, intensifying and spreading downward from the top of the stratosphere and southward to the Asian continent, resulting in a deepening of the East Asian Trough and a strengthening of meridional circulation. Before the occurrence of the freezing rain and snow event, temperature and vapor increases in the stratosphere transferred downward to the troposphere, along with a stratospheric flow in the near-polar region southward to lower latitudes.

Higher concentration self-adapted holes resulting from a vertical electric field are located in the spacing of two neighbouring n(+)-regions on the interface of a buried oxide layer, and therefore the electric field of a dielectric buried layer (E-I) is enhanced by these holes effectively, leading to an improved breakdown voltage (BV). The V-B and E-I of the NCI P-channel LDMOS increase to -188 V and 502.3 V/mu m from -75 V and 82.2 V/mu m of the conventional P-channel LDMOS with the same thicknesses SOI layer and the buried oxide layer, respectively. The influences of structure parameters on the proposed device characteristics are investigated by simulation. Moreover, compared with the conventional device, the proposed device exhibits low special on-resistance.

The whole magnetic ring only exhibits the axial magnetic field B(z) without the radial magnetic field B(perpendicular to). For the open magnetic ring with a gap, the peak value of B(z) decreases and the B(perpendicular to) increases, producing a non-axis-symmetrical magnetic field along central axis. The application in periodic permanent magnet focusing system (PPM) for the open magnetic ring is limited. Based on the distribution of the B(z) and B(perpendicular to), a new PPM structure with open magnetic ring is proposed, which provides a periodic magnetic field along central axis. The measured result of the prepared PPM system gives favorable support to the above design.

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and local density approximation (LDA) were used. The calculated results agree well with the experimental data and other theoretical calculations. The electronic structures of BeP2N4 indicate that they are insulators with wide bandgaps. The mechanical moduli of the spinel structure are larger than that of phenakite. The hardness of the two polymorphs was evaluated based on the methods proposed by Sung and Gao et al. Although the bulk modulus of phenakite is small the results indicate that it is a relatively hard material. On the other hand, the spinel structure is a super hard phase. When the pressure increases the phenakite structure gradually becomes malleable. The calculated GGA transition pressure from phenakite to spinel is 14 GPa, which is smaller than the predicted value of 24 GPa.

Many types of generalized rough set models have been proposed in the literature. This paper discusses the rough approximations of Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets in crisp and fuzzy approximation spaces in which both constructive and axiomatic approaches are used. In the constructive approach, concepts of rough intuitionistic fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets are defined, properties of rough intuitionistic fuzzy approximation operators and intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximation operators are examined. Different classes of rough intuitionistic fuzzy set algebras and intuitionistic fuzzy rough set algebras are obtained from different types of fuzzy relations. In the axiomatic approach, an operator-oriented characterization of rough sets is proposed, that is, rough intuitionistic fuzzy approximation operators and intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximation operators are defined by axioms. Different axiom sets of upper and lower intuitionistic fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence of different types of crisp/fuzzy relations which produce the same operators.

The catalyst activated by H(2) at 300 degrees C was found to exhibit the best catalytic activity, due to the presence of the smallest Cu(0) particles with a high dispersion. Moreover, the bigger Cu(0) particles were active for furfuralcohol hydrogenolysis to 2-methylfuran in the liquid-phase (ethanolic solution), and the hydrogenation of the furan ring of furfuralcohol and 2-methylfuran on Cu(0) particles was easily achieved in the vapour-phase.

(1) Casual relationship. Intervention rule shows which element is the cause and which element is the consequence. (2) Quantitative relationship: Intervention rule shows the quantitative intensity of how the change of the causal element interferes with the change of the consequential element. (3) Multi-scale intervention relationship. Intervention rule shows the intervention at different decomposition scale of the original system, since sub system may exhibit different mechanism from the original system. This paper first introduces a general intervention rule framework, and then transforms the framework into concrete intervention rules for complex network data and time series data. Then, it proposes two algorithms to mine the intervention rules from the two different systems. Finally, the experimental results show that multi-scale intervention rules do exist in real dataset. And the intervention intensity of each sub graph and sub series are always 4 or 5 time larger than intervention intensity of the original data.

Then, the effects of CuO addition on the microstructure and temperature dependence of magnetic properties of MnZn ferrites were investigated by characterizing the fracture surface micrograph and measuring the magnetic properties over a temperature ranging from 25 to 120A degrees C. The results show that the lattice constant and average grain size increase with the increase of CuO concentration. When the CuO concentration is below 0.07 wt.%, the initial permeability and saturation magnetic flux density increase monotonously, and the temperature of the secondary maximum peak in the curve of initial permeability versus temperature and the lowest power loss shift to a lower temperature with the increase of CuO concentration. However, excessive CuO concentration (> 0.07 wt.%) results in abnormal grain growth and porosity increase, which causes the initial permeability and saturation magnetic flux density decrease and the power loss increase at room temperature. Furthermore, the temperature of the secondary maximum peak in the curve of initial permeability versus temperature and the lowest power loss shift to a higher temperature.

An intuitionistic fuzzy rough set, which is the result of approximation of an intuitionistic fuzzy set with respect to an intuitionistic fuzzy approximation space, is an extension of fuzzy rough sets. For further studying the theories and applications of intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets, in this paper, we investigate the topological structures of intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets. We show that an intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximation space can induce an intuitionistic fuzzy topological space in the sense of Lowen if and only if the intuitionistic fuzzy relation in the approximation space is reflexive and transitive. We also examine the sufficient and necessary conditions that an intuitionistic fuzzy topological space can be associated with an intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive relation such that the induced lower and upper intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximation operators are, respectively, the intuitionistic fuzzy interior and closure operators of the given topology.

The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric and differential scanning (TG-DSC). The XRD and TG-DSC analyses indicated that Na8Nb6O19 center dot 13H(2)O/H2O2 was an intermediate hexaniobate during the preparation of NaNbO3 powders. Methylene blue (MB) dye degradation using Na8Nb6O19 center dot 13H(2)O/H2O2 , Nb2O5/H2O2 and NaNbO3/H2O2 systems were investigated, respectively. Among the catalytic oxidation systems, Na8Nb6O19 center dot 13H(2)O/H2O2 showed the highest activity for degradation of MB in the presence of H2O2. The results indicated that the dye degradation efficiency could be 93.5% at 30 degrees C after 60 min in the presence of the Na8Nb6O19 center dot 13H(2)O/H2O2 system. It was also found that the degradation of MB over the catalytic systems followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the degradation rate was 0.02376 min(-1) in the Na8Nb6O19 center dot 13H(2)O/H2O2 system, which was higher than that in the Nb2O5/H2O2 and NaNbO3/H2O2 systems. A possible mechanism for MB catalytic oxidation degradation using the Na8Nb6O19 center dot 13H(2)O/H2O2 system was proposed.

Few data have been available for PBDEs in house dust in China. In this study, dust samples were collected randomly from 46 houses in Guangzhou, South China, for the first time to investigate levels and pattern profiles of PBDEs and to estimate human exposure to PBDEs for adults and toddlers (6 months to 2 years old). Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode, congeners-including BDE28, 47, 66, 85, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, and 209-were determined. The results show that BDE209 is the predominant congener in house dust, comprising 90.7% to 99.8% (mean 97.4%) of the total concentration. Of Ptri-hepta BDEs, BDE47, 99, and 183 were the most abundant congeners, with mean contributions of 23.3%, 25.2%, and 21.9%, respectively. The intake of Ptri-hepta BDEs via dust ingestion was 0.16-3.82 ng/d for adults and 2.1-7.64 ng/d for toddlers, accounting for 0.65% to 13.6% and 18.6% to 45.5%, respectively, of the total (based on data in our previous work) (Chen et al. 2008). With respect to intake of BDE209, the values increased to 11 to 264 ng/d for adults and to 145 to 527 ng/d for toddlers. Risk assessment indicated that PBDEs may possibly affect the health of toddlers in Guangzhou, South China. Further studies are needed to investigate the bio-availability and metabolism of PBDEs in humans to improve risk evaluation.

The operating principle and characteristics of the MZI with electro-optic material (EOM) core are analyzed by using the supermode theory and coupled mode theory. The result shows that regardless of material loss, a very compact MZI of only 0.87 mm x 0.022 mm can be achieved by utilizing EOM with ultrahigh electro-optic coefficient, which means a new way to fulfill a very compact electro-optic modulator or optical switch. The absorption effect of the proposed MZI is also analyzed by perturbation method which is generated by lossy LHM layers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By varying the adsorbent dose, initial concentration, contact time, initial pH and particle size, the respective effects of these factors on the adsorption performance were explored. The sorption equilibrium data fitted Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity was 147.1 mg/g at 25 degrees C. The kinetic data obtained at different initial concentrations were analyzed using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion equations. The pseudo-second-order described the adsorption of Congo Red on spent mushroom very well.

Impact of two different types of El Nino events on the Amazon climate and ecosystem productivity	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						EP-El Nino; CP-El Nino; Amazon climate; Amazon ecosystem; Amazon carbon sequestration	LONG-TERM PLOTS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SOUTH-AMERICAN; TROPICAL FORESTS; CARBON EXCHANGE; SURFACE CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; ENSO; DROUGHT; BASIN	The Amazon basin plays an important role in the global carbon budget. Interannual climate variability associated with El Nino can affect the Amazon ecosystem carbon balance. In recent years, studies have suggested that there are two different types of El Ninos: eastern-Pacific (EP) El Nino and central-Pacific (CP) El Nino. The impacts of two types of El Nino on the Amazon climate and Amazon ecosystem are analyzed in the study. A composite method has been applied to highlight the common features for the EP- and CP-El Nino events using observational data, IPCC-AR4 model output. Potential impacts of the two different types of El Nino on ecosystem carbon sequestration over the Amazon have been investigated using a process-based biogeochemical model, the Biome-BioGeochemical Cycles model (Biome-BGC). Below-normal rainfall is observed year round in northern, central and eastern Amazonia during EP-El Nino years. During CP-El Nino years, negative rainfall anomalies are observed in most of the Amazon during the austral summer wet season, while there is average or above-average precipitation in other seasons. EP- and CP-El Nino events produce strikingly different precipitation anomaly pattern in the tropical and subtropical Andes during the austral fall season: wetter conditions prevail during EP-El Nino years and drier conditions during CP-El Nino years. Temperatures are above-average year round throughout tropical South America during EP-El Nino events, especially during austral summer. During CP-El Nino events, average or slightly above-average temperatures prevail in the tropics, but these temperatures are less extreme than EP year's temperature except in austral fall. These precipitation and temperature anomalies influence ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration throughout the Amazon. Using the Biome-BGC model, we find that net ecosystem production (NEP) in the EP-El Nino years is below average, in agreement with most previous studies; such results indicate that the Amazon region acts as a net carbon source to the atmosphere during EP-El Nino years. In the CP-El Nino years, NEP does not differ significantly from its climatological value, suggesting that the Amazon forest remains a carbon sink for the atmosphere. Thus, even if CP-El Nino events increase in frequency or amplitude under global warming climate as predicted in some Global Climate Models, the Amazon rainforest may remain a carbon sink to the atmosphere during El Nino years in the near future.

However, two major problems remain that obstruct the development of microwave research. One factor that limits their commercial application is the relatively low resolution of microwave radiometers. The other is the non-uniform spatial resolution for each frequency of the radiometer. The resolution mismatch becomes a critical consideration when observations at two or more frequencies must be combined. In this paper, we have used the Backus-Gilbert method to solve these two problems, while AMSR-E is chosen as the research object. First, we derived the Backus-Gilbert method in detail. The simulated data were then used to decide the optimum parameters in the Backus-Gilbert method. To enhance the resolution, the Backus-Gilbert method has been applied to the AMSR-E data, which covered the Mexico Gulf and the Amazon River. After resolution was enhanced, detailed information was obtained and compared with visible high resolution data. To match the resolution, the AMSR-E data from the Oklahoma Little Washed were used to compute the Microwave Vegetation Index (MVI), which was developed by J. C. Shi. Compared to the original MVIs, the information contained in the MVIs that were processed by the Backus-Gilbert method is more reliable.

However, the original alarms in the telecommunication networks cannot be used to mine association rules directly. This paper proposes a novel preprocessing expert system model to deal with the original alarms. This model uses two important techniques, of which the time window technique is used for converting original alarms into transactions, and the neural network technique can classify the alarms with different levels according to the characteristics of telecommunication networks in order to mine the weighted association rules. Simulation results and the real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of this preprocessing expert system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EPR g factors and tetragonal distortion for the isoelectronic Ni+ and Cu2+ centers in the CuGaSe2 crystal	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Electron paramagnetic resonance; Crystal- and ligand-field theory; Defect structure; Ni+; Cu2+; CuGaSe2	ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ATOMIC SCREENING CONSTANTS; SOLAR-CELLS; DEFECT STRUCTURES; SCF FUNCTIONS; THIN-FILMS; IONS; TRANSITION; PARAMETERS; SPECTRA	The EPR g factors, g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to), for the isoelectronic 3d(9) ions Ni+ and Cu2+ at the tetragonal Cu+ site of the CuGaSe2 crystal are calculated from the high-order perturbation formulas based on a two-spin-orbit-parameter model. In the model, both the contributions to g factors from the spin-orbit parameter of central 3d(9) ion and that of ligand ion are contained. The calculated results appear to be consistent with the experimental values. The tetragonal distortions (characterized by theta - theta(0), where theta is the angle between the metal-ligand bond and C-4 axis, and theta(0)approximate to E54.74 degrees is the same angle in cubic symmetry) of Ni+ and Cu2+ centers, which are different from the corresponding angle in the host CuGaSe2 crystal and from impurity to impurity, are obtained from the calculations. The difference of the sign of g(parallel to) - g(perpendicular to) between the isoelectronic Ni+ and Cu2+ centers is found to be due to the different tetragonal distortions of both centers in the CuGaSe2 crystal.

In the method, the Zeeman and hyperfine interaction terms are attached to the conventional Hamiltonian and a 52 x 52 energy matrix concerning the ground term H-4(J) (J=9/2, 11/2, 13/2, 15/2) is constructed. The Nd3+ center is attributed to Nd3+ occupying the 12-fold coordinated Sr2+ site in SrTiO3. Differing from the defect model assumed in the previous paper that the tetragonal distortion of this Nd3+ center is due to the association of one interstitial oxygen ion at a nearest neighborhood of Nd3+ and the Nd3+ displacement Delta z along C-4 axis, we suggest that it is due to the distortion of SrTiO3 lattice in the tetragonal phase. The calculated g factors g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to) show good agreement with the experimental values, suggesting that our defect model of Nd3+ center in SrTiO3 is reasonable. The experimental hyperfine structure constants were not reported and so our calculated results remain to be checked by EPR experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Equalisation of non-linear time-varying channels using a pipelined decision feedback recurrent neural network filter in wireless communication systems	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ADAPTIVE PREDICTION; ARCHITECTURE; SIGNALS; PRNN	To combat the linear and non-linear distortions for time-invariant and time-variant channels, a novel adaptive joint process equaliser based on a pipelined decision feedback recurrent neural network (JPDFRNN) is proposed in this paper. The JPDFRNN consists of a number of simple small-scale decision feedback recurrent neural network (DFRNN) modules and a linear combiner. The cascaded DFRNN provides pre-processing for the linear combiner. Moreover, each DFRNN can provide a local interpolation for M sample points; the final linear combiner presents a global interpolation with good localisation properties. Furthermore, since those modules of non-linear subsection can be performed simultaneously in a pipelined parallelism fashion, this would result in a significant improvement in the total computational efficiency. Simulation results show that the performance of the JPDFRNN using the modified real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm is superior to that of the DFRNN and RNN for the non-linear time-invariant and time-variant channels.

The vibrational contribution due to the acoustic phonon is calculated using the long-wave approximation similar to the study on the specific heat of crystals and that due to optical phonon is estimated using the single-phonon model. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. From the calculation, it is found that the static contribution Delta D-stat(T) (which is often regarded as very small and is neglected in the previous papers) is larger than the vibrational contribution Delta D-vib(T) and so the reasonable studies of temperature dependence of zero-field splitting should take both the static and the vibrational contributions into account.

For a concrete model, we take into account a kind of MPS QPTs accompanied by spontaneous parity breaking, though for either side of the critical point the GS is typically unique, and show that the kind of MPS QPTs occur only in the thermodynamic limit and are accompanied by the appearance of singularities, diverging correlation length, vanishing energy gap and the entanglement entropy of a half-infinite chain not only staying finite but also whose first derivative discontinuous.

This paper presents a method of identifying these unreliable segments to improve the skeletons of handwriting images. In this method, a novel feature called iteration time is exploited, by which each unreliable segment can be treated as a set of points with exceptional iteration times. First, the iteration time of each skeleton point is calculated, and an undirected graph is built from the skeleton whose edges are weighted by defining a distance measurement between each pair of connected nodes based on iteration time. Then the set of unreliable segments is achieved by a graph clustering algorithm with an effective clustering quality function. Finally, the probability of two jointed reliable segments belonging to a continuous pair is estimated by a best-matched method, and a cubic B-spline interpolation is applied to reconstruct unreliable parts of the skeleton. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect unreliable segments effectively and produce a skeleton that is closer to the original writing trajectory.

The dependence of radiation forces (RFs) on the beam order N, waist width w(0), correlation length sigma(0), particle radius a and focal length f is analyzed and illustrated by numerical examples. By a suitable choice of N, w(0), sigma(0) and f a stable trap of the Rayleigh particle is achievable. In particular, there exist critical values w(0,c), sigma(0,c) for a partially coherent flattened vortex beam the particle can be trapped by the beam with w(0) less than w(0,c) and sigma(0) larger than sigma(0,c).

The structural phase transition pressure Pt from alpha-MnS to beta-MnS, which is determined on the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, is 30.75 GPa. Also, the lattice parameters a, the bulk modulus B and pressure derivative of bulk modulus B', which are generally in good agreement with experiments and other theoretical values, are obtained under zero pressure. For further investigation of the structural phase transition pressure of MnS, the relative volumes V/V(0), the bulk modulus B, first and second pressure derivatives (B' and B '') of bulk modulus for the two structures of MnS have been calculated under various pressures.

EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched for articles published up to February 2011. All studies that examined the association of hypertension or antihypertensive medication use with the onset of AD were included. Pooled relative risks (RR) were calculated using fixed and random effects models. Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. All subjects were without dementia at baseline. Among them, 9 studies compared the incidence of AD between subjects with (7,270) and without (8,022) hypertension. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in incidence of AD (RR: 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-1.14) between subjects with and without hypertension. Seven studies compared the incidence of AD between subjects with (8,703) and without (13,041) antihypertensive medication use. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in incidence of AD (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.79-1.03) between subjects with and without antihypertensive medication use. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive medication use was associated with risk for incident AD.

The existence of a random absorbing set is first discussed for the systems and then an estimate on the solutions is derived when the time is large enough, which ensures the asymptotic compactness of solutions.

In the method, the Hamiltonian concerning the energy matrix includes the Zeeman and hyperfine interaction terms and so there is no perturbation calculation in it. The crystal-field parameters in the energy matrix are calculated using the superposition model, in which the structural data of 12-fold coordinated site rather than those of the incorrect 6-fold coordinated site given in the previous paper are applied. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. The results are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the method, the Zeeman (or magnetic) and hyperfine interaction terms are attached to the classical Hamiltonian used in the calculation of crystal-field energy levels and a 66 x 66 energy matrix concerning this Hamiltonian is constructed by taking all the ground-term multiplets H-6(J) (J=15/2, 13/2, 11/2, 9/2, 7/2, 5/2) into account. The calculated results (g factors & and average vertical bar A(Dy-161(3+))vertical bar and vertical bar(A) over bar(Dy-163(3+))vertical bar) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. From the calculations, the above defect model of rhombic Dy3+ center is confirmed, the defect structure of this Dy3+ center (characterized by the displacement of Cl- ligand caused by VAg) is obtained and the components of hyperfine structure constants A(i)(Dy-161(3+)) and A(i)(Dy-163(3+)) are predicted.

Making use of the Lorentz transformation and the constitutive transformation, Maxwell's equations lead to the coupled non-homogeneous differential equations which govern the wave propagation in CWMMP, and then analytical solutions have been obtained. The discussion about the eigenvalues of the waves and detailed studies on the fields are carried out. It finds that the fields of the CWMMP are composed of two parts with different eigenvalues. Numerical calculations show that because of Doppler shift effect, the eigenvalues of the modes in such a case is quite different from those of the CWMMP. And a detailed discussion on the dispersion characteristic of CWMMP is presented.

J	Xiao, J; He, CZ; Jiang, XY; Liu, DH				Xiao, Jin; He, Changzheng; Jiang, Xiaoyi; Liu, Dunhu			A dynamic classifier ensemble selection approach for noise data	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Multiple classifier systems; GMDH; Dynamic ensemble selection; Noise-immunity ability	ATTRIBUTE NOISE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIVERSITY; COMBINATION; ACCURACY; ALGORITHM; VARIANCE; FUSION; REGION; GMDH	Dynamic classifier ensemble selection (DCES) plays a strategic role in the field of multiple classifier systems. The real data to be classified often include a large amount of noise, so it is important to study the noise-immunity ability of various DCES strategies. This paper introduces a group method of data handling (GMDH) to DCES, and proposes a novel dynamic classifier ensemble selection strategy GDES-AD. It considers both accuracy and diversity in the process of ensemble selection. We experimentally test GDES-AD and six other ensemble strategies over 30 UCI data sets in three cases: the data sets do not include artificial noise, include class noise, and include attribute noise. Statistical analysis results show that GDES-AD has stronger noise-immunity ability than other strategies. In addition, we find out that Random Subspace is more suitable for GDES-AD compared with Bagging. Further, the bias-variance decomposition experiments for the classification errors of various strategies show that the stronger noise-immunity ability of GOES-AD is mainly due to the fact that it can reduce the bias in classification error better.

In the method, the Zeeman and hyperfine interaction terms are added to the classical Hamiltonian, and a 52 x 52 energy matrix concerning the ground multiplet I-4(15/2) and the first to third excited multiplets I-4(13/2), I-4(11/2) and I-4(9/2) is established for a 4f(11) ion in trigonal crystal field and under an external magnetic field. From the studies, the EPR parameters for three Er3+ centers in ThO2 are reasonably explained, the defect models for the two trigonal Er3+ centers suggested in the previous paper are confirmed and the defect structures of the two trigonal centers are obtained.

Our primary goal in this paper is (i) to solve the feedback-modified master equation, (ii) to demonstrate the ability of feedback control based on the solutions, and (iii) to pick out different steady states by choosing different driving strengths and feedback strengths to counteract the effects of both damping and the measurement back-action on the system. We further investigate some properties of the equilibrium steady state, its distribution probability and entanglement vs. the driving and feedback amplitudes.

The results show that the PCD in the northern part of the region is markedly higher than that in the southern part, but the PCP in the south is much earlier than that in the north by about one and a half months, which displays significant regional differences in precipitation. With the global warming, precipitation over East China shows an increasing tendency, but PCD displays a trend that is neither increasing nor decreasing. At the same time, the PCP is later than before, which can be mainly found in Jiangxi and southern Henan provinces. As a result, there are strong associations between the precipitation, PCD and PCP, which can be shown in the years with more precipitation, stronger PCD and later-than-usual PCP. In a word, the abnormal distribution of precipitation, PCP, and PCD over East China results in more extreme events of precipitation and more droughts and floods.

Recently, the application of association rules mining becomes an important research area in alarm correlation analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel Association Rules Mining based Alarm Correlation Analysis System (ARM-ACAS) to find interesting association rules between alarm events. In order to mine some infrequent but important items, ARM-ACAS first uses neural network to classify the alarms with different levels. In addition, ARM-ACAS also exploits an optimization technique with the weighted frequent pattern tree structure to improve the mining efficiency. The system is both efficient and practical in discovering significant relationships of alarms as illustrated by experiments performed on simulated and real-world datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Zhu, JM				Zhu Jing-Min			Properties of Parity Non-conserved and Parity Conserved States in Matrix Product Systems	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						matrix product state; parity operator; long-range correlation; entanglement entropy	QUANTUM; ENTANGLEMENT	In terms of reflection transformation of a matrix product state (MPS), the parity of the MPS is defined. Based on the reflective parity non-conserved MPS pair we construct the even-parity state vertical bar Psi(e)> and the odd-parity state vertical bar Psi(o)>. It is interesting to find that the parity non-conserved reflective MPS pair have no long-range correlations; instead the even-parity state vertical bar Psi(e)> and the odd-parity state vertical bar Psi(o)> constructed from them have the same long-range correlations for the parity non-conserved block operators. Moreover, the entanglement between a block of n contiguous spins and the rest of the spin chain for the states vertical bar Psi(e)> and vertical bar Psi(o)> is larger than that for the reflective MPS pair except for n = 1, and the difference of them approaches 1 monotonically and asymptotically from 0 as n increases from 1. These characteristics indicate that MPS parity as a conserved physical quantity represents a kind of coherent collective quantum mode, and that the parity conserved MPSs contain more correlation, coherence, and entanglement than the parity non-conserved ones.

Strained InGaAs/GaAs Quantum-Well Laser Emitting at 1054 nm	JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM			English	Article						InGaAs/GaAs; Quantum-well; Laser		In this paper, we present an InGaAs/GaAs strain QW laser with tilted waveguide emitting at 1054 nm that has been fabricated by Metal-Organic Chemical-Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) on a GaAs substrate. The active region consists of 6 nm QW separated by a 60-nm barrier within a two-step graded-index separated-confinement heterostructure (GRINSCH) region. The use of a Strained Buffer Layer (SBL) is shown to significantly improve the laser performance. The composition and micro-structure quality of the QW was measured by high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The strain QW laser exhibits a threshold current of 9 mA and a slope efficiency of 0.4 W/A (unused antireflection coating on the facets). Stable fundamental transverse mode operation was obtained up to 33 mW emitted power at an injection current of 100 mA. The spectral width of the strain QW laser is 1.6 nm at an injection current of 50 mA.	[Liu, A. P.] Chongqing Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [Duan, L.

Study of Fe3O4 Nano-Magnetic Ferrofluid by Atomic Force Microscope	JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM			English	Article						Nano-ferrofluid; Atomic Force Microscope; Microstructure characterization	NANOPARTICLES	The magnetic ferrofluid is a special intelligent material and its many properties can be controlled by external magnetic field. This paper introduces the preparation, performance and applications of Fe3O4 nano-ferrofluid, principally observed by the microstructure characterization by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and we measured the particle size and morphology of nano-ferrofluid. The magnetic property was analyzed from the microstructure characterization, and the analysis results show that the size of the Fe3O4 nano-particle is about 5 nm; the magnetic property is closely related to the chain microstructure and is influenced by the nano-particle distribution in the Fe3O4 magnetic ferrofluid.

The results showed that the controlling step for the adsorption kinetics changed with experimental parameters varied. When the particle size of steel slag was larger than 120 mesh, intraparticle diffusion of Pb(2+) was the controlling step; when the initial concentration of Pb(2+) was less than 150 mg L(-1) or the shaking rate was lower than 150 rpm, external diffusion of Pb(2+) was promoted. Contrary to the former experimental conditions, the adsorption reaction was the controlling step, and the adsorption followed second-order kinetics, with an adsorption rate constant of 13.26 g mg(-1) min(- 1). The adsorption isotherm of Pb(2+) with steel slag followed the Langmuir model, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99.

In the method, we add the Zeeman (or magnetic) and hyperfine interaction terms to the conventional Hamiltonian used in the calculations of crystal-field energy levels. The 66 X 66 energy matrix concerning the new Hamiltonian is established by considering the ground multiplet H-6(15/2) and the first to fifth excited multiplets H-6(J) (where J=13/2, 11/2,9/2, 7/2 and 5/2), and the crystal-field parameters in the energy matrix are calculated from the superposition model. From the calculations, the spin-Hamiltonian parameters of HfSiO4:Dy3+ are explained reasonably and the signs of hyperfine structure constants for Dy-161(3+) and Dy-161(3+) isotopes in HfSiO4 are suggested.

The results show that, the modulation instability characteristics here are similar to those of conventional saturable nonlinearity and Kerr nonlinearity. That is to say, when the fourth-order dispersion has the same sign as that of the second-order one, a new gain spectral region called the second one which is far away from the zero point may appear. The existence of the exponential saturable nonlinearity will make the spectral width as well as the peak gain of every spectral region increase with the input powers before decrease. Namely, for every spectral regime, this may lead to a unique value of peak gain and spectral width for two different input powers. In comparison with the case of conventional saturable nonlinearity, however, when the other parameters are the same, the variations of the spectral width and the peak gain with the input powers will be faster in case of exponential saturable nonlinearity.

The sampling effect of CCD will cause a dilution of accuracy in PMP, especially at abrupt discontinuities on the object surface. The existing methods cannot efficiently identify the abrupt discontinuities. We analyze the relationship between the phase, the height and the equivalent wavelength. By viewing the phase as the argument of a vector we find out that CCD sampling introduces errors into the measurement and the phase is nonlinear to the equivalent wavelength at the abrupt discontinuities. Therefore temporal phase unwrapping (TPU) is introduced into the measurement to identify the abrupt discontinuities. Computer simulations and practical experiment validate the feasibility of this method.

The XRD, SEM-EDS and XPS analyses revealed that La3+ was dispersed on Ag3VO4 in the form of La2O3 cluster. The DRS results indicated that the absorption edge of the La3+-Ag3VO4 catalyst shifted to longer wavelength. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of La2O3/Ag3VO4 for Rhodamine B (RhB) dye degradation under visible light irradiation was due to its wider absorption edge and higher separation rate of photo-generated electron and holes. The highest photodegradation efficiency was obtained when the La2O3/Ag3VO4 catalyst was calcined at 300 degrees C with 3 wt% La content.

The effects of the extraction time, diluent, phosphoric acid concentration, DNNSA concentration and temperature were examined. The H(3)PO(4) concentration had a negative effect on magnesium ion extraction, while the DNNSA concentration had a significant positive effect. The DNNSA easily forms reverse micelles in the organic phase. The experimental results were analyzed mathematically by nonlinear regression to determine the stoichiometry of the complex formed in extraction. It was found that magnesium was extracted in the form of the complex with HA representing the free acid form of DNNSA. The equilibrium constant of the extraction reaction was calculated to be 59.6.

The tetragonal distortion (characterized by Delta R=R-parallel to-R-perpendicular to, where R-vertical bar and R-perpendicular to represent the metal-ligand distances parallel with and perpendicular to the C-4 axis) of this Cu(H2O)(6)(2+) cluster is studied by calculating its spin-Hamiltonian parameters (g factors g(parallel to), g(perpendicular to) and hyperfine structure constants A(parallel to) and A(perpendicular to)) from two theoretical methods, the complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method (CDM) and the perturbation theory method (PTM). Both methods are based on the cluster approach in which the admixture between the d orbitals of 3d(n) ion and the p orbitals of ligand ion is considered. The calculated results show that both methods can be used to calculate the spin-Hamiltonian parameters and to determine the structure of 3d(9) clusters in crystals. These results are discussed.

Studying the morphological development of soil cracks helps to further reveal the close relationship between the soil cracking process and water movement in such semi-arid regions. Here we report regular changes on surface morphology of soil cracks with decreasing water in four different soils (Typ-Ustic Ferrisols, Ver-Ustic Ferrisols, Tru-Ustic Vertisols and Typ-Ustic Vertisols) through simulation experiments. Our results indicate the following: 1) Different soils ultimately have different development degrees of soil cracks, according to their various values of crack area density. Soil cracks in Typ-Ustic Ferrisols can only develop to the feeble degree, while those in the other three soils are capable of developing into the intensive degree, and even into the extremely intensive degree. 2) Soil crack complexity, as expressed by the value of the area-weighted mean of crack fractal dimension (AWMFRAC), is found to continuously decrease as a whole through the whole cracking process in all the studied soils. 3) Soil crack connectivity shows a uniform trend in the studied soils, that is to say, connectivity gradually increases with soil crack development.

The effect of Cu content on the catalytic properties of Cu(x)-MgAlO(y) reduced at 220 and 300 degrees C. in furfural hydrogenation was investigated. The Cu(x)-MgAlO(y), catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction. H(2) temperature-programmed reduction, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that Cu-MgAlO(y) containing 11.2% of Cu exhibited an excellent catalytic activity and stability, and Cu(0) species were confirmed to be the main catalytic active sites for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol and hydro-dehydration of furfuryl alcohol to 2-methyl furan. However, the presence of metal oxides, such as CuO, MgO, and even MgAl(2)O(4), would promote the formation of 2-diethoxylmethyl loran by the side reaction of furfural with ethanol.

The binding and formation energies of nitrogen vacancy are smaller than that of silicon vacancies, implying that nitrogen vacancy can be easily formed in gamma-Si3N4. Corresponding density of states of different point vacancies is analyzed. We concluded that the neutral silicon vacancies introduce the p-type carriers into the system, whereas single nitrogen vacancy leads to an n-type semiconductor. The results show indirect semiconductor of nitrogen vacancy for gamma-Si3N4. The effects of optical properties are discussed on single vacancies for gamma-Si3N4. For silicon vacancies, the materials have much higher static dielectric constants than these of nitrogen vacancy and perfect gamma-Si3N4. The single nitrogen vacancy for gamma-Si3N4 has no effects on absorption and reflection in visible and infrared light. For silicon vacancy, it is significantly increased.

This work focused on oxidizing elemental mercury by aqueous potassium hypochlorite (KClO) in a bubble reactor. Effects of initial oxidizing solution concentration, reaction temperature, pH, and mercury concentration in the inlet of the reactor on mercury oxidative absorption in KClO were investigated. Results indicate that higher concentrations of KClO favor Hg(0) removal, with a greater efficiency observed in acidic than in alkaline solution. High temperature inhibits Hg(0) absorption in aqueous absorbent. The pH value increases during the reaction process, and the reaction system depletes H(+) or produces OH(-).

In the summer of 2008, in situ measurements of E-field inside the thunderstorms were conducted in Pingliang, Gansu Provience, with the cooperation of an X-band weather radar. One E-field profile inside a thunderstorm was successfully acquired. The sounding data indicated four charge layers along the sounding trajectory, three inside the thuderstorm and one at its lower boundary. The lower cloud boundary charge layer was negative, acting as a screening layer, and laid between 4.3 to 4.5 km a.s.l. The lower positive charge center (LPCC) existed between 4.5-5.3 km a.s.l. (from 3 degrees C to -2 degrees C); the main negative charge area was present between 5.4-6.6 km a.s.l. (-3 degrees C to -10 degrees C); the upper positive charge layer was between 6.7-7.2 km a.s.l.

J	Guo, XL; Verma, M				Guo, Xiaolin; Verma, Manish			Choosing vehicle capacity to minimize risk for transporting flammable materials	JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES			English	Article						Hazardous materials transport; Flammables; TNT; Risk; Vehicle capacity	HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; NETWORK; MODEL	Highway transportation of hazardous materials (hazmat) has been an active area of research with significant efforts in the risk assessment and route selection domains. Almost all these works assume fixed (constant) truck capacity, and hence capacity-based vehicle selection has not been studied. In this paper, we make a first attempt to investigate the impact of different truck capacities on transport risk from moving flammables, such as gasoline or explosives, on a given route. We make use of three scenarios, under risk-neutral and risk-averse assumptions, to develop conditions for preferring a specific vehicle size. A problem instance based in the US is solved to gain managerial insights. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the method, the Zeeman (or magnetic) interaction is added to the Hamiltonian in the conventional CDM and so the present Hamiltonian includes all the interactions for 40 ions under electric field (i.e., the crystal field in crystal) and external magnetic field (in EPR experiment). The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. In addition, the calculated g factors and optical spectra from the present CDM are very close to those from the conventional CDM. It appears that both CDMs can be effective to the calculations of g factors (and also optical spectra) for 4f(n) ions in crystals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The binding energy and the formation energy suggest that Al impurities prefer to substitute Si at octahedral sites. Different doping concentrations are considered and the corresponding density of states (DOS) analyzed. Calculated DOS indicates that there are holes in the top of the valance band after doping, meaning a p-type doping. We study the complex dielectric function, the absorption coefficient, and the electron energy loss spectra. It is demonstrated that for the low Al concentration, the material exhibits the dielectric behavior and for the high Al concentration, the material is possible to exhibit the metallic behavior. The gamma-Si3N4 doped with Al has a much higher static dielectric constant than undoped gamma-Si3N4. implying its potential applications in electronics and optics.

The results showed that the controlling step for the adsorption kinetics changed with the varying experimental parameters. When the particle size of steel slag was larger than 120 mesh, intra-particle diffusion of Pb(2+) was the controlling step, and when the initial concentration of Pb(2+) was less than 150 mg L(-1) or the shaking rate was lower than 150 rpm, external diffusion of Pb(2+) was promoted. Contrary to the former experimental conditions the adsorption reaction was the controlling step, and the adsorption followed second-order kinetics, with an adsorption rate constant of 13.26 g mg(-1) min(-1). The adsorption isotherm of Pb(2+) with steel slag followed the Langmuir model, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that the coherence vortex depends on the beam order N, spatial coherence parameter a and position (x(1), y(1)) of the reference point. Depending on the choice of the reference point, the zero point of the spectral degree of coherence may be present or absent. In particular, if x(1) = y(1) = 0 is chosen, the phase at the zero point of the spectral degree of coherence may be determinate, thus the coherence vortex does not exist.

The indoor dust samples were analyzed for the concentrations, congener profiles, and possible sources of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and compared to similar data obtained for outdoor dusts. The concentrations of Sigma(10)PBDEs (the sum of BDE28, 47, 66, 85, 99. 100, 153, 154, 183, and 209) were 186.6-9654 ng g(-1) (mean = 2662 ng g(-1)) and 1737-4408 ng g(-1) (mean = 3179 ng g(-1)) for house dust and office dust, respectively. No significant differences were found among the congener profiles of PBDEs in house dust from three different cities. The dominant congener in all dust samples was BDE209, accounting for an average of 96.2%,99.0% and 97.4% of Sigma(10)PBDEs for house dust, office dust and outdoor dust, respectively. Unlike previous studies, this study found that BDE183 was present in high proportion to Sigma(9)PBDEs (BDE209 excluded) in both indoor and outdoor dusts, in addition to the usually dominant congeners, BDE47 and 99. Sigma(10)PBDEs concentrations in house dust were higher than those in outdoor dust for most comparison samples. Combined with the significantly higher Sigma(10)PBDEs concentrations in television and computer dusts, PBDE-containing products used indoors, including televisions and computers, were important potential emission sources for PBDEs in indoor dusts. Further studies are required to detail the source of the high levels of BDE183 in Chinese indoor dusts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These methods are based on the cluster approach in which the spin-orbit coupling parameters , ' and the orbital reduction factors k, k' are calculated from a semi-empirical molecular orbital method. The crystal-field parameters used in the calculations are obtained from the superposition model and so the defect structure of Cu2+ centres in ZnO can be acquired. The calculated g factors from the three methods are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values and the defect structure of Cu2+ centres in ZnO is acquired. It appears that in some cases the approximate PTM can be applied in the studies of g factors of various states. The conditions that the PTM are ineffective are discussed.

We derive a characterization of the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by considering the size of Levitin-Polyalk approximating solution sets of variational inequalities. We also show that the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness of variational inequalities is closely related to the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness of minimization problems and fixed point problems. Finally, we prove that under suitable conditions, the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness of a variational inequality is equivalent to the uniqueness and existence of its solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Investigations of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters for Yb3+in the tetragonal phase of SrTiO3 crystal	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article						spin-Hamiltonian parameter; ytterbium isotope; hyperfine structure constant; EPR	SUPERPOSITION-MODEL ANALYSIS; PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; OPTICAL-ABSORPTION; FIELD; LUMINESCENCE; OXIDES; IONS	The spin-Hamiltonian parameters (g factors, [image omitted], [image omitted], and hyperfine structure constants, [image omitted], [image omitted]) for Yb3+ at the 12-fold coordinated Sr2+ site of tetragonal SrTiO3 crystal at T approximate to 2 and 50 K were calculated using the completed diagonalization (of the energy matrix) method (CDM). Differing from the conventional CDM, the Hamiltonian concerning the energy matrix in this CDM contains the Zeeman and hyperfine interaction terms and so the spin-Hamiltonian parameters can be calculated directly from CDM. The crystal parameters used in the energy matrix are calculated from the superposition model, in which the tetragonal distortions and hence the order parameters phi at both temperatures are applied. From the calculations, the spin-Hamiltonian parameters at both temperatures are explained reasonably and the signs of hyperfine structure constants for the 171Yb3+ and 173Yb3+ isotopes in SrTiO3 are suggested. The results are discussed.	[Zheng, W. C.; Liu, H. G.; Yang, W. Q.; Li, B. X.] Sichuan Univ, Dept Mat Sci, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Yang, W.

From the studies, the local linear compressibility d ln R/dP approximate to -1.21 x 10(-4) /kbar for the dominant Cr3+-centered octahedron in LMA crystal is obtained. By comparing this compressibility with that in ruby (Al2O3:Cr3+), we confirm the assignment in the previous paper that the dominant Cr3+ center is Cr3+ ion at 4f site of LMA crystal.

During the Wenchuan magnitude 8.0 earthquake that happened in Wenchuan county (31.0 degrees north latitude, 103.4 degrees east longitude) of Sichuan province, China, on May 12, 2008, eight mice were monitored for locomotor activity and circadian rhythm in constant darkness with temperature 22-24 degrees C and humidity 55-65% for 38 days. The ongoing monitoring of locomotor activity of mice in our laboratory made it possible to design a posteriori study investigating whether the earthquake was associated with any change in animal behavior. Based on analyzing the recorded data with single cosinor, we found that the locomotor activity dramatically decreased in six of these eight mice oil day 3 before the earthquake, and the circadian rhythm of their locomotor activity was no longer detected. The behavioral change lasted for 6 days before the locomotor activity returned to its original state. Analyses of concurrent geomagnetic data showed a higher total intensity during the span when the circadian rhythm in locomotor activity weakened. These results indicated that the behaviors, including circadian rhythm and activity, in these mice indeed changed prior to the earthquake, and the behavioral change might be associated with a change of geomagnetic intensity.

Quantitative study of the complicated surface morphology of soil cracks is a prerequisite for further studies of soil-cracking mechanisms. The present paper establishes a quantitative indicator system by application of concepts and methods originating from Fractal Geometry and Network Analysis. These indicators can effectively express the complicated features of soil-crack network structure. Furthermore, a series of values related to soil-crack morphology was obtained by image processing on field photos of soil-crack quads, and gradation criteria for the degree of development of soil cracks were determined. Finally, the changes in values of the morphological indicators under different degrees of development were analyzed in detail. Our results indicate that (1) the degree of development of soil cracks can be divided into five grades, i.e., feeble development, slight development, medium development, intensive development and extremely intensive development; (2) the values of the indicators change predictably with increasing degree of development of soil cracks. The area density (Dc) increases, and both the area-weighted mean ratio of crack area to perimeter (AWMARP), which reflects the intensity of cracking, and the index r, which is related to the connectivity of a soil crack, grow uniformly (albeit with different forms). AWMRAP increases at a geometric rate while r shows logarithmmic growth, indicating a gradual increase in the connectivity of a soil crack. Nevertheless, the area-weighted mean of soil-crack fractal dimension (AWMFRAC) shows a decreasing trend, indicating a gradual decline in the complexity of cracks as area density increases.

Molecular dynamics simulations show that the transport and ejection of a C(20) molecule via a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) can be achieved by a sustained mechanical actuation driven by two oscillating tips. The optimal condition for nanopumping is found when the tip oscillation frequency and magnitude correlate to form quasi steady-state mechanical wave propagation in the SWNT, so that the energy transfer process is optimal leading to maximal molecular translational motion and minimal rotational motion. Our finding provides a potentially useful mechanism for using an SWNT as a vehicle to deliver large drug molecules.

In this paper, a novel DTI based white matter fiber tractography using genetic algorithm is presented. Adapting the concepts from evolutionary biology which include selection, recombination and mutation, globally optimized fiber pathways are generated iteratively. Global optimality of the fiber tracts is evaluated using Bayes decision rule, which simultaneously considers both the fiber geometric smoothness and consistency with the tensor field. This global optimality assigns the tracking fibers great immunity to random image noise and other local image artifacts, thus avoiding the detrimental effects of cumulative noise on fiber tracking. Experiments with synthetic and in vivo human DTI data have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this new fiber tracking technique. and an improved performance over commonly used probabilistic fiber tracking.

Then the time trends of stratospheric temperature at some altitudes were interviewed through linear trend test. The results obtained show that there are obvious differences between ECMWF and HALOE data. In mid-low latitudes, the temperature profiles are very similar bellow 10 hPa and the temperature from HALOE data is higher than that from ECMWF data in the layer from 10 hPa to 2 hPa. At I hPa, there is little difference between them. In mid-high latitudes of both hemispheres, the temperature difference is relatively obvious. The temperature from HALOE data is higher than that from ECMWF data in the whole stratosphere. It can be also found that the temperature distribution difference increases with the altitude in the stratosphere. There is a little difference in mid-low latitudes and clear differences out of 50 degrees in both hemispheres. At 100 hPa, 50 hPa and 10 hPa in the mid-low stratosphere, the temperature trends from HALOE and ECMWF data are very similar, but the decreasing trend is more obvious from HALOE data. At 2 hPa in the upper stratosphere, the trend after 1996, the temperature trends are just opposite. Those results will provide some proofs to stratospheric temperature researches.

The Cu2+(I) ion replaces the Zn2+ ion at tetragonally compressed octahedral coordination and has the ground state (2)A(1)(vertical bar d(z2) >),whereas the Cu2+(II) ion is at an interstitial site with a square-planar F-coordination and has the ground state B-2(2)(vertical bar d(x2-y2>)). The calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters and d-d transitions from the PTM and CDM coincide and are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. This suggests that both methods are effective for the theoretical studies of EPR and optical spectral data for 3d(9) ions in tetragonal symmetry with different ground states. The defect structures of the two Cu2+ centers in Ba2ZnF6:Cu2+ are also estimated. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using the dry MoO3 pellets, the films are deposited on quartz substrates at substrate temperatures ranging from 100 degrees C to 400 degrees C. A phase structure Of beta-MoO3 at the substrate temperature 200 degrees C is characterized by X-ray diffraction, but alpha-MoO3 comes forth at 300 degrees C and 400 degrees C. The surface morphology, cross section view and plate form nanostructures have been illustrated from the scanning electron microscope images. The absorption spectra of films show that the energy band E-g decreases with the increasing substrate temperature, due to the increase in oxygen vacancy. The resistances of thin films prepared at various substrate temperatures gradually decrease with the increasing environmental temperatures. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Wei, N; Gong, YF; He, JH				Wei Na; Gong Yuanfa; He Jinhai			Structural Variation of an Atmospheric Heat Source over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and Its Influence on Precipitation in Northwest China	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; atmospheric heat source/sink; greater/lesser precipitation years; northwest China	TIBETAN PLATEAU; SUMMER MONSOON; RAINFALL; ONSET; ASIA	NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and a 47-year precipitation dataset are utilized to analyze the relationship between an atmospheric heat source (hereafter called < Q(1) >) over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (QXP) and its surrounding area and precipitation in northwest China. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) The horizontal distribution of < Q(1)> and its changing trend are dramatic over QXP in the summer. There are three strong centers of < Q(1)> over the south side of QXP with obvious differences in the amount of yearly precipitation and the number of heat sinks predominate in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China (NWC), beside the northern QXP with an obvious higher intensity in years with less precipitation. (2) In the summer, the variation of the heat source's vertical structure is obviously different between greater and lesser precipitation years in eastern northwest China (ENWC). The narrow heat sink belt forms between the northeast QXP and the southwestern part of Lake Baikal. In July and August of greater precipitation years, the heating center of the eastern QXP stays nearly over 35 degrees N, and at 400 hPa of the eastern QXP, the strong upward motion of the heating center constructs a closed secondary vertical circulation cell over the northeast QXP (40 degrees-46 degrees N), which is propitious to add precipitation over the ENWC. Otherwise, the heating center shifts to the south of 30 degrees N and disappears in July and August of lesser precipitation years, an opposite secondary circulation cell forms over the northeast QXP, which is a disadvantage for precipitation. Meanwhile, the secondary circulation cell in years with more or less precipitation over the ENWC is also related to the heat source over the Lake Baikal. (3) The vertical structure of the heat source over the western QXP has obvious differences between greater and lesser precipitation years in western northwest China in June and July. The strong/weak heat source over the western QXP produces relatively strong/weak ascending motion and correspondingly constructs a secondary circulation cell in lesser/greater precipitation years.

From the calculations, the observed spin-Hamiltonian parameters of Tm3Al5O12:Yb3+ are explained reasonably and the optical spectrum band positions are suggested.

In the calculations, the required crystal-field parameters are estimated from the super position model which enables correlation of the crystal-field parameters and hence the SH parameters wit h the tetragonal distortion (characterized by Delta R = R-parallel to - R-perpendicular to, where R-parallel to and R-perpendicular to denote the metal-ligand distances parallel with and perpendicular to the tetragonal axis) of Cu(H2O)(6)(2+) centres. The calculated SH parameters from both methods are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values, suggesting that both PTM and CDM can explain satisfactorily the SH parameters of 3d(9) ions in crystals. The tetragonal distortion of the Cu(H2O)(6)(2+) centres. in ZnMF6 center dot 6H(2)O crystals are also obtained from the calculations. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

J	Chen, ZM; Yang, KQ; Wu, HY				Chen Zhong-Ming; Yang Kang-Quan; Wu Hong-Yu			Mechanism of heavy rainfall maintenance and increment in convergence excited by coupling forces between dynamic and thermodynamic fields	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						torrential rainfall; evolution of divergence; barotropic non-equilibrium force; baroclinic coupling forces between dynamic and thermodynamic fields	Q-VECTOR	According to the occurrence and maintenance of torrential rain relating closely to moisture convergence increment in low layer of troposphere, factors affecting the evolution of divergence is analysed to reveal the dynamic mechanism of heavy rainfall maintenance. Starting from the primitive equations, we obtain a new type of divergence equation including the coupling forces between Q vector and vertical shear of wind. Analysis on this equation brings to light the main factors to influence the evolution of divergence. They are separately the barotropic non-equilibrium force and the baroclinic coupling forces between Q vector and vertical shear of wind. Especially, the evolution of divergence is only controlled by tire above-mentioned two factors on the layer with the maximum convergence. In addition, the definite integral for new type of divergence equation is formed from the earth's surface to the un-divergent level. Results show that the self-exciting process of divergence fields lead to the decrease of convergence in the low layer of troposphere. Oppositely, the barotropic non-equilibrium force and the baroclinic coupling forces between Q vector and vertical shear of wind are the main factors that promote the increment of convergence in the air column, which we should pay more attention to in studying the mechanism of heavy rainfall maintenance.

Our results showed that the most abundant BDE congeners in surface sediments were BDE47, 99 and 209, with a median value of 0.044, 0.03, and 5.22 ng g(-1), respectively. The levels of BDE209 in our samples were much higher relative to those of the other BDE congeners and made up more than 90% of the PBDEs levels in almost all samples. Disregarding BDE209, of the remaining 9 BDE congeners the most abundant ones were BDE47 and 99, which contributed 35.7% and 24.6%. respectively, to the median of the 9 congeners. The contribution of the Beijiang River to the PBDE pollution burden of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) was small in comparison to that of the Dongjiang River and the Guangzhou section of the Zhujiang River. PBDEs in the Beijiang River mainly came from use of deca-BDE and penta-BDE with a minor contribution of octa-BDE. The poor correlation between PBDE and TOC may indicate that PBDEs concentrations in the sediments of the Beijiang River were controlled not only by TOC contents, but also by a combined effect of transport, mixing, depositional mechanisms associated with PBDEs, uncontaminated sediments, or fresh input of PBDEs.

The scheme for reproducing a new generation is very simple. Control parameters, of the length of the list of historical best solutions and the "learning probability" of the current solutions being moved towards the current best solutions and towards the historical ones, are used to assign different search intensities to different parts of the feasible area and to direct the updating of the current solutions. Results of numerical tests on minimization of the 2D Schaffer function, the 2D Shubert function and the 10D Ackley function show that this algorithm is effective and efficient in finding multiple global solutions of multimodal optimization problems.

Under the condition of upper or lower semicontinuity, a new criterion be obtained for the existence of a fuzzy preinvex mapping: a fuzzy preinvex mapping can be achieved when the invex subset of R(n) satisfies certain conditions. The relations between generalized convex fuzzy mappings are discussed, and some properties are obtained that relate the concepts of fuzzy pseudoinvex and fuzzy prequasiinvex mapping, fuzzy invex and fuzzy preinvex mapping, fuzzy preinvex and fuzzy prequasiinvex mapping. We also discuss the relationship between the fuzzy variational-like inequality (the fuzzy weak variational-like inequality) and fuzzy optimization problems, and an application example of a fuzzy variational-like inequality: the fuzzy variational-like inequality representation of a fuzzy transportation equilibrium problem.

J	Duan, WS; Liu, XC; Zhu, KY; Mu, M				Duan, Wansuo; Liu, Xinchao; Zhu, Keyun; Mu, Mu			Exploring the initial errors that cause a significant "spring predictability barrier'' for El Nino events	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM; ENSO PREDICTION; COUPLED MODEL; GROWTH; UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMICS; MONSOON; PACIFIC	Within the Zebiak-Cane model, we identify two types of initial errors that have significant season-dependent evolutions related to the spring predictability barrier (SPB) for El Nino events. One type includes the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) errors that have a zonal dipolar pattern with positive anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific and negative ones in the eastern equatorial Pacific; the other type consists of the SSTA errors with a spatial structure opposite to that of the former type, the zonal dipolar pattern shows negative anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific and positive anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The patterns of these two types of errors are nearly opposite of each other. The former causes the El Nino event to be underpredicted, and the latter causes the El Nino event to be overpredicted. For strong El Nino events the former tends to have a larger effect on the predictions than the latter, but for weak El Nino events, it is very difficult to determine which type of initial errors results in worse predictions. It is thought that strong (weak) El Nino events could be affected by strong (weak) nonlinearities. There are also other initial errors; however, they do not yield considerable season-dependent evolutions nor can a common characteristic be extracted from their patterns. The two types of initial errors suggest two dynamical behaviors of error growth related to the SPB: in one case, the initial errors grow in a manner similar to the El Nino events; in the other case, the initial errors develop with a tendency opposite to the El Nino events. The two types of initial errors may capture the errors that exhibit significant season-dependent evolutions related to the SPB. In addition, they may provide information regarding the "sensitive area'' of ENSO predictions because of their localized regions. Therefore, if these types of initial errors exist in the realistic El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) predictions and if a data assimilation or a target method can filter them, the ENSO forecast skill may be improved. For ensemble forecast studies, different signs of prediction errors caused by the two types of initial errors could illustrate why the ensemble mean offers a better forecast than a single prediction.

J	Wang, B; Fang, YJ; Lin, HG; Li, Y				Wang Biao; Fang YingJue; Lin HongGang; Li Yi			The improved QV signature scheme based on conic curves over a"currency sign (n)	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES F-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						conic curve over Z(n); digital signature; RSA; low exponent attacks; KMOV; QV	RSA	The classical RSA is vulnerable to low private exponent attacks (LPEA) and has homomorphism. KMOV based on elliptic curve E (n) (a,b) over a"currency sign (n) can resist LPEA but still has homomorphism. QV over E (n) (a,b) not only can resist LPEA but also has no homomorphism. However, QV over E (n) (a,b) requires the existence of points whose order is M (n) = lcm{a (TM)-E (p) (a,b), a (TM)-E (q) (a,b)}. This requirement is impractical for all general elliptic curves. Besides, the computation over En(a,b) is quite complicated. In this paper, we further study conic curve C (n) (a,b) over a"currency sign (n) and its corresponding properties, and advance several key theorems and corollaries for designing digital signature schemes, and point out that C (n) (a,b) always has some points whose order is M (n) = lcm{a (TM)-E (p) (a,b), a (TM)-E (q) (a,b)}. Thereby we present an improved QV signature over C (n) (a,b), which inherits the property of non-homomorphism and can resist the Wiener attack. Furthermore, under the same security requirements, the improved QV scheme is easier than that over E (n) (a,b), with respect plaintext embedding, inverse elements computation, points computation and points' order calculation. Especially, it is applicable to general conic curves, which is of great significance to the application of QV schemes.

Especially, the variation of temperature in terms of space and time, as well as the hotspot and thermal runaway phenomena are discussed. Suppose the heated object is a cylinder and the incident electromagnetic (EM) wave is plane wave, the problem turns out to be a coupling calculation of 2D multi-physical fields. The integral equation of EM field is solved using the method of moment (MoM) and the thermal conduction equation is solved using a semi-analysis method. Moreover, a method to determine the equivalent complex permittivity of reactant under the heating is presented in order to perform the calculation. The numerical results for water and a dummy chemical reaction (A) show that the hotspot is a ubiquitous phenomenon in microwave heating process. When the radius of the heated object is small, the highest temperature occurs somewhere inside the object due to the concentration of the EM wave. While the radius increases to a certain degree, the highest temperature occurs somewhere close to the surface due to the skin effect, and the whole high temperature area shows crescent-shaped. That is in accordance with basic physical principles. If the radius is kept the same in the heating process, the hotspot position of water does not change, while that of reaction A with several radius values varies. For either water or A, the thermal runaway phenomenon in which small difference of radius results in large difference of highest temperature, occurs easily when the radius is small. On the contrary, it is not evident when the radius is large. Moreover, it is notable that the highest temperature in water shows oscillating decreasing trend with the increase of radius, but in reaction A almost decreases monotonously. Further study should be performed to determine if this difference is only an occasional occurrence.

Due to its power in global search, it is widely applied in symbolic regression. However, little work has been done to apply it to real parameter optimization yet. This paper proposes a real parameter optimization method named Uniform-Constants based GEP (UC-GEP). In UC-GEP, the constant domain directly participates in the evolution. Our research conducted extensive experiments over nine benchmark functions from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2005 and compared the results to three other algorithms namely Meta-Constants based GEP (MC-GEP), Meta-Uniform-Constants based GEP (MUC-GEP), and the Floating Point Genetic Algorithm (FP-GA). For simplicity, all GEP methods adopt a one-tier index gene structure. The results demonstrate the optimal performance of our UC-GEP in solving multimodal problems and show that at least one GEP method outperforms FP-GA on all test functions with higher computational complexity.

The results show that the self-steepening effect can cause the characteristic of the pulse trains to vary with time, which is different from the self-steepening-free case where the generated pulse trains consist of single pulses which are identical in width, intensity, and interval, namely when pulses move a certain distance, they turn into the pulse trains within a certain time range. Moreover, each single pulse may split into several sub-pulses. And as time goes on, the number of the sub-pulses will decrease gradually and the pulse width and the pulse intensity will change too. With the increase of the self-steepening parameter, the distance needed to generate time-dependent pulse trains will shorten. In addition, for a large self-steepening parameter and at the distance where more sub-pulses appear, the corresponding frequency spectra of pulse trains are also wider.

Properties of intuitionistic fuzzy approximation operators are examined. Relationships between intuitionistic fuzzy rough set approximations and intuitionistic fuzzy topologies are then discussed. It is proved that the set of all lower approximation sets based on an intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation space forms an intuitionistic fuzzy topology; and conversely, for an intuitionistic fuzzy rough topological space, there exists an intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation space such that the topology in the intuitionistic fuzzy rough topological space is just the set of all lower approximation sets in the intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation space. That is to say, there exists an one-to-one correspondence between the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation spaces and the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy rough topological spaces. Finally, intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo-closure operators in the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximations are investigated.

By this analysis, factors of pharmacokinetics, curative effect and adverse reaction are compared, and then evaluating index system is established based on these factors. The result shows that pharmacokinetic factors have played the most important roles in the synthetical evaluation, while the factors of curative effects contributed less to the evaluation because of the drug resistance. This can well reflect the special condition: the long therapeutic course in tuberculosis therapy. Pharmacological Test and Toxicological test should be emphasized before clinical application for the purpose of improving the quality of drugs. This can form an alliance of optimizing therapeutic decision making and better quality of life for patients.

Defect model and spin-Hamiltonian parameters for the tetragonal Mo5+ and W5+ centers in Cs2ZrCI6 and Cs2HfCI6 crystals	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article						Mo5+; W5+; crystal field; defect structures; electron paramagnetic resonance; inorganic materials; spectroscopy	ATOMIC SCREENING CONSTANTS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; UP-CONVERSION; SCF FUNCTIONS; TRANSITION; IONS; EXCITATION; COMPLEXES; SPECTRUM; HALIDES	The spin-Hamiltonian (SH) parameters (g factors g(parallel to), g(perpendicular to) and hyperfine structure constants A(parallel to), A(perpendicular to)) of tetragonal MIC16- (M-I = Mo, W) centers in cubic Cs2MCl6 (M = Zr, Hf): M-I(5+) crystals are calculated from high-order perturbation formulas based on a two-mechanism model. These contain the contributions to SH parameters from both the crystal-field (CF) mechanism concerning the CF excited states and the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism concerning the CT excited states. In the calculations, two possible defect models are suggested for the tetragonal MIC16- centers. In model I, one Cl- ion shifts towards the M-I(5+) impurity by Delta Z(I) along the C-4 axis due to electrostatic repulsion between the Cl- ion and a neighboring charge compensator, monovalent anion, at the interstitial site. In model II, two Cl- ions are displaced towards M-I(5+) by Delta Z(II) along the C-4 axis due to the Jahn-Teller effect. The calculated results show that, to obtain a good fit between calculated and experimental SH parameters, the required displacement Delta Z(I) (which is about twice the displacement Delta Z(II)) is too large to be regarded as reasonable. Thus, model II seems more likely. The contributions of the CT mechanism to SH parameters are important and, for high valence state d(n) ions in crystals, the exact calculations of the SH parameters should take both CF and CT mechanisms (the latter is omitted in the widely used CF theory) into account.

The structure, morphology and light transmittance of the prepared samples were tested subsequently, and the results show: 0) The CdS films deposited under different oxygen partial pressure all present predominating growth lattice orientation ( 103), and further more the films will be strengthened after annealed under CdCl(2) atmosphere. (2) The AFM images of CdS show that the films are compact and uniform in grain diameter, and the grain size becomes larger with the increased substrate temperature. Along with it, the film roughness was also augmented. (3) The transmittance in the shortwave region of visible light through the CdS films would be enhanced when its thickness is reduced, and that will help improve the shortwave spectral response of CdTe solar cells. Finally, the prepared CdS films were employed to fabricate CdTe solar cells, which have achieved a conversion efficiency of 10.29%, and thus the feasibility of CSS process in the manufacture of CdTe solar cells was validated primarily.

The results show that the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of Meiyu precipitation are not homogeneous in the Yangtze-Huaihe Rivers basins but with prominent inter-annual and inter-decadal variabilities. The key region between the anomalies of Meiyu precipitation and the monthly sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) lies in the west wind drift of North Pacific, which influences the precipitation anomaly of Meiyu precipitation over a key period of time from January to March in the same year. When the SST in the North Pacific west wind drift is warmer (colder) than average during these months, Meiyu precipitation anomalously increases (decreases) in the concurrent year. Results of SVD are consistent with those of composite analysis which pass the significance test of Monte-Carlo at 0.05.

Moreover, although the DOA estimation methods based on the maximum likelihood have higher resolution than the beamforming and the subspace based methods, prohibitively heavy computation limits their practical applications. Hence, In this paper we propose a low-complexity adaptive moving target tracking algorithm, which includes a suboptimal DOA estimation algorithm that combines the advantages of the lower complexity of subspace algorithm and the high accuracy of ML based algorithms, and a Kalman filtering based adaptive tracking algorithm that models the dynamic property of directional changes for mobile terminals. Simulation results show that this proposed algorithm has better performance of DOA estimation and tracking of MS than the conventional ML or subspace based algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness over multipath fading channels.

The procedures of the PPDC model are described as follows. Firstly, a multi-factor Cluster problem can be converted into a single-factor (projected characteristic value) Cluster problem according to linear projection. Secondly, a new projection index on the basis of dynamic cluster rule is set Lip in the PPDC model, which successfully avoids the problem of parameter calibration and makes objective Cluster results. Thirdly, genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize projection direction of the PPDC model. Finally, the developed PPDC model is used in a case Study of regional partition of water resources in China to evaluate its application. The Cluster results Of the PPDC model agree well with the actual regional partition of water resources in China, indicating that the PPDC model is a powerful tool in multi-factor Cluster analyses and Could be a new method for regional partition of water resources.

It is known that there exists lambda* < 0 such that the equation with suitable boundary conditions has at least one positive solution for each lambda >= lambda* and has no positive solutions for lambda < lambda*. The known numerical result shows lambda* = -0.1988. In this paper, lambda* is an element of [-0.4, -0.12] is proved analytically by establishing a singular integral equation which is equivalent to the Falkner-Skan equation. The equivalence result provides new techniques to study properties and existence of solutions of the Falkner-Skan equation.	[Lan, K.

In this paper, therefore, a novel computationally efficient functional link neural network cascaded with Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial is proposed to combat nonlinear ISI. The equalizer has a simple structure in which the nonlinearity is introduced by functional expansion of the input pattern by trigonometric polynomial and Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial Due to the input pattern and nonlinear approximation enhancement, the proposed structure can approximate arbitrarily nonlinear decision boundaries. It has been utilized for nonlinear channel equalization. The performance of the proposed adaptive nonlinear equalizer is compared with functional link neural network (FLNN) equalizer, multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and radial basis function (RBF) along with conventional normalized least-mean-square algorithms (NLMS) for different linear and nonlinear channel models. The comparison of convergence rate, bit error rate (BER) and steady state error performance, and computational complexity involved for neural network equalizers is provided. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Starting from November, the PM10 pollution intensifies, and reaches mid to high alert level of air pollution, continues until April next year, and is at low alert level in the summer. In the winter and spring, the TSP concentration is 2-10 times higher than the third-level criterion of air quality (severe pollution).

The calculated band gap of doping gamma-Si3N4 was found to significantly decrease after the introduction of La. The band structures of gamma-Si3N4 behave like semiconductors for low La concentration and metal for high La concentration. The calculated optical properties showed that the static dielectric constant of gamma-Si3N4 doped with La is much higher than that of undoped gamma-Si3N4, so it may act as a new dielectric and refractive material.

The band gap (E-g) of Y-doped gamma-Si3N4 is found to significantly decrease in comparison to that Of gamma-Si3N4. The calculated E-g suggests that gamma-Si3N4 doped with low Y content can be used in the window or absorption material of solar cell, while those doped with high Y concentrations can show metal behavior. The calculation of optical properties shows that the static dielectric constant of gamma-Si3N4 doped with Y is much higher than that of the undoped gamma-Si3N4, implying its special applications in electronics and optics.

J	Liu, SY; Xiao, WD; Liu, P; Ye, ZX				Liu Shengyu; Xiao Wende; Liu Pei; Ye Zhixiang			Feasibility study of new limestone flue gas desulfurization process	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER			English	Article						flue gas desulfurization; absorption; mass transfer; additives; limestone	SO2 ABSORPTION; PILOT-PLANT; BUBBLING REACTOR; SUSPENSIONS	A new method based on conventional limestone flue gas desulftirization (FGD) has been developed. The main difference compared to the conventional wet FGD is the utilization of granular limestone with acetic acid additives as the absorbent, which should save on the power required for pulverization of limestone and pumping the circulation slurry. This paper focuses on a feasibility study of the new limestone FGD process by comparing SO, removal efficiency, SO2 absorption rate, limestone utilization and FGD system stability of the new FGD with those of the conventional FGD, in the same absorption equipment under the same experimental conditions. The results show that when the coarse limestone slurry (-80+100 mesh, US standard) is used directly as the absorbent, its utilization and SO2 removal efficiency, are very low at 44 and 60.7%, respectively. When the mixed slurry, which is composed of coarse limestone and 10-30 mmol/L acetic acid absorbs SO2, the degree of desulfurization is increased to 95% and the limestone utilization is enhanced to 93.5%. Finally, for the absorbent consisting of a fine limestone slurry (-300 mesh), the desulfurization efficiency and limestone utilization are 88 and 92.9%, respectively, under the same operating conditions. Therefore, the new desulfurization process is shown to be very feasible.

The results of our research may lead to the following conclusions: (1) A positive correlation relationship exists between TP NDVI change and its surface heat source, including the sensible heat and the latent heat. As to the correlation of the former, it is more remarkable in western TP than in eastern TP, and as to the correlation of the latter, however it turns out contrary. (2) With the improvement of TP vegetation, its surface heat source of every season is also mainly reinforced, especially in summer. As to the contribution of the sensible heat and the latent heat to the increment of the TP surface heat source intensity, the former is comparatively more significant than the latter in winter and spring, while in summer and autumn, the two have almost the same importance. (3) The correlation coefficient between summer NDVI over TP and the corresponding period precipitation of China displays a belt distribution of (+-+) from south to north China. (4) Anomalous surface heating field over TP derived from vegetation change is probably an important factor to affect summer precipitation of China.

Combined use of MODIS, AVHRR and radiosonde data for the estimation of spatiotemporal distribution of precipitable water	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							WINDOW TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE; LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SPLIT-WINDOW; RADIANCE MEASUREMENTS; VAPOR CONTENT; GPS DATA; RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHM; ABSORPTION; ATMOSPHERE	In this paper, the atmospheric precipitable water (PW) was estimated by means of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal channels brightness temperature difference (DT), over the broader area of Greece. The AVHRR derived DT was calculated in a grid of 5 x 5 km cells; the corresponding PW value in each grid cell was extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 2 product (near infrared algorithm). MODIS derived PW values were adjusted to the AVHRR overpass time by using PW rates of change. These rates were estimated from time series of radiosonde measurements, provided by four synoptic meteorological stations located in Athens, Thessaloniki, Heraklion and Izmir. Next, to estimate the relationship between adjusted PW and DT, a robust linear regression algorithm was applied. Since regression coefficients corresponded to the broader area of Greece, the regression relationship was applied to AVHRR data for the period 2001-2005, to predict the annual and seasonal variability of PW over the study area. Radiosonde derived PW values at the above synoptic stations were used to validate the AVHRR derived PW spatiotemporal distribution. A very good agreement between radiosonde and AVHRR derived PW values was observed since a RMSE of 0.46 cm was calculated using a validation data set that covered a five years period.

The blind deconvolution algorithm based on maximum-likelihood estimation technique is used to restore the intermediate image acquired by a digital detector. The effects of optical aberrations and the noise on the restoration image are explored. To demonstrate the validity of the method proposed, the computer simulation and laboratory experiments are carried out for the imaging of the optical system with primary aberration. The results have shown that the present method is well suited for effectively improving the imaging quality of the optical system with certain aberration, thus making the optical system resolution close to or reach the diffraction-limit of the optical system.

A composite analysis of diurnal cycle of GPS precipitable water vapor in central Japan during Calm Summer Days	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							GLOBAL-POSITIONING-SYSTEM; EXTENDED SEA BREEZE; RADIO INTERFEROMETRY; NUMERICAL EXPERIMENT; CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY; UNITED-STATES; SEMI-BASIN; TEMPERATURE; METEOROLOGY; ATMOSPHERE	The diurnal variations of water vapor in central Japan were investigated with GPS-derived precipitable water (PWV) and surface meteorological data as classified to three kinds of locations. Twenty-five clear days in central Japan in August 2000 were investigated to clarify the role of water vapor in the nocturnal maximum in the diurnal cycle of convective rainfall. The diurnal variations of PWV and some meteorological factors were composite during the selected days at 6 stations. The PWV shows a clear diurnal cycle with the amplitude of 3.4mm to 8.8mm and changes little during the period from the morning to noon. The daily amplitude of PWV is the largest in basin and smallest in plain although mean of PWV keeps high value in plain. A typical feature of the diurnal variation in central Japan is a maximum appearing in the evening. The time of maximum is from 1800 LST to 2000 LST, and minima appears at noon nearly in mountainous area and basin, while in early morning in plain. The diurnal maximum of PWV appears earlier in mountainous region than in plain. A diurnal cycle of specific humidity can be observed in all locations, and the amplitude in mountainous region is especially large compared with that in basin and plain. It is important to notice that there are remarkable differences in specific humidity among the six stations. The results suggest that the diurnal variation of PWV seems to be strongly affected by the local thermal circulations generated by the topography around these stations. The moisture transport causes the differences in phase of the diurnal cycle of PWV between different locations as well as the phase difference in precipitation. A very clear diurnal variation in surface air temperature is similar to that of solar radiation, with a minimum in the morning and a maximum in early afternoon. Maximum of surface wind speed are corresponded to peak of precipitation very well. It can be concluded that the amplitude of solar radiation increases with altitude as opposed to the situation of PWV generally. The precipitation observed frequently in the evening also shows a similar diurnal variation to that of the PWV, indicating the peak of precipitation appearing in late afternoon or in the evening over central Japan. Meanwhile the PWV reaches its nocturnal maximum. There is a good relationship between the diurnal cycle of observed precipitation and that of the PWV.

Applications of ICA for the enhancement and classification of polarimetric SAR images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FIXED-POINT ALGORITHM; APERTURE	Independent components analysis (ICA) based methods for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image speckle reduction and ground object classification are studied. Several independent components can be extracted from polarimetric SAR images using ICA directly. The component with lowest speckle index is regarded as the scene after speckle reduction. The disadvantage of this method is that only one image is kept and most polarization information will be lost. In this paper, we use ICA-sparse-coding shrinkage (ICA-SPS) based speckle reduction method, which is implemented on each individual image and can keep polarization information. It is carried out on the combined channels obtained by Pauli-decomposition rather than original polarization channels in order to keep relative phase information among polarization channels and get better performance. After ICA-SPS, the effect of speckle suppression on SAR image classification can be compared favourably with other methods by combining the channels into a false colour image. At last, a new ICA-based classification method is presented. In this method, four independent components are separated by ICA from five polarization and combined channels. One of these independent components which includes little ground object information is regarded as speckle noise and therefore be discarded. The remaining three components can be treated as subordination coefficients of three kinds of targets. A classified image can be obtained based on the components. And by composing these three channels in RGB colour pattern, a false colour image can be constructed.

This paper attempts to research the application of grey target theory in clinical antibiotic selection so as to give a reference to drug selection. We take the synthetical evaluation of antituberculosis drugs as an example: first, choose some influential factors as the index of antituberculosis drugs to get the primary data; then, establish an evaluating index system based on these factors. The evaluation result is obtained by grey relational analysis and calculation about these drugs. Finally, the order of drugs can be worked out. The result shows that some of these drugs such as RPT, SPFX, AZ, LVX and MFX have advantages than other antituberculosis drugs; in addition, drug development is very important in medical field. Grey target theory can be practically applied in the evaluation of antibiotic selection during medical clinical works.

This study investigates how the shortening or lengthening of the circadian period of the environmental lighting schedule affects the circadian and extra-circadian structure of locomotor activity in mice, with particular focus on the circasemiseptan, circaseptan, and circadecadian components with anticipated periods of about 3.5, 7, and 10 days, respectively. Methods. The locomotor activity of mice kept on different light-dark (LD) cycles was automatically monitored around the clock for about five weeks. The data were analyzed by linear-nonlinear rhythmometry. Results. As anticipated, in LD12:12, a prominent circadian rhythm was observed, with a marked 12-hour component qualifying the circadian waveform. By comparison, in LD10:10 and in LD14:14, the circadian rhythm had a reduced amplitude and a period close to that of the environmental synchronizer. Extra-circadian variation was then also demonstrated. In conclusion, circadian lighting schedules affect a broader-than-circadian time structure of locomotor activity in mice.

Firstly, we model OD flows as Fratar model and introduce the constrained relations between traffic matrix and link loads. By combining partial flow measurement, we can get a good prior value of network tomography. Then a good estimation of traffic matrix is attained with the modified network tomography method. Finally, we use the real data [8] from network Abilene to validate our method. In contrast to TomoGravity [1], the results show that our method improves remarkably and the estimation of traffic matrix is closer to real data, and especially when the flow is small and changes dramatically, the estimation is better.

This notion of well-posedness can be interpreted as some sort of well-posedness under perturbation in terms of Hausdorff set-convergence.

Under a convexity assumption, we show that the extended B-well-posedness is closely related to property (H).

Studying this interaction is beneficial for understanding dynamics of climate change as well as forecasting future climate change. On the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, the highest plateau in the world, interaction between ecosystem physiological processes and climate affect mid-levels of the atmosphere, so the study of this interaction has a special significance. We use two models, a carbon cycle model (CCM3) and a land surface model (LSM), to simulate ecosystem carbon cycle characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau and its influence on climate. The CO2 flux varies seasonally with ecosystem physiology processes on the Plateau: fluxes are highest in summer and lowest in winter. The seasonal variation of vegetation net CO2 flux shows that vegetation is an atmospheric carbon sink during most of the year, except in winter. This means that vegetation could weaken the greenhouse effect, which is important in terms of global warming. The land ecosystem is a weak carbon source from October to April, and it is a carbon sink from May to September (especially between June and August). The Tibetan Plateau CO2 fluxes vary spatially. The fluxes are highest over the southwest and southeast boundary areas and the northeast region of the Plateau in summer, and are lowest in the middle and northwest regions in winter. The interaction of CO2 flux and temperature shows that higher temperatures increase vegetation photosynthesis and all respiration. The abrupt increase in land ecosystem physiological processes with increasing temperature indicates that any warming due to increased atmospheric CO2 caused by human activity will be weakened by the land ecosystem over the Tibetan Plateau.

After 1 year's operation, a successful treatment for swine wastewater had been developed, without adding alkali or external organic matter. The anaerobic unit can maintain chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of approximately 85% during most times of the year, while removing 5% of NH4+-N. The anaerobic unit recovered 5000-7000 m(3)d(-1) of biogas in summer and 2500-3500 m(3)d(-1) in winter. In aerobic units, more than 85% of COD could be removed, with a COD concentration of around 300 mgl(-1) in the effluent. More than 98% of NH4+-N could be removed with an NH4+-N effluent concentration of about 10mgl(-1). The results confirmed that the addition of raw wastewater to the digested effluent was the key for stable operation of the aerobic unit. It can be concluded that treatment plants using the ANARWIA process can reach similar treatment effects to those plants using the sequence batch reactor (SBR) to directly treat raw wastewater. However, the hydraulic retention time (HRT), the constructing investment for the reactors, the power consumption and the running costs of the ANARWIA process are remarkably lower than those using the direct SBR process.

The multiframe blind deconvolution algorithm for improving the resolution of object images based on the maximum-likelihood estimation was presented. From the record images the object function and point spread function were estimated by the conjugation gradient optimization method. The reduction of photon noise was reached by using the smoothing low-pass filter during the algorithm iteration. The restoration results of simulation and real data show that the proposed blind deconvolution algorithm can overcome the effects of the atmospheric turbulence, photon noise and collimating fault of optical system on object images, and improve the resolution of object images to arrive at the level of diffraction-limited.

The results show that the quintic nonlinearity plays a role similar to the case of neglecting the group-velocity mismatch in modifying the modulation instability, namely, the positive and negative quintic nonlinearities can still enhance and weaken the modulation instability, respectively. The group-velocity mismatch can considerably change the gain spectrum of modulation instability in terms of its shape, peak value, and position. In the normal dispersion regime, with the increase of the group-velocity mismatch parameter, the gain spectrum widens and then narrows, shifts to higher frequencies, and the peak value gets higher before approaching a saturable value. In the abnormal dispersion regime, two separated spectra may occur when the group-velocity mismatch is taken into account. With the increase of the group-velocity mismatch parameter, the peak value of the gain spectrum gets higher and shorter before tending to a saturable value for the first and second spectral regimes, respectively.

A time-frequency atom approach to extract the features of radar emitter signals was presented in this study. Based on the over-complete multiscale dictionary of Gaussian Chirplet atoms, the signals were decomposed into a linear expansion of atoms by the method of marching pursuit ( MP). Then, the improved quantum genetic algorithm was applied to effectively reduce the time-complexity at each search step of MP, and thus some intrinsic Chirplet atoms describing features of signals were obtained. Experiment results show that the Chirplet atom is better than the Gabor atom in extracting the feature parameters, which confirms the validity and feasibility of the approach.

In both of the normal and anomalous dispersion regions, the contour plots of gain spectra of modulation instability with gray levels, the critical perturbation frequency (or instability domain), and the peak perturbation gain versus the input powers of the two waves are analyzed and discussed. The results show that, the critical perturbation frequency (or instability domain) and the peak perturbation gain increase with the input power, reaching a maximum value, and then decrease. This leads to a unique value of peak perturbation gain and critical perturbation frequency for two different input powers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Notonly the group-velocity mismatch, but also the difference of the third-order dispersion of two optical waves will alter the gain spectra of modulation instability but in different ways.

The results indicated that the nano-LDHs species were responsible for the catalytic oxidation of the rich-carbon compound in oxygen atmosphere. In addition, the nano-LDHs species and their calcinated products at high temperature could increase the carbonaceous residue-shield of the carbon-rich materials, improve the quality and the graphitization degree of the formed char-layer, and accelerate the intumescence and expansion of the melting carbon-rich materials to a certain degree under the oxygen-free condition, leading to the carbonization and expansion of the intumescent layer.

The wide climate variability in this region significantly affects the local land ecosystem and could consequently lead to notable vegetation changes. In this paper, the interannual variations of the plateau vegetation are investigated using a 21-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset to quantify the consequences of climate warming for the regional ecosystem and its interactions. The results show that vegetation coverage is best in the eastern and southern plateau regions and deteriorates toward the west and north. On the whole, vegetation activity demonstrates a gradual enhancement in an oscillatory manner during 1982-2002. The temporal variation also exhibits striking regional differences: an increasing trend is most apparent in the west, south, north and southeast, whereas a decreasing trend is present along the southern plateau boundary and in the central-east region. Covariance analysis between the NDVI and surface temperature/precipitation suggests that vegetation change is closely related to climate change. However, the controlling physical processes vary geographically. In the west and east, vegetation variability is found to be driven predominantly by temperature, with the impact of precipitation being of secondary importance. In the central plateau, however, temperature and precipitation factors are equally important in modulating the interannual vegetation variability.

In this paper, we have grown PbI2 single crystal through a special craft, from which gamma-ray detector has also been fabricated. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates structure of the grown crystal is 2H with hexagonal space group Pempty setml. Infrared transmission measurement shows transmission rate of the grown crystal sample (10x10x1mm(3)) reaches 40% averagely in range of 400 similar to 4000cm(-1). Ultraviolet absorbing test indicates cut-off wavelength of the sample is 547.6nm, corresponding band gap of 2.27eV. Room temperature detector fabricated from the grown crystal is sensitive to Am-241 59.5KeV gamma-ray. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the obtained energy spectrum is 26.7KeV. All the results indicate the PbI2 crystal grown through the special craft is of good characteristics and can be used for gamma-ray detector. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

If nonlinear distortions in the channel can be removed, the performance of chaos-based communications systems can be improved. According to analysis of Volterra filter, a novel structure of neural network Legendre orthogonal polynomial equalizer is proposed based on the theory of chaotic signal reconstruction. Combining the characteristic of single layer neural network and structure of Legendre orthogonal polynomial, the equalizer is designed and realized after the analysis of a few parameter nonlinear filters, and adaptive algorithm is deduced using the normalized least mean square algorithm. To support the analysis, simulation results for nonlinear chaos-based communication channel are provided.

The impacts of thermal forcing on the flow field structure of vortex are analyzed. It is found that thermal forcing has significant impacts on the flow field structure, and the material representative forms of these impacts are closely related to the radial distribution of heating. The discussion for the analytical solutions for the vortex in the boundary layer can explain some main structures of the vortex over the Tibetan Plateau.

The basic structure of the heterostructure is PTPD/Alq3. When hole transport layer and electron transport layer are doped simultaneously with different dopant, the electroluminescence quantum efficiencies are about 3 times greater than that of the undoped device. Compared with undoped device and conventional TPD/Alq(3) diode, the stability of the doping device is significantly improved. The process of emission for doped device may include carrier trapping as well as Forster energy transfer.

A very low back-to-back insertion loss of 0.9dB and return losses better than 12.0 dB at the range of 31. 0 similar to 40.0GHz frequeDcies were obtained from the two-way transition structure. By using 4 GaAs monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit(MMIC) power amplifiers, the new combining circuit produced up to 6W maximum power output with a gain variation of +/- 1.21 dB within the band of interest (32.0 similar to 36.0GHz). The average combining-efficiency over the operating band was estimated at 82%. This combiner also provides an excellent thermal property, sustaining as much as 25W of dc power consumed by the MMIC amplifiers. The measured results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
