Rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase boundary can be formed in the ceramics with a wide composition range of x = 0.04-0.08 by simultaneously increasing rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) phase transition temperature (TR-O) and decreasing orthorhombic-tetrahedral (O-T) phase transition temperature (TO-T). The R-T phase boundary warrants a large piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)) of similar to 418 pC/N as well as a high Curie temperature (T-C) of similar to 242 degrees C in the ceramics with chi = 0.04, and a high electric field-induced strain of similar to 0.33% (S-max/E-max - 983 pm V (-1)) as well as a large d33 (similar to 408 pC/N) can be attained in the ceramics with chi = 0.07. Especially, a high recoverable energy density (W-rec-0.54 J/cm(3)) can be gained in the ceramics with chi = 0.10 under a low breakdown strength (similar to 129 kV/cm). The piezoelectricity sensitive to sintering or poling temperatures can be weakened by introducing Ho element, that is, a high d(33) of 400-458 pC/N can be attained in a wide range of sintering temperatures (1070-1120 degrees C) and poling temperatures (13-120 degrees C). We believe that this investigation can be a significant promotion on the development of practical applications in (K, Na) NbO3-based ceramics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a cylindrical surface spectrum and arc distance-based sampling frequency selection method for multiband RF signals. In this method, a 3D visual expression of cylindrical surface spectrum of digital signal is introduced. This expression reflects better the circulatory nature of the spectrum of digital signals. It is found more intuitive, heuristic, and effective in dealing with undersampling issues of multiband RF signals than conventional spectrum expressions are. A function of arc distance between two frequency bands are also introduced which turns out to be useful in the determination of sampling frequency and design of digital filters.

Zinc acetate, ethanol and mono-ethanolamine (MEA) were used as a metal precursor, solvent and stabilizer, respectively. The structural and optical properties of ZnO thin films were investigated and found to be strongly dependent on the annealing temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that as the annealing temperature increased, the crystalline quality of the samples became better. The atomic force microscope images of the samples show larger and compact grains at higher heat-treating temperature. The ultraviolet-visible transmittance spectra indicated that as the temperature increased, the transmittance improved and the energy gap became larger (from 3.11 eV at 400 degrees C to 3.22 eV at 500 degrees C). The photoluminescence spectra presented a variety of emission peaks, two strong peaks at 390 nm and 469 nm, respectively, from the intrinsic emission and point defects, and the intensity of these peaks decreased with the increase of temperature.

The effectiveness of the method was verified by several cases. The results show that the velocity dealiasing algorithm based on radar Doppler spectra processing is effective with high success rate and stability. Success rates of 15 cases reach 100%. It can also find out the fuzzy type and correct radial velocity and spectrum width. With this method, noisy clutter are filtered validly and missing data can be filling well. The plankton echoes can almost be removed clearly while the small scale cloud can be remained.

After allocating each product's production cost and revenue to each path, we establish a profit network graph. An equilibrium PTPMM matrix and a -combination equilibrium are proposed based on a generalization of the well-known Wardrop's equilibrium principle. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the -combination equilibrium are proposed using a linear scalarized profit function. We prove that solving the PTPMM network equilibrium problem can be reduced to the solving of the weak vector variational inequality problem, which proposes an algorithm for the PTPMM problem. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate an application of these theoretical results.

The energy gaps of As-doped GaN nanowires with different concentrations exhibit indirect band gaps, and the band gaps are decreasing with the increasing doping concentration. The results predicate that alloys exhibit a typical semiconductivity. Moreover, the optical properties, including the complex dielectric function, optical refractive index, energy-loss function, reflectivity, and absorption coefficient are discussed for radiation up to 30 eV. With the increase of the As-fraction, the material gradually exhibits noticeable anisotropy in the photon energy range of 0-15 eV. Quickly increases the static dielectric constant and obviously red-shifts the absorption edge. The results are in good agreement with experimental data reported previously. Furthermore, the work gives a theoretical guidance for the preparation of As-doped GaN optoelectronic nanodevices.

In our protocol, TP is allowed to misbehave on its own but can not conspire with either of two parties. Compared with most two-user QPCE protocols, our protocol not only can compare two groups of private information (each group has two users) in one execution, but also compare just two private information. Compared with the multi-user QPCE protocol proposed, our protocol is safer with more reasonable assumptions of TP. The qubit efficiency is computed and analyzed. Our protocol can also be generalized to the case of 2N participants with one TP. The 2N-participant protocol can compare two groups (each group has N private information) in one execution or just N private information.

The uptake constant of PFAAs increased with increasing carbon chain length, whereas the elimination coefficient displayed the opposite trend, suggesting that carbon chain length plays an important role in the bioaccumulation of PFAAs. When the contribution of suspended particulate matter was taken into account, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) became lower (3.61-600 L/kg) compared with BAFs derived from only considering the absorption from free PFAAs in water (3.85-97000 L/kg). The results indicate that suspended particulate matter in water constitutes an important source of exposure for aquatic organisms to long-chain PFAAs. Linear (n-)PFOS was preferentially accumulated compared with branched isomers in carp. Among the branched isomers, 1m-PFOS displayed the greatest bioaccumulation, whereas m(2)-PFOS had the lowest. Linear PFOS displayed greater partitioning ability from blood to other tissues over branched PFOS (br-PFOS) isomers, leading to a relatively lower n-PFOS proportion in blood. In summary, suspended particulate matter made a contribution to the accumulation of long-chain PFAAs in aquatic organisms, and n-PFOS was preferentially accumulated compared with br-PFOS isomers.

The crystal structure, electrical properties, and magnetic properties of the ferrites were investigated. The results show that the single phase structural SrFe12O19 ferrites can be obtained even with a low sintering temperature of 900 degrees C. The Bi2O3 additive is found to possess a significant effect on the electrical properties and magnetic properties for the ferrites sintered at low temperatures enhancing resistivity rho, saturation magnetization M-s, intrinsic coercivity H-ci, and magnetic anisotropy field H-a. It is suggested that the low-temperature sintered SrFe12O19 ferrites with rho of 0.42x10(8) Omega.cm, M-s of 285.6 kA.m(-1), H-ci of 347.3 kA.m(-1), and H-a of 1546.6 kA.m(-1) provide an important potential application in nonreciprocal LTCC (low temperature co-fired ceramics) ferrite devices.

Software as a kind of artificial complex networks, where entities of the software are nodes and interactions between entities are edges. These interactions are data-flows, instruction-flows and control-flows of the software, and these flows driving hardware circuit is the internal cause of power consumption of software. In this paper, we model software systems as complex networks at architecture level, assuming that the relation between the network characteristics of software and its power consumption is nonlinear. Based on this assumption, we propose a software power modeling method at architecture level. The model first measures network characteristics of software and then fit the nonlinear relation between the network characteristics of software and its power consumption by BP neural network. Experimental results show that our model could accurately estimate power consumption of the software, and the error is less than 11.2% compared to the measured value, which indicates our assumption is reasonable and our model is effective.

The system is based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of Wi-Fi signals. A new undersampling algorithm is developed to address the imbalanced data problem associated with the OISVM, and a kernel function parameter selection algorithm is introduced for the training process. The time complexity of both the training process and the prediction process are significantly decreased. Comparative experimental results indicate that the training speed and the prediction speed are improved by at least ten and five times, respectively. Furthermore, through online learning, the estimation error is decreased by 0.8 m. Such an improvement makes the proposed method an ideal indoor positioning solution for portable devices for which the processing power and the memory are limited.

The nanoparticle exhibits optical gain in a particular wavelength region. The equivalence of the generalized and alternative expressions of the Lorentz force density relating to bound charges for chiral media is numerically validated. By considering the two-dimensional electromagnetic problem of incident plane waves normally impinged on active chiral cylinders, it is shown that the gradient force is mainly contributed by the bound electric and magnetic current densities of the cross-polarized waves. We also investigate how the medium parameters and impedance mismatch can be used to manipulate the pulling or pushing Lorentz forces between two chiral cylinders. This finding may provide a recipe to understand the light interaction with multiple chiral nanoparticles of arbitrary shapes (in general) with the aid of the numerical approach. It could be a promising avenue in controlling the optical micromanipulation for chiral nanoparticles with mirroring asymmetry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the growth of population and technological expertise and the declining emission-to-output ratio described in the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, the projected carbon emission is 13.7 Gt C, resulting in a 2.4 degrees C warming by the end of the twenty-first century (2080-2099) compared with 1980-1999. This paper also suggests the importance of the land and ocean carbon cycle in determining the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It is hoped that in the near future the next generation of coupled earth system models that include both the natural system and the social dimension will be developed.

H3TiO5 nanofibres blended with nano-sized carbon black were first prepared by the direct hydrothermal processing, and then Ti3O5 submicron rods could be obtained by sintering the prepared nanofibres at 1250 degrees C for 3 h. The microstructure and formation of phases in the reduction process were investigated, respectively. In addition, the oxygen sensing properties of the synthesised materials were preliminarily investigated by gas-sensing measurement. The results indicated that the electrical conductivity of the Ti3O5 submicron rods varied with the oxygen concentration, and the responses increased as the oxygen concentration increased at 200 degrees C.

The results show that MODIS_3K AOD agrees well with the AOD derived from the CE-318 sun photometer, with a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.91). And we used the MODIS AOD product analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the annual, seasonal and monthly distribution of AOD in the Sichuan area over the last ten years (2006-2015). In the Sichuan area, the mean change of AOD over the 10-year period showed a significant decreasing trend, reaching its maximum in 2010 and its minimum in 2015. Considering only the first five years, the lowest value was reached in 2008 and the overall trend was a standard symmetrical "V" type. Over the later five years, the annual average AOD value showed an overall decreasing trend. The monthly averaged AOD indicated a "double peaks" fluctuation trend; the two peaks appeared in March and August, and AOD changes were relatively small between September and January. Overall, the average value of AOD reached its highest values in spring, and its lowest values in autumn. In the city of Chengdu, the monthly and seasonal changes in the trend were essentially the same as those of the whole Sichuan area; However, the Chengdu AOD monthly and seasonal average change rate was higher than that of Sichuan as a whole. This shows that Chengdu is still the main contributor to the enhanced AOD value for the entire Sichuan region. The spatial distribution of AOD values indicates an "east high, west low" situation across the Sichuan area and Chengdu is one of three cities with the highest AOD values. However, the spatial variation of AOD trend value indicated an "east low, west high" the spatial distribution across the Sichuan region, opposite to the spatial distribution. Moreover, in the past 10 years, the overall AOD changes in Sichuan showed a downward trend, especially in Chengdu, suggesting that environmental remediation measures have achieved initial improvements. But, average AOD of some parts of western Sichuan is increasing, indicating that other regions in Sichuan should strengthen their management and remediation of haze weather. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The as prepared hierarchical microspheres is about 8-10 mu m in diameter assembled with porous nanosheets which favors charge transport. The formation process has been studied which is to form nanosheet first and then to self-assemble and finally to grow spheres. The band structure of Mn2O3 microspheres is confirmed through XPS valence spectrum and UV-vis,verfiying that it is suitable for hydrogen reduction. The H-2 production efficiency of hierarchical Mn2O3 microspheres is found to three time higher than that of Mn2O3 particles.

The effect of Zn substitution on the structural, magnetic and electrical properties have been investigated. The DTA and TG results indicate that there are three steps of combustion process. The X-ray diffraction patterns show that there are Fe2O3, CuO and CuFeO2 secondary phases and tetragonal structure when x=0.0. Furthermore, the lattice parameter and the average crystallite size decrease, and the X-ray density increases with the increase of Zn substitution. The saturation magnetization increases with the increase of Zn substitution when x <= 0.40, and decreases when x > 0.40. Meanwhile, the coercivity monotonically decreases with the increase of Zn substitution. The polarization behavior for all the samples in the test frequency range of 100 Hz to 10 MHz obeys the charge polarization mechanism. Electrical transport behavior of the ferrites nanopowders is same with the impurity semiconductor, and the effect of Zn substitution on the temperature dependence of dc resistivity is observed.

Depending on different initial excitations and system parameters, abnormal double, triple, and quadruple composite dissipative solitons as well as single dissipative solitons can be observed. The composite dissipative solitons may consist of identical or different types of pulsating solitons. Moreover, the creeping solitons and the single ordinary pulsating solitons can even appear in the parameter regions where originally the other types of pulsating solitons exist. Besides, before evolving into each abnormal dissipative soliton, the initial finite energy Airy pulse or pulse pairs generally exhibit very interesting and unique early evolution behavior.

Here, we report a giant piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)) of 550 pC/N and a high Curie temperature (T-C) of 237 degrees C in (1-x-y)K(1-w)Na(w)Nb(1-z)Sb(z)O(3-)xBiFeO(3-)yBi(0.5)Na(0.5)ZrO(3) (KNwNSz-xBF-yBNZ) ceramics by optimizing x, y, z, and w. Atomic-resolution polarization mapping by Z-contrast imaging reveals the intimate coexistence of rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases inside nanodomains, that is, a structural origin for the R T phase boundary in the present KNN system. Hence, the physical origin of high piezoelectric performance can be attributed to a nearly vanishing polarization anisotropy and thus low domain wall energy, facilitating easy polarization rotation between different states under an external field.

As the increased loss of anisotropic ENZ metamaterial brings decreased propagation loss for oblique incidence, the transmission of incident light is enhanced which induces a different distribution of transverse shift peaks. Based on simulation results, the influences of ENZ permittivity components and thickness as well as gold layer thickness on transverse shift of left-circularly polarized light in ENZ/Au/ENZ waveguide are analyzed. In order to make our results convincing we make use of alternating thin layers of silver and germanium stacking to construct anisotropic ENZ metamaterial. The transverse shifts of incident light with different ENZ metamaterial and gold layer thicknesses are obtained. Calculation results show the maximum transverse shifts of left-polarized light for linear polarized light can achieve 49.6 microns. Meanwhile, the enhanced SHE of transmitted light is invariant with the variation of gold layer which shows a great tolerance to fabrication error.

The direct-current (DC) resistivity from room temperature (RT) to 750 degrees C is mainly dominated by metallic-conduction mechanism and semi-conduction mechanism, which can be responsible for the single metal-semiconductor (M - S) transition behavior. But the double M - S transitions and conduction relaxation are observed with alternating current (AC) measurement in a frequency range of 1 kHz-10 MHz. These abnormal electrical transport behaviors are suggested to be attributed to the coexistence of conduction electrons with different activation energy. The multi particle polarization behavior is obtained in the ferrites from the variation of real permittivity and dielectric loss with temperature, and the space charge polarization mechanism is found to determine the non-linear relationship of P-E. Furthermore, the La3+-Co2+ substitution exhibits significant effects on the electrical transport and dielectric characteristics for the ferrites. Typically, when the substitution amount increases from 0 to 0.3, the activation energy E-a increases from 0.331 to 1.068 eV, the RT resistivity rho d increases from 2.2 x 10(9) to 3.7 x 10(9) Omega cm, and the average value of real permittivity epsilon'(RT-100 degrees C) measured at 1 kHz decreases from 4.15 to 2.29.

The main results show that air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation are two dominant factors controlling daily gross primary production. Soil temperature and soil water content are the main factors controlling ecosystem respiration. Canopy photosynthetic activity is also responsible for the variation of daily ecosystem respiration other than environmental factors. No clear correlation between net ecosystem exchange and environmental factors was observed at daily scale. Temperature sensitive coefficient was observed to increase with larger soil water content. High values of temperature sensitive coefficient occurred during the periods when soil water content was high and grass was active. Annual integrated net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production and ecosystem respiration were -191, 1145 and 954 g C m(-2) for 2010, and -250, 975 and 725 g C m(-2) for 2011, respectively. Thus, this alpine grassland was a moderate carbon sink in both of the two years. Compared to alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, this alpine grassland demonstrated a much greater potential for carbon sequestration than others. Annual precipitation is a dominant factor controlling the variation of annual net ecosystem exchange over this grassland. The difference in gross primary production between the two years was not caused by the variation in annual precipitation. Instead, air temperature and the length of growing season had an important impact on annual gross primary production. Variation of annual ecosystem respiration was closely related to annual gross primary production and soil water content during the growing season.

It was found that the formation of CO is preferred to that of HCOO, kinetically and thermodynamically, indicating that methane can be formed on the Pt-based catalysts preferably. Furthermore, rather low an activation barrier (0.34 eV) for the formation of trans-COOH species was found, compared with that on Pt(111) surface (0.59 eV), showing that the interface between Pt-4 cluster and gamma-Al2O3(110) slab promotes the hydrogenation of CO2. However, the activation barrier for the dissociation of cis-COOH species on the supported catalyst is 0.91 eV, which is much higher than that on pure metal surface (0.56 eV). An electronic transfer channel was found to reconcile the divergence. Our results indicate that Pt/gamma-Al2O3 should be a promising candidate for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 by adjusting the metal/support interface to balance the activation barriers for the formation of trans-COOH and the dissociation of cis-COOH species.

Anisotropic electrical and lattice transport properties of ordered quaternary phases Cr2TiAlC2 and Mo2TiAlC2: A first principles study	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Cr2TiAlC2 and Mo2TiAlC2; Electrical conductivity; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric property	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; MAX PHASES; NONMETALLIC CRYSTALS; TI3ALC2 CERAMICS; THERMOPOWER; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR; SE	Electrical conductivities of Cr2TiAlC2 and Cr2TiAlC2 in a and c directions are calculated from semi-classic Boltzmann transport theory. The values are found to be sigma(a) = 5.68 x 10(5) S/m (6.56 x 10(5) S/m) and sigma(c) = 2.15 x 10(5) S/m (2.69 x 10(5) S/m) for Cr2TiAlC2 (Cr2TiAlC2) at 300 K. Using the phonon-mode Debye temperature and Slack-model, the lattice thermal conductivities in the two directions are also evaluated, and the values are kappa(a) = 18.71 W/mK (16.11 W/mK) and kappa(c) = 0.48 W/m K (0.25 W/m K) for Cr2TiAlC2 (Cr2TiAlC2) at room temperature. The anisotropy in lattice thermal conductivity is found to be stronger than that of electrical conductivity. The predicted Seebeck coefficients and thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) indicate that they are poor thermoelectric materials. Due to the relatively high conductivities, they might be used to fabricate high temperature conductive components in aerospace industry. In addition, our results in a direction have the direct implications for the relevant properties of MXenes (Cr2TiC2 and Mo2TiC2), produced from their bulk phases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is an accurate and convenient way to solve problems involving two terminals. However, when faced with problems involving three or more terminals, which are more common in practical applications, existing conformal mapping methods apply assumptions or approximations. A general exact method does not exist for a structure with an arbitrary number of terminals. This study presents a conformal mapping method for multiple terminals. Through an accurate analysis of boundary conditions, additional terminals or boundaries are folded into the inner part of a mapped region. The method is applied to several typical situations, and the calculation process is described for two examples of an electrostatic actuator with three electrodes and of a light beam splitter with three ports. Compared with previously reported results, the solutions for the two examples based on our method are more precise and general. The proposed method is helpful in promoting the application of conformal mapping in analysis of practical problems.

The incompressible nature of these tetragonal TMN2 (TM = Ti, Zr, and Hf) compounds has been demonstrated by the calculated elastic moduli, originating from the strong N-N covalent bonds that connect the TMN8 units. However, as compared with traditional fcc transition metal mononitride (TMN), the TMN2 possess a larger elastic anisotropy may impose certain limitations on possible applications. Further mechanical strength calculations show that tetragonal TMN2 exhibits a strong resistance against (100)[010] shear deformation prevents the indenter from making a deep imprint, whereas the peak stress values (below 12 GPa) of TMN2 along (110)[1 (1) over bar1] shear directions are much lower than those of TMN, showing their lower shear resistances than these known hard wear-resistant materials. The shear deformation of TMN2 at the atomic level during shear deformation can be attributed to the collapse of TMN8 units with breaking of TM-N bonds through the bonding evolution and electronic localization analyses.

In this study, we modified both d(33) and T-C by the construction of phase boundaries using a different chemical composition. As shown in this manuscript, the relationships among the composition, phase boundary and electrical properties can be well established. By designing a series of material systems of 0.95K(0.40)Na(0.60)NbO(3)-0.05Bi(0.5)M(0.5)HfO(3) {M: Li, (Li, Na), (Li, K), (Li, Ag), (Li, Na, K), (Li, Ag, Na), (Li, Ag, K), (Li, Ag, Na, K), Ag, (Ag, Na), (Ag, K), (Ag, Na, K), Na, K, (Na, K)}, the orthorhombic-tetragonal (O-T) phase boundary can be well established and the enhanced d33 of 330-370 pC N-1 and a high T-C of 308-320 degrees C can then be attained simultaneously in the ceramics without Li. In particular, there is also an improved temperature stability of d33 in KNN-BAH ceramics, i.e., a high d33 of 200 pC N-1 and d(33)* of 300 pm V-1 can be shown by the ceramics even if the measurement temperatures reach 150 degrees C. As a result, a balanced development of three parameters can be well realized in KNN-BMH ceramics and we believe that this material system will give a clear understanding about the comprehensive behaviors of KNN-based ceramics with a high T-C.

It differs from all other known congeneric species by the densely dentate leaf margin, the pendulous pedicels, the scarlet flowers, the compressed filaments, and the triangular connective. To better understand taxonomy of this new species, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using a combined dataset from nrITS, plastid trnL-trnF region, and atpB-rbcL spacer. The results indicate that Caltha is monophyletic and C. dysosmoides is sister to C. sinogracilis. The conservation status of the new species is categorized as CR based on IUCN criteria.

The results showed that the deterioration of water quality has intensified at river estuary and aquaculture area. Meanwhile, these regions dominated by plants had relatively low dissolved oxygen concentrations. UV-vis spectra showed lower humification degree and simpler molecular structure in the DOM collected from the pollutant-receiving region. The analysis of PCA combined with synchronous fluorescence spectra yielded two principal components (PCs) that account for 99.44% of the variance. PC1 showed a dominant protein-like fluorophore at 279 nm and PC2 was characterized by dominated fulvic-like fluorophores (325 and 331 nm). The results of PCA indicated that DOM collected from the river estuary, the aquaculture region, and the eutrophication area exhibited a higher protein-like fluorophore, and higher PC1 and lower PC2 loadings (PC1>0.7, PC2<0.4). Meanwhile, a higher fulvic-like fluorophore existed in the DOM samples collected from a clean region (PC1<0.4, PC2>0.7). HCA identified four clusters that accorded with the PCA results. This study suggested that water quality and the sources, and spectral characteristics of DOM were influenced mainly by human activities (agriculture, industrial, and domestic wastewater from upstream, food and excrement from aquaculture) and natural processes (aquatic-plant and microorganism activities).

Annual distribution of 187,008 ER visits that took place between 2009 and 2011 in Beijing, China displayed regularity rather than random characteristics. The annual cycle from the Fourier series fitting of the number of ER visits was found to explain 63.2% of its total variance. In this study, the possible effect and regulation of meteorological conditions on these ER visits are investigated through the use of correlation analysis, as well as statistical modeling by using the Distributed Lag Non-linear Model and Generalized Additive Model. Correlation analysis indicated that meteorological variables that positively correlated with temperature have a positive relationship with the number of ER visits, and vice versa. The temperature metrics of maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures were found to have similar overall impacts, including both the direct impact on human mental/physical conditions and indirect impact on human behavior. The lag analysis indicated that the overall impacts of temperatures higher than the 50th percentile on ER visits occur immediately, whereas low temperatures show protective effects in the first few days. Accidental casualties happen more frequently on warm days when the mean temperature is higher than 14 degrees C than on cold days. Mean temperatures of around 26 degrees C result in the greatest possibility of ER visits for accidental casualties. In addition, males were found to face a higher risk of accidental casualties than females at high temperatures. Therefore, the IPEC-classified ER visits are not pure accidents; instead, they are associated closely with meteorological conditions, especially temperature.

In particular, the CS algorithm is performed in the real-valued system model, and the activated antenna indices, which are used to transmit the real and imaginary parts of QSM symbols, can be estimated separately. In order to further improve the performance of QSM, a novel search strategy is proposed.

J	Liu, C; Shan, YQ; Liu, XN; Yang, KJ; Liao, HS				Liu, Chao; Shan, Yuqi; Liu, Xingnian; Yang, Kejun; Liao, Huasheng			The effect of floodplain grass on the flow characteristics of meandering compound channels	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Vegetation; Meandering compound channel; Stage-discharge curve; Velocity; Secondary flow; Reynolds shear stress	DEPTH-AVERAGED VELOCITY; SUBMERGED FLEXIBLE VEGETATION; BED OPEN-CHANNEL; EMERGENT VEGETATION; OVERBANK FLOWS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; ANALYTICAL-MODEL; OVERLAND FLOWS; FINITE PATCH; MOBILE BED	Laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale meandering compound channel to investigate the effect of floodplain grass on the main flow field in the channel. Three-dimensional velocity fields, turbulences, and Reynolds shear stresses were measured along half a meander. The experiments revealed that flexible artificial grass planted on a floodplain can significantly reduce the conveyance capability of the entire channel. Two parallel stage-discharge curves increased with increasing flow depth. The additional resistance of the floodplain grass increased the streamwise velocity and conveyance in the main channel along a meander. An analysis of the generation mechanism of secondary flows in the main channel indicated that the secondary current consisted of an enhanced original secondary cell that was strengthened by the centrifugal force and a component of the upstream floodplain flow. The relative dominance of these two components in the secondary flows was primarily determined by the angle between the floodplain flow and the main channel ridge, and also the floodplain roughness. At the same flow depth, the secondary flow in cases with grass on the floodplain was generally stronger than that in the case of a smooth meander bend, although it was weaker near the middle cross-over section. Floodplain grass enhanced the intensity of the lateral turbulence above the bankfull level and significantly modified the turbulence structure, although it had a negligible effect on the vertical turbulence except at the bend entrance. Floodplain grass also affected the Reynolds shear stresses in the main channel, generating stronger lateral shear stresses at a low flow depth. In contrast, at a high flow depth, the distribution of the interface shear stresses changed entirely while its magnitude remained the same. When the floodplains were grassed, the vertical shear stress that was induced by secondary flows was greater at the apexes but reduced at the cross-over sections. These observations highlight the important effects of floodplain grass on the main channel flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the complex phase and valence states of the vanadium oxides, understanding the microstructure and optical properties of this material with different oxygen stoichiometries has been challenging. In this study, we show that confocal Raman microscopy mapping can resolve the phase distribution in a large vanadium oxide thin film sample area, therefore providing a useful tool for a structure-property relationship study of this material. A new Raman peak at 166 cm(-1) is observed in oxygen rich VO2 films, which forms micron size islands in the films, and is attributed to the characteristic peak of V4+/V5+ mixed valence states. The mixed valence state structure exists in a large oxygen partial pressure window during thin film fabrication. By joining the structural analysis and optical constants fitted by the Drude-Lorentz model using effective medium theory, the influence of different phases and valence states to the optical constants of the vanadium oxide thin films is clearly observed. These results provide in-depth understanding of the structure-optical property relationship of vanadium oxide thin films.

In this paper, wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition is proposed as a valid technology for enhancing geophysical responses in specific frequency bands, in the same way as traditional spectrum decomposition methods do. The calculation of wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition, which decomposes the original seismic volume into a series of common quefrency volumes, employs a sliding window to move over each seismic trace sample by sample. The key factor in wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition is the selection of the sliding-window length as it limits the frequency ranges of the common quefrency section. Comparison of the wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition with traditional spectrum decomposition methods, such as short-time Fourier transform and wavelet transform, is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition and the relation between these two technologies. In hydrocarbon detection, seismic amplitude anomalies are detected using wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition by utilizing the first and second common quefrency sections. This reduces the burden of needing dozens of seismic volumes to represent the response to different mono-frequency sections in the interpretation of spectrum decomposition in conventional spectrum decomposition methods. The model test and the application of real data acquired from the Sulige gas field in the Ordos Basin, China, confirm the effectiveness of the seismic amplitude anomaly section using wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition for discerning the strong amplitude anomalies at a particular quefrency buried in the broadband seismic response. Wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition provides a new method for measuring the instantaneous cepstrum properties of a reservoir and offers a new field of processing and interpretation of seismic reflection data.

Strong correlations between the PSA and ENSO occurred during the periods 1956-1975 and 1990-2004 [referred to as the high correlation (HC) periods], but the correlations were weak for the periods 1928-1956 and 1975-1990 [referred to as the low correlation (LC) periods]. Both the processes of surface air-sea coupling in the extratropical/tropical Pacific, and subsurface ocean temperature evolution along the equator associated with the PSA, were found to be stronger during the HC periods than during the LC periods, thereby resulting in a stronger influence of the PSA on the subsequent ENSO during the HC periods. Changes in the PSA-ENSO relationship can be attributed mainly to interdecadal changes in the intensity of the austral summer PSA. The latter was found to have contributions from both the modulation of the Pacific decadal oscillation and long-term variations in the Southern Annular Mode.

It is a high-impact precipitation-generating weather system in this region and a large downstream area. A climatology of the SWV over 1979-2010 is presented here. Results indicate that the SWV is a common regional weather system with about 73 annual occurrences. Two primary genesis regions are identified, one in the Sichuan basin and another one in the southeast flank of the Tibetan Plateau. SWV genesis displays seasonality with a spring-summer preference and diurnal variations. The average life cycle, horizontal dimension, and translation speed are 15.1 h, 435 km, and 8.6 m s(-1), respectively. SWVs are classified into four types that show regional and seasonal contrasts in structure. In type I, the winter-spring elevated dry vortex in the basin is vertically confined to a shallow layer between 850 and 600 hPa and tilts northeastward. The low-level vortex has a cold center, and the middle to upper levels feature baroclinicity. In type II, the nighttime warm-season precipitating vortex system in the basin has a deep structure with the cyclonic vorticity extending from the surface into the upper troposphere. The nonsevere precipitating vortex (type IIa) is weakly baroclinic and tilts northward with height, whereas the severe precipitating vortex (type IIb) is vertically aligned. For type III, in the southern mountains, the shallow surface-based vortex develops in a well-mixed boundary layer and vertically tilts in the upslope direction and has a warm and lowhumidity core. For type IV, the heavy precipitating vortex in the mountainous region is large, deep, and nearly upright with a fairly barotropic environment.

The detectors were built with two orthogonal directions configuration as the bias electric field parallel to the crystallographic c-axis E//c and perpendicular to the c-axis EaSyenc. It presents the electrical anisotropy including resistivity, dark current, carrier transport and x-ray induced photoelectricity properties with considering the configuration of bias field and c-axis. A mechanism of carrier scattering effect from anisotropic lattice structure, dislocation and stacking fault could be mainly responsible for this anisotropy property in PbI2 crystal. All the results indicate that the crystal orientation will be taken into account when we design and fabricate the x-ray detectors based on PbI2 crystals or films.

This study shows that the outflow flux of sulfate (SOT) in three major tributaries of the Upper. Yangtze River in the Sichuan Basin in southwest China has been increasing over the last three decades, which implies the regional soil acidification caused by increasing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Since 2005, the outflow of SO42- to the Upper Yangtze River from the Sichuan Basin has even reached the atmospheric SO2 emission from the basin. In contrast to S emissions, the rapid increase in nitrogen (N) emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3), have resulted in only a slight increase in nitrate (NO(3) over bar) concentrations in surface waters, indicating a large retention of N in the basin. Although N deposition currently contributes much less than S to soil acidification in this area, it is possible that catchments receiving a high input of N may be unable to retain a large fraction of the N deposition over long periods.

The as prepared AgInZnS/RGO nanocomposites was composed of AgInZnS nanoparticles of 7-8 nm and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheet. Moreover, the AgInZnS/RGO nanocomposites demonstrated slight red shifted absorption and photoluminescence quenching, which could be attributed to the effective separation of photon-generated carrier of AgInZnS nanoparticles and fast electrical transportation of RGO sheet. Furthermore, the as-prepared AgInZnS/RGO nanocomposites showed relatively strong photo response, comparable short rise-time (0.62 s) and decay-time (0.29 s), which makes it as promising applications in photoelectric detection.

It combines the advantages of two-layer and three-layer repulsive actuators, i.e., fabrication requirements and fill factor. A theoretical model for the proposed actuator is developed and solved through the numerical calculation of Schwarz-Christoffel mapping. Theoretical and simulated results show that the pseudo-three-layer actuator offers higher performance than the two-layer and three-layer actuators with regard to the two most important characteristics of actuators, namely, driving force and theoretical stroke. Given that the pseudo-three-layer actuator structure is compatible with both the parallel-plate actuators and these two types of repulsive actuators, a 19-element two-layer repulsive actuated deformable mirror is operated in pseudo-three-layer electrical connection mode. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the pseudo-three-layer mode produces a larger displacement of 0-4.5 mu m for a dc driving voltage of 0-100 V, when compared with that in two-layer mode.

Compared to conventional approaches, other than the avoidance of an end-capping procedure, the current protocol is remarkably advanced in the aspect of eco-friendliness, step-and cost-economy, and, of special significance, the purity of polymer products. As illustrative examples, six 5,5'-bithiazole-based polymers are synthesized using this new method, demonstrating higher number-average molecular weight (M-n up to 33700) in better yields (up to 93%) through only one step. The evolution of C-H/C-H-type DArP from heavy metal salts to O-2 alone as the oxidant could solve the problem of metal residues in polymers, which is considered harmful to the performance of devices.

Consequently, an increasing number of internet users are drowning in a sea of data. Big Personal Data has enormous commercial value; it is a new kind of data asset. An urgent problem has thus arisen in the data market: How to price Big Personal Data fairly and reasonably. This paper proposes a pricing model for Big Personal Data based on tuple granularity, with the help of comparative analysis of existing data pricing models and strategies. This model is put forward to implement positive rating and reverse pricing for Big Personal Data by investigating data attributes that affect data value, and analyzing how the value of data tuples varies with information entropy, weight value, data reference index, cost, and other factors. The model can be adjusted dynamically according to these parameters. With increases in data scale, reductions in its cost, and improvements in its quality, Big Personal Data users can thereby obtain greater benefits.

The present study established tracer sources based on HJ-1 satellite data, micropulse light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data, and backward trajectories simulated using the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Additionally, the present study analyzed the diffusion conditions for the sources and characteristics of the pollutant transport in this pollution event through simulation using a mesoscale atmospheric chemistry transport model-the weather research forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-CHEM). The results show that the change in the boundary-layer height over Chengdu had a relatively large effect on the vertical diffusion of pollutants. During the pollution event, Chengdu, Meishan, and Leshan were areas of significantly low mean ventilation coefficients (VH). In Chengdu, the VH was extremely low at night, and there was a temperature inversion near the ground, resulting in the continuous accumulation of pollutants at night and a continuous worsening of the pollution. During the period of heavy pollution, there were straw-burning sites in Meishan, Ziyang, Neijiang, Zigong, and Deyang. On 7 May 2014, the pollutants in Chengdu mainly originated from Meishan. The accumulation in Chengdu of pollutants originating in Meishan and Deyang led to highly concentrated pollution on 8 May 2014, to which the pollutants originating in Deyang were the main contributor. The transport of pollutants resulting from straw burning in the study area and the relatively poor conditions for the pollutant diffusion in Chengdu collectively led to the heavy air pollution event investigated in the present study.

Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with parameterizations electrification and discharging, we performed 30 simulations by varying both the CCN concentration and water vapor content below the freezing level. The sensitivity simulations showed a distinct response to increased concentrations of CCN, depending on the water vapor content below the freezing level. Enhancing CCN concentrations increased electrification processes of thunderstorms and produced a new negative charge region above the main positive charge center when there were ample amounts of water vapor below the freezing level. Conversely, there were weak effects on electrification and the charge structure in numerical experiments initialized with lower water vapor content below the freezing level.

The physical mechanism of tunneling mode is analyzed by the condition of general zero average permittivity. The influence of anisotropy, loss and dispersion of HMM on tunneling modes is discussed based on simulation results. Tunneling mode merging or splitting can be realized by adjusting the thickness of air or HMM. We can also find the absorption of HMM significantly reduces the transmittance peak of tunneling mode. When a recently reported HMM of ZnAlO/ZnO multilayer is introduced in the FTIR structure, the combined action of HMM loss and dispersion brings many small tunneling modes in the angular spectrum. The tunneling mode in the proposed structure can be used to design filters and wavelength selectors which may also have applications in wavelength de-multiplexing in optical communications.

J	Bai, AJ; Li, GP				Bai Aijuan; Li Guoping			Climatology of monsoon precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau from 13-year TRMM observations	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; RAINFALL; REGION	Based on the 13-year data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite during 2001-2013, the influencing geographical location of the Tibetan Plateau (Plateau) monsoon is determined. It is found that the domain of the Plateau monsoon is bounded by the latitude between 27A degrees N and 37A degrees N and the longitude between 60A degrees E and 103A degrees E. According to the annual relative precipitation, the Plateau monsoon can be divided into three sections: the Plateau winter monsoon (PWM) over Iran and Afghanistan, the Plateau summer monsoon (PSM) over the central Plateau, and the transiting zone of the Plateau monsoon (TPM) over the south, west, and east edges of the Plateau. In PWM and PSM, the monsoon climatology has a shorter rainy season with the mean annual rainfall of less than 800 mm. In TPM, it has a longer rainy season with the mean annual rainfall of more than 1800 mm. PWM experiences a single-peak monthly rainfall with the peak during January to March; PSM usually undergoes a multi-peak pattern with peaks in the warm season; TPM presents a double-peak pattern, with a strong peak in late spring to early summer and a secondary peak in autumn. The Plateau monsoon also characterizes an asymmetrical seasonal advance of the rain belt. In the east of the Plateau, the rain belt migrates in a south-north orientation under the impact of the tropical and subtropical systems' oscillation. In the west of the Plateau, the rain belt advances in an east-west direction, which is mainly controlled by the regional Plateau monsoon.

It is still unclear whether a stable snow-atmosphere coupled mode exists in the extratropics, like the ENSO in the tropics. Using Sliding Correlation analysis over Any Window, the present study quantitatively evaluates the stability of coupling relationships between the major modes of winter snow over the Northern Hemisphere and the winter atmospheric Arctic Oscillation (AO), the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and the Siberian High over the period 1872-2010, and discusses their possible relationships for different seasons. Results show that the first mode of the winter snow cover fraction and the winter AO together constitute a stable snow-atmosphere coupled mode, the SNAO. The coupled mode is stronger during recent decades than before. The snow anomaly over Europe is one key factor of the SNAO mode due to the high stability there, and the polar vortex anomaly in the atmosphere is its other key factor. The continuity of signals in the SNAO between autumn and winter is weaker than that between winter and spring. The second winter snow mode is generally stably correlated with the winter AAO and was more stable before the 1970s. The AAO signal with boreal snow has a strong continuity in seasonal transition. Generally, through these coupled modes, snow and atmosphere can interact in the same season or between different seasons: autumn snow can influence the winter atmosphere; the winter atmosphere can influence spring snow.

In order to obtain such a high-power dual-frequency laser as well as a balanced intensity distribution of the dual-mode, the seed laser wavelength was precisely tuned to spectrally match with the gain curve of the amplifier by employing a temperature controller. Finally, when the heat sink temperature of the amplifier crystal was kept at 30.0 degrees C, the dual-mode seed laser operated at 16.0 degrees C was amplified from 284.5 mW to 16.1 W with a balanced intensity distribution, and frequency separation was measured as 53.2 GHz.

Original images were decomposed into low frequency subband coefficients and bandpass direction subband coefficients by using the nonsubsampled contourlet transform. Three maps of visual salient features are constructed based on visual salient features the local energy, the contrast and the gradient respectively, and low-frequency subband coefficients are got by utilizing these visual saliency maps. The cross-contrast is obtained by computing the ratio between the local gray mean of bandpass direction subband coefficients and the local gray mean of fused low-frequency subband coefficients. Bandpass direction subband coefficients is goted by the cross contrast. Comparison experiments have been performed on different image sets, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better in both subjective and objective qualities.

To avoid additional computational step and improve the efficiency of the proposed model, a representation of contextual mixing proportion is adopted. Secondly, the spatial information of the pixels is closely related to the Gaussian distribution of their neighborhood system. Thirdly, the inherent relationship between the Gaussian distribution and the Student's t-distribution is adopted to optimize the unknown parameters of the proposed model, which simplifies the inference process and makes the proposed model to be easily implemented. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic noise images, simulated medical images and real-world grayscale images are presented to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed model in terms of the visual and quantitative comparison.

Based on this principle, we built a black target visiometer system using a photograph of a black object taken with an industrial camera, that has a relatively simple structure and automated operation. In this study, three commercial visibility instruments a forward scatter meter (CJB-3A) and two atmospheric transmission meters (LT31, VM100)-were compared to the black target visiometer system. Our results show that, within visibility ranges of up to 10 km, 1) all of the instruments agree well at low visibility and agree poorly at a visibility exceeding 5 km; 2) the forward scattering instrument has high bias at low visibility because particle absorption is not included; and 3) the best agreement with the black target method was obtained with the simple transmissometer rather than the forward scatter instrument or the hybrid transmissometer for a visibility range of up to 10 km.

Satellite estimates generally capture the overall spatial-temporal variation of precipitation over China with relatively better ability in warm seasons than in cold seasons. Meanwhile, satellite precipitation estimates also tend to show better agreement with gauge observations over humid regions than over arid and alpine regions. Analysis of the systematic and random error components suggests that the uncertainties in both TRMM3B42RTV7 and TRMM3B42V7 precipitation estimates are significantly reduced over most parts of China compared to the other three satellite products. Among the five products, the research product TRMM3B42V7 with bias adjustments agrees the most with the gauge observation in terms of spatiotemporal variation, amplitude and pattern of variability, occurrence of rainy events, and probability distribution function of the precipitation amount for different rain rates over most parts of China; the near-real-time product TRMM3B42RTV7 with the application of improved retrieval algorithms and more satellite data performs the second best over most subregions of eastern China. The improvements of TRMM3B42RTV7 without bias adjustments over eastern China relative to CMORPH, PERSIANN, and TRMM3B41RTV7 are encouraging and favorable for the operational applications.

The map of the PM2.5 and AOD levels showed large spatial differences in the aerosol concentrations and aerosol optical properties over China. The ranges of the annual mean PM2.5 and AOD were 10-117 mu g/m(3) and 0.12-1.11 from the clean regions to seriously polluted regions, from the almost arctic and the Tibetan Plateau to tropical environments. There were significant spatial agreements and correlations between the PM2.5 and AOD. However, the linear regression functions (PM2.5=A*AOD+B) exhibited large differences in different regions and seasons. The slopes (A) were from 13 to 90, the intercepts (B) were from 0.8 to 33.3, and the correlation coefficients (R-2) ranged from 0.06 to 0.75. The slopes (A) were much higher in the north (41-99) than in the south (13-64) because the extinction efficiency of hygroscopic aerosol was rapidly increasing with the increasing humidity from the dry north to the humid south. Meanwhile, the intercepts (B) were generally lower, and the correlation coefficients (R-2) were much higher in the dry north than in the humid south. There was high consistency of AOD versus PM2.5 for all sites in three ranges of the atmospheric column precipitable water vapor (PWV). The segmented linear regression functions were y=84.66x+9.85 (PWV<1.0), y=69.47x+11.87 (1.0<PWV<2.5), and y=52.37x+8.59 (PWV>2.5). The correlation coefficients (R-2) were high from 0.64 to 0.70 across China.

The proposed antenna can achieve gain enhancement by loading novel artificial materials structures (Split-ring Resonators) in the end-fire direction while broad bandwidth is realized by using elliptic dipole elements and a microstrip to coplanar balun. The measurements show that the proposed antenna have around 5-8 dB gain in the working band (5-11 GHz), which is around 2 dB more than the unloaded one. This antenna can be used in target recognition systems for its advantages of end-fire radiation broad bandwidth and high gain.

This study focuses on the abilities of climate models that participated in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to reproduce the physical processes involved in this observed cross-seasonal connection. A systematic evaluation suggested that 16 out of 25 models were essentially capable of reproducing this cross-seasonal connection. Two categories of models were selected to explore the underlying reasons for these successful simulations. Models that successfully simulated the cross-seasonal relationship were placed in the type-I category, and these performed well in reproducing the related physical mechanism, known as the "coupled ocean atmosphere bridge," in terms of the SST variability associated with the SAM and response of the meridional circulation to these SST anomalies. In contrast, the type-II category of models showed poor performance in representing the related processes and associated feedbacks, and the model biases compromised the performance of the simulated cross seasonal relationship. These results demonstrate that the capability of the CMIP5 models to reproduce SST variability associated with the boreal autumn SAM and related coupled ocean atmosphere bridge process plays a decisive role in the successful simulation of the cross-seasonal relationship.

In this Letter, a deformable mirror is employed as a programmable super-resolution pupil phase filter. Continuous phase-only filters based on the Zernike polynomial series are designed by the genetic algorithm and fitted through closed-loop adaptive optics with a piezoelectric deformable mirror. Experimental super resolution results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. This method has no polarization light requirement and is convenient for application.

The daily average columnarwater-vapor (CWV) over urban Beijing was retrieved using three methods (Methods A, B and C), and compared with the AERONETwater-vapor product. Finally, the seasonal relationships ofCWV with AOD(500nm) and alpha(440e870) were analyzed. The calibration results showed the calibration value to differ from the original value by about 4%. The CWV retrieval result showed that AERONET and the three methods of retrieval for CWV were highly correlated. The monthly average variation trends of AOD(500nm) and CWV were similar, with the maximum occurring in July, and the minimum in December. The seasonal average variation trends of AOD(500nm) and CWVwere also similar, but could be placed in the following order: summer > autumn > spring > winter. The seasonal variation of alpha 440e870 versus AOD(500nm), alpha 440e870 versus CWV, and AOD(500nm) versus CWV, showed increasing A(OD500nmwith) increasing CWV, which reflected the hygroscopicity of aerosol fine particle growth characteristics. Summerwas mainly characterized by fine particles; while spring, autumn and winterwere a mix of coarse and fine particles, showing typical urban aerosol properties.

The high sensitivity of our sensor makes it possible to detect weak ripple deflections (as low as 0.4 A) that are not readily resolved in the typical measurements of channel-base current in rocket-triggered lightning experiments. The discernible magnetic pulses within 1 ms after the inception of a sustained upward positive leader from the triggering wire can be classified into impulsive pulses and ripple pulses according to the discernibility of separation between individual pulses. The time scale (usually >20 mu s) of ripple pulses is substantially longer than the leading impulsive pulses (with time scales typically <10 mu s), and the amplitude is significantly reduced, whereas there is no considerable difference in the interpulse pulse. Along with our previous finding on the burst of magnetic pulses during the initial continuous current in rocket-triggered lightning, the new measurements suggest that the stepwise propagation might be a persistent feature for the upward positive leader in rocket-triggered lightning, and the stepping of positive leader early in triggered lightning could be characterized with the observation of ripple pulses. The precedence of impulsive magnetic pulse measured at 78 m range relative to the arrival of corresponding current pulse at the channel base indicates that the ionization wave launched by individual stepping of positive leader propagates downward along the triggering wire at a mean velocity of 1.23 x 10(8) m/s to 2.25 x 10(8) m/s.

Mobile communication cellular systems have become one of the most important communication systems in recent times and are used by millions of people around the world. Since the 1990s, considerable efforts have been taken to improve both the communication and security features of the mobile communications systems. However, these improvements divide the mobile communications field into different generations according to the communication and security techniques such as A3, A5 and A8 algorithms for 2G-GSM cellular system, 3G-authentication and key agreement (AKA), evolved packet system-authentication and key agreement (EPS-AKA), and long term evolution-authentication and key agreement (LTE-AKA) algorithms for 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) systems. Furthermore, these generations have many vulnerabilities, and huge security work is involved to solve such problems. Some of them are in the field of the public key cryptography (PKC) which requires a high computational cost and more network flexibility to be achieved. As such, the public key infrastructure (PKI) is more compatible with the modern generations due to the superior communications features. This paper surveys the latest proposed works on the security of GSM, CDMA, and LTE cellular systems using PKI. Firstly, we present the security issues for each generation of mobile communication systems, then we study and analyze the latest proposed schemes and give some comparisons. Finally, we introduce some new directions for the future scope. This paper classifies the mobile communication security schemes according to the techniques used for each cellular system and covers some of the PKI-based security techniques such as authentication, key agreement, and privacy preserving.

The particles and silicon are heated by the irradiation and they will expand differently due to their different expansion coefficients, making the particles easier to be removed. Laser plasma can ionize and even vaporize particles more significantly than an incident laser and, therefore, it can remove the particles more efficiently. The laser plasma shock wave plays a dominant role in removing particles, which is attributed to its strong burst force. The pressure of the laser plasma shock wave is determined by the laser pulse energy and the gap between the focus of laser and substrate surface. In order to obtain the working conditions for particle removal, the removal mechanism, as well as the temporal and spatial characteristics of velocity, propagation distance and pressure of shock wave have been researched. On the basis of our results, the conditions for nano-particle removal are achieved.

They can also be applied to evaluate the reliability of software. However, deducing a weakest precondition, as well as determining its propagation path, encounters challenges such as unknown constraint conditions, symbol computation and means of representation. To address these challenges, in this paper, we utilize the disjunctive normal form of if-else branch structure to capture reasonable propagation paths of the weakest precondition. Meanwhile, by removing the sequential dependencies, we demonstrate how to get the weakest precondition of loop-structure by leveraging program function. Moreover, we extensively explore three modeling characteristics (i.e., path extension, innermost connection and condition leap) for deducing the weakest precondition of structured programs. Finally, taking the definition of program node and storage structure of weakest precondition as bases, we design a serial of modeling algorithms. Based on symbol computation and recursive call technology with Depth-First Search (DFS), our algorithms can not only be used to deduce the weakest precondition, but also to capture the propagate path of the weakest precondition. Experiments illustrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed models and designed deductive algorithms.

The annual means of PM2.5 (PM10) were 62 +/- 45 (130 +/- 88) mu g m(-3) and 79 +/- 61 (142 +/- 96) mu g m(-3) in the city and suburban region, which were much higher than the regional background (PM2.5: 36 +/- 29 mu g m(-3)). The annual means of AOD were 0.53 +/- 0.47 and 0.54 +/- 0.46 and 0.24 +/- 0.22 in the city, suburban and the background region, respectively. The annual means of Angstrom exponents were 1.11 +/- 0.31, 1.09 +/- 0.31 and 1.02 +/- 0.31 in three typical stations. Meanwhile, the rates of PM2.5 accounting for PM10 were 44%-54% and 46%-70% in the city and suburban region during four seasons. The pollution of fine particulate was more serious in winter than other seasons. The linear regression functions of PM2.5 (y) and ground-observed AOD (x) were similarly with high correlation coefficient in the three typical areas, which were y = 74x + 18 (R-2 = 0.58, N = 337, in the City), y = 80x + 25 (R-2 = 0.55, N = 306, in the suburban) and y = 87x + 9 (R-2 = 0.64, N = 350, in the background). The functions of PM10 (y) and ground-observed AOD (x) were y = 112x + 57 (R-2 = 0.54, N = 337, in the city) and y = 114x + 68 (R-2 = 0.47, N = 304, in the suburban). But the functions had large differences in four seasons. The correlations between PM2.5, PM10 and MODIS AOD were similar with the correlations between PM2.5, PM10 and the ground-observed AOD. With MODIS C6 AOD, the distributions of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration were retrieved by the seasonal functions. The absolute retrieval errors of seasonal PM2.5 distribution were less than 5 mu g m(-3) in the pollutant city and suburb, and less than 7 mu g m(-3) in the clean background. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The device is made of a prism-coupling system, which consists of a prism and a CeYIG/Au/liquid waveguide. Systematic simulations using the finite element method and 4 x 4 transfer matrix methods are implemented to calculate the figure of merit (FOM) of sensitivity. Calculation results show that a FOM of 5.022/RIU for refractive index variation from 1.330 to 1.345 can be obtained when the incident wavelength is 980 nm. The proposed structure can achieve high angular sensitivity for the magnetic field of the proposed structure concentrated in the sensing medium. Meanwhile, our sensor, with gold as the bottom layer, is a better hydrophily for the molecular self-assembly technique compared with other conventional sensors, which makes it more practical in applications.

The data studied included spatial and temporal distributions of the precipitation; horizontal distributions and vertical structures of the precipitation system; convective storm top altitudes and types of rain; mean rainfall profiles; the influence of water vapor content before and after the rainfall; and the atmospheric circulation background. The results suggest that most precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau occurs in the southeast, and that the maximum near-surface precipitation rate for this event was more than 100 mm.h(-1). The convection was so powerful that the convective storm top altitude surpassed 16 km. Furthermore, the water vapor content caused obvious changes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) area. The mean rainfall profile can be roughly divided into four layers and showed that the maximum rainfall rate appeared at about 5.5 km. Deep weak precipitation provided the largest contribution to the total precipitation, while the highest average precipitation rate was from deep strong convective precipitation. The atmospheric circulation situation is conducive to the formation of strong convective weather, and the terrain is also an external factor affecting precipitation for this event.

Xihan 1.) at Dingxi, Gansu Province, China. The objective was to find evidence that global climate change is affecting the bioaccumulation of Cd and Zn in T. aestivum L. cv. Xihan 1. The results showed that compared to control A, elevated temperature and CO2 increased Cd bioaccumulation in the shoots by 1.4-2.5 times, and increased that in the roots by 1.2-1.5 times, but decreased Zn levels in wheat shoots by 1.4-2.0 times, while decreased that in the roots by 1.6-1.9 times. Moreover, temperature and CO2 concentration increase also led to increased Cd concentration, and decreased Zn concentration in subcellular compartments of wheat seedlings. The largest Cd concentration increase (174.4%) was observed in the cell wall and debris fractions of shoots after they were subjected to the highest CO2 and temperature treatment (TC3). The largest Zn concentration decrease (53.1%) was observed in the soluble (F3) fractions of shoots after they were subjected to the medium CO2 and temperature treatment (TC2). The temperature and CO2 increase had no significant effect on the proportional distribution of Cd and Zn in the subcellular fractions. The root-to-shoot translocation of Cd increased with the increasing temperature and CO2 concentration. However, the Zn distributions only fluctuated within a small range.

Seeking a new remote sensing drought monitoring technique is of great help to improve and develop the technique of drought monitoring and alert. The Bowen ratio, the ratio of sensible heat flux against latent heat flux, reflecting surface hydro-thermal characteristics, can be introduced to drought monitoring field. Using EOS-MODIS satellite data and synchronized meteorological data, the Bowen ratio drought monitoring model was established based on surface energy balance. Then, the correlation between soil moisture against Bowen ratio index (beta) and temperature-vegetation index ( TVX) was analyzed. Finally, taking the clear-sky imagery (October 5, 2014) as an example, a drought level classification standard based on beta was established and droughts in the study region were evaluated. Results show that 3 is highly negatively related to soil relative humidity, which has a better correlation than that between TVX and soil relative humidity in the depth range of 0 similar to 20 cm. The precision of drought monitoring is significantly improved. The distribution of dry-wet condition based on the beta drought classification standard is well consistent with the distribution of antecedent precipitation over the study region. Evaluation results show that generally no drought took place over the study region on October 5, 2014, which is consistent with precipitation anomaly percentage for the period of September, 2014. Our study suggests that the surface energy balance based Bowen ratio index can achieve excellent results when applied to drought monitoring and has a good application prospect.

We show that a complex C is weak injective (resp. weak flat) if and only if C is exact and all cycles of C are weak injective (resp. weak flat) as R-modules. In addition, we discuss the weak injective and weak flat dimensions of complexes of modules. Finally, we show that the category of weak injective (resp. weak flat) complexes is closed under pure subcomplexes, pure epimorphic images and direct limits. As a result, we then determine the existence of weak injective (resp. weak flat) covers and preenvelopes of complexes.

It is shown o that a group G has property mu if and only if HP(G/Phi(f)(G)) = HP(G)/Phi(f)(G) and that the class of groups with property v is a proper subclass of that of groups with property mu.

J	Xue, YJ; Cao, JX; Du, HK; Zhang, GL; Yao, Y				Xue, Ya-juan; Cao, Jun-xing; Du, Hao-kun; Zhang, Gu-lan; Yao, Yao			Does mode mixing matter in EMD-based highlight volume methods for hydrocarbon detection? Experimental evidence	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Hydrocarbon detection; Highlight volumes; EMD; Mode mixing; EEMD; CEEMD	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; SEISMIC-REFLECTION DATA; INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORM	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based spectral decomposition methods have been successfully used for hydrocarbon detection. However, mode mixing that occurs during the sifting process of EMD causes the 'true' intrinsic mode function (IMF) to be extracted incorrectly and blurs the physical meaning of the IMF. We address the issue of how the mode mixing influences the EMD-based methods for hydrocarbon detection by introducing mode-mixing elimination methods, specifically ensemble EMD (EEMD) and complete ensemble EMD (CEEMD)-based highlight volumes, as feasible tools that can identify the peak amplitude above average volume and the peak frequency volume. Three schemes, that is, using all IMFs, selected IMFs or weighted IMFs, are employed in the EMD-, EEMD- and CEEMD-based highlight volume methods. When these methods were applied to seismic data from a tight sandstone gas field in Central Sichuan, China, the results demonstrated that the amplitude anomaly in the peak amplitude above average volume captured by EMD, EEMD and CEEMD combined with Hilbert transforms, whether using all IMFs, selected IMFs or weighted IMFs, are almost identical to each other. However, clear distinctions can be found in the peak frequency volume when comparing results generated using all IMFs, selected IMFs, or weighted IMFs. If all IMFs are used, the influence of mode mixing on the peak frequency volume is not readily discemable. However, using selected IMFs or a weighted IMFs' scheme affects the peak frequency in relation to the reservoir thickness in the EMD-based method. Significant improvement in the peak frequency volume can be achieved in EEMD-based highlight volumes using selected IMFs. However, if the weighted IMFs' scheme is adopted (i.e. , if the undesired IMFs are included with reduced weights rather than excluded from the analysis entirely), the CEEMD-based peak frequency volume provides a more accurate reservoir thickness estimate compared with the other two methods. This study demonstrates that any form of EMD can be beneficial if it is appropriately conditioned. Thus, mode mixing issues will not play an important role in hydrocarbon detection. Because every form of EMD carries strengths and weaknesses in its current implementation, the standardization of such a utility demands further understanding. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While GPU offers powerful computing capability, the problem of the energy consumption becomes particularly prominently and it has become one of the important issues hindering development of GPU. For the purpose of solving this problem, DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling) becomes an effective solution. Because the previous works only focus on single component and use linear relationship to do DVFS without considering energy saving of other units in system at software runtime, therefore we propose an energy saving model (CDVFS) of considering the characteristics of both GPU and memory at software runtime based on GA-BP (Genetic Algorithm-Back propagation) neural network to make better use of the relationship between components for energy saving. Firstly, the model assumes that functional relation between the software runtime characteristics of GPU and memory and the appropriate frequency which corresponds to the GPU and memory as nonlinear. Secondly, we extract five characteristics and use GA-BP neural network to fit the nonlinear functional relation. At last, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and reasonableness of assumption, and also show that CDVFS can get average energy savings of 17.06% compared with previous works within acceptable performance loss.

Our proposed composite parity-conserved matrix product state has long-range quantum correlation only for two spin blocks where their spin-block length larger than 1 compared to any subsystem only having short-range quantum correlation, and we investigate quantum correlation properties of two spin blocks varying with environment parameter and spacing spin number. We also find that the geometry quantum discords of two nearest-neighbor spin blocks and two next-nearest-neighbor spin blocks become smaller and for other conditions the geometry quantum discord becomes larger than that in any subcomponent, i.e., the increase or the production of the long-range quantum correlation is at the cost of reducing the short-range quantum correlation compared to the corresponding classical correlation and total correlation having no any characteristic of regulation. For nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor all the correlations take their maximal values at the same points, while for other conditions no whether for spacing same spin number or for different spacing spin numbers all the correlations taking their maximal values are respectively at different points which are very close. We believe that our work is helpful to comprehensively and deeply understand the organization and structure of quantum correlation especially for long-range quantum correlation of quantum many-body systems; and further helpful for the classification, the depiction and the measure of quantum correlation of quantum many-body systems.

The results show that the glass-ceramics with 0-1.10 mol% SO3 possess mainly CaZrTi2O7-2M phase along with a small amount of CaZrTi2O7-3T and ZrO2 phases. The hexagonal CaZrTi2O7-3T crystals crystallize on the surface of glass-ceramics. For the samples with 1.24-1.55 mol% SO3, the main crystalline phases are CaTiSiO5 and CaZrTi2O7-2M in the bulk, while a separate sulfate layer containing Na2SO4 and BaSO4 is observed on the surface. X-ray fluorescence analysis indicates that about 2/3 of the SO3 originally added has been lost by volatility. The normalized mass loss (NLi) for Na, B, Ca elements remains almost unchanged (similar to 10(-2) g/m(2)) after 7 days for the samples with 0-1.10 mol% SO3. The NLi for both Na and B increases gradually after 7 days when the SO3 content is 1.24 mol%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Feng, J; Ding, RQ; Li, JP; Liu, DQ				Feng, Jie; Ding, Ruiqiang; Li, Jianping; Liu, Deqiang			Comparison of nonlinear local Lyapunov vectors with bred vectors, random perturbations and ensemble transform Kalman filter strategies in a barotropic model	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						ensemble forecasting; bred vector; nonlinear local Lyapunov vector; ensemble transform Kalman filter	TEMPORAL-SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION; QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC MODEL; DATA-ASSIMILATION; ATMOSPHERIC PREDICTABILITY; INITIAL PERTURBATIONS; UNSTABLE SUBSPACE; ERROR GROWTH; PREDICTION SYSTEM; SINGULAR VECTORS; PART I	The breeding method has been widely used to generate ensemble perturbations in ensemble forecasting due to its simple concept and low computational cost. This method produces the fastest growing perturbation modes to catch the growing components in analysis errors. However, the bred vectors (BVs) are evolved on the same dynamical flow, which may increase the dependence of perturbations. In contrast, the nonlinear local Lyapunov vector (NLLV) scheme generates flow-dependent perturbations as in the breeding method, but regularly conducts the Gram-Schmidt reorthonormalization processes on the perturbations. The resulting NLLVs span the fast-growing perturbation subspace efficiently, and thus may grasp more components in analysis errors than the BVs. In this paper, the NLLVs are employed to generate initial ensemble perturbations in a barotropic quasi-geostrophic model. The performances of the ensemble forecasts of the NLLV method are systematically compared to those of the random perturbation (RP) technique, and the BV method, as well as its improved version-the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) method. The results demonstrate that the RP technique has the worst performance in ensemble forecasts, which indicates the importance of a flow-dependent initialization scheme. The ensemble perturbation subspaces of the NLLV and ETKF methods are preliminarily shown to catch similar components of analysis errors, which exceed that of the BVs. However, the NLLV scheme demonstrates slightly higher ensemble forecast skill than the ETKF scheme. In addition, the NLLV scheme involves a significantly simpler algorithm and less computation time than the ETKF method, and both demonstrate better ensemble forecast skill than the BV scheme.

The results from PlioMIP show that the ASM intensified and summer precipitation increased in North Africa during the mid-Piacenzian, which can be explained by the increased net energy in the atmospheric column above North Africa. Further experiments with CAM4 indicated that the combined changes in the mid-Piacenzian of atmospheric CO2 concentration and SST, as well as the vegetation change, could have substantially increased the net energy in the atmospheric column over North Africa and further intensified the ASM. The experiments also demonstrated that topography change had a weak effect. Overall, the combined changes of atmospheric CO2 concentration and SST were the most important factor that brought about the intensified ASM in the mid-Piacenzian.

Non-local means (NLM) algorithms have been implemented efficiently for MRI denoising, but are always limited by high computational complexity. Compared to conventional methods, which raster through the entire search window when computing similarity weights, the proposed SNLM algorithm randomly selects a small subset of voxels which dramatically decreases the computational burden, together with competitive denoising result. Moreover, structure tensor which encapsulates high-order information was introduced as an optimal sampling pattern for further improvement. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed SNLM method can get a good balance between denoising quality and computation efficiency. At a relative sampling ratio (i.e. xi = 0.05), SNLM can remove noise as effectively as full NLM, meanwhile the running time can be reduced to 1/20 of NLM's. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Directed by transition metal ions, the self-assembly of the building blocks triggered polymerization to form the corresponding metallo-supramolecular polymers PCzTPY, PSiTPY and PNTPY, respectively. The UV-vis absorption maxima of the building blocks occur at long wavelengths (351, 368 and 430 nm for CzTPY, SiTPY and NTPY, respectively), which arises from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. However, the absorption maxima of their corresponding metallosupramolecular polymers are clearly red-shifted (to 394, 431 and 509 nm for PCzTPY, PSiTPY and PNTPY, respectively), which is caused by the incorporation of the transition metal ion into the backbones of the target polymers. Based on the above strategies, the resulting metallo-polymers exhibit reduced energy gaps, which are 2.07,1.97 and 1.56 eV for the PCzTPY, PSiTPY and PNTPY metallo-supramolecular polymers, respectively.

Aerosol optical properties in this region varied significantly between the dry and wet seasons. The mean AOD and alpha were 0.50 +/- 032 and 1.41 +/- 0.28, respectively, in the dry season and 0.41 +/- 0.20 and 1.13 +/- 0.41 in the wet season. Because of the combustion of the rich biomass in the dry season, fine modal smoke aerosols increased, which led to a higher AOD and smaller aerosol control mode than in the wet season. The average atmospheric humidity in the wet season was 85.50%, higher than the 79.67% during the dry season. In the very damp conditions of the wet season, the aerosol control mode was relatively larger, while AOD appeared to be lower because of the effect of aerosol hygroscopic growth and wet deposition. The trajectories were similar both in dry and wet, but with different effects on the aerosol concentration. The highest AOD values 0.66 +/- 034 (in dry) and 0.45 +/- 0.21 (in wet) both occurred in continental air masses, while smaller (038-0.48 in dry and 030-035 in wet) in oceanic air masses. The range of AOD values during the wet season was relatively narrow (0.30-0.45), but the dry season range was wider (0.38-0.66). For the Angstrom exponent, the range in the wet season (0.74-134) was much greater than that in the dry season (133-1.54). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile it is still very hard to deal with coherent sources for conventional methods. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to localize wideband coherent sources based on a distributed sensors networks. For this sensor networks, only two node-arrays are required, and each node-array consists of only two sensors. Firstly, direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) estimation is done at each node-array by employing a new algorithm proposed in this paper, which can estimate DOAs of multiple wideband coherent sources only using two sensors. Next, combining the pattern matching idea and the prior geometrical information of sources, a cost function is constructed, and the localization problem is converted to obtain an optimal solution that minimizes the cost function. Combining the cost function and the estimated DOAs results of each node-array, multiple wideband coherent sources can be localized. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of Sr substitution on the structural and magnetic properties have been investigated. Differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA-TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements were used to characterize chemical, structural and magnetic properties. The DTA-TG results indicate that there are three steps of combustion process. XRD results indicate that the lattice parameter increases, and the average crystallite size decreases with increasing Sr substitution. The Sr2FeO4 and SrFe12O19 impurity phases formed with excess Sr substitution. The saturation magnetization monotonically decreases with the increase of Sr substitution. Meanwhile, the coercivity initially decreases with the increase of Sr substitution when x <= 0.15, and increases when x > 0.15. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

Two important NPC rainfall modes were identified by empirical orthogonal function analysis: the first is characterized by an almost uniformly distributed rainfall anomaly over most parts of the NPC, while the second shows rainfall variability in Northeast China (NEC) and its out-of-phase relationship with that in North China (NC) and the northern part of Northwest China. The results also suggest that the NPC summer rainfall anomalies are also closely associated with those in some other parts of China. It is revealed that the circumglobal teleconnection pattern associated with the anomalous Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the Polar/Eurasia (PEA) pattern work in concert to constitute the typical circulation pattern of the first rainfall mode. The cooperative engagement of the anomalous ISM circulation and the PEA pattern is fundamental in transporting water vapor to the NPC. The study emphasizes that the PEA pattern is essential for the water vapor transport to the NPC through the anomalous midlatitude westerly. In the second NPC rainfall mode, the typical circulation pattern is characterized by the anomalous surface Okhotsk high and the attendant lower tropospheric circulation anomaly over NEC. The circulation anomaly over NEC leads to a redistribution of water vapor fluxes over the NPC and constitutes an out-of-phase relationship between the rainfall anomalies over NEC and NC.

This class depends on the retractions on the cone and contains self-maps for any retractions, and weakly inward maps and generalized inward maps when the retraction is a continuous metric projection. The new index coincides with the previous fixed point index theories for compact self-maps and generalized inward compact maps. New fixed point theorems are obtained for nowhere normal-outward compact maps and applied to treat some abstract boundary value problems and Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems with nonlinearities changing signs.

Variational-mode decomposition (VMD) is a newly developed methodology for decomposition on adaptive and quasi-orthogonal signal and can decompose a seismic signal into a number of band-limited quasi-orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Each mode is an AM-FM signal with the narrow-band property and nonnegative smoothly varying instantaneous frequencies. Analysis on synthetic and real data shows that this method is more robust to noise and has stronger local decomposition ability than the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based methods. Comparing with the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or wavelet transform (WT), instantaneous spectrum after VMD promises higher spectral and spatial resolution. Application of the VMD on field data demonstrates that instantaneous spectrum after VMD targets the thickness variation in the coal seam more sensitively than the conventional tools and highlights the fine details that might escape unnoticed. The technique is more promising for seismic signal processing and interpretation.

Existing denoising methods are predominantly implemented in a single domain, ignoring information in other domains. However, denoising methods are becoming increasingly complex, making analysis and implementation challenging. The present study aimed to develop a dual-domain image denoising (DDID) algorithm for 3D MRI that encapsulates information from the spatial and transform domains. In the present study, the DDID method was used to distinguish signal from noise in the spatial and frequency domains, after which robust accurate noise estimation was introduced for iterative filtering, which is simple and beneficial for computation. In addition, the proposed method was compared quantitatively and qualitatively with existing methods for synthetic and in vivo MRI datasets. The results of the present study suggested that the novel DDID algorithm performed well and provided competitive results, as compared with existing MRI denoising filters.

We calculate the transverse shift of right-circularly polarized light in a SiO2-air-HMM-air-SiO2 waveguide and analyze the physical mechanism of the enhanced SHETL. The HMM anisotropy can greatly increase the transverse shift of polarized light even though HMM loss might reduce it. Compared with transverse shift of transmitted light through a single HMM slab with ZnAlO/ZnO multilayer, the maximum transverse shift of tunneling light through a FTIR structure with identical HMM can be significantly enlarged by more than three times which reaches -38 mu m without any amplification method.

This paper analyzes the performance of traditional antenna calibration methods, and then proposes an antenna calibration method based on Wiener channel prediction for time-varying TDD-MIMO system. Through theoretical derivation, we get the capacity formula of the TDD-MIMO system using traditional antenna calibration and antenna calibration based on channel prediction. The theoretical analysis and simulation results both indicate that the performance degradation of antenna calibration can be caused by time-varying channel and the prediction algorithm proposed in the paper can well compensate for the performance loss and significantly improve the antenna calibration performance for time-varying TDD-MIMO system.

This paper proposed an improved CE-BEM to alleviating the high frequency sampling error caused by conventional CE-BEM. On the one hand, exploiting the improved CE-BEM, we achieve the sampling point is in the Doppler spread spectrum and the maximum sampling frequency is equal to the maximum Doppler shift. On the other hand we optimize the function and dimension of basis in CE-BEM respectively,and obtain the closed solution of the EM based channel estimation differential operator by exploiting the above optimal BEM. Finally, the numerical results and theoretic analysis show that the dimension of basis is mainly depend on the maximum Doppler shift and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and if fixing the number of the pilot symbol, the dimension of basis is higher, the modeling error is smaller, while the accuracy of the parameter estimation is reduced, which implies that we need to achieve a tradeoff between the modeling error and the accuracy of the parameter estimation and the basis function influences the accuracy of describing the Doppler spread spectrum after identifying the dimension of the basis.

Particularly, the traveling wave equation, as an important reduced equation, is investigated in detail. Treating it as a singular perturbation system in R-3, we study the phase space geometry of its reduced system on a two-dimensional invariant manifold by using the dynamical system methods such as tracking the unstable manifold of the saddle, studying the equilibria at infinity and discussing the homoclinic bifurcation and Poincare bifurcation. Correspongding wavespeed conditions are determined to guarantee the existence of various bounded traveling waves of the KBK equation.

Dependence of their crystal structure, magnetic, electrical, and dielectric properties on La-Cu substitution amount were investigated. Pure M-type phase is obtained for the ferrites with La-Cu substitution amount x <= 0.3. With x further increasing to 0.5, the multiphase structure is formed, where the M-type phase coexists with the LaFeO3 phase and Sr2FeO4-x phase. In single M-type phase region with x <= 0.3, the varied magnetic properties can be well explained considering the occupancy effects of La3+ and Cu2+ ions in magnetoplumbite structure. Their electrical transport behavior is found to be correlated with La-Cu substitution amount. Single metal-semiconductor (M-S) transition is clearly observed in the ferrites with a high doping amount as x=0.3. The polarization behavior from 1 kHz to 10 MHz follows the charge polarization mechanism, and the temperature dependence of real permittivity (epsilon'-T curves) and dielectric loss (tg delta-T curves) strongly suggests the complicated multiparticle polarization and relaxation. 0 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Potential energy curves, permanent dipole moments, and transition dipole moments for the X-1 Sigma(+), a(3)Pi, and A(1)Pi states are studied based on multi-reference configuration interaction plus Davidson corrections (MRCI+Q) method with ACVQZ basis set, spin-orbit coupling effects are considered at the MRCI+Q level. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors (f(00) = 0.9988 and f(11) = 0.9970) and branching ratios (R-00 = 0.9965, R-01 = 2.85 x 10(-3), R-02 = 6.35 x 10(-4), and R-03 = 2.05 x 10(-6)) for the A(1)Pi(1)(v' = 0) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+)(v ''' = 0) transition are determined. A sufficiently radiative lifetime tau (A(1)Pi(1)) = 4.99 ns is predicted for rapid laser cooling. The proposed cooling wavelength is deep in the ultraviolet region at lambda(00) = 261.75 nm. Total emission rates for the a(3)Pi(0+) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+), a(3)Pi(1) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+), A(1)Pi(1) -> a(3)Pi(0+), and A(1)Pi(1) -> a(3)Pi(1) transitions are particularly small (similar to 10 s(-1)-650 s(-1)). The calculated vibrational branching loss ratio to the intermediate a(3)Pi(0+) and a(3)Pi(1) states can be negligible. The results imply the probability of laser cooling AlCl molecule with three-electronic-level. Published by AIP Publishing.

The zonal circulation over the TP abruptly changed in summer (31st pentad) and winter (59th pentad). The switch from summer to winter circulation is characterized by a sudden northward shift of the westerlies and the zero-velocity curve and disappearance of the westerly jet. The winter-summer switch is characterized by the reverse pattern. Therefore, the circulation conversion between summer and winter can be judged from the position of the zero-velocity curve. Curves located north of 20 degrees N indicate summer circulation over the TP and vice versa. The abrupt change of zonal circulation is mainly caused by the thermodynamic effect of the TP. In June, this effect causes a huge monsoon circulation cell extending from the TP to low latitudes. Consequently, the westerlies jump to the north as easterlies develop. This process, which is enhanced by the strong northerly in Coriolis, establishes the summer circulation. In October, the Hadley cell recurs as the thermal effects of the TP diminish, the westerlies rush southward, and the winter circulation is established.

The effect of Ce substitution on the structural and magnetic properties have been investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements were used to characterize structural and magnetic properties. XRD results indicate that the lattice parameter increases and the average crystallite size decreases with increasing Ce substitution. And CeO2 secondary impurity phase formed with excess Ce substitution. The saturation magnetization and coercivity monotonically decrease with the increase of Ce substitution.

Introducing a transistor array (TA) style to analog layout, this article addresses the layout-dependent variability based on the measurement results of test chips on 90nm CMOS process. In TA style, a large transistor is decomposed into a set of unified subtransistors, which are connected in series or parallel. Focusing on one row layout of diffusion sharing for the multiple gates, we analyze the current direction-dependent variability and the leakage current via off-gates for the electrical isolation. Furthermore, we present several analog design cases on TA including analysis of the impact on the DC characteristics caused by the transistor channel decomposition.

Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone) and arrhythmia hospitalization or arrhythmia mortality. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were analyzed via a random-effects model and reported as relative risk and 95% confidence interval. 25 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria and 23 contributed to the meta-analysis. Arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality were associated with increases in PM2.5 (RR = 1.015 per 10 mu g/m(3), 95% CI: 1.006-1.024), PM10 (RR = 1.009 per 10 mu g/m(3), 95% CI: 1.004-1.014), carbon monoxide (RR = 1.041 per 1 ppm, 95% CI: 1.017-1.065), nitrogen dioxide (RR = 1.036 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.020-1.053), and sulfur dioxide (RR = 1.021 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.003-1.039), but not ozone (RR = 1.012 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 0.997-1.027). Both particulate and gaseous components, with the exception of ozone, have a temporal association with arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality. Compared with Europe and North America, a stronger association was noted in Asia.

The long- term variation in CH4 associated with climate change and wetland loss is still largely unknown. From 1950 to 2010, CH4 emissions over the TP were analyzed using a model framework that integrates CH(4)MODwetland, TOPMODEL, and TEM models. Our simulation revealed a total increase of 15% in CH4 fluxes, from 6.1 g m(-2) year(-1) to 7.0 g m(-2) year(-1). This change was primarily induced by increases in temperature and precipitation. Although climate change has accelerated CH4 fluxes, the total amount of regional CH4 emissions decreased by approximately 20% (0.06 Tg-i.e., from 0.28 Tg in the 1950s to 0.22 Tg in the 2000s), due to the loss of 1.41 million ha of wetland. Spatially, both CH4 fluxes and regional CH4 emissions showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest of the study area. Lower CH4 emissions occurred in the northwestern Plateau, while the highest emissions occurred in the eastern edge. Overall, our results highlighted the fact that wetland loss decreased the CH4 emissions by approximately 20%, even though climate change has accelerated the overall CH4 emission rates over the last six decades.

In order to reduce the temperature nonlinearity in the proposed voltage reference, threshold voltage and a proportional-to-absolute-temperature voltage form the basic linear-temperature components, which are achieved by resistorless threshold voltage extractor and asymmetric differential difference amplifier. Moreover, a self-biased current source with feedback is used to provide stable bias currents for the whole voltage reference, which can improve the power-supply noise attenuation (PSNA) with reduced current mirror errors. Verification results of the proposed voltage reference implemented with 0.18-mu m CMOS technology demonstrate that the temperature coefficient of 14.1 ppm/degrees C with a temperature range of -20 degrees C to 80 degrees C is obtained at 1.35-V power supply, and a PSNA of 75.7 dB is achieved without any filtering capacitor while dissipating a maximum supply current of 880 nA. The active area is 115 mu m x 130 mu m.

China is currently the largest producer and consumer of chlorinated paraffins (CPs). To study the environmental behavior and fate of SCCPs in the soils of urban and suburban regions, the SCCP concentrations in 88 topsoils and 15 soil columns from land of different use types (e.g., woodland, vegetable field, paddy field and greenbelt) from Guangzhou and Chengdu have been determined. The SCCP concentrations in topsoils from Guangzhou (range: 1.45-25.5 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw), average: 10.3 ng g(-1) dw) were much higher than those from Chengdu (range: 0.218-3.26 ng g(-1) dw, average: 1.43 ng g(-1) dw). When compared to previously reported SCCP levels for topsoils from other areas, the SCCP concentrations measured in the present work were quite low. Much higher SCCP concentrations were observed in the greenbelt topsoils from Chengdu relative to the values measured from woodlands and vegetable and paddy fields. The composition profiles suggest that C10Cl6-10 and C11-13Cl6-8 were the major groups of SCCPs in topsoils from the woodlands and vegetable and paddy fields in Guangzhou and Chengdu. Vertical variations of the SCCP concentrations in the soil columns suggest that less chlorinated SCCPs (Cl5-6-SCCPs) are more capable of migrating to the deeper-layer soils than more chlorinated ones (Cl9-10-SCCPs). The SCCP concentrations displayed little dependence on organic matter (OM) for most topsoils (p > 0.05), indicating that OM is not the controlling factor in the distribution of SCCPs in the soils. Capsule: This study analyzed the occurrence, homologue patterns and vertical migration of SCCPs in the topsoils of two Chinese cities with different industrial structures and climate conditions.

J	Xiao, H; Yin, Y; Chen, Q; Zhao, PG				Xiao, Hui; Yin, Yan; Chen, Qian; Zhao, Pengguo			Impact of aerosol and freezing level on orographic clouds: A sensitivity study	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Orographic cloud; Aerosol; Riming process; Freezing level	DEEP CONVECTIVE CLOUDS; AIR-POLLUTION; PRECIPITATION SUPPRESSION; MICROPHYSICS SCHEME; ICE PARTICLES; SNOWFALL; GROWTH; MODEL; SIMULATION; RATES	The response of clouds and precipitation to changes in aerosol properties is variable with the ambient meteorological conditions, which is important for the distribution of water resources, especially in mountain regions. In this study, a detailed bin microphysics scheme is coupled into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate how orographic clouds and precipitation respond to changes in aerosols under different thermodynamic profiles. The model results suggest that when the initial aerosol number concentration changes from a clean continental background (4679 cm(-3)) to a polluted urban environment (23,600 cm(-3)), the accumulated surface precipitation amount can be increased up to 14% mainly due to the enhanced riming process which results from more droplets of 10-30 mu m in diameter. When the freezing level is lowered from 2.85 km to 0.9 km (above 1000 hPa level), the growth of ice-phase particles via riming process is enhanced, leading to more precipitation. However, the response of surface precipitation amount to increase in aerosol particle concentration is not linear with lowering freezing level, and there is a maximum precipitation enhancement caused by aerosols (about 14%) as the freezing level is at 1.4 km. Further sensitivity tests show that, the response of riming growth to increase in aerosol particle concentration becomes more significant with lowering the freezing level, but this effect becomes less significant as the freezing level is further lowered due to the limited liquid water. Moreover, the growth of raindrops through collision and coalescence is suppressed with lowering freezing level, due to the shorter distance between the melting level and the ground.

We find that thermo-optic Imbert-Fedorov (TOIF) effect displays in this four-layer optical system which has not been proposed before. Furthermore, we discuss the TOIF shifts in prism/SiO2/Si/SiO2 and prism/Au/Si/SiO2 waveguides with different parameters and study the observed phenomena from physical point of view. It is shown that the maximum IF shift can achieve 140 pm in a prism/Au/Si/SiO2 waveguide which is large enough to be directly measured by the calculation results. Accordingly, TOIF shift provides a temperature control method for the enhancement and modulation of IF shift. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten intensity categories were used to reveal the contributions of precipitation frequency and intensity to the variation of rainfall amount. Moreover, the trends of frequency were also evaluated by comparing the respective contributions of the number and the duration of precipitation events. The main results are as follows: (1) The precipitation amount and intensity both decreased from southeast to northwest China, with two areas of high precipitation frequency located in southwestern and southeastern China. A region of high precipitation duration was found in central China and two lower duration regions were found in southern and northern China. (2) Generally, the extreme heavy rainfall showed a significant increasing trend while the light rainfall showed a significant decreasing trend over central eastern China. Nevertheless, the spatial unevenness was detected and in south and southeast China, significant increasing trends were found, whereas in northeast China and the Sichuan Basin, precipitation amounts showed a declining trend in each precipitation intensity category. (3) The trends of precipitation amount were mainly caused by the variations of precipitation frequency, which had a contribution rate of greater than 95%; however, for the heavy rainfall category, intensity changes were also very important. (4) Increased precipitation frequency was largely caused by the prolonged duration of rainfall events, whereas the decreased frequency was mainly due to the reduction in the number of rainfall events.

It was found that CuO and Co2O3 additions are very effective to improve the density and sintering behavior of KNN ceramics. KNN-Cu-0.1Co ceramics with the highest density (rho similar to 4.38 g/cm(3)) could be prepared at such a low sintering temperature of 930 degrees C. Hard ferroelectrics KNN-Cu-xCo show an asymmetric P-E hysteresis loop, attributing to an internal bias field E-i. The improvement measures of E-i was discussed through the analysis on its affected factors, including doped level, sintering temperature, and measuring frequency. The results also suggested that mechanical quality factor Q(m) has similar variation trend with E-i as the variation sintering temperature or composition. KNN-Cu-0.5Co ceramics sintered at 980 degrees C obtain the excellent properties: Q(m) similar to 577, k(p) similar to 30% and d(33) similar to 83 pC/N. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detector with coplanar electrode similar to the Van der Pauw structure instead of conventional planar structure can partly reduce the influence of trapping effect to charge carrier transport along the c-axis. According to the configuration, four operating modes of the detector were thoroughly studied. Several novel results, such as the negative polarity dark current and photocurrent under zero bias voltage, orientation polarization, short relaxation time of steady-state surface leakage current and fast photocurrent response are obtained by this kind of coplanar structure configuration. The detector has the potential to be developed as a solid state X-ray dosimeter in the medical radiation environment, providing a high sensitivity and good adaptability under positive or negative bias voltage.

Although the understanding and application of GPS are of vital importance for modern manufacturing industry, the latest GPS standards contain huge amounts of data, information and knowledge that are obscurely linked together, so they are very difficult for designers, engineers and metrologists to understand, remember and comprehensively use them. This is especially true for surface texture that is one of the most complicated geometrical characteristics in GPS domain. To overcome the implementation barrier of GPS surface texture, a novel knowledge-based solution supported formally by a unified knowledge modeling of the complete GPS surface texture standard chain has been researched. This knowledge model can serve as a formal basis for developing more intelligent and reliable tolerance design and measurement systems. This paper starts with an introduction on how to build up a formal knowledge model based on category theory, called categorical fibration model, to unified acquisition and representation of all surface texture knowledge. It then moves on to de fine a recursive knowledge refinement process for the devised model to enable the recursive multi-level GPS knowledge transformations and refinements. This knowledge model is validated naturally by checking rules identified from category theoretic notions. Finally, this paper presents a general framework for applying the modeled GPS knowledge in practice, from the aspects of the integrated and complete modeling of all surface texture knowledge, detailed knowledge acquisition and modeling examples for four sub-knowledge bases of the proposed software solution, core functional features of this software, and a comprehensive case study for testing its validity and usability. This knowledge-based solution facilitates life cycle collaboration and integration of the complete GPS surface texture chain to reduce product development cost and lead time, and to ensure functional requirements of geometrical workpieces.

The GH effect in three different waveguides and their performances as a refractive index sensor to detect glycerol concentration in water are analyzed. The SMM brings a periodic property of GH shift peaks which is not found in other waveguides. It is also verified that setting coupling layer of the prism waveguide coupling structure as sensing area is an effective method to significantly increase the sensitivity to refractive index variation. A schematic diagram for the biosensor configuration is designed, and the sensitivity distribution for different glycerol water index is given. Calculation results show that in the proposed biosensor the maximum sensitivity reaches 3.2 x 10(6) mu m/RIU and resolution reaches 1.6 x 10(-7) (around 1.33306) with high sensitive position sensitive detector.

The results demonstrated that when DO was sufficient (about 8 mg . L-1), ammonia, iron and manganese could be completely removed. When DO decreased from 6.5 to 4 mg . L-1, the concentration of ammonia in the effluent increased accordingly, though iron and manganese were removed efficiently. When DO was as low as 3 mg . L-1, only iron was removed, whereas most of the ammonia and manganese still existed in the effluent. In addition, the oxidizing rates of the pollutants were not affected significantly with DO decrease. Turbidity removal in the biofilter was also investigated, and the results demonstrated that the turbidity decreased to less than 0.5 NTU at 0.4 m depth of the filter.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from influent and effluent samples from the constructed wetland was investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy combined with fluorescence regional integration (FRI), parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). This study evaluates the capability of these methods in detecting the spectral characteristics of fluorescent DOM fractions and their changes in constructed wetlands. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with FRI analysis showed that protein-like materials displayed a higher removal ratio compared to humic-like substances. The PARAFAC analysis of wastewater DOM indicated that six fluorescent components, i.e., two protein-like substances (C1 and C6), three humic-like substances (C2, C3 and C5), and one non-humic component (C4), could be identified. Tryptophan-like C1 was the dominant component in the influent DOM. The removal ratios of six fluorescent components (C1-C6) were 56.21, 32.05, 49.19, 39.90, 29.60, and 45.87 %, respectively, after the constructed wetland treatment. Furthermore, 2D-COS demonstrated that the sequencing of spectral changes for fluorescent DOM followed the order 298 nm -> 403 nm -> 283 nm (310-360 nm) in the constructed wetland, suggesting that the peak at 298 nm is associated with preferential tryptophan fluorescence removal. Variation of the fluorescence index (FI) and the ratio of fluorescence components indicated that the constructed wetland treatment resulted in the decrease of fluorescent organic pollutant with increasing the humification and chemical stability of the DOM.

Calculation method in anisotropic wave guides is developed based on stationary method and physical mechanism of enhanced GH effect is analyzed. Simulation results show the GH shift peaks are significantly influenced by the dispersion of material and the refractive index of prism and substrate.

Heuristic algorithms are proposed in literature reviews to get a minimal reduction and yet an unresolved issue is that many redundancy non-empty elements involving duplicates and supersets exist in discernibility matrix. To be able to eliminate the related redundancy and pointless elements, in this paper, we propose a compactness discernibility information tree (CDI-tree). The CDI-tree has the ability to map non-empty elements into one path and allow numerous non-empty elements share the same prefix, which is recognized as a compact structure to store non-empty elements in discernibility matrix. A complete algorithm is presented to address Pawlak reduction based on CDI-tree. The experiment results reveal that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the benchmark algorithms to find out a minimal attribute reduction.

In order to manifest the variation of permeability, the dominant magnetization mechanism was investigated by resolving the complex permeability spectra into two components including domain wall movement and spin rotation magnetization. The results show that, with grain size increasing, the dominant contribution to magnetization mechanism changes from spin rotation magnetization to domain wall movement due to the increase of amount of domain wall, and the amount of domain wall is observed by Lorentz microscopy to measure the critical diameter of magnetic domain which is around 3 mu m in NiZn ferrite. The temperature dependence of the magnetization mechanism has been discussed for the sake of thermal stability. As the operating temperature increases, the ratio between two magnetization mechanism components appears to be stable around 4 after a shift from 1.76, and the domain wall movement totally dominates the variation of permeability as the main magnetization mechanism.

The results show that the topological charge of center optical vortices in the far field is equal to initial phase index for the case of the radial NVAiBAs, whereas for radial NVGBAs the topological charge not only lies on initial phase index, but also is closely related to the odevity and sign of optical vortices embedded in beamlet, where mathematical analysis is made to explain the topological charge of center optical vortices, and the limitation of the number of beamlet to the topological charge of center optical vortices is also discussed. In addition, energy fluxes of radial NVAiBAs and NVGBAs exhibit different space orientations by controlling noncancial strength and present larger dark zones by increasing topological charge of beamlet, respectively. Finally, the relationship between the center optical vortices and energy fluxes of radial NVAiBAs and NVGBAs in even or odd N beamlets is also revealed, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, most commonly-used patch-based denoising methods are heavily dependent on the degree of patch matching. Due to the large number of voxels in the 3D MRI dataset, the procedure of searching sufficient similarity patches was limited by the empirical compromising between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy, and cannot fulfill the application in multimodal MRI dataset with different SNR and resolutions. Methods: In this study, we propose a modified global filtering framework for 3D MRI. For each denoising voxel, the similarity weighting matrix is computed using the reference patch and other patches from the whole dataset. This large weighting matrix is then approximated using the k-means clustering Nystrom method to achieve computational viability. Results: Experiments on both synthetic and in vivo MRI datasets demonstrated that the proposed adaptive Nystrom low-rank approximation could achieve competitive estimation compared with exact global filter while reducing the sampling rate by four orders of magnitude. In addition, the corresponding global filter improved patches-based method in both spatial and transform domain. Conclusion: We propose a global denoising framework for 3D MRI which extracts information from the entire dataset to restore each voxel. This large weighting matrix of the global filter is approximated using Nystrom low-rank approximation with an adaptive k-means clustering sampling scheme, which significantly reduce the sampling rate as well as the running time. The proposed method is capable of denoising in multimodal MRI dataset and can be used to improve currently used patch-based methods.

However, the non-uniform temperature distribution is the key problem of microwave processing, which is related to the structure of the cavity, and the placement and physical parameters of the material. In this paper, a new microwave cavity structure with a sliding short based on phase-shifting heating is creatively proposed to improve the temperature uniformity. An electronic mathematical model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) is built to predict the temperature distribution. Meanwhile, a new computational approach based on the theory of transformation optics is first provided to solve the problem of the moving boundary in the model simulation. At first, the experiment is carried out to validate the model, and heating results from the experiment show good agreement with the model's prediction. Based on the verified model, materials selected among a wide range of dielectric constants are treated by stationary heating and phase-shifting heating. The coefficient of variation (COV) of the temperature and temperature difference has been compared in detail between stationary heating and phase-shifting heating. A significant improvement in heating uniformity can be seen from the temperature distribution for most of the materials. Furthermore, three other materials are also treated at high temperature and the heating uniformity is also improved. Briefly, the strategy of phase-shifting heating plays a significant role in solve the problem of non-uniform heating in microwave-based material processing. A 25%-58% increase in uniformity from adapting the phase-shifting method can be observed for the microwave-processed materials.

However, in comparison to ground-based measurements, the FMF is still difficult to retrieve from satellite observations, as attempted by a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the retrieval of FMF based on Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) data. This method takes advantage of the coincident multi-angle intensity and polarization measurements from a single satellite platform. In our method, we use intensity measurements to retrieve the total AOD and polarization measurements to retrieve the fine-mode AOD. The FMF is then calculated as the ratio of the retrieved fine-mode AOD to the total AOD. The important processes in our method include the estimation of the surface intensity and polarized reflectance by using two semi-empirical models, and the building of two sets of aerosol retrieval lookup tables for the intensity and polarized measurements via the 6SV radiative transfer code. We apply this method to East Asia, and comparisons of the retrieved FMFs for the Beijing, Xianghe and Seoul_SNU sites with those of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations produce correlation coefficients (R-2) of 0.838, 0.818, and 0.877, respectively. However, the comparison results are relatively poor (R-2 = 0.537) in low-AOD areas, such as the Osaka site, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the satellite observations.

It is also a risk factor affecting human health. However, limited evidence is available to illustrate the effect of DTR modification on cause-specific cardiovascular disease among the elderly. Methods: A semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the exposure-effect relationship between DTR and daily emergency room (ER) admissions for cause-specific cardiovascular diseases among the elderly from 2009 to 2011 in Beijing. We examined the effects of DTR for stratified groups by gender and age, and examined the effects of DTR in the warm season and cold season for cause-specific cardiovascular diseases. Results: Significant associations were found between DTR and ER admissions for all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease among elderly males, while DTR was significantly associated with ER admissions for all cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease among elderly females. People aged 75 years and older were more vulnerable to DTR. DTR caused greater adverse effects on both genders in the warm season, whereas the effect estimates on females were higher in cold season than in warm season. Conclusions: A short-term increase of DTR was significantly associated with ER admissions for cause-specific cardiovascular disease among the elderly in Beijing.

Ground-based measurements and satellite observations during this event were used to further our understanding of the formation process of haze pollution and aerosol optical properties. The results suggest that high relative humidity, poor diffusion conditions (low wind speed and stable stratification) and favorable secondary transformation conditions under the hygroscopic growth of aerosol and high emissions led to this serious haze episode. During the haze period, the daily average value was 1.15 and 0.42 for aerosol optical depth (AOD(500nm)) and columnar water-vapor (CWV, in cm), respectively. On 19 December, the correlation coefficient between CWV and AOD(500nm) was 0.91, indicating the effect of hygroscopic growth of fine-mode articles. The daily average values for Angstrom exponent, fine-mode fraction, aerosol absorption optical depth, and Angstrom absorption exponent were 1.19, 0.81, 0.11 and 1.47, respectively, which suggests that fine aerosol particles were dominant in the atmosphere and fine-mode particles were the dominant contributor to atmospheric extinction during the haze period. Moreover, it also reflects that there were more absorbing aerosol particles during the haze period. Compared with other polluted periods with a bimodal distribution, there was an obvious trimodal distribution on 19 December. There were three peaks at radii of about 0.1 mu m, 0.5-0.8 mu m and 4 mu m. Satellite observations show that there was an obvious aerosol layer in the Beijing area during the haze period, concentrated at ground level to within 2 km in the upper layers. The types of aerosol were mainly composed of mixed pollution aerosols.

In preventing the significant loss of the effective features, a sampling process was executed with a significantly higher frequency. The side effect of this process showed that raw observation vectors were of extremely high dimensions. To reduce computation overhead, the feature selection algorithm based on conditional entropy was put forward to compress raw observation vectors into new observation vectors. The conditional entropy was used to update the conditional probability of a fault based on new fault information, which eventually made the fault probability more clear. By applying the proposed feature selection algorithm, it can compress raw data more wisely, and maximize the information in choosing the dimensions to be included in the new observation vectors. Simulation results showed that the fault detection approach presented in the study could classify non-linear feature vector space of the analog circuits. and achieved a lower misclassification rate than other current methods (i.e., equidistant method and conditional probability-based method).

This novel method combines the technical superiority of hydrothermal method and carbothermal reduction. In order to investigate reaction process and the influence of the addition of carbon black and reaction temperature on the reduction process, we synthesized substoichiometric titanium oxides in different conditions. The results showed that Ti4O7 submicron rods could be prepared with carbon black content of 3.7 % wt% by heating at 1075 A degrees C for 3 h. The Ti4O7 samples with higher specific surface area showed outstanding conductivity and optical properties. The UV-Vis spectra of Ti4O7 submicron rods showed that the absorption band covered the visible region and part of the near-infrared region. The light absorption property of Ti4O7 submicron rods is quite different with that of TiO2.

The proposed CNFSLMS algorithm-based functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) filter, aiming to overcome the compromise between convergence speed and steady state mean square error of the NFSLMS algorithm, offers both fast convergence rate and low steady state error. Furthermore, by replacing the sigmoid function with the modified Versorial function, the modified CNFSLMS (MCNFSLMS) algorithm with low computational complexity is also presented. Experimental results illustrate that the combination scheme can behave as well as the best component and even better. Moreover, the MCNFSLMS algorithm requires less computational complexity than the CNFSLMS while keeping the same filtering performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ground-based and satellite observations indicated absorbing dust aerosol loading over the region surrounded by eight large-scale deserts. Radiation forcing was identified by using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. The ranges of annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponents, and single-scattering albedo (SSA) were from 025 to 035, from -0.73 to 1.18, and from 0.77 to 0.86, respectively. The ranges of annual mean aerosol direct radiative forcing values at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), mid-atmosphere, and on the surface were from 3.9 to 12.0, from 50.0 to 53.1, and from -39.1 to -48.1 W/m(2), respectively. The aerosols' optical properties and radiative characteristics showed strong seasonal variations in both the desert and semi-desert regions. Strong winds and relatively low humidity will lead dust aerosols in the atmosphere to an increase, which played greatly affected these optical properties during spring and winter in northwestern China. Based on long-term observations and retrieved data, aerosol direct radiative forcing was confirmed to heat the atmosphere (50-53 W/m(2)) and cool the surface (-39 to -48 W/m(2)) above the analyzed desert. Radiative forcing in the atmosphere in spring and winter was 18 to 21 W/m(2) higher than other two seasons. Based on the dust sources around the sites, the greater the AOD, the more negative the forcing. The annual averaged heating rates for aerosols close to the ground (1 km) were approximately 0.80-0.85 K/day. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To solve this kind of ill-posed problems, a regularization term (i.e., regularizer) should be introduced, under the assumption that the solutions have some specific properties, such as sparsity and group sparsity. Widely used regularizers include the l(1) norm, total variation (TV) semi-norm, and so on. Recently, a new regularization term with overlapping group sparsity has been considered. Majorization minimization iteration method or variable duplication methods are often applied to solve them. However, there have been no direct methods for solving the relevant problems due to the difficulty of overlapping. In this paper, we proposed new inexact explicit shrinkage formulas for one class of these relevant problems, whose regularization terms have translation invariant overlapping groups. Moreover, we apply our results to TV deblurring and denoising problems with overlapping group sparsity. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to iteratively solve them. Numerical results verify the validity and effectiveness of our new inexact explicit shrinkage formulas.

Detailed effects of La-Cu substitution amount on their crystal structure, magnetic, electrical, and dielectric properties were investigated. The results show that the pure M-type phase is obtained for the ferrites with x <= 0.3. With further increasing x, the multiphase structure is inevitably formed, where the LaFeO3 phase coexists with the M-type phase. In the single M-type phase region, the variation of magnetic properties with La-Cu substitution amount is well explained based on the occupancy effects of La3+ and Cu2+ in magnetoplumbite structure. Suitable La-Cu substitution with x = 0.25 raises the saturation magnetization to a maximum value of 67.5 emu/g. The intrinsic coercivity decreases from 3.68 to 3.43 kOe with x increasing from 0 to 0.3, which is mainly dominated by the reduced magnetic anisotropy field. Electrical transport behavior of the ferrites is found to follow the impurity semiconductor, and the effect of La-Cu substitution on the direct-current resistivity is observed. Their polarization behavior in test frequency range of 1 kHz-10 MHz obeys the charge polarization mechanism, which happens since the frequency of the hopping of electron exchange between Fe2+ to Fe3+ is far from the frequency of alternating-current field.

The experimental results reveal that porous hollow Pd spheres have superior hydrogen absorption kinetics than spongy Pd. A typically pressure hysteresis behavior can also be observed in the hydrogen absorption/desorption isotherm curves. Gibbs free energy loss Delta G(loss) correlation with pressure hysteresis of porous hollow Pd spheres is 4.3-4.8 kJ/mol, which is larger than spongy Pd and Monocrystal Pd. The special hollow structure and microstructure defects of Pd powder should be taken into account. Moreover, hydride formation enthalpy of porous hollow Pd spheres is smaller than spongy Pd and Pd black. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These ferrites were chiefly characterized by X-ray diffraction, precision density balance, and vibrating sample magnetometer. It is observed that the addition of BBSZ can promote the low temperature sintering of the ferrites, as well as the formation of M-type phase. But the excessive addition of non-magnetic BBSZ is inclined to reduce the magnetic properties for the ferrites. Detailed effects of the BBSZ amount on their low temperature sintering characteristics are revealed and explained. The proper addition of BBSZ is suggested to be 4, 4, and 5 wt% for the CS ferrites, MS ferrites, and HPS ferrites, respectively. Notably, the obtained MS ferrites can provide relatively high saturation magnetization of 65.3 emu/g, magnetic anisotropy field of 1528.8 kA/m, and intrinsic coercivity of 336.1 kA/m as low temperature sintered M-type hexaferrites for use in microwave LTCC circulators.

Effects of different structures on the crystallographic, morphological, magnetic properties and stress were investigated in details. For the structure of d(s100), BaM film processes platelet-like grains, which shows excellent magnetocrystalline anisotropy and large squareness ratio S-perpendicular to (0.62). For the structure of d(s200), there are a lot of acicular grains. Thus, the c-axis in-plane oriented and/or randomly oriented grains induce poor magnetocrystalline anisotropy. For the structure of d(b200), the platelet-like grains dominate the microstructure. Both squareness ratio S-perpendicular to (0.67) and coercivity H-c perpendicular to (98.6 kA/m) of the d(b200) show the highest values among the three kinds of the film structures. In addition, with the increase of film thickness from 100 nm to 200 nm, the stress in film decreases gradually. Compared with the other structures, the bilayer 200 nm thick film (d(b200)) obtains the smallest stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Main limits of radial basis function network are how to choose parameter in the model, so in this method, through optimizing the parameters of the radial basis function by particle swarm optimization algorithm, a neural network model of regional ecological environment is generated to enhance the performance. Additionally, a visualization system of the ecological quality assessment is developed using ArcGIS software, which can be used to display and evaluate the ecological quality of eco-environmental quality. The eco-environmental quality assessment in Sichuan Province of China is taken as an example, and the results show that radial basis function network optimized by PSO is superior to the traditional model, GIS can inquire and display the message and evaluation results, and the hybrid method provides a new approach for the protection and scientific management of ecological quality and worth to be recommended.

Thus, based on the outputs of deep processing of these data, manufacturing enterprises have the potential to respond rapidly to the changing customer needs and markets under the dynamic environment of multi-site design and cloud manufacturing, which is becoming a core competitiveness of enterprises. However, due to a large amount of data scattered in various distributed databases or clouds of enterprises has not yet been exploited effectively, this valuable competence gained from mass customization is still not practically available in the modern manufacturing industry. In order to provide a feasible treatment for mass customization in product design under cloud manufacturing environment, the three critical problems identified in this paper must be solved comprehensively. Thus, this research has proposed a novel integrated solution (named "KAGFM") to realize effective mass customization for customer-oriented product design in an intelligent computerized manner based on big data mining, that is, manufacturing enterprises can adjust product design schemes keenly adapting with the specific requirements of a certain group of customers. By taking advantage of the cloud manufacturing, this solution can extract a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules from huge quantities of raw data through integrating the artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), and fuzzy rules seamlessly together to precisely extract and express semantic relationships between individual data sets (including personal attributes and preferences) and key product design elements. This paper tests and evaluates the proposed solution through a case study on mass customization for concept mobile phone design. Experimental results have showed that it can provide a better customized product design mode in context of cloud manufacturing through reducing data processing time, improving data utilization rate and facilitating enterprises to make a quick and correct response to changes of customer preferences.

Taking Southwestern China (a typical mountainous region) as an example, this paper established a new HC-MMK approach (Hierarchical Classification based on Multi-source and Multi-temporal data and geo-Knowledge), which was especially designed for land cover mapping in mountainous areas. This approach was taken in order to generate a 30 m-resolution land cover product in Southwestern China in 2010 (hereinafter referred to as CLC-SW2010). The multi-temporal native HJ (HuanJing, small satellite constellation for disaster and environmental monitoring) CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) images, Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images and topographical data (including elevation, aspect, slope, etc.) were taken as the main input data sources. Hierarchical classification tree construction and a five-step knowledge-based interactive quality control were the major components of this proposed approach. The CLC-SW2010 product contained six primary categories and 38 secondary categories, which covered about 2.33 million km(2) (accounting for about a quarter of the land area of China). The accuracies of primary and secondary categories for CLC-SW2010 reached 95.09% and 87.14%, respectively, which were assessed independently by a third-party group. This product has so far been used to estimate the terrestrial carbon stocks and assess the quality of the ecological environments. The proposed HC-MMK approach could be used not only in mountainous areas, but also for plains, hills and other regions. Meanwhile, this study could also be used as a reference for other land cover mapping projects over large areas or even the entire globe.

Here, a coupled state-of-the-art Earth system model with an interactive carbon cycle (BNU-ESM) was used to investigate whether this proportionality extends to the complex Earth system model and to examine the climate system responses to different emission pathways with a common emission budget of man-made CO2. These new simulations show that, relative to the lower emissions earlier and higher emissions later (LH) scenario, the amount of carbon sequestration by the land and the ocean will be larger and Earth will experience earlier warming of climate under the higher emissions earlier and lower emissions later (HL) scenario. The processes within the atmosphere, land, and cryosphere, which are highly sensitive to climate, show a relatively linear relationship to cumulative CO2 emissions and will attain similar states under both scenarios, mainly because of the negative feedback between the radiative forcing and ocean heat uptake. However, the processes with larger internal inertias depend on both the CO2 emissions scenarios and the emission budget, such as ocean warming and sea level rise.

Therefore, it is extremely important to improve the coding speed. By making use of the advantage of the quality scalable video coding (QSVC) structure, we propose a new fast Intra coding algorithm for QSVC. Based on the coding structure of QSVC, temporal, spatial and inter-layer correlations are employed together to predict candidate macro-block (MB) modes and their encoding orders to exclude low possible modes, and then three new early termination methods are proposed. In addition to MB modes, temporal, spatial and inter-layer correlations are also adopted together to estimate weight values and orders of all directional modes. Experimental results demonstrate that the coding speed of the proposed algorithm can be improved by 63.58 % in average with negligible coding loss.

The ground state X-2 sigma(+) and low-lying excited states Alpha(2)pi, Alpha '(2)Delta are calculated at the multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) level of theory. The calculated spectroscopic constants are in good agreement with available theoretical and experimental results. At the MRCI level of theory with Davidson correction, the permanent dipole moments of the X-2 sigma(+) and Alpha(2)pi states of ScO are also calculated. The highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors and shorter radiative lifetime for the Alpha(2)pi -> X-2 sigma(+) transition are calculated with the corresponding potential energy curves and transition dipole moment. Although there is an intermediate state Alpha '(2)Delta, the loss will be dominated by branching to the intermediate electronic state Alpha '(2)Delta at a level of eta < 1.4 x 10(-4). These results demonstrate the probability of laser cooling of ScO, and we provide a promising laser-cooling scheme for ScO molecule.

It indicates that the formation of surface phase associated with non-uniform La3+-Co2+- substitution is crucial to the hybrid grain structure, which consists of body phase, surface phase, and interface. The abnormal double metal-semiconductor (M-S) transitions in La3+-Co2+ substituted ferrites are suggested to arise from the competition of lattice vibration scattering effect and thermal excitation of different conduction electrons strongly correlated with the hopping of electrons between Fe2+ and Fe3+ at octahedral sites in body phase and surface phase.

Results have demonstrated that the zeolite synthesized by integrated calcination with MgO at 400 degrees C performances a good ammonium adsorption capacity as high as 24.9mg g(-1), an increase by 97.6 and 68.2% compared to that of natural zeolite itself and natural zeolite that heated in 400 degrees C for4h (12.6 and 14.8mg g(-1), respectively), when its dose was adjusted at 27g L-1 with solution pH of 8.3 and agitation speed of 280r min(-1) at 25 degrees C. Negative Gibbs free energy change indicated the spontaneous nature of the adsorption. In addition, both ion-exchange and molecular adsorption being the main mechanisms, in which ion-exchange dominated the ammonium adsorption process near neutral pH, and the molecular adsorption was of secondary importance, and contributed less to the total ammonium removal according to the experimental results under neutral pH conditions.

The magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant decreased with the increase of Zn substitution. The saturation magnetization increased with the increase of Zn substitution when x <= 0.20, and decreased when x>0.20. Meanwhile, the coercivity initially decreased with the increase of Zn substitution when x <= 0.60, and increased when x>0.60.

J	Qu, X; Huang, G				Qu, Xia; Huang, Gang			The Global Warming-Induced South Asian High Change and Its Uncertainty	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; SUMMER MONSOON; PACIFIC; CLIMATE; TELECONNECTION; CIRCULATION; SCALE; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS	Based on models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), the present study investigates the South Asian high (SAH) change in response to global warming. Under global warming, the selected 16 coupled general circulation models all feature an elevation of geopotential height at 100 hPa to the south of the SAH climatological position; an easterly response is found over the northern Indian Ocean in all the models, while a westerly response is found over subtropical Asia. The ridges of the SAH shift equatorward in 75% of models. Using the linear baroclinic model, it is found that the combined effects of latent heating and the mean advection of stratification change (MASC) are mainly responsible for those responses. The MASC mainly leads to the aforementioned easterly and westerly responses; the latent heating contributes to the geopotential height response and the easterly response over the northern Indian Ocean. The most important intermodel diversity is found in the 100-hPa circulation change under global warming, accounting for more than half of the total intermodel variance. The intermodel spread of latent heating and the MASC are important factors in driving the 100-hPa circulation diversity. Furthermore, analysis shows that the projected uncertainties in humidity, vertical velocity, and global mean temperature change are the three most important sources of intermodel diversity for the 100-hPa circulation change.

The study was based on AERONET observational and retrieval data, particulate matter measurements (TEOM 1405), meteorological data, and then the HYSPLIT model was used to analyze the pollution sources. The study period was divided into three sub-periods according to the different stages of implementation of the control measures, and the main conclusions can be summarized as follows. During the period in which the restrictive measures were applied, the air quality improved significantly, with the average value of the AOD being 0.34 +/- 0.20, about 69% less than before. Meanwhile, the average angstrom ngstrom exponent was about 9.5% higher than before, with an average value of 1.38 +/- 0.25, indicating that the main pollutants were fine particles. Single scattering albedo decreased as wavelength increased, being higher than in the other two stages (mean value of 0.944 +/- 0.045). This showed that the strong scattering capacity and absorption aerosol optical depth was at its lowest, at about 0.008 +/- 0.009. The peaks of aerosol volume concentration in the fine and coarse mode were significantly reduced. Meteorological conditions also had a certain effect on the aerosol optical properties, with the blowing of clean and dry wind and the occurrence of precipitation contributing to the overall improvement in air quality.

Experimental results show that the degradation of R-ON is reduced by increasing the dose of p-type buried layer (Pbury). The average R-on shift is only 3.7% after 168 h of aging tests with Pbury dose equal to 3.4 x 10(12) cm(-2). Both peak electric field and impact ionization rate near the bird's beak close to the source are decreased by increasing the dose of Pbury. Meanwhile, the peak electric field close to the drain is increased to avoid the drop in the breakdown voltage.

The iterative fast Fourier transform (IFFT) technique with a judge factor is introduced into the optimizer to accelerate the convergence. The global characteristics of a genetic algorithm show its optimization capability in the early phase of the optimization process and the powerful local search ability of IFFT works in the late phase. Thus, this proposed algorithm can not only effectively avoid being trapped into the local optimum but also possess a fast convergence for large array thinning. Several representative examples of large planar thinned arrays validate the good performance of the proposed algorithm.

Results show that the MJO plays an important role in the occurrence of the TPV that the number of TPVs generated within an active period of the MJO is three times as much as that during an inactive period. In addition, during the active period, the number of the TPVs generated in phases 1 and 2 is larger than that in phases 3 and 7. After compositing phases 1 and 7 separately, all meteorological elements in phase 1 are apparently conducive to the generation of the TPV, whereas those in phase 7 are somewhat constrained. With its eastward propagation process, the MID convection centre spreads eastward, and the vertical circulation within the tropical atmosphere changes. Due to the interaction between the mid-latitude and low-latitude atmosphere, changes occur in the baroclinic characteristics of the atmosphere, the available potential energy and eddy available potential energy of the atmosphere, and the circulation structures of the atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and surrounding areas. This results in significantly different water vapour transportation and latent heat distribution. Advantageous and disadvantageous conditions therefore alternate, leading to a significant difference among the numbers of plateau vortex in different phases.

In this paper, a method using Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD), Hilbert transform and the least-squares curve-fitting is proposed for seismic attenuation estimation as an effective frequency attenuation gradient estimation approach. We first use CEEMD to obtain the different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which have a narrow band and can enhance the physical meaning of instantaneous attributes trace by trace. The time-frequency spectrum, which is computed using a Hilbert transform of each IMF, is represented as a spectrum with a single-peak that has narrow side lobes, which is conducive to frequency attenuation gradient estimation. Second, for each time sample, the frequency amplitude spectrum of each IMF trace is extracted from the time-frequency spectrum to conduct the attenuation gradient computation. Then, the logarithm operation is performed for each IMF trace. Due to the very narrow bands of some IMFs in some seismic traces, a variable frequency window is adopted along the IMF trace according to the local data characteristics. Finally, the attenuation gradient for each IMF in a seismic trace can be computed using least-squares fitting. A different IMF reflects a seismic trace with a different spatiotemporal scale and can highlight different geologic and stratigraphic information. The correlation weighted average operation is used to highlight some useful details in seismic trace and obtains the attenuation gradient for each seismic trace. Field data examples demonstrate our method and its effectiveness. The proposed method can stably estimate the frequency attenuation gradient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

And the one-dimensional third-order boundary value problem on interval [0, infinity) is equivalently transformed into a second-order boundary value problem on finite interval [beta, 1]. The finite difference method is utilized to solve the singular boundary value problem, in which the amount of computational effort is significantly less than the other numerical methods. The numerical solutions obtained by the finite difference method are in agreement with those obtained by previous authors.

Both algorithms are based on the complex tree structure to reduce the complexity of searching the unique minimum Euclidean distance and multiple Euclidean distances, and obtain the corresponding transmit symbol vectors. The novel complex hard sphere decoder for MIMO detection is presented first, and then the soft processing of a novel sphere decoding algorithm for list generation is discussed. The performance and complexity of the proposed techniques are demonstrated via simulations in terms of bit error rate (BER), the number of nodes accessed and floating-point operations (FLOPS).

The uncertainties can be very general, including unmodelled dynamics, uncertain or time-varying parameters, uncertain non-linearities and bounded disturbances and so on. With only one adaptive parameter, the proposed adaptive estimator estimates simultaneously the state of the system and the uncertainty in the output. Under the given assumptions, the adaptive estimator ensures that estimation errors of both the state of the system and the uncertainty in the output are uniformly bounded. Furthermore, the estimation errors can converge to some arbitrarily small values by adjusting the design constant appropriately. Simulation results of a single-link robotic arm illustrate the effectiveness and the potential applications of the proposed estimator.

We discuss the design principles using the coupled-mode theory of DC and deduce the conditions for a valid biosensor model. The coupling length, the detectable refractive index range, and the sensing resolution for different silica widths and separation distances of the DC are presented by analytical calculation. By a tradeoff between coupling length and resolution of refractive index, we can obtain a sensor with a compact size of 48 mu m x 30 mu m. The biosensor shows a resolution of about 1 x 10(-6) for glucose concentration ranging from 1 to 200 mg/dL.

Thereby, the process, causes and boundary layer meteorological characteristics of a heavy haze episode occurring from 16 to 25 December 2013 in Xi'an were analyzed. Principal component analysis showed that this haze pollution was mainly caused by the high-intensity emission and formation of gaseous pollutants (NO2, CO and SO2) and atmospheric particles (PM2.5 (fine particles) and PM10 (respirable suspended particle). The second cause was the relative humidity and continuous low temperature. The third cause was the allocation of the surface pressure field. The presence of a near-surface temperature inversion at the boundary layer formed favorable stratification conditions for the formation and maintenance of heavy haze pollution. The persistent thick haze layer weakened the solar radiation. Meanwhile, a warming effect in the urban canopy layer and in the transition zone from the urban friction sublayer to the urban canopy was indicated. All these conditions facilitated the maintenance and reinforcement of temperature inversion. The stable atmospheric stratification finally acted on the wind field in the boundary layer, and further weakened the exchange capacity of vertical turbulence. The superposition of a wind field with the horizontal gentle wind induced the typical air stagnation and finally caused the deterioration of air quality during this haze event.

Experiment results clearly showed that the pure M-type crystal phase was successfully obtained when the La-Co substitution amount x did not exceed 0.3. However, the single M-type phase structure transformed to multiphase structure with further increased x, where the M-type phase coexisted with the non-magnetic phase such as alpha-Fe2O3 phase, La2O3 phase, and LaCoO3 phase. Appropriate La-Co substitution improved the M-s (>62 emu/g), H-a (>1400 kA/m), and H-ci (>320 kA/m) for the ferrites with x varying from 0.1 to 0.3, but the T-C decreased with increasing substitution amount. Moreover, the microwave sintered ferrites could provide larger Hci and similar Ms compared with the conventional sintered ferrites.

A geographical information system (GIS) provides a convenient mapping platform and powerful functions for spatial data symbolisation, while the presence of various mapping standards impedes the understanding of maps and sharing of map information. On the other hand, the available GIS platforms find it difficult to deal with automatic conversion between maps and different mapping standards. To resolve this problem, an approach for symbol recognition and automatic conversion is proposed, and a conversion system based on the approach and the ArcGIS Engine platform is developed to realise automatic conversion between maps produced based on different mapping standards. To test these conversion effects of the proposed system, the petroleum sector is chosen as the research field and the mutual conversion of a map in practical work among the three mapping standards (i.e. the Chinese Petroleum, Shell and USGS standards) governing this field is taken as a case study. The results show that the conversion system has a high conversion accuracy and strong applicability.

In this study, we reported a facile and novel strategy to synthesize reduced TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) photoelectrode. The microwave reduction could introduce oxygen vacancy in the lattice of TiO2, while the rapid-production of oxygen vacancy facilitated the generation of impurity level between the forbidden band and greatly enhancement of visible light absorption, thereby resulting in an improved separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and photocatalytic (PC) performance. Additionally, the derived valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VBXPS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra confirmed the existence of oxygen vacancy in the lattice of TiO2 NTs photoelectrode, in which the valence bond maximum (VBM) and charge carriers concentration of reduced TiO2 NTs photoelectrode was determined to be 1.75 eV and 5.36 x 10(19) cm(-3), respectively. Furthermore, the scavenging experiments revealed that center dot OH radical was the dominated species for the degradation of diclofenac. The enhanced-visible-light PC mechanism could mainly be attributed to the generation of oxygen vacancy, which can provide not only the visible light absorption capacity but also charge separation efficiency.

The WR summer surface temperature (WRST) in the observational record is characterized by substantial interannual variability superimposed on the secular warming trend. Analysis of the 130 year observational record reveals that a strong and significant inverse relationship between WRST interannual variability and the tropical El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has emerged during the past three decades. The ENSO influence on the summer extratropical atmospheric circulation was weak before 1980 but became strong and significant afterward, showing a structure similar to the East Atlantic/WR teleconnection pattern. This pattern is associated with rising/falling upper level geopotential height over WR, which leads to the warming/cooling of surface and tropospheric air temperatures. Numerical simulations from a theoretical linear baroclinic model and Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project models further suggest that the enhancement of the ENSO teleconnection to WR may be attributable to a change in the ENSO-related tropical thermal forcing. A tripole-type rainfall anomaly pattern over tropical Pacific and Atlantic is found to be associated with ENSO in the past three decades. The tripole heating pattern can excite a Rossby wave that extends northwestward reaching WR and is necessary for the strong influence of ENSO on WR summer climate.

Detailed effect of La-Co substitution amount on their crystal structure and magnetic properties were mainly investigated. The results show that the pure M-type crystal phase is successfully obtained for the ferrites with La-Co substitution amount x not higher than 0.3. With further increased substitution amount, the multiphase structure is formed, where the non-magnetic alpha-Fe2O3 phase and LaCoO3 phase coexist with the M-type phase. Appropriate La-Co substitution improves the magnetic properties of the ferrites, including the saturation magnetization M-s, effective magnetic anisotropy constant K-eff, magnetic anisotropy field H-a, and intrinsic coercivity H-ci. Besides, the Curie temperature T-C of the ferrites exhibits a rapid decrease when the La-Co substitution amount exceeds 0.3. It is suggested that the La3+-Co2+ ions can partially substitute the Sr2+-Fe3+ ions for the ferrites, leading to enhanced magnetic properties. Typically, the obtained Sr1-xLaxFe12-xCoxO19 (x = 0.2-0.3) ferrites can provide improved M-s above 64 emu/g, H-a above 1510 kA/m, and H-ci above 330 kA/m as low temperature sintered M-type hexaferrites, which are promising for use in future design and realisation of self-biased circulators in LTCC systems.

To obtain high-quality PET images requires a standard-dose radionuclide (tracer) injection into the human body, which inevitably increases risk of radiation exposure. One possible solution to this problem is to predict the standard-dose PET image from its low-dose counterpart and its corresponding multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) images. Inspired by the success of patch-based sparse representation (SR) in super-resolution image reconstruction, we propose a mapping-based SR (m-SR) framework for standard-dose PET image prediction. Compared with the conventional patch-based SR, our method uses a mapping strategy to ensure that the sparse coefficients, estimated from the multimodal MR images and low-dose PET image, can be applied directly to the prediction of standard-dose PET image. As the mapping between multimodal MR images (or low-dose PET image) and standard-dose PET images can be particularly complex, one step of mapping is often insufficient. To this end, an incremental refinement framework is therefore proposed. Specifically, the predicted standard-dose PET image is further mapped to the target standard-dose PET image, and then the SR is performed again to predict a new standard-dose PET image. This procedure can be repeated for prediction refinement of the iterations. Also, a patch selection based dictionary construction method is further used to speed up the prediction process. The proposed method is validated on a human brain dataset. The experimental results show that our method can outperform benchmark methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.

However, the unbalanced developments of their dielectric constants, dielectric losses, and stabilities still hinder practical applications. In this study, we attained a colossal permittivity (epsilon(r) = 10(4)similar to 10(5), 1 kHz) in a series of new titanium dioxide (i.e., (A(0.5)Ta(0.5))(x)Ti1-xO2, where A = Al, Sm, Bi, Fe, In, Dy, Ga, Gd, Yb, or Sc) ceramics containing Ta and trivalent elements that is comparable or superior to the previously reported results in In and Nb co-doped ceramics. In addition, a low dielectric loss (tan delta similar to 5.4%, 1 kHz) was achieved in the ceramics by tailoring the types of trivalent elements used; such a ceramic also shows relatively good dielectric properties with regard to frequency (10(2)similar to 10(6) Hz) and temperature (-150-200 degrees C) stabilities. The formation of defectdipole clusters (e.g., Al3+PVo-Ti3+ and Ta(5+)Ti(3+)A(Ti) (A = Ti3+/Al3+/Ti4+)) induced by Ta and trivalent elements should be responsible for the observed enhancements in dielectric properties. We believe that TiO2-based ceramics are one of the most promising candidates in the field of electronic and energy-storage devices. (c) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A multiphase coexistence concerning rhombohedralorthorhombic and orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O/O-T) was observed in the ceramics with x = 0.10 and y = 0.15, and then an enhanced piezoelectricity of d(33) similar to 540 pC N-1 and a large strain of similar to 0.21% can be attained. More importantly, a larger d(33) can be reached when sintered at 1450 degrees C and polarized at their corresponding phase transition temperatures.

However, the heat and mass budget of TPlakes and the performance of contemporary lake models overTP have not been quantified to date. Weutilise 3-yr observations from Ngoring Lake, the largest lake in the Yellow River source region of TP, to investigate the typical properties of the lake-air boundary layer and to evaluate the performance of a simplified lake scheme from the Community Land Model version 4.5 (SLCLM) as one of the most popular lake parameterization schemes in atmospheric models. The strong boundary layer instability during the entire open-water period is a distinguishing feature of the air-lake exchange, similar to the situation over tropical and subtropical lakes, while contrasting to the generally stable atmospheric conditions commonly observed over ice-free temperate and boreal lakes from spring to summer. The rather simple algorithmofSLCLMdemonstrated good performance in these conditions. A series of sensitivity simulations with SLCLM revealed strong shortwave solar radiation and cold air temperatures because of high altitude as the primary factors causing the boundary layer instability. The outcomes of the study (1) demonstrate the role of TP lakes as accumulators of shortwave solar radiation releasing the heat into the atmosphere during the entire open-water period; (2) justify the use of simple lake models for the Tibetan highlands, while revealing remarkable uncertainties in the estimations of the latent heat flux; (3) qualify the strong cool-skin effect on the lake surface which results from permanent negative air-lake temperature difference, and should be taken into account when interpreting remote sensing data from highland areas.

It is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance by traditional models constructed on the assumption that the training and test data are subject to the same distribution, because the customers usually come from different districts and may be subject to different distributions in reality. This study combines ensemble learning with transfer learning, and proposes a clustering and selection based transfer ensemble (CSTS) model to transfer the instances from related source domains to target domain for assisting in modeling. The experimental results in two customer credit scoring datasets show that CSTE model outperforms two traditional credit scoring models, as well as three existing transfer learning models.

Under biological motivation, the stability of equilibria is investigated by the global Lyapunov functions. Some novel techniques are applied to the global dynamics analysis for the differential infectivity epidemic model. Uniform persistence and the sharp threshold dynamics are established; that is, the reproduction number determines the global dynamics of the system. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the main theoretical results.

Displays are the dominant energy consuming component of battery-operated devices, giving rise to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) as a new promising display technology, which consumes different power when displaying different content due to their emissive nature. Based on this property, we propose an approach to improve image energy efficiency onOLEDdisplays by perceiving image content. The key idea of our approach is to eliminate undesired detailswhile preserving the region of interest of the image by leveraging the color and spatial information. First, we use edge detection algorithm to extract region of interest (ROI) of an image. Next, we gradually change luminance and saturation of region of noninterest (NON-ROI) of the image. Then we perform detailed experiment and case study to validate our approach; experiment results show that our approach can save 22.5% energy on average while preserving high quality of the image.

This paper simulates and predicts the discharge, treatment and reutilisation of solid waste in the iron and steel industry by constructing a system dynamics model. The results show that the model can be applied effectively. The solid waste volume has a tendency to rapidly increase and the stripping ratio shows a decreasing trend. The reutilised volume of tailings increases substantially over time and the reutilised ratio in the environment scenario is higher than that in the current scenario.

It encoded a putative protein with 281 amino acids, sharing 95.3% identity with Arabidopsis plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP, Genbank: NP_195236.1). Prediction of transmembrane structure showed that BnPIP-like gene contained five loops and six transmembrane helices. Online analysis also indicate that BnPIP-like protein existed as homo-tetramers. In order to research its functions in eucaryon, BnPIP-like gene was fused into the pPIC3.5K and then the recombinant vector, as well as the pPIC3.5K, were induced into methylotrophic yeast (Pichia pastoris Strain GS115), respectively. In BMMY media, the BnPIP-like protein was sufficiently expressed after methanol (MeOH) induction for 24 h. The salt stress (300 mM NaCl) treatment was operated after 18 h of normal growth conditions. The OD600 values of BnPIP-like-transgenic P. pastoris and the control were determined every 12 h. The growth curves were obtained and it showed that the growth of both P. pastoris with or without BnPIP-like protein was obviously inhibited. However, the concentrations of BnPIP-like-transgenic P. pastoris was always higher than the control, indicating that the inhibition of growth in BnPIP-like-transgenic P. pastoris was slighter because of the over-expression of BnPIP-like gene. Thus the resistance to salt explained the eukaryotic functions of BnPIP-like protein. Moreover, it provided a theoretical possibility for a more comprehensively industrial utilization of fermenting yeast.

The corresponding evolutions of pulse shapes and spectra are provided for different soliton order and phase modulation parameters. The results show that, in the time domain, the initially first-order phase modulation can make the soliton pulse shift towards the pulse leading or trailing edges along a straight line with the pulse shape profile and its breather evolution behavior unchanged. Correspondingly, in the frequency domain, the initial first-order phase modulation can make the pulse spectrum exhibit red-shifting or blue-shifting phenomenon with the pulse spectrum profile and its breather evolution behavior unchanged. The larger the absolute value of the phase modulation parameter, the larger the shifting. While for the same phase modulation parameter, both-the fundamental and higher-order solitons exhibit the same shifting. These results maybe potentially applied in manipulating the time-domain trajectories of the solitons as well as their corresponding frequency-domain positions by engineering the initial first-order phase modulation parameters of the solitons.

Herein, the local structure and promotion mechanism of PyN in carbon materials for the catalytic oxidation of SO2 were investigated on graphene model catalysts by using density functional theory. A type of defect involving three PyN atoms around a single C atom vacancy was found to be active for both the dissociation of O-2 and the further oxidation of SO2. It is worth mentioning that both PyN and the adjacent C atoms are primary active sites. Additionally, a switch effect of pyridine N-oxide was identified, which can suppress or enhance the oxidation capacity of surface oxygen species for SO2 oxidation. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the low temperature catalytic oxidation of SO2 by PyN-doped carbon materials and offer insight for the design of new carbon-based catalysts.

Interpolation methods, which are widely used to enhance resolution, often result in blurred edges. Advanced superresolution scanning acquires images with specific protocols and long acquisition times. In this paper, we propose a novel single image superresolution (SR) method which introduces high-order SVD (HOSVD) to regularize the patch-based SR framework on DWI datasets. The proposed method was implemented on an adaptive basis which ensured a more accurate reconstruction of high-resolution DWI datasets. Meanwhile, the intrinsic dimensional decreasing property of HOSVD is also beneficial for reducing the computational burden. Experimental results fromboth synthetic and realDWI datasets demonstrate that the proposedmethod enhances the details in reconstructed high-resolutionDWIdatasets and outperforms conventional techniques such as interpolation methods and nonlocal upsampling.

A possibility degree formula for the comparison between two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is proposed. Then, using this possibility degree formula, possibility degree matrices are built and the central dominance of one alternative outranking all other alternatives is defined under one attribute. According to the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator, an approach is presented to aggregate the possibility degree matrices based on attributes and then the most desirable alternative is selected. This fuzzy multiple attribute decision making method is used in the field of financial investment evaluation, and the set of attributes of the decision making program is built by financial analyses and accounting reports in the same industry. Finally, numerical example is provided to demonstrate the practicality and the feasibility of the proposed method.

J	Wang, H; Chen, GY; Lei, HH; Wang, YQ; Tang, SX				Wang, Hao; Chen, Gangyi; Lei, Huanhuan; Wang, Yongqian; Tang, Shunxian			Improving the Predictability of Severe Convective Weather Processes by Using Wind Vectors and Potential Temperature Changes: A Case Study of a Severe Thunderstorm	Advances in Meteorology			English	Article							PRECIPITATION; SUPERCELL	Strong, local convective weather events are capable of causing extensive damage, but weather observation systems with limited resolution and radar monitoring can typically provide only a few minutes to hours of prior warning time. This paper presents a comprehensive case study of the cumulative evolution of several characteristic quantities during one extremely severe convective weather process. The research results indicate that the main feature of strong convective weather is the uneven distribution of thermal energy in the atmosphere, and the structure of this heat distribution determines the level of instability in the atmosphere. A vertical "clockwise rolling current" occurs in the wind field structure at the beginning of the process, and this is accompanied by a rapid drop in temperature at the top of the troposphere. When these signs occurred in the case study, radar technology was used to refine the precipitation region and spatial characteristics of the approaching storm.

Based on ET data simulated by the Community Land Model, the present study analyzed the changes in ET over the Loess Plateau. The results showed the domain-average ET to have decreased in the past 31 years, at a rate of 0.78 mm year(-1). ET fluctuated much more strongly in the 1990s than in the 1980s and 2000s, and, apart from in autumn, ET decreased in all seasons. In particular, ET in summer comprised about half of the annual ET trend and had the sharpest trend, dominating the interannual decline. ET also decreased more sharply in the semiarid than semihumid regions. The declining trend of ET was attributed to declining precipitation and air humidity. Locally, the ET trend was closely related to local mean annual precipitation: in areas with precipitation less than 400 mm, ET showed a decreasing trend; in areas with precipitation larger than 600 mm, ET showed an increasing trend; and in areas with precipitation in the range of 400-600 mm could be classified as a transitional zone.

Furi-Vignoli-type characterizations are established for the well-posedness. We prove that the weak generalized Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations is equivalent to the nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution set of the problem. Finally, we discuss the relations between the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations of the split variational inequality problem and the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness by perturbations of the split minimization problem when the split variational inequality problem arises from the split minimization problem.

Compared with other similar implantable antennas, the proposed antenna incorporates three advantages for biotelemetry communication. First, it can realize a broad impedance bandwidth by exhibiting dual resonances. Second, it can obtain a compact structure by introducing two arc-shaped slots, a rectangular slot and a circular slot on metal radiating patch. Finally, it can display a friendly shape by using a circular structure. The proposed antenna occupies a volume of about 431.5mm(3) (10.4(2) x 1.27 pi mm(3)), which is a compromise between miniaturization and bandwidth. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth is 55MHz (385-440MHz). Furthermore, the radiation performance and human body safety consideration of the antenna are examined and characterized.

Microwave assisted biodiesel production is a complex interplay of electromagnetics, reaction between different components and heat and mass transfer in a tube for continuous manufacturing. The multiphysics model is based on a single mode cavity operating at 2450 MHz. Material properties required for multiphysics modeling are assumed as bivariate functions of reaction solution's component and temperature in this work. An elaborate experimental system was developed to validate the multiphysics model through temperature measurements carried out for different initial velocities of the reacting components. Excellent agreement was found between experimental values and model predictions with a maximum relative error of 0.908%. The model developed is elaborate from the point of view of physics which can explain the process of microwave-assisted production of biodiesel and it's very important for optimize the process before scaling up. Also, due to fluid flow, presence of hot spots and thermal runaway caused by the short penetration depth of the microwaves and relative long term microwave heating can be done away with especially for large scale.

By modulating silicon temperature the phased shift induced by the sample index change is compensated to ensure the output power is unchanged. The phase-matching conditions for a valid refractive index sensor are discussed to direct the design for lengths of sensing and heating areas. Meanwhile the sensitivity and resolution of the refractive index sensor are also analyzed. The proposed thermo-optic compensation method shows noticeable advantages compared with refractive index sensor by directly detecting the output power. Based on these discussions, a refractive index sensor with a compact size of 2 mm x 1.5 mm can be realized with a sensitivity of 48,000K/RIU and a resolution of 2 x 10(-6) can be realized.

The results show that, both the pulse shapes and spectra exhibit interesting damped oscillation behavior with decreasing oscillation amplitude for very long distance. In particular, the spectra profiles exhibit interesting arrow shaped evolution. Variations of the pulse widths, maximal normalized amplitudes, and maximal spectral amplitudes with the propagation distance, are also presented. We find that, for the higher order super-Gaussian pulses, their pulse widths and maximal normalized amplitudes have larger values of oscillation periods and initial oscillation amplitudes. However, the higher order super-Gaussian pulses have larger values of average pulse widths but smaller values of average maximal normalized amplitudes. In frequency domain, the higher-order super Gaussian pulses have larger values of average maximal spectral amplitudes. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The proposed I DII display is composed of a display panel, a barrier array and a parallax barrier. The barriers, which are located at the junction of adjacent elemental images on the display panel, are perpendicular to the display panel and the parallax barrier. It is different from the previous 1DII display using the barrier array that the aperture centers of the slits aren't aligned with the centers of the corresponding element images. Moreover, the most important difference is that the pitch of the slit is small than that of the elemental image. The widths of all viewing zones reconstructed by elemental images are identical at the optimal viewing distance. Thus, the viewing angle of the proposed 1DII display isn't affected by the number of the slits and the elemental images. A prototype of the proposed I DII display is developed, and good experimental results are obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Sensitivity analysis was conducted via replacing the new soil hydraulic property scheme in CLM4.5 by the old one, using default CLM4.5 runs as reference. Results indicated that the new parameterization scheme ameliorated the surface dry biases at ZS but enlarged the wet biases which existed at GS site due to ignoring the gravel effect. The wetter surface condition in CLM4.5 also leads to a warmer surface soil temperature because of the greater heat capacity of liquid water. In addition, the combined impact of new soil hydraulic property schemes and the ice impedance function on the simulated soil moisture lead to the more reasonable simulation of the starting dates of freeze-thaw cycle, especially at the thawing stage. The improvements also lead to the more reasonable turbulent fluxes simulations. Meanwhile, the decreased snow cover fraction in CLM4.5 resulted in a lower albedo, which tended to increase net surface radiation compared to previous versions. Further optimizing is needed to take the gravel into account in the numerical description of thermal-hydrological interactions.

It is shown that L-partial pseudo-quasi metrics are reasonable generalizations of partial pseudo-quasi-metrics and pointwise metrics in the sense of Shi. Also, it is proved that an L-partial pseudo-quasi-metric space can be endowed with an L-cotopology and a pointwise quasi-uniformity. Moreover, an L-partial pseudo-quasi-metric and its induced pointwise quasi-uniformity induce the same L-cotopology. (C) 2016 All rights reserved.

The ideal 90 degrees beam bending of Eaton lens is verified by the numerical simulation with the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. The practical refractive index of the lens is realized by controlling the mixing ratio of a polymer to air void. The dimensions of unit cell are designed with effective medium theory and verified by the full-wave simulation software ANSYS HFSS. A polymer jetting 3-D printing method is applied to implement the Eaton lens. The radiation pattern and near-field distribution of the lens are measured using an X-band waveguide as the feed, and the experimental results agree well with the simulated results.

To do so, we use iterative algorithm to simulate the effect of intracavity phase perturbation on eigenmode structure properties of the passive confocal unstable resonator. On this basis, further experiment of output beam properties on a misaligned passive unstable laser resonator has been performed by adopting Hartmann-Shack (H-S) method and Zernike modal wavefront reconstruction. Wavefront distribution and the first 35-order Zernike coefficient included in the wavefront are obtained. The results show that intracavity tilt perturbation notablely affects outcoupled beam intensity distribution, and will also increase some high-order aberrations of beam phase properties. However, low-order Zernike tilt aberration is the main component with phase-tilted perturbation is introduced into resonator cavity. Defocus, low-order astigmatism and coma aberration will all be brought with the augument of phase tilt aberration, which will obviously degrade output beam quality. When intracavity compensating elements are adopted for optical aberration correction, the correction of tilt aberration should be considered first. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Application and analysis of debris-flow early warning system in Wenchuan earthquake-affected area	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CRITICAL RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; SOIL COUPLING MECHANISM; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; DURATION CONTROL; REGIONAL-SCALE; INITIATION; SLOPE; INTENSITY; RUNOFF; FAILURES	The activities of debris flow (DF) in theWenchuan earthquake-affected area significantly increased after the earthquake on 12 May 2008. The safety of the lives and property of local people is threatened by DFs. A physics-based early warning system (EWS) for DF forecasting was developed and applied in this earthquake area. This paper introduces an application of the system in the Wenchuan earthquake-affected area and analyzes the prediction results via a comparison to the DF events triggered by the strong rainfall events reported by the local government. The prediction accuracy and efficiency was first compared with a contribution-factor-based system currently used by the weather bureau of Sichuan province. The storm on 17 August 2012 was used as a case study for this comparison. The comparison shows that the false negative rate and false positive rate of the new system is, respectively, 19 and 21% lower than the system based on the contribution factors. Consequently, the prediction accuracy is obviously higher than the system based on the contribution factors with a higher operational efficiency. On the invitation of the weather bureau of Sichuan province, the authors upgraded their prediction system of DF by using this new system before the monsoon of Wenchuan earthquake-affected area in 2013. Two prediction cases on 9 July 2013 and 10 July 2014 were chosen to further demonstrate that the new EWS has high stability, efficiency, and prediction accuracy.	[Liu, D. L.; Zhang, S. J.; Yang, H.

In this rarely studied family of monolayer binary compounds a variety of possible phases are discovered, including narrow bandgap a semiconductor (FeO2), half-metal (FeS2) and metal (FeSe2 and FeTe2), and all the ground states are ferromagnetic (FM). Based on the magnetic exchange interactions, the temperature dependence of the average magnetic moment per unit cell and magnetic susceptibility of monolayer FeX2 are predicted. The Curie temperatures (T(C)s) are estimated and magnon dispersions as a function of temperature are demonstrated, revealing a new family of pristine monolayers with transition temperatures (96-168 K) above the liquid-nitrogen temperature.

Air temperature, precipitation, maximum depth of frozen ground and maximum snow depth were also analysed for trends and for correlations with soil temperatures. A significant warming trend was evident in the TRSR during the 35 yr analysed. Significant soil warming was detected, at rates of 0.706 degrees C decade(-1) for surface soils (0 cm), 0.477 degrees C decade(-1) for shallow layer soils (5-20 cm) and 0.417 degrees C decade(-1) for deep layer soils (40-320 cm). There was a clear effect of air temperature on soil temperature, as seen from the concurrent significant increases in air and soil temperature trends and the strong cor relation between them. The relationship between precipitation and soil temperatures was com plicated. Higher levels of precipitation on the ground also resulted in higher soil temperatures during the summer in the frozen soil, while the process of freezing and thawing had an inhibitory effect on the soil temperature increase. The warming trends in soil temperature are expected to continue with the degradation of frozen soil in the TRSR.

The sensing mechanism is by changing the incident light wavelength the refractive index change induced by glucose concentration can be compensated to keep the coupling length of DC unchanged. The influences of the central light wavelength, the waveguide width and spacing on the sensitivity and resolution of the proposed sensor are analyzed. By a tradeoff between the coupling length and resolution in a sample index range of 0.02, we can obtain a sensor with a size of 33.65 mm x 100 mu m for d(1) = d(2) = 3 mu m which shows a resolution of about 1.8 x 10(-5) and a sensitivity of 5500 nm/RIU using a tunable laser with a precision of 0.1 nm.

Further experiments on output beam quality on a passive Q-switched zigzag slab Nd:YAG laser have been performed by adopting Hartmann-Shack and Zernike-mode reconstruction methods. By the means of peak-valley and root mean square errors of the wavefront distribution, each order of Zernike aberrations are achieved accurately. Moreover, the distribution of circle energy in the far-field and corresponding beam evaluation factors can also be obtained by further calculation. Experimental results indicate that the wavefront aberration is mainly concentrated in the first 10 Zernike aberrations, which mainly includes the defocus Z(3), the low-order astigmatism Z(5), the coma aberration Z(6), and the spherical aberration Z(10), because of the crystal thermal effect and the intracavity phase perturbation. The method can be used to further analyze the compensation of intracavity aberration and optimal design for such lasers.

An experiment study has been performed in order to analyze the error in retrievals of aerosol optical properties from sunphotometer measurements caused by a variety of in situ objective factors. The standard instrument relative error analysis method was used to determine the relative error of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) under the effects of five factors: spider web inside the collimator (F1); collimator bending (F2); dust inside the optical head (F3); incrustation scale inside the optical head (F4); and dust and incrustation scale inside the optical head (F5). The results showed that the five factors caused error for AOD retrieved at 1020, 870, 670 and 440 nm, with the maximum error occurring at 870 nm due to the more sensitive measurement signals. The error ranges of AOD derived from the direct solar measurements in the four bands were -0.34%-8.77%, -6.22%-9.68%, -0.05%-2.52%, -0.96%-3.48% and 5.42%-13.38% for F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5, respectively. The maximum error occurred under the influence of F5 with an average error value of 10%, while the minimum occurred owing to F3 with an average error value of 1%. All of the AEs retrieved from the experimental instruments were smaller than that from the reference instrument. The AE error values were 15.19%, 25.57%, 4.56%, 4.41% and 8.83% for F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5, respectively. The average AE retrieval error value was 11.7%.

In this paper, eigenmode of resonators using general asymmetric circular mirrors in solid-state lasers is briefly discussed, moreover, experiment analysis of the output beam quality on a passive Q-switched zig-zag slab Nd:YAG laser has been presented by adopting Hartmann-Shack (H-S) method and Zernike mode reconstruction theory. In this way, the PV and RMS errors of the wavefront aberration, each order Zernike aberrations can be acquired accurately, distribution of circle energy in far-field and other beam evaluation factors can also be obtained by further calculation, so beam mode properties and quality can be analyzed comprehensively. Experimental results illuminate that wavefront aberration of the laser is concentrated in the frontal 10 ranks of Zernike aberration, mainly including the defocus Z3, the low-order astigmatism Zs, the coma aberration 4 and the spherical aberration Zis because of the crystal thermal effect and the intracavity phase perturbation.

Our calculations confirm that the anisotropic thermal conductivity in H-MT2 phases is mainly caused by strong directional dependence of phonon dispersions in a layered crystal. The heavy molecular mass can further increase the anisotropic feature of thermal properties. Acoustic phonon bands play dominate role in total thermal conductivity. It is found that longitudinal acoustic phonon band along provides at least 50% of total heat conductance. Contributions from remaining optical phonons are usually less than 1%. Thermal conductivities in [100] and [001] directions are calculated, and they are compared with other experimental and theoretical results. Our current method underestimates the intrinsic thermal conductivity. However, the large anisotropy in thermal conductivity is successfully captured by this simple and efficient approach.

The encoding structure of MGS is significantly different from that of CGS, and the encoding procedure of MGS is very complex. It is important to reduce encoding complexity without sacrificing MGS coding performance. In this paper, a fast mode decision algorithm is proposed for the enhancement layer of MGS based on its specific coding structure. First, the candidate modes and the coding sequence of the current macro-block (MB) are predicted based on mode correlations and correlation degrees. Next, early termination strategies, including Direct Mode, inter-layer, layer and spatial, and spatial-only, are proposed based on the coding structure of MGS and correlations. Finally, MBs are encoded in the order predicted with the four proposed early termination strategies to improve the coding speed. Experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve an average time saving of up to 85.44% with strong robustness and negligible loss in coding efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There are four advantages to the proposed model. First, compared with the standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the proposed model effectively incorporates spatially relationships between the pixels using a Markov random field (MRF). Second, the proposed model is similar to GMM, but has a simple representation and is easier to implement than some existing models based on MRF. Third, the contextual mixing proportion of the proposed model is explicitly modelled as a probabilistic vector and can be obtained directly during the inference process. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm and gradient descent approach are used to maximize the log-likelihood function and infer the unknown parameters of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model at image segmentation is compared with some state-of-the-art models on various synthetic noisy grayscale images and real world color images.

Evolutions of the frequency chirps, shapes and spectra of pulses are numerically calculated in the normal dispersion regime. It is shown that, the approximate analytical frequency chirps accords well with the numerical ones at the initial evolution stages of the pulses. And the calculated approximate critical OWB distances accord well with the numerical ones only for the traditional OWB. In addition, for the positive QN and the negative one but with small absolute values, the traditional OWB can be observed. While for the negative QN with large absolute values, non-traditional OWB may occur. Namely, soliton pulse trains may develop during the pulse propagation. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

The effects of viscous friction and thermal conduction on the acoustic wave propagating in the liquid and perfect gas are respectively analyzed under different configurations of acoustic frequency and shear flow profile. In Part 1 of this paper, mathematical models of non-isentropic and isentropic acoustic waves are formulated based on the conservation of mass, momentum and energy for both liquid and perfect gas. Meanwhile, comprehensive solutions based on the Fourier-Bessel theory are provided, which gives a general methodology of iteratively calculating features of the acoustic wave. Numerical comparisons with previous simplified models verify the validity of the proposed models and solutions.

The simulated SM was compared to the in situ SM measurements from International Soil Moisture Network over China, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis data, a new microwave based multiple-satellite surface SM dataset (SM-MW), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA Interim/Land) SM data. The results showed that CLM4.0 simulation is capable of capturing characteristics of the spatial and temporal variations of SM. The simulated, NCEP, SM-MW, and ERA Interim/Land SM products are reasonably consistent with each other; based on the simulated SM of summer, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution in every layer was characterized by a gradually increasing pattern from the northwest to southeast. The SM increased from surface layer to deeper layer in general. The variation trends basically showed consistencies at all depths. The simulated SM of summer demonstrated different responses to the precipitation variation. The variation distribution of SM and measured precipitation had consistencies. The humid region significantly responded to precipitation, while the semiarid and arid regions were ranked second.

In order to explore and understand the impact in the grassland's eco-environment during the RGLGP, we utilized Projection Pursuit Model (PPM) and Geographic Information Systeni (GIS) to develop a spatial assessment model to examine the ecological vulnerability of the grassland. Our results include five indications: (1) it is practical to apply the spatial PPM on ecological vulnerability assessment for the grassland. This methodology avoids creating an artificial hypothesis, thereby providing objective results that successfully execute a multi-index assessment process and analysis under non-linear systems in eco-environments; (2) the spatial PPM is not only capable of evaluating regional eco-environmental vulnerability in a quantitative way, but also can quantitatively demonstrate the degree of effect in each evaluation index for regional eco-environmental vulnerability; (3) the eco-environment of the Xianshui River Basin falls into the medium range level. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use cover and change (LUCC) crucially influence the Xianshui River Basin's eco-environmental vulnerability. Generally, in the Xianshui River Basin, regional eco-environmental conditions improved during 2000 and 2010. The RGLGP positively affected NOVI and LUCC structure, thereby promoting the enhancement of the regional eco-environment; (4) the Xianshui River Basin divides its ecological vulnerability across different levels; therefore our study investigates three ecological regions and proposes specific suggestions for each in order to assist in eco-environmental protection and rehabilitation; and lastly that (5) the spatial PPM established by this study has the potential to be applied on all types of grassland eco-environmental vulnerability assessments under the RGLGP and under the similar conditions in the Returning Agriculture Land to Forest Project (RALFP). However, when establishing an eco-environmental vulnerability assessment model, it is necessary to choose suitable evaluation indexes in accordance with regional eco-environmental characteristics.

In this approach, the integration of feed-forward and feedback controls is presented to design the kinematic controller of wheeled mobile robots, where the control law is constructed on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, for generating the precisely desired velocity as the input of the dynamic model of wheeled mobile robots; a proportional-integral-derivative based membrane controller is introduced to design the dynamic controller of wheeled mobile robots to make the actual velocity follow the desired velocity command. The proposed approach is defined by using an enzymatic numerical membrane system to integrate two proportional-integral-derivative controllers, where neural networks and experts' knowledge are applied to tune parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on the simulated wheeled mobile robots show the effectiveness of this approach.

Mixing state of atmospheric particles over the North China Plain	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mixing state; Hygroscopicity; Volatility; Aerosol particles; North China Plain	NUMBER SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; CLOUD CONDENSATION NUCLEI; AEROSOL OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; BLACK CARBON; HYGROSCOPIC PROPERTIES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; PARTICULATE MATTER; SOOT PARTICLES; CCN ACTIVITY; HUMAN HEALTH	In this unique processing study, the mixing state of ambient submicron aerosol particles in terms of hygroscopicity and volatility was investigated with a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer and a Volatility Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer. The measurements were conducted at a regional atmospheric observational site in the North China Plain (NCP) from 8 July to 9 August, 2013. Multimodal patterns were observed in the probability density functions of the hygroscopicity parameter kappa and the shrink factor, indicating that ambient particles are mostly an external mixture of particles with different hygroscopicity and volatility. Linear relationships were found between the number fraction of hydrophobic and non-volatile populations, reflecting the dominance of soot in hydrophobic and nonvolatile particles. The number fraction of non-volatile particles is lower than that of hydrophobic particles in most cases, indicating that a certain fraction of hydrophobic particles is volatile. Distinct diurnal patterns were found for the number fraction of the hydrophobic and non-volatile particles, with a higher level at nighttime and a lower level during the daytime. The result of air mass classification shows that aerosol particles in air masses coming from north with high moving speed have a high number fraction of hydrophobic/non-volatile population, and are more externally mixed. Only minor differences can be found between the measured aerosol properties for the rest of the air masses. With abundant precursor in the NCP, no matter where the air mass originates, as far as it stays in the NCP for a certain time, aerosol particles may get aged and mixed with newly emitted particles in a short time.

In this paper, we proposed a procedure which combines both Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) techniques for the micro-Doppler analysis. The Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) based method was also proposed to address the problem of mode mixing which may occur in EMD procedure. The simulation results showed that, compared with the traditional Cohen's class time-frequency method (SPWVD), the method we proposed achieved much better performance under three different conditions (severe noise, weak modulation and compound vibrations).

The experimental results revealed that the humidity sensing properties of the functionalized graphene films were strongly associated with their oxygen content. The humidity response of the sensor could be improved by increasing the oxygen content of the functionalized graphene films. The stability of the sensor was also investigated using an impedance analysis method. The results indicated that the stability of the sensor was also influenced by the oxygen content of the functionalized graphene films during humidity detection. An increase in the oxygen content of the functionalized graphene film reduced the sensor stability. Thus, our work suggests that the oxygen content of functionalized graphene films is a key parameter for the design of graphene-based bulk acoustic wave humidity sensors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison with observations showed that the model reproduced surface ozone and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column densities. Long-range transport from outside East Asia contributed the greatest fraction to annual surface ozone over remote regions, the Korean peninsula, and Japan, reaching 50%-80% of total ozone. Self-contributions accounted for 5%-20% ozone in the Korean peninsula and Japan, whereas the contribution of trans-boundary transport from photochemical production in China was less than 5%-10%. At extra-high ozone levels, self-contributions reached 50%-60% in the Korean peninsula. Ozone source-receptor relationships showed high seasonal variability over East Asia. Significant transport was also found between sub-regions in China, which presents a great challenge to policy-makers because most current control strategies are confined to specific regions.

Our proposed method first combines the basis expansion model (BEM) and the inter symbol interference (ISI) cancellation to overcome the situation that exists with the fast time-varying channel and the normalized maximum multipath channel exceeding the length of the cyclic prefix (CP). At first, the channel estimation and signal detection can be approximated without considering the ISI. Then, the channel parameters and signal detection are updated through ISI cancellation and circular convolution reconstruction from the frequency domain. The simulations show the algorithm can improve the performance of channel estimation and signal detection.

Afterwards, the frequency aliasing that is caused by the digitalization is studied. To solve these two issues, the selection of the sampling frequency is of great importance. In this paper, a maximizing minimum arc-distance strategy is proposed, which is dependent on the frequency range of the signal. The arc-distance method is designed for optimizing the sampling frequency. Furthermore, with this method, the minimum arc distances between the frequency bands of the signal and the interferences can be calculated. The inter-band arc distances are important references for optimizing the transition bandwidth of the filter after the sampling and demodulation process.

The hydrazine hydrate treatment induced the simultaneous formation of Ti3+ species and N-doping in the lattice of TiO2 NTs. In addition, the N-Ti3+/TiO2 NTs photoelectrode exhibited intense visible light absorption ranging from 400 to 800 nm, high transient photoinduced current of 0.213 mA cm(-2), charge carriers concentration of 0.92 x 10(19) cm(-3), generation of hydroxyl radicals and PEC efficiency of 100% for the degradation of diclofenac solution within 4 h visible light irradiation. The enhanced-visible-light PEC performance was mainly attributed to the enhancement of visible light absorbance, narrow band gap energy and high separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers. This study provides a facile strategy to construct intense visible light active catalyst, which could be applied in the fields of wastewater/air purification, solar energy conversion and water splitting.

Weak luminous grounded channel was recognized below the downward leader tip in the frame preceding the return stroke, which is inferred as upward connecting leader considering the physical process of lightning attachment, though not directly confirmed by sequential frames. For stepped leader-first return strokes, the upward connecting leaders tend to be induced by those downward leader branches with brighter luminosity and lower channel tip above ground, and they may accomplish the attachment with great possibility. The upward connecting leaders for 2 out of 61 leader-subsequent stroke sequences were captured in the frame prior to the return stroke, exhibiting relatively long channel lengths of 340 m and 105 m, respectively. The inducing downward subsequent leaders were of the chaotic type characterized by irregular electric field pulse train with duration of 0.2-0.3 ms. The transient drop of the high potential difference between stepped leader system and ground when the attachment occurred would macroscopically terminate the propagation of those ungrounded branches while would not effectively prevent the development of the existing space stem systems in the low-conductivity streamer zone apart from the leader tip. When the ungrounded branches are of poor connection with the main stroke channel, their further propagation toward ground would be feasible. These two factors may contribute to the occurrence of multiple grounding within the same leader-return stroke sequence.

It was revealed that the monodispersed Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets. The Ag/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were applied in removal of NO in air under visible light irradiation. The results showed that the decoration of Ag nanoparticles not only enhanced the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 nanosheets, but also benefited the oxidation of NO to final products. The increased visible light absorption arising from the surface plasmon resonance of Ag and improved separation and transfer of photoinduced carriers over Ag/g-C3N4 composites were demonstrated by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence spectra, respectively. It was therefore proposed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ag/g-C3N4 composites could be attributed to the extended light response range and enhanced charge separation due to the introduction of Ag nanoparticles.

Their grain sizes climb up and then decline with increasing Ba2+ content, and Ba2+ is homogenously distributed in the matrix. With adding Ba2+ to replace both Bi3+ and Na+, it slightly influences the T-C. A rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase boundary appears in the ceramics with the compositional range of x=0-0.20, drastically enhancing both dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. In addition, the ceramic with x=0.15 has the largest d(33) similar to 360 pC/N, together with a good temperature stability of ferroelectricity and an enhanced thermal stability of piezoelectricity. Therefore, it is proved that such a ceramic system is a promising candidate for piezoelectric devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Then based on the WRF3.2 and the NCEP/NCAR FNL reanalysis data, we devised comparative tests of changing the plateau's topographic gradient and simulated a process of persistent heavy rain that happened in May 2010 in South China. The results are shown as follows. The Tibetan Plateau's topography is conducive to the formation of atmospheric Rossby waves. while the plateau's terrain, its friction and heating effects can all make the atmospheric Rossby waves develop into the planetary waves; The effects of plateau's north and south slopes on the Rossby wave' phase velocity is opposite, and when the slope reached a certain value can the quasi-steady normal fluctuations be generated; Simultaneously, due to the plateau's topographic gradient, descending motion appears at the west side of the plateau while ascending motion appears at the east side, and the vertical movement increased with the amplification of topographic gradients. The plateau's topographic gradient also obviously amplified the precipitation in South China, and the rainfall area increased with the amplification of topographic gradients and gradually moved from south to north and from west to east, which is conducive to the occurrence and development of convective activities in the downstream areas of the Tibetan Plateau; Moreover, for the plateau's dynamic and thermal effects, the Rossby wave' propagation shows upstream effects of energy dispersion, so the plateau can then affect the weather in downstream areas. Moreover, the wave group velocity increased with the degree of topographic slope.

Using the REOF we analyzed the spatial distribution of precipitation in the 109 stations in the Yangtze River Basin in Meiyu periods from 1978 to 2007. The result showed that the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin can be divided into the south and north part. As a result, relationships between an atmospheric heating source (hereafter called <Q(1)>) over the Asian region and the precipitation on the south and north side of Yangtze River in Meiyu periods were separately studied in this paper. The results are shown as follows. The flood/drought to the north of Yangtze River (NYR) was mainly related to the <Q(1)> over the East Asia summer monsoon region: when the <Q(1)> over the Philippines through Western Pacific and the south China was weakened (strengthened), it would probably result in the flood (drought) in NYR; and the precipitation on the south side of Yangtze River (SYR) was related to the <Q(1)> over the east Asia and Indian summer monsoon region: when the <Q(1)> over the areas from south China to the northern East China Sea and Yellow Sea and south-eastern Japan was strengthened (weakened), and the <Q(1)> over the areas from the Bay of Bengal to south-eastern Tibetan Plateau was weakened (strengthened), it will lead to flood (drought) in SYR.

Considering the problems of the ensemble-based data assimilation part of the system, including the reduction in the degree of geostrophic balance between variables, and the non-smooth analysis increment and its obviously smaller size compared with the 3DVAR data assimilation, corresponding measures were taken to optimize and ameliorate the system. Accordingly, a single pressure observation ensemble-based data assimilation experiment was conducted to ensure that the ensemble-based data assimilation part of the system is correct and reasonable. A number of localization-scale sensitivity tests of the ensemble-based data assimilation were also conducted to determine the most appropriate localization scale. Then, a number of hybrid data assimilation experiments were carried out. The results showed that it was most appropriate to set the weight factor of the ensemble-estimated covariance in the experiments to be 0.8. Compared with the 3DVAR data assimilation, the geopotential height forecast of the hybrid data assimilation experiments improved very little, but the wind forecast improved slightly at each forecast time, especially over 300 hPa. Overall, the hybrid data assimilation demonstrates some advantages over the 3DVAR data assimilation.

Subsequently, the resulting samples were characterized through scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible light diffuse reflection spectrum (UV-vis DRS) and exfoliated volume (EV) measurements. Results showed that both TiO2/EG nanocatalysts displayed an obviously enhanced visible light absorbance. Besides, the S-TiO2/EG nanocatalyst exhibited higher adsorptive and photocatalytic (PC) performance than those of M-TiO2/EG sample, which was mainly attributed to the more intense visible light absorbance and well-developed porosity. Furthermore, the effects of massive ratio between TiO2 and EG and calcination temperature on the PC performances were investigated in detail. Under the optimized conditions, 89.6% of phenol solution could be degraded within 120 min visible light irradiation by S-TiO2/EG nanocatalyst.

Subsequently, morphologies and chemical structures were investigated through scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the optical and photoelectrochemical (PECH) properties were recorded through Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), transient photocurrent density and Mott-Schottky measurements. Furthermore, the photocatalytic (PC) performance was evaluated through the yield of hydroxyl (center dot OH) radicals and degradation of methyl blue under visible light illumination. All results indicated that Ag2S NCs/TiO2 NTAs photoelectrode exhibited intense visible light absorbance, high transient photocurrent of 0.098 mA.cm(-2) and charge carrier concentration of 1.58 x 10(19).cm(-3), as well as effective PC performance of 83.6% for the degradation of methyl blue. Besides, center dot OH radicals was the dominated responsible active species during the PC process. The enhanced visible light PC performance was mainly attributed to the intense visible light absorbance and high charge carrier separation efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The morphology and structure analysis indicated that the as-fabricated semiconductor films were composed of particles with diameters ranging from 80 to 160 nm, and each particle was composed of small crystalline grain with a narrow size about 20 nm, which was the face-centered cubic single crystal structure. X-ray diffraction peaks shifted toward lower angle, and the size of the lattice increased compared with undoped NiO, which demonstrated that zinc ions have been successfully doped into the NiO host structure. Simultaneously, we systematically investigated the gas-sensing properties of the Zn-doped NiO sensors for NH3 detection at room temperature. The sensor based on doped NiO sensing films gave four to nine times faster response and four to six times faster recovery speeds than those of sensor with undoped NiO films, which is important for the NiO sensor practical applications. Moreover, we found that the doped NiO sensors owned outstanding selectivity toward ammonia.

The determination of water vapor distribution in the atmosphere and its changing pattern is very important. Although atmospheric scientists have developed a variety of means to measure precipitable water vapor (PWV) using remote sensing data that have been widely used, there are some limitations in using one kind satellite measurements for PWV retrieval over land. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for retrieving PWV over land by combining different kinds of remote sensing data and it would work well under the cloud weather conditions. The PWV retrieval algorithm based on near infrared data is more suitable to clear sky conditions with high precision. The 23.5 GHz microwave remote sensing data is sensitive to water vapor and powerful in cloud-covered areas because of its longer wavelengths that permit viewing into and through the atmosphere. Therefore, the PWV retrieval results from near infrared data and the indices combined by microwave bands remote sensing data which are sensitive to water vapor will be regressed to generate the equation for PWV retrieval under cloud covered areas. The algorithm developed in this paper has the potential to detect PWV under all weather conditions and makes an excellent complement to PWV retrieved by near infrared data. Different types of surface exert different depolarization effects on surface emissions, which would increase the complexity of the algorithm. In this paper, MODIS surface classification data was used to consider this influence. Compared with the GPS results, the root mean square error of our algorithm is 8 mm for cloud covered area. Regional consistency was found between the results from MODIS and our algorithm. Our algorithm can yield reasonable results on the surfaces covered by cloud where MODIS cannot be used to retrieve PWV.

We therefore investigate a simple universal time-domain minimum mean square error-decision feedback equalizer with a simple adaptive channel estimator to approach the near-optimal performance for mobile users. Furthermore, the method can be readily extended to the receivers incorporating with time-domain equalizers in other wireless communication scenarios such as OFDM systems over doubly selective channels. Using the Givens rotation based Cholesky factorization, the optimum feedforward and feedback coefficients can be easily derived with very low complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can approach the near-optimum performance using LMS channel estimation, and is suitable for the mobile terminals.

J	Xia, ZY; Chen, HB; Xu, LS; Wang, YQ				Xia Zhiye; Chen Hongbin; Xu Lisheng; Wang Yongqian			Extended range (10-30 days) heavy rain forecasting study based on a nonlinear cross-prediction error model	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						nonlinear cross prediction error; extended range forecasting; phase space	ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; TIME-SERIES; OPTIMAL PERTURBATION; PREDICTABILITY; SYSTEM; DIMENSION; ECMWF; NCEP; METHODOLOGY; EXPONENTS	Extended range (10-30 d) heavy rain forecasting is difficult but performs an important function in disaster prevention and mitigation. In this paper, a nonlinear cross prediction error (NCPE) algorithm that combines nonlinear dynamics and statistical methods is proposed. The method is based on phase space reconstruction of chaotic single-variable time series of precipitable water and is tested in 100 global cases of heavy rain. First, nonlinear relative dynamic error for local attractor pairs is calculated at different stages of the heavy rain process, after which the local change characteristics of the attractors are analyzed. Second, the eigen-peak is defined as a prediction indicator based on an error threshold of about 1.5, and is then used to analyze the forecasting validity period. The results reveal that the prediction indicator features regarded as eigenpeaks for heavy rain extreme weather are all reflected consistently, without failure, based on the NCPE model; the prediction validity periods for 1-2 d, 3-9 d and 10-30 d are 4, 22 and 74 cases, respectively, without false alarm or omission. The NCPE model developed allows accurate forecasting of heavy rain over an extended range of 10-30 d and has the potential to be used to explore the mechanisms involved in the development of heavy rain according to a segmentation scale. This novel method provides new insights into extended range forecasting and atmospheric predictability, and also allows the creation of multi-variable chaotic extreme weather prediction models based on high spatiotemporal resolution data.

Herein, hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) materials were synthesized by adopting dodecylamine as a structure directing agent, which was then employed as a host for supporting polyethylenimine (PEI) without further calcinations or extraction treatment. The physicochemical properties of the silica support and composites were characterized, and the moisture adsorption capacity of these composites was determined. The reserved template agents resulted in a dramatic improvement in moisture adsorption amount. Among them, 50PEI/DHMS showed the highest adsorption value. The enhanced adsorption could be attributed to the generated hydrogen bonding between amino groups and H2O molecules and the improved diffusion of moisture into the bulk networks of PEI polymers due to its better spatial dispersion imposed by the long alkyl chains of template agents, which was confirmed by thermogravimetry results and hydrogen efficiency analysis. Moreover, the maintained terminal amino groups of templates could also function as active sites for moisture adsorption. The results herein imply that the PEI/DHMS composites could be appealing materials for capturing moisture in GIS.

J	Zhong, XQ; Du, XT; Cheng, K				Zhong, Xianqiong; Du, Xiantong; Cheng, Ke			Evolution of finite energy Airy pulses and soliton generation in optical fibers with cubic-quintic nonlinearity	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							WAVE BREAKING; BEAMS; PROPAGATION; ACCELERATION; MANIPULATION; INSTABILITY; MODULATION; DISPERSION; PACKETS; DRIVEN	We numerically simulate the propagation of finite energy Airy pulses in optical fibers with cubic-quintic nonlinearity and analyze the effects of quintic nonlinear parameters and soliton order number on their evolution properties. The soliton pulses are observed, whose peak amplitudes and corresponding temporal positions will vary with the propagation distance. Depending on different quintic nonlinearity parameters and soliton order number, the soliton pulse temporal positions exhibit weak decayed oscillations and then nearly linearly shift to leading or trailing edge of the Airy wavepacket, or tend to fixed positions, and the peak amplitudes also exhibit decayed oscillations but with different oscillation amplitude and central values. For large soliton order number, the soliton pulses are considerably compressed. Other weak dispersive wave pulses will appear near the main soliton pulses and gradually depart from the main soliton pulses. In the case of small soliton order, despite their considerable energy attenuation, the main lobes and even minority of the neighboring side lobes of the Airy pulses can still recover from the energy transfer to the soliton pulses and the dispersive wave pulses and maintain their unique properties of self-healing and self-acceleration in time for a very long distance. In the case of large soliton order, however, the Airy wavepacket only remains its very weak background and even disappears quickly.

Here, TiO2 is incorporated into a ZnO/a-Si interface as an antireflection layer and SiOx is incorporated into an a-Si/mu c-Si interface as an intermediate reflecting layer. Solar cells with such architecture not only increase the light absorption but also reduce the mismatch losses of current between the top and bottom cells. The key results, as evidenced by the spectral response measurements, are that the total photocurrent increases from 22.62 to 24.35 mA/cm(2), as well as the short circuit current density of the two component cells is reached to a delicate balance. The influences of the interlayer thickness and morphology on the improvement have been investigated using an electromagnetic simulation in order to take full advantage of this design.

However, our field measurement of two CFPPs equipped with SCR indicates a significant increase of So(4)(2-) and NH4+ emission in primary PM2.5, due to catalytic enhancement of SO2 oxidation to SO3 and introducing of NH3 as reducing agent. The subsequent formation of (NH4)(2)SO4 or NH4HSO4 aerosol is commonly concentrated in sub-micrometer particulate matter (PM1) with a bimodal pattern. The measurement at the inlet of stack also showed doubled primary PM2.5 emission by SCR operation. This effect should therefore be considered when updating emission inventory of CFPPs. By rough estimation, the enhanced primary PM2.5 emission from CFPPs by SCR operation would offset 12% of the ambient PM2.5 concentration reduction in cities as the benefit of national NOx emission abatement, which should draw attention of policy-makers for air pollution control.

By an impedance analysis method, the response mechanism underlying this effect has been examined. It is found that the disturbance of the fringing electric field of QCR due to adjacent metal is the main reason. Moreover, this experiment demonstrates that the proximity effect of QCR is strongly associated with the fundamental resonance frequency. Also, the effect of the size of the adjacent copper disk on the proximity effect of QCR has also been studied. The accurate understanding and prediction of this effect, on one hand, can help us distinguish abnormal frequency fluctuation especially in the presence of the adjacent metal. On the other hand, this effect can also be used for sensing applications.

Coincident with this climate shift, climate models' skills in predicting the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the 2000s are significantly lower than in the 1980s-1990s. A common bias is likely to exist in contemporary ENSO models that got amplified after the climate shift. In this study, we identify this model bias to be the wind-sea surface temperature coupling processes over the tropical Pacific. Evidence is presented to show that this coupling process experienced an obvious shift around year 2000 in its coupling strength and coupling center. A simple ENSO coupled model is used to demonstrate that the changing properties of the post-2000 ENSO events can be more realistically simulated if this model bias is alleviated.

This transitional zone is an important ecological barrier of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. However, the innate vulnerability of the environment combined with the unreasonable development and utilization of hydropower, forestry, agriculture and grassland resources lead to prominent eco-environmental problems in this area. In order to analyze environmental problems in the study area, based on the selected environmental vulnerability indicators (including elevation, slope, vegetation coverage, land use, soil type, precipitation, temperature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population), this paper integrates Projection Pursuit Model (PPM) and Geography Information System (GIS) to quantitatively evaluate the environmental vulnerability in the middle-upper reaches of Dadu River Watershed in both 2000 and 2010. According to the evaluation results, the environmental vulnerability of the study area is divided into five grades, namely, potential vulnerability, slight vulnerability, light vulnerability, moderate vulnerability, and high vulnerability. On the whole, the environmental vulnerability of the study area is at the moderate level, and exhibits obvious vertical distribution characteristics. Meanwhile, the environmental vulnerability changes show a trend of generally improved and partially deteriorated for the past 10 years (from 2000 to 2010) in the study area. Besides, the driving forces of the environmental vulnerability changes are discussed and analyzed. The general improvement of the study area environment mainly benefits from the carrying-out of the environmental protection policies such as "Natural Forests Protection" and "Grain-for-Green". And the primary reasons that cause local environment of the study area worse are over-exploitation of hydropower and mineral resources. At the end of this paper,according to the environmental vulnerability classification results, specific suggestions were proposed for regional environmental protection.

The characteristic polynomials corresponding to the Y-parameters rather than the S-parameters are derived and then determined by the Cauchy method. Once determining the characteristic polynomials, the complex poles and residues of Y-parameters are also determined. Using these complex poles and residues, the complex CM can be obtained by a sequence of similarity transformations, and then the desired extracted CM and unloaded Q for each resonator are obtained from this complex CM. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, three filter CM extraction examples are demonstrated. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Yu, CX; Yin, XA; Li, ZY; Yang, ZF				Yu, Chunxue; Yin, Xin'an; Li, Zuoyong; Yang, Zhifeng			A universal calibrated model for the evaluation of surface water and groundwater quality: Model development and a case study in China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Neural network model; Universal model; Surface water; Ground water; Water quality evaluation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY SYNTHETIC EVALUATION; INDEX; PROTECTION; SYSTEMS	Water quality evaluation is an important issue in environmental management. Various methods have been used to evaluate the quality of surface water and groundwater. However, all previous studies have used different evaluation models for surface water and groundwater, and the models must be recalibrated due to changes in monitoring indicators in each evaluation. Water quality managers would benefit from a universal and effective model based on a simple expression that would be suitable for all cases of surface water and groundwater, and which could therefore serve as a standard method for a region or country. To meet this requirement, we attempted to develop a universal calibrated model based on the radial basis function neural network. In the new model, the units and values of the evaluation indicators for surface water and groundwater are normalized simultaneously to make the data directly comparable. The model's training inputs comprise the normalized value in each of a water quality indicator's grades (e.g., the nitrate contents defined in a regulatory standard for grades I to V) for all evaluation indicators. The central vector of the Gaussian function is used as the average of the evaluation indicators' normalized standard values for the five grades. The final calibrated model is expressed as an equation rather than in a programming language, and is therefore easier to use. We used the model in a Chinese case study, and found that the model was feasible (it compared well with the results of other models) and simple to use for the evaluation of surface water and groundwater quality.

When incubated with this ALT pre-treated sludge, dry solids (DS) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of typical wastewater activated sludge reached 22.5% and 3.4 x 10(12) m/kg, respectively, which were much better than that obtained with conventional chemical flocculants. Sludge dewatering was further improved when both the bioflocculant and conventional polyaluminum chloride (PAC) were used simultaneously. Charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging were proposed as the reasons for the enhanced performance in the case of the combined use. With swine wastewater, the bioflocculant could remove COD, ammonium and turbidity by 45.2%, 41.8% and 74.6% when incubated with 20 mg/L at pH 8.0. This study suggested that the ALT pre-treated sludge has a great potential as an alternative bioflocculant to conventional flocculants in sludge dewatering and swine wastewater pretreatment.

The results show that the pure M-type phase is successfully obtained when the La-Co substitution amount x does not exceed 0.3. However, the single M-type phase structure transforms to multiphase structure with further increased x, where the alpha-Fe2O3 phase and La2O3 phase coexist with the M-type phase. Moreover, the saturation magnetization M-s, magnetic anisotropy field H-a, intrinsic coercivity H-ci, and Curie temperature T-C of the ferrites depend on the La-Co substitution amount strongly, which are suggested to be determined by the partially substitution of La3+ -Co2+ ions for Sr2+ -Fe3+ ions with x not higher than 0.3. It is found that the obtained Sr1-xLaxFe12-xCoxO19 (x=0.2 and 0.3) ferrites can provide improved magnetic properties (M-s > 62 emu/g, H-a > 1400 kA/m, and H-ci > 320 kA/m) as low temperature sinterecl M-type hexaferrites for microwave LTCC applications.

Potential energy curves for the X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2), A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2), and 2(2)Pi(3/2,1/2) states are calculated using multi-reference configuration interaction method plus Davidson corrections. Spectroscopic parameters of BeI and MgI are in excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical values. The A(2)Pi(3/2) state of MgI is a repulsive state. It is an unsuitable scheme for the A(2)Pi(3)/2(upsilon') <- X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (upsilon '') transition for laser cooling of MgI. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors f(00) for the A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2) (upsilon' = 0) <- X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (upsilon '' = 0) transitions and suitable radiative lifetimes tau for the A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2) (upsilon' = 0) of BeI and MgI are obtained. Three laser wavelength drives are required for the A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2)(upsilon') <- X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (upsilon '') transitions of BeI and MgI. The proposed cooling wavelengths of BeI and MgI are both in the violet region. The results imply the feasibility of laser cooling of BeI and MgI, and that laser cooling of BeI is more possible.

Real-Time Characterization of Aerosol Particle Composition above the Urban Canopy in Beijing: Insights into the Interactions between the Atmospheric Boundary Layer and Aerosol Chemistry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; MASS-SPECTROMETER; JANUARY 2013; EVOLUTION PROCESSES; ORGANIC AEROSOLS; HAZE POLLUTION; EASTERN CHINA; COMPONENTS; SECONDARY; QUANTIFICATION	Despite extensive efforts into the characterization of air pollution during the past decade, real-time characterization of aerosol particle composition above the urban canopy in the megacity Beijing has never been performed to date. Here we conducted the first simultaneous real-time measurements of aerosol composition at two different heights at the same location in urban Beijing from December 19, 2013 to January 2, 2014. The nonrefractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM,) species were measured in situ by a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer at near-ground level and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor at 260 m on a 325 m meteorological tower in Beijing. Secondary aerosol showed similar temporal variations between ground level and 260 m, whereas much weaker correlations were found for the primary aerosol. The diurnal evolution of the ratios and correlations of aerosol species between 260 m and the ground level further illustrated a complex interaction between vertical mixing processes and local source emissions on aerosol chemistry in the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, the aerosol compositions at the two heights were substantially different. Organic aerosol (OA), mainly composed of primary OA (62%), at the ground level showed a higher contribution to NR-PM1 (65%) than at 260 m (54%), whereas a higher concentration and contribution (15%) of nitrate was observed at 260 m, probably due to the favorable gas-particle partitioning under lower temperature conditions. In addition, two different boundary layer structures were observed, each interacting differently with the evolution processes of aerosol chemistry.

The pulse evolutions in terms of the frequency chirps, shapes and spectra are numerically calculated in the normal dispersion regime. The results reveal that, depending on different QN parameters, the traditional OWB or soliton or soliton pulse trains may occur. The approximate analytical critical distances are found to be in good agreement with the numerical ones only for the traditional OWB whereas the approximate analytical frequency chirps accords well with the numerical ones at the initial evolution stages of the pulses.

The intensity index and zonal position index of the wintertime northern branch ridge (WNBR) are defined in this study by using the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data and precipitation and temperature observations at 160 stations in China. Interannual variation features of the WNBR and its relation with precipitation and surface air temperature in China are discussed based on wavelet analysis, correlation analysis, and composite analysis. The results indicate that the intensity and zonal position of the WNBR exhibit significant interannual variability. The intensity of the WNBR gradually weakens and varies in periodic cycles of 4-6, quasi-2, and quasi-16 yr. Its zonal position shifts westward slightly and varies in periodic cycles of quasi-8 and quasi-16 yr. The WNBR is highly correlated with precipitation and surface air temperature in China. When the WNBR is strong (weak) and its zonal position shifts eastward (westward), winter precipitation in Northeast China and the northern region of Northwest China increases (decreases), whereas precipitation decreases in central China, South China, and eastern regions of Northwest and Southwest China. Meanwhile, surface air temperatures in most areas of China are higher (lower) than normal. Further investigation has revealed that the two indexes are closely related to variations in general atmospheric circulation, which explains why there exists a close linkage between the variation of the WNBR and climate in China. It is believed that the WNBR is also tied to the Rossby wave, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the East Asian trough, and the North Pacific jet stream.

The onboard Microwave Humidity Sounders (MWHSs) provide vertical information about water vapor, which is important for numerical weather prediction (NWP). The noise equivalent delta temperature (NEDT) of the MWHS is higher than that of the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) instrument (e.g., on board MetOp-B) but lower than that of the older AMSU-B instruments (on board NOAA-15, NOAA-16, and NOAA-17). Assimilation of MWHS observations into the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) improved the fit of short-range forecasts to other observations, notably MHS, and also slightly improved the longer-range forecast scores verified against analyses. Also, assimilating the MWHS on board both FY-3A and FY-3B gave a larger impact than either instrument alone. Furthermore, when MWHS and MHS were added separately to a baseline using neither, the impact of MWHS was found to be comparable to that of MHS. Consequently, ECMWF has been assimilating the FY-3B MWHS data in the operational forecasting system since 24 September 2014. This is the first operational use of Chinese polar-orbiting satellite data by an NWP center outside of China.

This study shows that the spring snow depth over the TP decreased after 2002. Meanwhile, atmospheric heating source <Q(1)> over TP also experienced interdecadal variations from cold to warm phase after the year 2002, which could be linked to the decreasing of the spring snow depth over the TP. Possible physical mechanisms of the influence of the spring snow depth on the atmospheric heat source <Q(1)> over the TP are explored. A significant positive correlation was found between the spring <Q(1)> over the TP and subsequent summer (June-August) 500 hPa geopotential height over the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) location. The interdecadal shift northward of WPSH and interdecadal variations of the large scale precipitation conditions favoured the increase of summer precipitation to the Huaihe River valley (30 degrees-35 degrees N, 110 degrees-120 degrees E) during 2002-2010 in comparison to 1979-2001.

The seasonal variations of the AOD and alpha show that the maximum AODs occur in spring, except at Urumqi and Lanzhou. The seasonal mean alpha values are lower than 0.80 in all four seasons at Tazhong, Hotan, Hami, Ejina, Dunhuang, Minqin, and Jiuquan, but higher than 0.80 in winter at Urumqi, Lanzhou and Yinchuan. The first classification method shows that coarse mode particles are found at all ten sites, but that fine mode growth only happens at Urumqi, Lanzhou, and Yinchuan. The relationship between AOD(440nm) and alpha show that alpha smaller than 0.80 decrease with increasing AOD(440nm) at all ten sites. Aerosols are classified into four types (Type I-IV) according to the total mean tau(440) ((tau) over bar (440)) and total mean Angstrom exponent ((alpha) over bar) of each site. Aerosols with a tau(440) smaller than (tau) over bar (440), but greater than or equal to (alpha) over bar (tau(440) < <(tau)over bar>(440) ; alpha >= (alpha) over bar) are classified as Type I; aerosols with tau(440) >= (tau) over bar (440) and alpha >= (alpha) over bar are Type II; those with tau(440) < <(tau)over bar>(440) and alpha < <(alpha)over bar> are Type III; and those with tau(440) >= (tau) over bar (440) and alpha < <(alpha)over bar> are Type IV. The second aerosol classification method shows that Type I and Type III aerosols are the most common at all ten sites. Type II aerosols are the least at Tazhong and Hotan, but are the most common at Urumqi, Lanzhou, and Yinchuan. On the contrary, Type IV aerosols are the most common at Tazhong and Hotan, but are the least common at Urumqi, Lanzhou and Yinchuan.

J	Dong, DH; Huang, G; Qu, X; Tao, WC; Fan, GZ				Dong, Danhong; Huang, Gang; Qu, Xia; Tao, Weichen; Fan, Guangzhou			Temperature trend-altitude relationship in China during 1963-2012	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article								Based on daily air temperature data from 745 stations in China, the present study investigates the regional characteristics of temperature trend and the dependence of temperature changes on the altitude during the period of 1963-2012. There is a consistent warming trend throughout the country except for the southwest China where a cooling trend is identified. Moreover, significant warming trend exists in highland areas such as the Northeast, Inner Mongol, and the Tibet region. Compared with other seasons, the warming trend is most pronounced in highland regions in winter. In summer, the temperature has no obvious increasing trend in north China, while the cooling trend is found in south China. The relationship between altitude and temperature trend is further investigated by dividing China into three subregions according to the altitude-below 200, 200-2,000, and above 2,000 m. Although there is no simple linear relationship between elevation and warming trend on national scale, the temperature trend-altitude relation is different among the three regions. The temperature trend decreases with altitude below 200 m while increases from 200 to 2,000 m, and a weak positive temperature trend-altitude relation is found over 2,000 m. The strongest temperature trend-altitude relations are found in the subtropical regions, especially pronounced south of 36A degrees N in China. The magnitudes of decreases from 200 to 2,000 m are one order lower than the increases below 200 m. Low-altitude stations appear to be influenced more by anthropogenic aerosols. High-altitude stations are mostly located in flat terrain and sparsely populated region. Therefore, temperature trends change with elevations.

The structural, optical, and morphological properties of samples were investigated and found to be strongly dependent on the substrate temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns show silicon film deposited at 25 A degrees C is almost entirely amorphous, however, as the substrate temperature increased from 100 to 300 A degrees C, the grain size of samples increases from 4.1 to 14.6 nm indicates improved crystalline quality. Raman spectroscopy revealed the nc-Si:H films contain crystalline, amorphous and an intermediate structure, and the crystallinity of sample deposited at 300 A degrees C reaching a maximum value of 56 %. The optical absorption spectra of nc-Si:H films show hydrogen content and quantum confinement effect have strong influence on the optical band gap. Atomic force microscopy images show good coincidence with above results.

The results show that the pure M-type crystal phase is successfully obtained for the ferrites with La-Co substitution amount x not higher than 0.3. When the substitution amount further increases to 04 and 0.5, the alpha-Fe2O3 phase and La2O3 phase are found to coexist with the M-type phase, thus the multiphase structure is formed. Besides, the saturation magnetization M-s, intrinsic coercivity H-ci, and Curie temperature T-c of the termites are strongly correlated with the La-Co substitution amount. Enhanced M-s and H-ci are obtained when the substitution amount varies from 0.2 to 0.4, which can exceed 3600 Gs and 4000 Oe, respectively. However, the T-c decreases rapidly when the substitution amount exceeds 0.3, and a value under 410 degrees C is observed It is suggested that the La3+-Co2+ ions can partially substitute the Sr2+-Fe3+ ions for the hot press sintered ferrites at low sintering temperatures, leading to improved M-s and H-ci for use in microwave LTCC ferrite devices.

By tuning the compositions, a high d33 of similar to 51 pC/N and a low dielectric loss of similar to 0.25% can be attained in the ceramics with x = 0.05 and y = 0.05, which is superior to the previously reported results. In addition, a saturated P-E loop with a P-r of 14.2 mu C/cm(2) and an E-C of 53.1 kV/cm can be witnessed in the ceramics with x = 0.05 and y = 0. By studying the relationships between d(33) and different sintering methods, we can find that the quenching method can effectively promote the piezoelectricity of the ceramics. As a result, the systematic investigations on the (1 - x)Bi1-ySmyFeO3-xBiScO(3) ceramics can benefit the developments of bismuth ferrite materials in the field of high-temperature piezoelectrics.

Inverse spin Hall effect of antiferromagnetic MnIr in exchange biased NiFe/MnIr films	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						spin Hall effect; spin pumping; exchange bias	FERROMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; THICKNESS DEPENDENCE	Antiferromagnetic Mn3Ir, which is widely employed in exchange-biased applications, has attracted much attention recently due to its predicted and subsequently observed large spin Hall effect, therefore increasing its potential for spintronic devices in place of conventional paramagnetic 5d spin Hall metals. (Pt, Ta and W) Via the electrical detection of ferromagnetic resonance, we study a series of exchange biased NiFe/MnIr films for various MnIr thicknesses. In these systems, spin-pumped spin currents from NiFe are converted into dc voltages within MnIr via the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), which mixes with spin rectification voltages generated from NiFe. Through angular measurements, we separate these different voltage contributions to qualitatively detect non-zero ISHE in MnIr, which coexists with a non-zero unidirectional anisotropy. We find significant extrinsic damping contributions which prevent the accurate quantification of spin pumping-induced ISHE in MnIr films. The results show that spin currents may propagate and dissipate in MnIr films through ISHE in the presence of exchange bias.	[Soh, Wee Tee; Yeow, Yasmin; Ong, C.

Both the total correlation and the classical correlation become larger than that in any subcomponent; while the quantum correlations of the two nearest-neighbor spin blocks and the two next-nearest-neighbor spin blocks become smaller and for other conditions the quantum correlation becomes larger, i.e., the increase or the production of the long-range quantum correlation is at the cost of reducing the short-range quantum correlation, which deserves to be investigated in the future; and the ration of the quantum correlation to the total correlation monotonically decreases to a steady value as the spacing spin length increasing.

Oxidative stress markers in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: a prospective controlled study	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Oxidative Stress; 8-iso-PGF2 alpha; Cholestasis; Pregnancy	PLASMA GLUTATHIONE-PEROXIDASE; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID; ISOPROSTANES; PREECLAMPSIA; PRODUCTS; SELENIUM; LIVER; BILE	OBJECTIVE: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), characterized by skin pruritus and elevation of serum aminotransferase activity and bile acid concentration in the mother, is one of the most common liver disorders in pregnancy. It was proved that ICP might lead to fetal distress by triggering oxidative damage. Total bile acids (TBA) are an established marker for assessment of the severity of ICP. The aim of this study was to explore associations of TBA levels with levels of the oxidative stress markers 8-epimer of prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2 alpha), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in ICP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Maternal plasma levels of 8-iso-PGF2 alpha, SOD and Gpx were examined in ICP patients (n=40) and normal pregnancy controls (n=47) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. RESULTS: Plasma levels of 8-iso-PGF2 alpha and Gpx were significantly lower in ICP patients than in controls (p = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively), while no significant difference was observed in SOD levels between the two groups. Levels of 8-iso-PGF2 alpha and TBA were negatively correlated (r = -0.277, p = 0.01, Spearman's correlation coefficient). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical severity of ICP is closely related to the degree of lipid peroxidation, and the natural antioxidant system might fail to work effectively in the presence of lipid peroxidation damage in ICP.

J	Chen, D; Wang, HJ; Liu, JP; Li, GP				Chen, Dong; Wang, Huijun; Liu, Jiping; Li, Guoping			Why the spring North Pacific Oscillation is a predictor of typhoon activity over the Western North Pacific	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						typhoon; North Pacific Oscillation; Western North Pacific SST	SEASONAL FOOTPRINTING MECHANISM; TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; QUASI-BIENNIAL OSCILLATION; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; EL-NINO; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; STORM FORMATION; ENSO; FREQUENCY; EVENTS	In this study, we investigated the impact of the spring North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) on typhoon frequency over the Western North Pacific (WNP, north of the equator and west of dateline). To reduce the statistical uncertainty, all the data we used have been excluded the El Nino/Southern Oscillation signals. We found that the spring NPO positively correlated with the annual typhoon number over the WNP (hereafter TNWNP) during the period 1968-2010, with a correlation coefficient of 0.62 (above the 99% significance level). When the Northern Low and Southern High pattern over the north Pacific weakens, the TNWNP tends to increase. A positive phase of spring NPO is associated with the tropical circulation and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Pacific, which may lead to unfavorable dynamical and thermal conditions for typhoon genesis over the WNP during JJAS. The negative anomaly of SST over the WNP, associated with the positive spring NPO anomaly, is connected to the tropical atmospheric circulations from spring to summer via good oceanic seasonal persistence and air-sea interaction. Thus, the spring NPO-related variability of the tropical atmospheric circulation as well as the SST can affect typhoon activity over the WNP. In addition, the spring NPO can also be adopted as a predictor for the summer rainfall in South China, since the spring NPO can modulate the WNP SST and western Pacific subtropical high from spring to summer.

In this paper, regular meteorological observations, as well as flux eddy covariance methods, are used to measure land-atmosphere energy exchange. Experiments were conducted over the Dunhuang Gobi, a typical arid region of northwest China, during the summer of 2008. Surface fluxes were measured directly using an eddy-correlation system, while the vertical gradients of wind and temperature were also observed at four levels using a meteorological tower. Based on the observation data, the integral mean of surface albedo over the Gobi was found to be 0.238. In addition, the mean values of momentum, heat roughness lengths, and soil thermal conductivity were, 0.045, 0.005 cm, 0.199 and 0.201 W (m K)(-1), respectively. The Monin-Obukhov similarity functions for momentum and heat were analyzed and new empirical formulae were developed.

To estimate the critical electric field in the soil, a tangential electric field method is proposed based on the electromagnetic field analysis presented in this study. With this method, the instant moment when the soil ionisation occurs is obtained by examining the tangential component of horizontal electric field. According to the maximum electric field in soil without soil ionisation for every moment, the soil critical electric field could be estimated. In addition, the critical electric fields for four different types of soil reported in the literature are estimated with the tangential electric field method, yielding satisfactory agreement.

Stationary-phase method is utilized to calculate the TOGH shift. When the waveguide is regarded as a two-dimensional planar waveguide, a nonlinear relation between GH shift and temperature is obtained. Based on the noticeable TOGH effect, a sensitive temperature modulator or sensor can be realized. As the waveguide width is limited, the proposed structure can be regarded as a three-dimensional rectangular waveguide. We explore the GH shift and TOGH effect for different modes propagating in rectangular waveguide which show different linear relations between GH shift and temperature, which can be used to design mode-selective device based on TO effect.

The Sidi transformation is used to remove the logarithmic singularities in the integral kernels and then the modified quadrature method is presented to approximate the weakly integrals. Numerical examples show that the error of numerical solution for the boundary integral equation of the 3D Laplace equation can converge with the order O (h(3)) by use of a Sidi transformation, and the optimal condition number for the according discrete system is 0 (h(-1)), where h is the uniform mesh step size.

Results indicate that promoters modification leads to the formation of small Cu particles with a high dispersion, improves catalytic performance of Cu-based catalysts in methanol synthesis. Moreover, the activation temperature is another important factor on affecting the Cu dispersion and particle size. The investigation on CO2 hydrogenation shows that methanol is mainly from hydrogenation of activated CO2 with active hydrogen on Cu particles, which is inhibited by high reaction temperature due to improvement on reverse water-gas shift reaction and methanation.

We prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R-0 <= 1; and there exists a unique endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable when R-0 > 1. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium is also proved by using a graph-theoretic approach to the method of Lyapunov functions.

The results suggest that the boreal summer SAH is more significantly influenced by preceding ENSO events in the easterly phase of the QBO than in the westerly phase. The change in the ENSO-SAH relationship in the different QBO phases may be attributable to the change in the ENSO-induced sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). Specifically, ENSO's influence on the following summer's TIO SST is more significant when the QBO is in its easterly phase than westerly phase. Further analysis showed that the change in the connection between ENSO and the TIO SST in the different QBO phases may be attributable to change in the anomalous tropical Indian Ocean cell (IOC) associated with ENSO. In particular, the anomalous IOC induced by anomalous Walker circulation over the tropical Pacific is stronger and located further west in QBO easterly than westerly phase. This leads to stronger descending motion and larger SST anomalies over the TIO in the QBO easterly phase. These larger SST anomalies over the TIO in the QBO easterly phase could exert a more significant influence on the tropospheric temperature through moist adjustment, which subsequently results in stronger SAH variability.

This paper aims at detecting land desertification change in Zoige County over 15 years with quantitative remote-sensing techniques using multi-spectral imagery. Landsat images acquired in 1994 and 2009 were analyzed using the following methodology: (1) image pre-processing; (2) spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to obtain precise sub-pixel classification results of land cover; and (3) change vector analysis (CVA) to conduct a multi-temporal comparison process. Change detection results depict the land desertification conditions and vegetation re-growth conditions. In this way, we characterized the spatial-temporal change pattern of land desertification in Zoige County between 1994 and 2009. After categorizing ecological regions based on change detection results, we analyzed the driving factors of both land desertification conditions and vegetation re-growth conditions, finding out that grasslands under intense grazing pressure tend to suffer severe desertification, while topographic relief has an obvious influence on vegetation re-growth. Specific suggestions for each ecological region are proposed, which can assist the development of environmental restoration measures and environmental protection measures in Zoige County in an effective way. Furthermore, this methodology for monitoring land desertification could be carried out across neighboring counties or in other regions with similar sub-alpine rangeland and land desertification problems.

The loss of photons and the distortion of the qubit state are caused by noise. To solve these problems, in our study, a hyperentangled Bell state is used to design faithful deterministic secure quantum communication and authentication protocol over collective-rotation and collective-dephasing noisy channel, which doubles the channel capacity compared with using an ordinary Bell state as a carrier; a logical hyperentangled Bell state immune to collective-rotation and collective-dephasing noise is constructed. The secret message is divided into several parts to transmit, however the identity strings of Alice and Bob are reused. Unitary operations are not used.

However, it is difficult to determine the organic reef's internal structure and gas reservoirs due to numerous adverse factors such as the low resolution of seismic data, depth of burial, strong anisotropy, irregular spatial distribution and complex internal structure. A case study of wavelet decomposition and reconstruction technology applied to elucidate the features of organic reef reservoirs in the Changxing formation from Yuanba gas field shows that the seismic record reconstructed by high frequency signal can adequately describe the internal properties of organic reef reservoirs. Furthermore, the root mean square amplitude ratio of both low and high frequency data obtained from the reconstructed seismic data clearly show spatial distribution of gas and water in reef reservoirs.

The GPS-precipitable water vapor (GPS-PWV), obtained through inversion using this technology can reflect the water vapor inflow and outflow in a vertical air column above a certain area in nearly real-time, which is especially important for areas of severe water vapor variation. In this paper, we studied the relationship between GPS-PWV variation and actual precipitation. The specific aim was to identify the underlying physical mechanisms driving the variation and to further strengthen the utility of GPS-PWV in forecasts and warnings of severe convection weather. We concluded that (1) rapid rise in the GPS-PWV in the long-term low-level data predicted the arrival of precipitation and was therefore useful in weather forecasts; (2) the GPS-PWV variation was closely related with the movement of the water vapor transfer belt; (3) the atmosphere showed an unstable energy structure before the GPS-PWV increase; and (4) local motion was strongly related with the development and maintenance of precipitation.

While the inverse Q-filter attempts to eliminate such effect and hence improve the seismic resolution. But the numerical instability of inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation can reduce the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and limit the spatial resolution. Although the gain-limit constrained cut-off frequency method and stable factor method for the inverse Q-filter can control the numerical instability and the SNR, in which the gain-limit is time-invariant and is not associated with the dynamic range of seismic data, it usually suppresses high frequencies at later time and reduces the seismic resolution. In order to solve this problem, we should fully compensate energy of seismic data in the effective frequency band and suppress noise beyond it. This work proposes a self-adaptive approach for inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation based on the cut-off frequency and stable factor methods. The gain-limit in this method is time-variant and self-adaptive to the cui-off frequency of the effective frequency band of seismic data; and the stabilizing factor changes in inverse proportion to the square of the self-adaptive gain-limit. The self-adaptive approach can restore energy of seismic data in the effective frequency band and control the numerical instability, and finally achieve high resolution and high SNR data. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate that the self-adaptive inverse Q-filter can compensate for energy loss without boosting high frequency noise, and produce desirable seismic images with high quality. In order to achieve desirable resolution and high SNR of seismic data by the self-adaptive approach for inverse Q-filtering, the Q value and the cut-off frequency of the effective frequency band at any time should be relatively accurate.

The optimal culture conditions of this strain were determined as 4 g K2HPO4, 2 g KH2PO4, 0.2 g MgSO4, 0.1 g NaCl, and 2.0 g urea dissolved in 1.0 L potato starch wastewater with no need of adding carbon sources or adjusting pH value. Production of this bioflocculant was positively associated with cell growth, and a highest value of 0.81 g/L was obtained. During the kaolin suspension flocculation, charge neutralization and interparticle bridging were proposed as the main reasons for enhanced performance. Further, with potato starch wastewater, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity removal rates reached 52.4 and 81.7 %, respectively, at pH 7.5 when the bioflocculant dose was adjusted to 30 mg/L.

Production of this bioflocculant was positively associated with cell growth, and a highest value of 0.81 g/L was obtained. When incubated with this bioflocculant, dry solids (DS) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of typical wastewater activated sludge reached 20.8 % and 3.9x10(12) m/kg, respectively, which were much better than the ones obtained with conventional chemical flocculants. Sludge dewatering was further improved when both the bioflocculant and conventional polyacrylamide (PAM) were used simultaneously. With potato starch wastewater, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity removal rates could reach 52.4 and 81.7 %, respectively, at pH value of 7.5 when the bioflocculant dose was adjusted to 30 mg/L; from a practical standpoint, the removal of COD and turbidity reached 48.3 and 72.5 %, respectively, without pH value adjustment.

DT CSST is a shift invariant modification of conventional Compactly Supported Shearlet Transform (CSST). Based on the mitigation of shift variance of CSST in DT CSST, a clearer fused image could be acquired through the General Image Fusion (GIF) method, and this image is called the initial fused image in this paper. The decision map is determined by the similarity of the initial fused image and the source images. The generation algorithm of the decision map in this paper takes advantage of the directional nature of DT CSST: every direction of the transform generates an initial directional decision map and then yields the final map through vote and smooth steps. This scheme is called DDM in this paper. The proposed method is evaluated by four groups of standard images. The results show that the proposed method is able to improve the quality indices compared with two algorithms which have excellent quality indices.

The calculated lattice parameters and elastic constants of WII-A(3)N(4) (A = C, Si, Ge and Sn) are in good agreement with the experimental data and previously calculated values. WII-A(3)N(4) (A = C, Si, Ge and Sn) compounds are also found to be thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The results suggest that hardness of WII-A(3)N(4) is the hardest of these C3N4 polymorphs. The hardness of WII-Sn3N4 is the smallest among WII-A(3)N(4) (A = C, Si, Ge and Sn).

Although cross correlation attacks(CCAs) were given for defeating message blinding methods, however searching for correlation points is difficult for noise, misalignment in practical environment. In this paper, we propose an optimized cross correlation power attack for message blinding exponentiation algorithms. The attack method can select the more correlative power points of share one operation in the modular multiplication by comparing variances between correlation coefficients. Further we demonstrate that the attack method is more efficient in experiments with hardware implementation of RSA on a crypto chip card. In addition to the proposed CCA method can recovery all 1024bits secret key and recognition rate increases to 100% even when the recorded signals are noisy.

In general, the mobile node trajectory is associate with its social relations and regular life in urban areas, and existing DTN routing protocols cannot incorporate in urban environments. This study aims to improve the key targets, such as delivery ratio, latency and network overhead ratio, in urban environments by describing a routing algorithm based on Geographic Grid (GeoGrid). GeoGrid is suitable for a sensory data collection system in which a part of the mobile nodes generate data, and mobile relay nodes transport the data to a fixed sink station. Simulation experiments were carried out to verify the performance of the proposed GeoGrid under an urban scenario, and the results suggest that the GeoGrid outperforms both Epidemic and Prophet routing algorithms in successful delivery ratio, average delivery latency, and network overhead ratio.

Values for direct radiative forcing (DRF) were then estimated using these measurements. For all four sites, the mean AOD appeared higher in the spring and summer, with the minimum occurring in the autumn. Conversely, the Alpha was lower in the spring but higher in the autumn and winter. The mean 440 nm SSA at the four sites varied from 0.81 to 0.87, indicating the highly spatial variability of aerosol optical properties. Frequent dust events resulted in a dominant contribution by coarse particles in spring, while fine particles were predominant during the summer. Mixtures of fine and coarse particles influenced aerosol optical properties in the autumn and winter. Results from this study provide useful information for the further understanding of retrieved aerosol optical properties and DRF in Northeast China.

The key mechanisms involved in activating the 2011/12 La Nia are illustrated by these datasets. Results show that neutral conditions were already evident in the equatorial eastern Pacific during the decaying phase of the 2010/11 La Nia. However, isothermal analyses show obviously cold water still persisting at the surface and at subsurface depths in off-equatorial regions throughout early 2011, being most pronounced in the tropical South Pacific. The negative SST anomalies in the tropical South Pacific acted to strengthen a southern wind across the equator. The subsurface cold water in the tropical South Pacific then spread northward and broke into the equatorial region at the thermocline depth. This incursion process of off-equatorial subsurface cold water successfully interrupted the eastern propagation of warm water along the equator, which had previously accumulated at subsurface depths in the warm pool during the 2010/11 La Nia event. Furthermore, the incursion process strengthened as a result of the off-equatorial effects, mostly in the tropical South Pacific. The negative SST anomalies then reappeared in the central basin in summer 2011, and acted to trigger local coupled air-sea interactions to produce atmospheric-oceanic anomalies that developed and evolved with the second cooling in the fall of 2011.

Calculations based on density functional theory were employed to investigate the effects of hydroxyl and epoxy groups on the adsorption of NO, and then the oxidation to NO2. It is found that the surface hydroxyl groups of carbon materials can enhance the adsorption of NO. The enhancement is derived from a weak covalent interaction between the nitrogen atom of the NO molecule and the carbon surface. NO can be oxidized by epoxy groups with rather low barrier, which helps to explain the low temperature catalytic oxidation. The hydroxyl group possesses no significant effects on the oxidation barrier. The low oxidation barrier is ascribed to the unique electronic structure NO, the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) of which is partially filled. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods In this study, a semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to evaluate the specific influences of air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NO2) on hospital emergency admissions with different lag structures from 2009 to 2011, the sex and age specific influences of air pollution and the modifying effect of seasons on air pollution to analyze the possible interaction. Results It was found that a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in concentration of PM10 at lag 03 day, SO2 and NO2 at lag 0 day were associated with an increase of 0.88%, 0.76%, and 1.82% respectively in overall emergency admissions. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in concentration of PM10, SO2 and NO2 at lag 5 day were associated with an increase of 1.39%, 1.56%, and 1.18% respectively in cardiovascular disease emergency admissions. For lag O-2, a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in concentration of PM10, SO2 and NO2 were associated with 1.72%, 1.34%, and 2.57% increases respectively in respiratory disease emergency admissions. Conclusion This study further confirmed that short-term exposure to ambient air pollution was associated with increased risk of hospital emergency admissions in Beijing.

Four six-qubit DF states are used in the process of secret transmission, however only the vertical bar 0'>. state is prepared. The other three six-qubit DF states can be obtained by permuting the outputs of the setup for vertical bar 0'> By using the vertical bar 0'> state as the decoy state, the detection rate and the qubit error rate reach 81.3%, and they will not change with the noise level. The stability and security are much higher than those of the ping-pong protocol both in an ideal scenario and a decoherence noise scenario. Even if the eavesdropper measures several qubits, exploiting the coherent relationship between these qubits, she can gain one bit of secret information with probability 0.042.

J	Xue, X; Chen, W; Nath, D; Zhou, DW				Xue, Xu; Chen, Wen; Nath, Debashis; Zhou, Dingwen			Whether the decadal shift of South Asia High intensity around the late 1970s exists or not	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							REANALYSIS; PACIFIC; SUMMER	This study compares the decadal means of the seasonal (June July August (JJA)) mean geopotential heights available from the NCEP1 and ERA-40 reanalysis data in the Northern Hemisphere. The interdecadal changes in the South Asia High (SAH) intensity derived from the reanalysis data are also compared with ground-based radiosonde observations and atmospheric model outputs. The JJA mean geopotential heights in the 1980s are distinctly larger than the 1970s in NCEP1 over most of the regions in the Northern Hemisphere, while no obvious difference is observed in ERA-40. The interannual variation of the SAH strength is very close in the two reanalysis data, so that it is appropriate to utilize the reanalysis data to study the interannual variation of SAH strength after removing the interdecadal trend. However, the discrepancy in SAH intensity between NCEP1 and ERA-40 mainly exists on the interdecadal time scale. The SAH intensity in the NCEP1 was close to that in the ERA-40 before the late 1970s but became remarkably stronger after the late 1970s, leading to a much larger decadal strengthening during the period 1970-1990. Based on the six radiosonde observation stations in the area of the SAH, the results indicate that the decadal reinforcing in the SAH strength occurs around the mid-1980s. Thus, NCEP1 may overestimate the decadal shift in the SAH intensity around the late 1970s, while ERA-40 may underestimate it. Much attention needs to be paid when we use the reanalysis data to study the decadal variability of the SAH intensity.

These regions are highly susceptible to coastal erosion with its dense population, developed economy and low-lying land. Due to immense natural and human pressures, there is an urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of coastal erosion risk in such areas. Various models have been established, but most of them focused on sandy coasts and physical factors that influence coastal erosion while socioeconomic factors were usually ignored. Accordingly, this study presents a GIS-based risk assessment of coastal erosion for muddy coasts by combining both the physical and socioeconomic aspects of erosion. The method is used to assess coastal erosion risk in the Yangtze Delta. Based on the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response) framework, 10 vulnerability indicators and 3 impact indicators corresponding to physical and socioeconomic aspects, respectively, are identified to constitute an indicator system. These indicators are weighted using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique, and then are combined into a Vulnerability Index and a Hazard Index, which then are merged into a Risk Index. Then, these indexes are normalized to 0%-100%. Finally, the normalized values are ranked into 5 levels: very low (<20%), low (20% <= Is<40%), moderate (40% <= Is<60%), high (60% <= Is<80%) or very high (>= 80%). This study is the first to comprehensively assess coastal erosion risk in the Yangtze Delta by integrating physical and socioeconomic factors at a detailed spatial scale. The results provide a clear picture of the current coastal erosion risk in the study area, despite of some limitations. The study also reveals key gaps in data gathering and coastal management practices that need to be addressed in order to develop more effective long-term coastal management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite derived VIs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have more potential because the MODIS balances the requirements of spatial detail, spectral and temporal density and tends to reflect vegetation responses through time. However, the relationship between MODIS data and salinity may be underestimated in previous studies because the MODIS time series data were not investigated thoroughly, especially regarding vegetation phenology. This study assessed the applicability of MODIS time series VI data for monitoring soil salinization with a series of MODIS pixels selected in the Yellow River Delta, China. The hidden information in vegetation phenology was investigated by improving the quality of VIs time series data with the Savitzky-Golay filter, extracting the phenological markers and differentiating VIs time series data based on vegetation types. The results showed that the quality of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series data were improved by the Savitzky-Golay filter, which could provide more accurate thresholds of phenological stages than the empirical definition. The seasonal integral of EVI (EVI-SI) extracted from the smoothed EVI time series profile was verified as the best indicator of the degree of soil salinity. Additionally, the correlation of EVI-SI and soil salinity was highly dependent on land cover heterogeneity, and the ranges of correlation coefficients were as high as 0.59-0.92. EVI-SI was linearly correlated with ECe in cropland with a high model fit (R-2 = 0.85). The relationship of EVI-SI and ECe fit best with a binomial line and EVI-SI was able to explain 70% of the variance of ECe. Despite the poor fit of the linear regression model in mixed sites limited by spatial resolution (R-2 = 0.32), MODIS time series VI data, as well as the extracted seasonal parameters, still show great potential to assess large-scale soil salinization.

By combining with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique, the humidity sensing properties of these nanocomposites sensors, including response sensitivity, humidity hysteresis, dynamic response and recovery, were studied through an impedance analysis method. The test results indicated that DND/GO nanocomposites showed high humidity response sensitivity, logarithmic linear response, fast response/recovery and small humidity hysteresis. Moreover, the influence of DND content in nanocomposite on the humidity response sensitivity and quality factor of the sensors has also been discussed. The results revealed that the increase of DND content in nanocomposite could enhance the humidity response sensitivity, but reduce the quality factor of the sensor. So, it is very necessary to select a suitable DND content in nanocomposite for balancing the sensitivity and quality factor. In addition, the reasons for the enhanced humidity sensing performance have also been discussed in detail. This work demonstrated that DND/GO nanocomposite is a promise candidate material for humidity sensing detection by combing with QCM technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of Cr substitution on the structural and magnetic properties have been investigated. Differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA-TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectro-scopy (FT-IR) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements were used to characterize chemical, structural and magnetic properties. The DTA-TG results indicate that there are three steps of combustion process. FT-IR spectra confirm the formation of spinel structure during the self-propagation combustion. XRD results indicate that the lattice parameter and the X-ray density decrease, and the average crystallite size increase with increasing Cr substitution. And Fe2O3 secondary impurity phase formed with excess Cr substitution. The saturation magnetization increases with the increase of Cr substitution when x <= 0.05, and decreased when x > 0.05. Meanwhile, the coercivity monotonically decreases with the increase of Cr substitution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MOPA system consists of a monolithic microchip seed laser and a double-end pumped traveling wave power amplifier. The short length of seed laser cavity guarantees the seed signal with a large frequency separation (above 53 GHz) but low output power (below 247.8 mW).

We find that the system has three different ferromagnetic phases, one line of the two ferromagnetic phases coexisting equally describes the paramagnetic state, and the other two lines of two ferromagnetic phases coexisting equally describe the ferrimagnetic states, while the three phases coexisting equally point describes the ferromagnetic state. Whether on phase transition lines or at the phase transition point, the system is always in an isolated mediate-coupling state, the physical quantities are discontinuous and the system has long-range correlation and has long-range classical correlation and long-range quantum correlation. We believe that our work is helpful for comprehensively and profoundly understanding the quantum phase transitions, and of some certain guidance and enlightening on the classification and measure of quantum correlation of quantum many-body systems.

The results show that the films with Mo and Cr underlayer provide an improved intrinsic coercivity. The film thickness presents a complex effect on the intrinsic coercivity of the films with Mo underlayer. When the film thickness is 3.0 mu m, the maximum value of the intrinsic coercivity is 281.6 kA3.m(-1) at room temperature. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of intrinsic coercivity is found to be strongly correlated with the magnetic parameters. In the range from 25 degrees C to 300 degrees C, the intrinsic coercivity of the films of above 200 kA.m(-1) is obtained.

Results showed that dry solids (DS) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of sludge treated by MBFGA1 alone appeared as 21.7 % and 3.6 x 10(12) m kg(-1), respectively, which were much better than FeCl3, Al-2(SO4)(3), and polyaluminum chloride (PAC), but poorer than P(AM-DMC) in sludge dewatering. Apart from this, the optimized conditioning process for improving the dewaterability of the sludge conditioned by the composite is MBFGA1 of 1.4 g L-1, P(AM-DMC) of 0.13 g L-1, CaCl2 of 56.1 mg L-1, pH value of 7.5, and agitation speed of 149 rpm. Under this optimal condition, DS and SRF appeared as 29.9 % and 2.2 x 10(12) m kg(-1), respectively. Thus, it is feasible and meaningful to enhance the dewaterability of the sludge by the compound uses of MBFGA1 and P(AM-DMC).

It is difficult to get satisfactory prediction effect by traditional models constructed on the assumption that the training and test data are subject to the same distribution, because the customers usually come from different districts and may be subject to different distributions in reality. This study proposes a feature-selection-based dynamic transfer ensemble (FSDTE) model that aims to introduce transfer learning theory for utilizing the customer data in both the target and related source domains. The model mainly conducts a two-layer feature selection. In the first layer, an initial feature subset is selected by GMDH-type neural network only in the target domain. In the second layer, several appropriate patterns from the source domain to target training set are selected, and some features with higher mutual information between them and the class variable are combined with the initial subset to construct a new feature subset. The selection in the second layer is repeated several times to generate a series of new feature subsets, and then, we train a base classifier in each one. Finally, a best base classifier is selected dynamically for each test pattern. The experimental results in two customer churn prediction datasets show that FSDTE can achieve better performance compared with the traditional churn prediction strategies, as well as three existing transfer learning strategies.

Among 23 CMIP5 models, the capability of models in representing the IOBM depends largely on the simulation of ENSO. Moreover, half of the models can reproduce the unstable ENSO-IOBM relationship. Considering the simulations of ENSO, ENSO-IOBM relationship and interdecadal change, 6 of 23 CMIP5 models are chosen for further investigation. The interdecadal change of ENSO-IOBM relationship is relative to the three ENSO-related processes. During the high correlation (HC) period, the tropospheric temperature (TT) mechanism, oceanic Rossby waves and antisymmetric wind pattern are strong, prolonging the persistence of IOBM. In comparison, during the low correlation (LC) period, the three processes are weak. The results show that the shallow thermocline in the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO), increased interannual variability and prolonged periodicity of ENSO are all responsible for the interdecadal change. Furthermore, the possible changes of ENSO-IOBM relationship in the future are investigated. The ENSO-related tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) warming is strengthened under global warming. Despite the deepened thermocline over SWIO and unchanged ENSO activity, the ENSO-related TIO warming is strengthened by the enhanced TT mechanism, which is caused by the increased saturated specific humidity. The results reveal that there is more downward net heat flux (NHF) over the TIO, which is conducive to the TIO warming, and the latent heat flux (LHF) change makes a great contribution to the NHF change. The weakened upward or strengthened downward LHF is possibly due to the decreased anomalous sea-air temperature difference by strengthened TT mechanism.

Only X-basis and Z(1)Z(2)X(3)-basis (composed of Z-basis and X-basis) measurement are required, which makes the scheme more convenient than others in practical applications. By distributing a random key between both sides of the communication and performing classical XOR operation, we realize a one-time-pad scheme, therefore our protocol achieves unconditional secure. Because only user with legitimate identity string can decrypt the secret, our protocol can resist man-in-the middle attack. The three-particle GHZ state in X-basis is used as decoy photons to detect eavesdropping. The detection rate reaches 75% per qubit.

J	Liu, Y; Deng, W; Song, XQ				Liu Ying; Deng Wei; Song Xue-qian			Relief degree of land surface and population distribution of mountainous areas in China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Land surface; Relief degree; Population density; Population pressure; Population distribution; Mountain; China	SUITABILITY	Evaluation on the population pressure in the mountainous areas is a necessary condition for the protection and good governance. The evaluation depends on accurate population density assessment. Traditional methods used to calculate population density often adopt the administrative region as a scale for statistical analysis. These methods did not consider the effects of the relief degree of land surface (RDLS) on the population distribution. Therefore they cannot accurately reflect the degree of population aggregation, especially in mountainous areas. To explore this issue further, we took the mountainous areas of China as the research area. China has A total area of 666 km(2) can be classified as mountainous area, accounting for 69.4% of the country's total landmass. The data used in this research included the digital elevation model (DEM) of China at a scale of 1:1,000,000, National population density raster data, the DEM and the national population density raster data. First, we determined the relief degree of land surface (RDLS). Next, we conducted a correlation analysis between the population distribution and the RDLS using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Based on the correlation analysis results and population distribution, this new method was used to revise the provincial population density of the mountainous areas. The revised results were used to determine the population pressure of different mountainous areas. Overall, the following results were obtained: (1) The RDLS was low in most mountainous areas (with a value between 0 and 3.5) and exhibited a spatial pattern that followed the physiognomy of China; (2) The relationship between the RDLS and population density were logarithmic, with an R-2 value up to 0.798 (p < 0.05), and the correlation decreased from east to west; (3) The difference between the revised population density (RPD) and the traditional population density (PD) was larger in the southeastern region of China than in the northwestern region; (4) In addition, compared with traditional results, the revised result indicated that the population pressure was larger. Based on these results, the following conclusions were made: (1) the revised method for estimating population density that incorporates the RDLS is reasonable and practical, (2) the potential population pressure in the southeastern mountainous areas is substantial, (3) the characteristics of the terrain in the high mountainous areas are important for the scattered distribution of the population, and (4) the population distribution of mountainous areas in China should be guided by local conditions, such as social, economic, and topographic conditions.

By analyzing the dynamic ionization process of soil, a HPM soil propagation model is constructed by combining the Maxwell equations. The model is numerically validated by using a finite difference time domain method. The numerical results show the physical processes of the HPM propagation and attenuation in soil and the nonlinear change process of soil resistivity. These numerical results are verified by a theoretical analysis.

The Decisional DNA is a domain-independent, standard and flexible knowledge representation structure that allows its domains to acquire, store, and share experiential knowledge and formal decision events in an explicit way. We apply this approach to our current work-SmartBike, a sensor-equipped bicycle built under the concept of Internet of Things. By using Decisional DNA and machine learning algorithms, the SmartBike is able to distinguish its user's patterns based on past riding data. The presented conceptual approach demonstrates how Decisional DNA can be applied to the Internet of Things and bring to them intelligence required by forthcoming semantic networks.

The larger stroke and smaller size of the bimorph DM made the system have larger aberration correction or superposition ability and be more compact. By simply modifying the control matrix or the reference matrix, select correction or superposition of aberrations was realized in real time similar to a conventional adaptive optics closed-loop correction. PL function was first integrated in addition to conventional adaptive optics visual simulation. PL training undertaken with high-order aberrations correction obviously improved the visual function of adult anisometropic amblyopia. The preliminary application of high-order aberrations correction with PL training on amblyopia treatment was being validated with a large scale population, which might have great potential in amblyopia treatment and visual performance maintenance.

Seasonal variation and source apportionment of organic tracers in PM10 in Chengdu, China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH			English	Article						PM10; Alkanes; PAHs; Dicarboxylic acid; Source	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; DICARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; URBAN ATMOSPHERE; N-ALKANES; HONG-KONG; AREA; AEROSOL; SITES; PAHS	Organic compound tracers including n-alkanes, triterpane, sterane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dicarboxylic acids of airborne particulate matter (PM10) were characterized for samples collected at five sites from July 2010 to March 2011 using GC/MS. Spatial and temporal variations of these organic tracers in PM10 were studied, and their sources were then identified respectively. Average daily concentrations of PM10 varied in different seasons with the trend of PM10 in winter (0.133 mg/m(3))[autumn (0.120 mg/m(3))[spring (0.103 mg/m(3))[summer (0.098 mg/m(3)). Daily concentrations of n-alkanes (C11-C36) ranged from 12.11 to 163.58 ng/m(3) with a mean of 61.99 ng/m(3). The C-max and CPI index of n-alkanes indicated that vehicle emissions were the major source in winter, while the contributions of high plant wax emissions became significant in other seasons. It was discovered that the main sources of triterpenoid and steranes were gasoline and diesel engine emissions. Concentrations of Sigma 15PAHs in PM10 also varied (12.25-58.56 ng/m(3)) in different seasons, and chrysene, benzo(a) pyrene, benzo(b) fluoranthene, benzo(k) fluoranthene, benzo(ghi) perylene and fluoranthene were the dominant components. In the four seasons, the concentration of Sigma 15PAHs was relatively higher at the northern site because of traffic congestion. The main source of airborne PAHs was traffic emissions and coal combustion. Average daily concentrations of dicarboxylic acids (C4-C10) in PM10 ranged from 12.11 to 163.58 ng/m(3), of which azeleic acid was the major compound (0.49-52.04 ng/m(3), average 14.93 ng/m(3)), followed by succinic acid (0.56-19.08 ng/m(3), average 6.84 ng/m(3)). The ratio of C6/C9 showed that the major source in winter was biological, while the contributions of emissions from anthropogenic activities were much higher in summer.	[Yin, H. L.; Qiu, C.

The crystal structure and grain morphology of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Electrochemical testing such as discharge charge cycling (CD) and cyclic voltatnmetry (CV) were employed in evaluating their electrochemical properties as cathode materials for lithium ion battery. Results reveal that the crystallinity and crystalline size of V2O5 particles increased when the thermal-decomposition temperature increased from 400 degrees C to 500 degrees C. and their adhesiveness was also synchronously increased. This indicate that the thermal-decomposition temperature palyed a significant influence on electrochemical properties of V2O5 cathodes. The V2O5 sample obtained at 400 degrees C delivered not only a high initial discharge capacity of 330 mA h g(-1) also the good cycle stability during 50 cycles due to its higher values of a in crystal structure and better dispersity in grain morphology.

Over the majority of northern Eurasia (east of 20A degrees E), the light precipitation days and amounts decrease, but those for the moderate, heavy, and very heavy precipitation increase. Moreover, the precipitation intensity increases, which is responsible for the decrease in light precipitation days and amount and increase in relatively more intense precipitation since there is no significant trend in total precipitation days. However, the precipitation characteristics are opposite over the Iberian Peninsula. We find that the changes in precipitation characteristics are possibly due to the changes in static stability. In the majority region (the Iberian Peninsula), the static stability weakens (strengthens) during 1951-2010. When static stability weakens (strengths), the upward motion increases (decreases) and thus the precipitation intensity increases (decreases). Accordingly, the light precipitation events decrease (increase) and heavy precipitation events increase (decrease).

Today's core networks are highly underutilized most of the time because of the over-provisioning and redundancy dimensioning, which results in severe energy inefficiency. In previous work, many non-deterministic polynomial-time hard mathematics formulation models have been proposed to minimize the energy consumption of core networks. However, effective heuristics are needed to solve these models in medium/large-size networks. This work studies the energy-minimized routing and virtual topology design problem of the power-hungry Internet protocol (IP) layer in core networks, aiming to achieve an energy-proportional IP layer by exploiting the variation of traffic with hours to reconfigure virtual topology and reroute traffic. We formulate energy-minimized routing and virtual topology design as an Integer linear programming problem and propose a LR algorithm, a heuristic based on the Lagrangian relaxation, to solve this problem in a polynomial-time. The simulation results indicate that the LR algorithm outperforms the best previous algorithm and can achieve a near energy-proportional IP layer with significant power saving. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of simulation results is conducted, which suggests a design principle of network equipment to facilitate the power saving. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, when the segment fails to separate each character from the others, those methods will not function properly. Sometimes the container code characters are printed or arranged very closely, which makes it a challenge to isolate each character. To address this issue, a new framework for automatic container code recognition (ACCR) in visual images is proposed in this paper. In this framework, code-character regions are first located by applying a horizontal high-pass filter and scan line analysis. Then, character blocks are extracted from the code-character regions and further classified into two categories, i.e. single-character block and multi-character block. Finally, a segmentation-based approach is implemented for recognition of the characters in single-character blocks, and a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method is proposed for the multi-character blocks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can successfully recognize the container code with closely arranged characters.

Research on atmospheric electricity has been actively conducted since the 1980s in China. Lightning physics and its effects, as important branches of atmospheric electricity, have received more attention because of their significance both in scientific research and lightning protection applications.

Production of the bioflocculant was positively associated with cell growth and a highest value of 2.4 g L-1 was obtained. During the kaolin suspension flocculation, charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging were proposed as the reasons for enhanced performance. Apart from this, the bioflocculant showed good performances in sludge dewatering and swine wastewater pretreatment. After conditioning by the bioflocculant, dry solids (DS) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of the sludge reached 18.4% and 4.8 x 10(12) m kg(-1), respectively, which were much better than that by conventional chemical flocculants. In the swine wastewater pretreatment, the removal efficiencies of COD, ammonium, and turbidity reached 48.3%, 43.6% and 75.8% at pH 8.0 when the bioflocculant dose was adjusted to 20 mg L-1.

The results indicate that MODIS NIR PWV products shows better agreement with radiosonde data than with IR PWV products, with the correlation coefficients up to 0.95. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of NIR PWV range from 2 to 8 mm with different stations, which shows significant regional differences over China. The mean RMSE is about 5.03 mm (similar to 35%) with a positive deviation of 2.56 mm (similar to 18%), indicating the occurrence of a slight overestimation. Moreover, MODIS IR PWV during night-time has a better agreement with radiosonde PWV than that during daytime. The mean RMSE of IR PWV during daytime was similar to 6.02 mm (similar to 42%), with a positive deviation of 1.54 mm (similar to 11%). The mean RMSE of IR PWV during night-time was similar to 5.81 mm (similar to 40%), with a negative deviation of approximately -0.04 mm (similar to 0.25%). Both the NIR and IR PWV products during daytime tend to be higher than radiosonde PWV.

It is important and valuable to find a way to save power for such networking systems. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Layer Optimization and Design (CLOD) approach to improve the energy efficiency of Internet Protocol (IP) over Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) backbone networks under QoS constraints. CLOD makes use of the skew spatial distribution (i.e. 80-20 law) of traffic demands to construct the virtual topology of IP layer with a consideration of the cross-layer resource constraints. Also, CLOD takes advantage of the constraint-based routing to satisfy the QoS constraints in terms of allowed maximum hop count and allowed maximum link utilization. Taking into account the connection between base network design and network operation, CLOD dimensions the base network by using pattern of network operation and optimizes network power consumption by reconfiguring network to adapt traffic variation and the available resources. Simulation results indicate that CLOD can save power significantly and achieve near energy-proportional networks. In addition, an analysis on trade-off performance between the hop count and power consumption is given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Low temperature N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD). H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X.PS) were employed to characterize the influence of the preparation method on physicochemical properties of the catalyst. Catalytic activity performance for methanol, CO, C3H8 and NO conversion was evaluated. Catalytic activity results show that the addition of BaO has a positive effect on the conversion of all pollutants, and the best results are achieved by the impregnation method. The light-off temperature decreases by 43, 31, 45 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The XRD, H-2-TPR and XPS results confirm that the impregnation method is mainly based on the surface modification. The enrichment of Ba2+ strengthens the Pd-Ce interaction in Pd-Ce interface, promoting the reductive ability, thus increasing the catalytic activity at low temperature. The co-precipitation method results in structure disorder and additional anion vacancies accompanied by the formation of more Ce3+, which may be beneficial to the conversion of CO.

Associated with this climate shift, the ENSO simulation and prediction skills of most models in the 2000s were significantly lower than those in the 1980-90s, which had common biases that were amplified through this climate transition. In this work, a model bias is examined with the heat flux (HF)-sea surface temperature (SST) coupling processes over the tropical Pacific, which experienced coupling strength modification around 2000 over both the regions west and east of 160 degrees W. A simple ENSO coupled model trained with the observations before 2000 is used to demonstrate that this model bias can be alleviated by updating the HF-SST coupling parameters. After updating these parameters, the performance of the ENSO model is significantly improved for reproducing observations over the tropical Pacific after the year 2000, suggesting the potential for a substantial improvement in ENSO simulation and prediction.

Recently successful algorithms exploit heavy-tailed gradient distribution as image prior to restore latent image with piecewise smooth regions. However, these prior assumed also remove the mid-frequency component such as textural details regions while they preserve sharp edges. That because gradient profile in fractal-like texture do not have sparse characteristic. To restore textural features of expected latent image, in this paper, we introduce fractional-order gradient as image prior which is more appropriate to describe characteristic of image textures. From details comparison of our experiments, the textual details are more clear and visual quality is improved.

Its typical scheme that includes two coils, an insulated resin cylinder and a metal hemisphere shell, is set up. Firstly, the near field is non-uniform spherical waves. Secondly, the electric field intensity vector E is parallel to xOy plane, while the magnetic field intensity vector H exists in arbitrary direction; the vector E only has a transverse component, which is perpendicular to its propagation direction, while the vector H has both transverse and radial ones. Thirdly, the amplitude of vector E is inversely proportional to the square of distance, while the amplitude of vector H inversely proportional to the cube of distance; both vectors E and H are directional. Fourthly, when latitude angle. is equal to 900, the amplitude of E is maximal, and it is zero as. is equal to 00; when latitude angle. is equal to 00, the amplitude of H is maximal, and it is minimal as. is equal to 900. For E-plane, the beam width 2.0 between zero power points is 1800, while the beam width 2. 0.5 between half power points is 900; for H-plane, the beam width 2.0 does not exist; the beam width 2. 0.5 is 2arcsin[(2/3) 0.5]. Fifthly, there are reflection waves on the surface of both the insulated resin cylinder and the metal hemisphere shell that produce a full reflection phenomenon; it is possible to produce full transmission phenomenon on the surface of the cylinder. An experimental example is presented for verifying these theoretical predictions.

Furthermore, the WRF model produced a High-Resolution Assimilation Dataset of the water-energy cycle in China (HRADC). This dataset has a horizontal resolution of 25 km for near surface meteorological data, such as air temperature, humidity, wind vectors and pressure (19 levels); soil temperature and moisture (four levels); surface temperature; downward/upward short/long radiation; 3-h latent heat flux; sensible heat flux; and ground heat flux. In this study, we 1) briefly introduce the cycling 3D-Var assimilation method and 2) compare results of meteorological elements, such as 2 m temperature and precipitation generated by the HRADC with the gridded observation data from CMA, and surface temperature and specific humidity with Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) output data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We find that the simulated results of monthly 2 m temperature from HRADC is improved compared with the control simulation and has effectively reproduced the observed patterns. The simulated special distribution of ground surface temperature and specific humidity from HRADC are much closer to GLDAS outputs. The spatial distribution of root mean square errors (RMSE) and bias of 2 m temperature between observations and HRADC is reduced compared with the bias between observations and the control run. The monthly spatial distribution of surface temperature and specific humidity from HRADC is consistent with the GLDAS outputs over China. This study could improve the land surface parameters by utilizing remote sensing data and could further improve atmospheric elements with a data assimilation system. This work provides an effective attempt at combining multi-source data with different spatial and temporal scales into numerical simulations, and the simulated results could be used in further research on the long-term climatic effects and characteristics of the water-energy cycle over China.

Characteristics and sources of submicron aerosols above the urban canopy (260 m) in Beijing, China, during the 2014 APEC summit	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CHEMICAL SPECIATION MONITOR; POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; MASS-SPECTROMETER; ORGANIC AEROSOLS; COLLECTION EFFICIENCIES; PARTICLE COMPOSITION; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; EVOLUTION PROCESSES; INORGANIC AEROSOLS	The megacity of Beijing has experienced frequent severe fine particle pollution during the last decade. Although the sources and formation mechanisms of aerosol particles have been extensively investigated on the basis of ground measurements, real-time characterization of aerosol particle composition and sources above the urban canopy in Beijing is rare. In this study, we conducted real-time measurements of non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) composition at 260 m at the Beijing 325 m meteorological tower (BMT) from 10 October to 12 November 2014, by using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) along with synchronous measurements of size-resolved NR-PM1 composition near ground level using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). The NR-PM1 composition above the urban canopy was dominated by organics (46 %), followed by nitrate (27 %) and sulfate (13 %). The high contribution of nitrate and high NO3-/SO42- mass ratios illustrates an important role of nitrate in particulate matter (PM) pollution during the study period. The organic aerosol (OA) was mainly composed of secondary OA (SOA), accounting for 61 % on an average. Different from that measured at the ground site, primary OA (POA) correlated moderately with SOA, likely suggesting a high contribution from regional transport above the urban canopy. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit with strict emission controls provides a unique opportunity to study the impacts of emission controls on aerosol chemistry. All aerosol species were shown to have significant decreases of 40-80 % during APEC from those measured before APEC, suggesting that emission controls over regional scales substantially reduced PM levels. However, the bulk aerosol composition was relatively similar before and during APEC as a result of synergetic controls of aerosol precursors. In addition to emission controls, the routine circulations of mountain-valley breezes were also found to play an important role in alleviating PM levels and achieving the "APEC blue" effect. The evolution of vertical differences between 260 m and the ground level was also investigated. Our results show complex vertical differences during the formation and evolution of severe haze episodes that are closely related to aerosol sources and boundary-layer dynamics.	[Chen, C.; Sun, Y.

J	Tang, TT				Tang, Tingting			Large Goos-Hanchen shift for different modes in metal-insulator-metal waveguide with electro-optic material	OPTIK			English	Article						Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift; Electro-optic (EO) material; Higher-order mode; Lower-order mode		We study the large Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift for different guided mode in the metal insulator metal waveguide by the adjusting of electro-optic (EO) material permittivity. Stationary-phase method is used to calculate the GH shifts for different guided mode propagating in the waveguide, and simulation results show that the increase of the upper-cladding metal layer reduces the GH shift and the critical incident angle. In addition, the GH shift of higher-order mode has less sensitivity to the change of thickness of upper-cladding metal layer but better sensitivity to the incident angle than lower-order mode. These different properties of GH shift for different modes can be used to design detectors with different functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The potential energy curves for the X-2 Sigma(+), A(2)Pi, and 2(2)Pi electronic states of BeCl and BeBr are plotted based on multi-reference configuration interaction plus Davidson corrections (MRCI + Q), and the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects are considered at the MRCI + Q level. The calculated spectroscopic parameters agree with the experimental data. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors are determined for the A(2)Pi(nu = 0) <- X-2 Sigma(+)(nu '' = 0) transition: f(00)(BeCl) = 0.947 and f(00)(BeBr) = 0.966. Moreover, the suitable radiative lifetimes tau of the A(2)Pi(nu' = 0) state are determined for rapid laser cooling: tau(BeCl) = 18.38 ns and tau(BeBr) = 27.09 ns. The proposed cooling wavelengths of both BeCl and BeBr are within the ultraviolet region at lambda(00)(BeCl) = 358.51 nm and lambda(00)(BeBr) = 379.38 nm. Laser cooling schemes for BeCl and BeBr molecules are also developed in consideration of the SOC effects. These results indicate that the inclusion of SOC effects does not affect the judgment of the feasibility of laser cooling of BeCl and BeBr molecules, even for the given BeBr molecules in which the SOC effect is significant.

Long-term real-time measurements of aerosol particle composition in Beijing, China: seasonal variations, meteorological effects, and source analysis	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CHEMICAL SPECIATION MONITOR; SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; MASS-SPECTROMETER; SUBMICRON AEROSOLS; HIGH-RESOLUTION; COAL COMBUSTION; COLLECTION EFFICIENCIES; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; EVOLUTION PROCESSES	High concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) are frequently observed during all seasons in Beijing, China, leading to severe air pollution and human health problems in this megacity. In this study, we conducted real-time measurements of non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) species (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride, and organics) in Beijing using an Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor for 1 year, from July 2011 to June 2012. This is the first long-term, highly time-resolved (similar to 15 min) measurement of fine particle composition in China. The seasonal average (+/-1 sigma)mass concentration of NR-PM1 ranged from 52 (+/-49) mu g m(-3) in the spring season to 62 (+/-49) mu g m(-3) in the summer season, with organics being the major fraction (40-51 %), followed by nitrate (17-25 %) and sulfate (12-17 %). Organics and chloride showed pronounced seasonal variations, with much higher concentrations in winter than in the other seasons, due to enhanced coal combustion emissions. Although the seasonal variations of secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA, i.e., sulfate + nitrate + ammonium) concentrations were not significant, higher contributions of SIA were observed in summer (57-61 %) than in winter (4346 %), indicating that secondary aerosol production is a more important process than primary emissions in summer. Organics presented pronounced diurnal cycles that were similar among all seasons, whereas the diurnal variations of nitrate were mainly due to the competition between photochemical production and gas-particle partitioning. Our data also indicate that high concentrations of NR-PM1 (>60 mu g m(-3))are usually associated with high ambient relative humidity (RH) (>50 %) and that severe particulate pollution is characterized by different aerosol composition in different seasons. All NR-PM1 species showed evident concentration gradients as a function of wind direction, generally with higher values associated with wind from the south, southeast or east. This was consistent with their higher potential as source areas, as determined by potential source contribution function analysis. A common high potential source area, located to the southwest of Beijing along the Taihang Mountains, was observed during all seasons except winter, when smaller source areas were found. These results demonstrate a high potential impact of regional transport from surrounding regions on the formation of severe haze pollution in Beijing.	[Sun, Y. L.; Wang, Z. F.; Du, W.; Wang, Q.

J	Chen, QL; Xu, LY; Cai, HK				Chen, Quanliang; Xu, Luyang; Cai, Hongke			Impact of Stratospheric Sudden Warming on East Asian Winter Monsoons	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY			English	Article							ARCTIC OSCILLATION; SURFACE CLIMATE; PART I; PROPAGATION; WEATHER; TROPOSPHERE; TRANSPORT	Fifty-two Stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events that occurred from 1957 to 2002 were analyzed based on the 40-year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis dataset. Those that could descent to the troposphere were composited to investigate their impacts on the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). It reveals that when the SSW occurs, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) are both in the negative phase and that the tropospheric circulation is quite wave-like. The Siberian high and the Aleutian low are both strengthened, leading to an increased gradient between the Asian continent and the North Pacific. Hence, a strong EAWM is observed with widespread cooling over inland and coastal East Asia. After the peak of the SSW, in contrast, the tropospheric circulation is quite zonally symmetric with negative phases of AO and NPO. The mid-tropospheric East Asian trough deepens and shifts eastward. This configuration facilitates warming over the East Asian inland and cooling over the coastal East Asia centered over Japan. The activities of planetary waves during the lifecycle of the SSW were analyzed. The anomalous propagation and the attendant altered amplitude of the planetary waves can well explain the observed circulation and the EAWM.

J	Li, ZW; Wu, JG; Wu, WJ				Li, Zhenwei; Wu, Jiagang; Wu, Wenjuan			Composition dependence of colossal permittivity in (Sm0.5Ta0.5)(x)Ti1-xO2 ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; CACU3TI4O12; RUTILE; CONSTANT; TIO2; TA	In this study, colossal permittivity (CP) (10(4)-10(5)) is attained in the (Sm0.5Ta0.5)(x)Ti1-xO2 ceramics, and their dielectric loss can be further decreased by doping oxides and optimizing the sintering temperatures. The effects of Sm and Ta as well as the oxides on their microstructure, dielectric properties, and stability were studied in detail. The secondary phases were induced by doping excessive Sm and Ta, and then both backscattering and EDS confirmed that excessive Sm and Ta result in the generation of secondary phases. The relationships between secondary phases and dielectric properties were established. The formation of secondary phases decreases their dielectric constant, whereas their dielectric loss can be slightly decreased through the optimization of Sm and Ta content. In addition, all the ceramics possess an improved frequency (10(2)-10(6) Hz) and temperature (-150-200 degrees C) stability of dielectric properties. Moreover, the addition of oxides containing trivalent (Bi3+) or pentavalent (Sb5+ and Nb5+) elements can further reduce their dielectric loss. Through the results of XPS, the formation of defect-dipole clusters, e.g., (Sm3+VOTi3+)-Ti-center dot center dot and Ta5+ Ti3+ A(Ti) (A = Ti3+/Sm3+/Ti4+), induced by Sm and Ta should be mainly responsible for enhanced dielectric properties.

It is shown that the noncanonical strength, off-axis distance, and aperture coefficient affect the position and number of phase singularities, and the motion, creation, and annihilation of phase singularities are found by adjusting these parameters. For a low aperture coefficient, the energy flux distributions exhibit different numbers and orientations of lobes by varying the noncanonical strength. With increasing aperture coefficient, the symmetries of lobes are broken, and the energy flux distributions gradually become ellipses and the directions of their major axes vary with different noncanonical strengths. Finally, the energy flux distributions of an Airy beam carrying a single noncanonical vortex are discussed and compared.

Symmetry based prostate cancer detection	BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article							CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI; ADENOCARCINOMA; CARCINOMA; LOCALIZATION; STATISTICS; ANTIGEN; IMAGES	Objective: To retrospectively assess the value of left and right half symmetry analysis in prostate T-2 weighted images (T2WI) for improving prostate cancer (PCa) screening. Methods: T2WI and other data of a total of 66 males were collected; the control group and cancer group had 33 patients each. Thresholding geometric active contours algorithm was used for prostate region segmentation, and the measure of local reflectional symmetry algorithm was applied to extract the longitudinal symmetry axes. After that, cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) of the left and right halves of each prostate were obtained. Results: Data analysis showed that the mean and variance of the value of the left and right half CCs of prostate T2WI in the cancer group and control group were 0.73 +/- 0.05 and 0.82 +/- 0.06, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87, and the specificity and the sensitivity were 91% and 70%, respectively. The p < 0.001 indicated that the value of CCs of the prostates between the two groups was significantly different. Conclusion: The symmetry in T2WI is a potential useful index for PCa screening and has a potential value for PCa detection and localizations of tumours for biopsy. Advances in knowledge: Texture bilateral symmetry of prostate T2WI is employed to screen the suspected prostate tumour.

Ground-based aerosol climatology of China: aerosol optical depths from the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) 2002-2013	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SKY RADIANCE MEASUREMENTS; YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; NORTH CHINA; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOL; ACE-ASIA; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SUN-PHOTOMETER; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SOLAR-RADIATION; DUST EMISSION	Long-term measurements of aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 440 nm and Angstrom exponents (AE) between 440 and 870 nm made for CARSNET were compiled into a climatology of aerosol optical properties for China. Quality-assured monthly mean AODs are presented for 50 sites representing remote, rural, and urban areas. AODs were 0.14, 0.34, 0.42, 0.54, and 0.74 at remote stations, rural/desert regions, the Loess Plateau, central and eastern China, and urban sites, respectively, and the corresponding AE values were 0.97, 0.55, 0.82, 1.19, and 1.05. AODs increased from north to south, with low values (<0.20) over the Tibetan Plateau and northwestern China and high AODs (>0.60) in central and eastern China where industrial emissions and anthropogenic activities were likely sources. AODs were 0.20-0.40 in semi-arid and arid regions and some background areas in northern and northeastern China. AEs were >1.20 over the southern reaches of the Yangtze River and at clean sites in northeastern China. In the northwestern deserts and industrial parts of northeast China, AEs were lower (<0.80) compared with central and eastern regions. Dust events in spring, hygroscopic particle growth during summer, and biomass burning contribute the high AODs, especially in northern and eastern China. The AODs show decreasing trends from 2006 to 2009 but increased similar to 0.03 per year from 2009 to 2013.

A left R-module M (resp., right R-module N) is called weak injective (resp., weak flat) if Ext(R)(1) (F,M) = 0 (resp., Tor(1)(R) (N,F) = 0) for every super finitely presented left R-module F. By replacing finitely presented modules by super finitely presented modules, we may generalize many results of a homological nature from coherent rings to arbitrary rings. Some examples are given to show that weak injective (resp., weak flat) modules need not be FP-injective (resp., not flat) in general. In addition, we introduce and study the super finitely presented dimension (denote by l.sp.gldim(R)) of R that are defined in terms of only super finitely presented left R-modules. Some known results are extended.

Based on a developed El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ensemble prediction system, this paper investigates the key predictors for the 2011/12 La Nina, to determine which conditions favor a double-dip La Nina event up to one year in advance. The key predictors were isolated in a 100-member ensemble hindcast experiment. Results show that continuous easterly surface winds and persistent subsurface cold conditions preceded the second-year cooling in mid-2011. And a significant difference can be viewed between the best and the worst ensemble forecasts arose from the stochastic model-error perturbations. The detailed comparisons between the best and the worst ensemble forecasts further illustrate that the stochastic model-error perturbations play a significant role in improving the prediction skills of the best ensemble members during the 2011/12 12-month forecast process, through capturing the transition of sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical Pacific (i.e., from a warm condition to a cold condition) in boreal spring.

The existing routing algorithms of DTNs do not meet the current city environments due to the large differences in node densities, social characteristics, and limited energy. The key indicators of DTNs such as success delivery ratio, average delivery latency, network lifetime, and network overhead ratio can influence the performances of civil DTNs applications. Aiming to improve the key indicators of DTNs in city environments, this paper presents a fixed sink station based structure and a more proper routing algorithm named Game Theory Based Decision Making (GTDM). GTDM shows decision-making process for neighborhood selection and packet delivering strategy which is based on the noncooperative game theory method and city environment characteristics. GTDM performance is evaluated using numerical simulations under Working Day Movement (WDM) model and the results suggested that GTDM outperforms other traditional DTNs routing approaches, such as Epidemic and Prophet algorithms.

Microwave heating serves as an excellent tool for carrying out such reactions and the multiphysics simulations need effective permittivity as one of the most important inputs. In this work, we perform the esterification reaction between ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid using a temperature cycle in order to measure the effective permittivity of the reaction mixture. The obtained result is fitted using a bivariate function of the concentration of one of the products of the reaction and temperature of the mixture. The computed results show good agreement with measured values with maximum errors for the synthesis reactions of ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate being 4.94% and 3.68%, respectively.

Light tunneling channels with 100% transmittance was found, and characteristics of these channels will be changed by structure parameters, such as lattice constant, incident angle. Specifically speaking, the results show that as t (periodic number of the well layer) increases the light tunneling channel number increases by the laws of t-1, however ass (periodic number of the barrier layer) increases the light tunneling channel number is unchanged. As the incidence angle becomes larger, the channel width become narrower, however the light tunneling channel number is unchanged. While the smaller the lattice constant is, the narrower the channel width is. These characteristics above can provide guidance for designing new high quality quantum optical devices, for example, multi-channel optical filter with adjustable channel. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Beside daytime nucleation, nocturnal new particle formation was also found in different regions around the world. Compared with daytime nucleation events, the understanding of nocturnal ones is still sparse. The variety of aerosol particle physico-chemical properties, including particle number size distribution, volatility and hygroscopicity were measured in the North China Plain during July-August 2013. During the observation period, rapid increase in ultrafine particle number concentration was attributed to new particle formation. The nocturnal new particle formation rate was 45 cm(-3)s(-1), which is 1.25 times higher than an observed daytime value. Condensation sink was found to be 0.055 s(-1).

The new algorithm was applied in the parameter optimization of on-ramp traffic PI controller combining with nonlinear feedback theory. With the critical information contained in the searching space and results of the basic QPSO algorithm, this algorithm avoids the rapid disappearance of swarm diversity and enhances the global searching ability through collaboration between subswarms. Experiment results on an on-ramp traffic control simulation show that DWC-QPSO can be well applied in the study of on-ramp traffic PI controller and the comparison results illustrate that DWC-QPSO outperforms other evolutionary algorithms with enhancement in both adaptability and stability.

At the same time, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) was experiencing pronounced surface heating. The characteristics of this extreme weather and its linkage to the TP surface heating anomaly were analyzed in this paper. The results show that (1) anomalous heating of the TP helps to form and sustain the Siberian blocking high, which is important for persistent southward flow of dry and cold Siberian air; (2) TP heating helps the moisture flux move more north and strengthens the southerly wind above 850 hPa; (3) there are two Rossby wave trains at 500 hPa and the layers above it (at about 20 degrees N-40 degrees N). Correlation analysis reveals that TP heating anomalies are closely associated with these Rossby wave trains; (4) the Rossby wave propagates downstream from the TP to South China in the mid and high layers of the atmosphere when the TP changes swiftly from a heat sink to a heat source. This implies that anomalous heating of the TP may stimulate the Rossby wave train to propagate downward in midlatitudes.

Determining starting time and duration of extreme precipitation events based on intensity	CLIMATE RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate extremes; Identifying extremes; Monitoring and detections; EID constraints; Mathematical modeling	CLIMATE EVENTS; UNITED-STATES; TRENDS; FREQUENCY; INDEXES; CHINA; RAINFALL	For daily precipitation, previous studies have mainly identified extremes over fixed durations. The goal of our study was to identify over which multiday period a rainfall event can best be described as an extreme. Specifically, we extrapolated the starting time and duration within a rainfall episode to best describe an event with that starting time and duration as an extreme, compared to events with other starting times and durations. The principle is that the precipitation intensity averaged over this period is comparably (relative to duration) the strongest among all the events that have different starting times and durations. For this purpose, the 'extreme' intensity-duration (EID) relation is established through mathematical modeling based upon our understanding of the issue of identifying the extremes. The constraints in the model between 'extreme' intensity and duration require that the single parameter contained in the EID relation be between, but not too close to, 0 and 1. Tests show that extremes can be well identified with the EID approach by simply assigning a moderate value to the parameter, and the identification of extremes is not sensitive to which value is chosen for this parameter. The estimation with multiyear data and a regression indicates that the parameter is truly moderate between 0 and 1, but the value relies on the threshold used for determining the initial extreme intensities. It is therefore suggested that a fixed moderate value be given to the parameter in the operational identification of the extremes. As a real application of the method, we determined the starting time and duration of the extreme in a recent heavy rainfall that occurred over Beijing.

Dysmenorrhea is a common problem for which acupuncture provides effective analgesia. Although acupoint selection affects the effectiveness of acupuncture, the basic rules of acupoint selection are little understood. This study aims to investigate the principles of acupoint selection and characteristics of acupoints used for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Database were searched for clinical trials published in English or Chinese from January 1978 to April 2014 evaluating the effect of acupuncture on primary dysmenorrhea, with or without methods of randomization and/or control. Three authors extracted information and two reviewers inputted information on titles, journals, interventions, main acupoints, and outcomes using the self-established Data Excavation Platform of Acupoint Specificity for data mining. Results. Sanyinjiao (SP06), Guanyuan (CV04), and Qihai (CV06) were used most frequently. The most frequently used meridians were Conception Vessel, Spleen Meridian of Foot Taiyin, and Bladder Meridian of Foot Taiyang. 67.24% of acupoints used were specific acupoints. Acupoints on lower limbs were most frequently used. Conclusion. Data mining is a feasible approach to identify the characteristics of acupoint selection. Our study indicated that modern acupuncture treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is based on selection of specific acupoints according to traditional acupuncture theory.

Density functional theory corrected with dispersion was used to investigate the potential of graphene oxides (GOs) for the catalytic oxidation of SO2 and NOx. It is found that both the SO2 and NOx can be oxidized by epoxy groups of GO nearly at room temperature. The hydroxyl groups on the GO surface enhance the adsorption and oxidation of SO2, and of NO as well, but in quite different ways. For the case of SO2, the promotion is derived from the formation of charge transfer channels, which are fabricated by the hydroxyl group, the adsorbed SO2 and the epoxy group. The promotion is enhanced by the introduction of more hydroxyl groups as more charge transfer channels are formed. However, for NO, the hydroxyl group leads to a strong N-C covalent interaction between the adsorbed NO molecules and the GO surface, through which the NO is activated and oxidized with a much lower barrier. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of the low temperature catalytic oxidation of SO2 and NO by carbon materials and insights into designing new carbon-based catalysts.

Then we characterize the well-known QF rings and IF rings in terms of n-copure projective modules. Finally, we prove that a ring R is relative left hereditary if and only if every submodule of a projective (or free) left R-module is n-copure projective if and only if id (R) (N) a parts per thousand currency sign 1 for every left R-module N with N a F (n) .

The symmetry properties of phonon modes are analyzed. The mode-Gruneisen parameters and phonon velocities are calculated using phonon spectra. All the investigated structures show very large phase velocities (>10 000 m s(-1)) and small group velocities (<600 m s(-1)). The macroscopic Gruneisen parameter of the [001] direction is larger than that of the [010] direction for 2H-MT2 phases. The volumetric and linear thermal expansion coefficients are evaluated using the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) between 0 K and 1100 K. The negative thermal expansion coefficients are discovered in the 2H-WS2 structure. Our results show that the properties in the [001] direction are very different to the [010] direction, because of the significant difference in the chemical bonding in the two crystallographic directions for these layered materials.

We demonstrate that by combining the low optical loss of Ag (epsilon=-62.485+4.331i) and the strong magneto-optical effect of CeYIG (Phi(F)=2 x 10(4) deg/cm) at similar to 1000 nm wavelength, a high figure of merit (FoM) for index sensing can be achieved. The device shows a factor of 20 improvement in the index resolution in comparison with ferromagnetic metal based MOSPR sensors at the same wavelength. By carrying out both analytical and numerical simulations, an optimized Ag/CeYIG MOSPR structure with the highest index sensitivity is achieved at the incident light wavelength of 1160 nm and the CeYIG thickness of 25 nm. The enhanced resolution of the DMOSPR sensor has been attributed to both the field enhancement at the sensing interface due to the high index of CeYIG films and, the high magneto-optical figure of merit of the CeYIG near infrared wavelength range.

The selections of input seismic attributes and their time window have an obvious effect on the validity of classification and require iterative experimentation and prior knowledge. In general, it is sensitive to noise when waveform serves as the input data to cluster analysis, especially with a narrow window. To conquer this limitation, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is introduced into waveform classification based on SOM. We first de-noise the seismic data using EMD and then cluster the data using ID grid SOM. The main advantages of this method are resolution enhancement and noise reduction. 3D seismic data from the western Sichuan basin, China, are collected for validation. The application results show that seismic fades analysis can be improved and better help the interpretation. The powerful tolerance for noise makes the proposed method to be a better seismic fades analysis tool than classical ID grid SUM method, especially for waveform cluster with a narrow window.

The temporal distribution of, and correlation between, PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 particles are analyzed. Additionally, the relationships between particulate matter (PM) and certain meteorological parameters are studied. The results show that variations in the average mass concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 generally have the same V-shaped distributions (except for April), with peak/trough values for PM average mass concentrations appearing in January/September, respectively. From 2009 to 2011, the inter-annual average mass concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 fall year on year. The correlation coefficients of daily concentrations of PM10 with PM2.5, PM10 with PM1.0, and PM2.5 with PM1.0 were high, reaching 0.91, 0.83 and 0.98, respectively. In addition, the average ratios of PM2.5/PM10, PM1.0/PM10 and PM1.0/PM2.5 were 85%, 78% and 92%, respectively. From this, fine PM is determined to be the principal pollutant in the Chengdu region. Except for averaged air pressure values, negative correlations exist between other meteorological parameters and PM. Temperature and air pressure influenced the transport and accumulation of PM by affecting convection. Winds promoted PM dispersion. Precipitation not only accelerated the deposition of wet PM, but also inhibited surface dust transport. There was an obvious correlation between PM and visibility; the most important cause of visibility degradation was due to the light extinction of aerosol particles.

Results have demonstrated that the removal efficiency of Cu(II) reached 96.9 % by adding MBFR10543 in two stages, separately, 1.5 x 10(-2) % (w/w) in the 1.0-min rapid mixing (180 rpm) and 2.0 x 10(-2) % (w/w) after 2.0-min slow mixing (80 rpm), with pH value fixed at 6.0. Cu(II) sorption process could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherms model. The negative Gibbs free energy change indicated the spontaneous nature of the sorption. Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis indicated that functional groups, such as -OH, -COOH, Ca center dot O, and -NH2, were existed in MBFR10543 molecular chains, which had strong capacity for removing Cu(II). Furthermore, both charge neutralization and bridging being the main mechanisms involved in Cu(II) removal by MBFR10543.

The Bi2O3 additive and sintering temperature separately exhibit a strong effect on the sintering density, crystal structure, and magnetic properties of the ferrites. As to the ferrites with 3 wt% Bi2O3, the relatively high sintering density rho(s), saturation magnetization M-s, and intrinsic coercivity H-ci can be obtained at a low sintering temperature of 900 degrees C even much lower. Furthermore, the effective magnetic anisotropy constant K-eff and magnetic anisotropy field H-a of the ferrites are calculated from the magnetization curve by the law of approach to saturation. It is suggested that the low-temperature sintered SrFe12O19 ferrites with M-s of 285.6 kA/m and H-a of 1564.6 kA/m possess a significant potentiality for applying in the self-biased low-temperature co-fired ceramics circulators from 34 to 40 GHz.

CZA samples were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, H-2-TPR, oxygen pulse adsorption, and XPS. The results show that the interactions between Pd and CZA with hydrothermal treatment lead to charge transfer from Pd species to Ce, which results in the presence of defect CeOx and more lattice oxygen in the catalyst.

Density functional theory was used to investigate the adsorption and oxidation of SO2 on elaborated graphene oxides (GOs) to discover the insights. It is found that the hydroxyl groups on GO surface possess bifunctional effects: both enhancing the adsorption of SO2 through H-bonding interaction and reducing the reaction barrier for its oxidation to SO3. The promotion of oxidation is related to a pre-activation of the surface epoxy group. Based on Bader population, charge difference and electron localization function analysis, a charge transfer channel is proposed to explain the pre-activation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The timescale of these pulses is about 3-8 mu s, and the typical interpulse interval is about 30 mu s. The source discharges of these pulses, which are not readily detectable in the frequency range (140-300MHz) of a short-baseline very high frequency (VHF) lightning imaging system, are attributed to the stepping processes when the positive leader propagated into the cloud region. The reversals in the polarity of magnetic pulses are related to the variation in the vertical direction of positive leader propagation as resolved by the VHF imaging system.

In the frontend of the system, the measurement matrix was used to sense the border information in a compressed manner, and then the proposed reconstruction method was applied to recover the border information at the monitoring terminal. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the helicopter sound signal was used as an example in the experimental simulation, and three other typical reconstruction algorithms 1) split Bregman algorithm, 2) iterative shrinkage algorithm, and 3) smoothed approximate l(0) norm (SL0), were employed for comparison. The experimental results showed that the proposed method has a better performance in recovering the helicopter sound signal in most cases, which could be used as a basis for further study of the border monitoring WSN system.

In this letter, we make an attempt to find effective multiple spreaders in complex networks by generalizing the idea of the coloring problem in graph theory to complex networks. In our method, each node in a network is colored by one kind of color and nodes with the same color are sorted into an independent set. Then, for a given centrality descriptor, the nodes with the highest centrality in an independent set are chosen as multiple spreaders. Comparing this approach with the traditional method, in which nodes with the highest centrality from the entire network perspective are chosen, we find that our method is more effective in accelerating the spreading process and maximizing the spreading coverage than the traditional method, no matter in network models or in real social networks. Moreover, the low computational complexity of the coloring algorithm guarantees the potential applications of our method.

However, the method depends on the input matrix mineral bulk modulus and the rationality of the two-phase medium model. We used the matrix mineral bulk modulus inversion method and multiple constraints to obtain a two-phase medium model with physical meaning. The proposed method guarantees the reliability of the obtained AVO characteristicsin two-phase media. By the comparative analysis of different lithology of the core sample, the advantages and accuracy of the inversion method can be illustrated. Also, the inversion method can be applied in LH area, and the AVO characteristics can be obtained when the porosity, fluid saturation, and other important lithology parameters are changed. In particular, the reflection coefficient amplitude difference between the fast P wave and S wave as a function of porosity at the same incidence angle, and the difference in the incidence angle threshold can be used to decipher porosity.

The study discovered that the CNOP method reveals the process of one-way interaction between Fengshen and Fung-wong. Moreover, if the region of Fung-wong was selected for verification, the sensitivity area was mainly located in the region of Fengshen and presented a half-ring structure; if the region of Fengshen was selected for verification, most of the sensitivity areas were located in the region between the Fengshen and the subtropical high, far away from Fung-wong. This indicated that Fung-wong is mainly steered by Fengshen, but Fengshen is mainly affected by the subtropical high. The sensitivity experiment showed that the initial errors in the CNOP-identified sensitive areas have larger impacts on the verification-area prediction than those near the typhoon center and their developments take a large proportion in the whole domain. This suggests that the CNOP-identified sensitive areas do have large influence on the verification-area prediction.

At the critical point, the physical quantities including the entanglement are not discontinuous and the matrix product system has long-range correlation and N-qubit maximal entanglement. We believe that our work is helpful for having a comprehensive understanding of quantum phase transitions in matrix product states of one-dimensional spin chains and of potential directive significance to the preparation and control of one-dimensional spin lattice models with stable coherence and N-qubit maximal entanglement.

A feasibility study for the construction of an atmospheric precipitable water vapor model based on the neural network technology	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Radio-sounding data; Artificial neural network; NCEP/NCAR; Precipitable water vapor	GPS METEOROLOGY; REANALYSIS	As the dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, water vapor not only affects global climate and weather but also plays a very important role in global heat and water cycles. Studies of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere are necessary to further understand the processes of disastrous weather, climate change, and the distribution of water vapor resources. However, the process of calculating PWV using radio-sounding data (RPWV) is problematic. Firstly, radio-sounding datasets often contain missing or erroneous data. Moreover, the calculations about RPWV are relatively complicated, which restricts further studies on changes of water vapor in the atmosphere. To overcome limitations associated with data derived from radio-sounding data, this paper evaluates the use of a neural network model for PWV by using reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. A high precision neural network model was established through the selection of a model structure, and the model was further optimized based on varying lengths of input quantity. The numbers of neurons in the hidden layer were determined, and the model results for different input quantities were compared. We found that the PWV data obtained from this new approach can meet research requirements in meteorology. Overall, the neural network technology provided a simple and feasible solution for obtaining PWV data that may be valuable for supplementing missing RPWV datasets, prolonging the cumulative quantity of PWV datasets, and correcting erroneous radio-sounding data.

By magnetizing the CeYIG thin film along different directions, a variation of the GH shift can be observed, which is named as the MOGH (magneto-optical Goos-Hanchen) effect. The applied magnetic field direction is found to cause MOGH effect for light with different polarizations. As example systems, enhanced GH shift and MOGH effect is observed in both prism/Air/CeYIG/SiO2 and prism/Au/CeYIG/SiO2 structures, by applying opposite magnetic field across the CeYIG layer in a transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) configuration. The GH and MOGH effect as a function of layer thicknesses, material refractive indices and magneto-optical properties are systematically simulated and discussed. It is observed that the coupling layer and MO layer thickness plays an important role of controlling the MOGH effect in the prism/Au/CeYIG/SiO2 plasmonic waveguide structure. The MOGH effect shows high sensitivity to applied magnetic field and index variations, making it promising for applications such as optical switches, modulators, and chemical or biomedical index sensors.

It was found that the thickness of PbI2 films decreased from 1 000 mu m to 220 mu m with the increase in the sublimation source temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the thick films are polycrystalline hexagonal structure with preferred growth orientation of (002) plane, and their grain size, dislocation density and growth stress are closely related to the source temperature. Images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveal the accumulation of hexagonal plate-like particles which constitute the samples, and the particles with a diameter of 248 mu m and a thickness of 32. 7 mu m, exhibit clearly layered structure. By spectrum fitting using Gauss function, the Raman spectra show a shift of about 147, 169, 217 and 210 cm(-1) respectively, the first three peaks correspond to the longitudinal optical vibrations (LO) mode in 4H-PbI2 crystal, while the last peak originate from a vibration pattern associated with SnO2 in substrate. Raman peak of 147 cm(-1) changes significantly with the increases in source temperature, and a dramatic decrease in peak intensity with broadening peak width occurred when the source temperature increased up to 225 degrees C or more. Under 340 nm excitation at room temperature, several weak photoluminescence peaks of PbI2 samples which associated with defects and exciton recombination near 2. 25, 2. 57 and 2. 64 eV were observed. Given a comprehensive consideration of structural and spectral characterization results, PbI2 thick films with a thickness of about 659 mu m deposited at a source temperature of 200 degrees C achieves the best crystalline quality.

The static and dynamic humidity sensing performances are successively studied using impedance analysis and oscillating circuit methods. The experiment results show that PDDA/GO composite thin films coated QCM humidity sensor exhibits large humidity sensing response, low humidity hysteresis, fast response and recovery, and excellent repeatability. In addition, the influence of the number of assembled layers of PDDA/GO on the performances of QCM humidity sensor has also been investigated. Meanwhile, the origin of the obtained excellent humidity sensing performances has been analyzed by considering the water adsorption/desorption mechanism of PDDA/GO composite multilayer thin films. This paper suggests that LbL self-assembly technique is a promising candidate method for fabricating high-performance QCM humidity sensor using PDDA/GO composite multilayer thin films as sensing material.

The Y-parameters are calculated by characteristic polynomials corresponding to the measured S-parameters. The unloaded quality factor of resonators and the CM can be extracted from the Y-parameters. The method allows one to diagnose a filter with source-load coupling without necessity of dealing with the degenerate poles problem of the Y-parameters and the measurement noise. The proposed diagnosis method can be used in a filter tuning and speeds up its physical realization. The method is verified by a fabricated fourth-order bandpass filter and a simulated substrate integrated waveguide dual-mode filter with source-load couplings. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, a new face image hallucination method under illumination variation is proposed. In order to hallucinate a high-resolution face image with frontal illumination from a low-resolution face image with non-frontal illumination, in the proposed method, the nonsubsampled contourlet transform is first used to estimate the reflectance component and features affected by illumination variation from an input low-resolution face image with non-frontal illumination, then a super-resolution approach via adaptively local sparse representation and global reconstruction constraint is presented to enhance the resolution of the reflectance component for the input low-resolution face image, and the low-resolution features affected by the illumination variation are normalized and enhanced by the Kernel Principal Component Analysis and bicubic interpolation techniques. Finally, the high-resolution face image with frontal illumination is hallucinated by combining the reconstructed high-resolution reflectance component and the enhanced illumination features. Experimental results on Extended Yale B face database show that under illumination variations, the proposed method can deal with uneven illuminations in face image and reconstruct the high-resolution face image with frontal illumination effectively compared with some other super-resolution methods.

The effect of Mg substitution on the structural and magnetic properties have been investigated. X-ray diffraction and vibrating scanning magnetometer were used to characterize the structural and magnetic properties. XRD revealed single-phase of cubic spinel. Both average crystallite size and lattice parameter increase with increasing Mg substitution. The saturation magnetization initially increases with the increase of Mg substitution when x <= 0.05, and decreases when x > 0.05, which indicates excessive nonmagnetic cations in tetrahedral site will decrease the superexchange interaction between tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The decrease in the coercivity values with increasing Mg substitution indicates the decrease of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

X-ray diffraction measurement and atomic force microscope analysis show that the structural change of the films occurs depending on growth condition. The width of the Urbach tail of the films indicates that the disordered structure inside the grains changes relying on preparation condition, It is found that the structure of the films is sensitive to growth parameter. A microstructure evolution model with respect to grain orientation is developed to explain the morphological and structural variation process during the films growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The structure and magnetic properties of NiZnCo ferrite thin Films with different annealing temperatures (600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C) have been investigated. The secondary impurity phases of Fe2O3 and ZnO slowly disappeared with annealing temperature up to 800 degrees C. But, there are some FeSiO3, Zn2SiO4 and SiO2 impurity phases formation when the annealing temperature is 900 degrees C. The average grain size and surface roughness increased with annealing temperature up to 800 degrees C and then they decreased at 900 degrees C. The saturation magnetization gradually increases with annealing temperature up to 800 degrees C and then it decreases at 900 degrees C.

We assume that each pair of transmit and receive antennas has a different frequency offset.

Characteristics of Taklimakan dust emission and distribution: A satellite and reanalysis field perspective	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						Taklimakan Desert; dust aerosol; CALIPSO; MISR; synoptics	TIBETAN PLATEAU; MINERAL DUST; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; CLIMATE SYSTEM; DESERT DUST; AEROSOL; CHINA; MODEL; STORMS; TRANSPORT	Dust particles from the Taklimakan Desert can be lofted vertically up to 10km due to the unique topography and northeasterly winds associated with certain synoptic conditions. Then they can be transported horizontally to regions far downwind by westerlies. We combined data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization to investigate the three-dimensional distribution of dust over the Taklimakan Desert and surrounding areas. During spring and summer, a dust belt with high aerosol optical depths (AOD) extends eastward from the Taklimakan Desert to the Loess Plateau along the Hexi Corridor and southward to the Tibetan Plateau. However, the dust extinction coefficients decrease rapidly from 0.340km(-1) near surface to 0.015km(-1) at 5km in spring, while the extinction values vary within 0.1000.020 between the altitudes of 1.6 and 3.5km and decrease to 0.023km(-1) at 5km in summer, indicating that dust aerosol is relatively well mixed vertically. We further used MISR daily AOD to identify high- and low-dust days and then analyzed composite difference patterns of temperature, geopotential height, and wind between high- and low-dust days. It was found that although the synoptic situations of spring and summer are quite different, there are two common features: a strong anticyclonic wind anomaly over the Taklimakan at 500hPa and an enhanced easterly wind over the Tarim Basin at 850hPa for the two seasons. These conditions are favorable for dust entrainment from the dry desert surface, vertical lofting, and horizontal transport.	[Ge, J. M.; Huang, J. P.; Xu, C. P.; Qi, Y. L.; Liu, H.

Meteorological parameters, including temperature, humidity, dew point, air pressure, ultraviolet light, wind direction, and wind speed were also measured. By combining the meteorological parameters with the atmospheric pollutant data, we performed Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and ozone production efficiency (OPE) analysis to objectively understand the interrelations among the pollutants, as well as between the pollutants and the meteorological factors. During the observation period, there were various meteorological changes such as rainfall, cold air transit, and sunshine that created conditions for the formation or dispersal of pollutants. The study period coincided with the 16th Asian Games, during which time the government adopted strict measures to reduce the discharge of pollutants around the Pearl River Delta area. However, we still observed serious pollution of PM2.5 and O-3, of which the highest value of PM2.5 was 210 mu g m(-3) and the highest value of O-3 reached 117 ppb. At the same time, the high concentrations of CO, NO, NO2, NOz, and SO2 could not be cleared away with rainfall in such a short period of time. On the basis of PMF analysis, we found that three factors influence the air quality of this region: local biomass burning, secondary pollutants of regional transport, and high industrial pollutant emissions. According to OPE analysis, the O-3 pollution was mostly found to be VOC-sensitive but occasionally NOx-sensitive for OPE values greater than 10.

The calculated elastic constants by using a pseudopotential plane-wave method agree well with the experimental data and with the previous theoretical works. Based on the elastic constants and their related parameters, the crystal mechanical stability is discussed. Calculations of the zone-center optical-mode frequencies including longitudinal-optical/transverse-optical splitting, by using the density functional perturbation theory, are reported. All optical modes are identified, especially B-1 modes, and agree with Raman measurements.

Frequency attenuation gradient is more sensitive to the type of reservoir identification than other frequency properties such as center frequency, root-mean-square frequency. One of the derived properties for direct hydrocarbon detection is time-frequency spectral decomposition. Based on seismic attenuation theory in a fluid-filled porous medium, a new method combining the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the continuous-wavelet transform named EMDWave is proposed as a high-precision frequency attenuation analysis and an improved time-frequency analysis methods. Compared to the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) method, it reflects more details. The common frequency section calculated by the EMDWave method can improve the reservoir characteristics. First, the EMD method is used as multiband filtering in the temporal domain. The EMD method can decompose the original seismic signals into a finite number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). All these IMFs can be expressed as gradual single-frequency signals that enhance the physical meaning of instantaneous frequencies and instantaneous amplitudes. After the correlation analysis of the original seismic signal and its corresponding IMFs, the IMF component which reflects more oil and gas information is selected for further hydrocarbon detection. The selected IMF with relatively narrow band can make the wavelet transform avoid the frequency loss incurred by a large scale distribution for broadband non-stationary signals. Second, the wavelet transform is applied to the selected IMF. The time-frequency spectrum obtained has a single-peaked spectrum with narrow side-lobes and it is good for computing the absorption coefficients. Then absorption coefficients are computed by curve fitting based on the least square method. The proposed method EMDWave effectively improves the precision of the conventional methods of Energy Absorption Analysis (EAA). Applications of the EMDWave method for hydrocarbon detection over a gas field located in western Sichuan Depression, China, show the effectiveness of gas bearing detection. It can improve the traditional attenuation analysis for better reservoir characterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the effects of high temperature aging treatment on the crystal structure and the magnetic properties of the films are not obvious. According to the law of approach to the saturation and high temperature magnetization curves of the films, the temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy constant K-1 can be obtained, which clearly suggests that the preferred orientation of SmCo crystalline will be destroyed at a certain extent by elevated temperatures. Moreover, the proper temperature dependence of magnetic properties for the films, is suitable for applications in microelectromechanical system (MEMS).

We find that in the thermodynamic limit the proposed system has three different quantum phases and by adjusting the control parameters we are able to realize any phase, any two phases equal coexistence and the three phases equal coexistence. At every critical point the physical quantities including the entanglement are not discontinuous and the matrix product system has long-range correlation and N-spin maximal entanglement. We believe that our work is helpful for having a comprehensive understanding of quantum phase transitions in matrix product states of one-dimensional spin chains and of certain directive significance to the preparation and control of one-dimensional spin lattice models with stable coherence and N-spin maximal entanglement.

Two users previously share an identity string representing their identities. The identity string is encoded as decoherence-free states (termed logical qubits), respectively, over the two collective noisy channels, which are used as decoy photons. By using the decoy photons, both the authentication of two users and the detection of eavesdropping were implemented. The use of logical qubits not only guaranteed the high fidelity of exchanged secret message, but also prevented the eavesdroppers to eavesdrop beneath a mask of noise.

The results indicate that orthorhombic-Si2N2O is the most stable phase at ambient conditions; it transforms into tetragonal-Si2N2O at a relatively low pressure (10 GPa). PBEsol predicts lattice constants and mechanical properties better than PBE, but PBE gives better phase transition parameters. The mechanical properties, such as bulk modulus, Young's modulus and shear modulus, are evaluated by the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approach. The tetragonal-Si2N2O exhibits larger mechanical moduli than other phases. The obtained Vickers hardness of Si2N2O structures shows that the hardness of tetragonal-Si2N2O is slightly higher than those of monoclinic and orthorhombic phases. The minimum thermal conductivities of Si2N2O polymorphs in crystalline and amorphous states are estimated, and we conclude that the thermal conductivities of amorphous Si2N2O phases are comparable to typical thermal barrier coatings.

J	Song, XQ; Deng, W; Liu, Y				Song Xue-qian; Deng Wei; Liu Ying			Spatial spillover and the factors influencing public service supply in Sichuan province, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Public services; Spatial Spillover; Spatial Econometric Model; Relief Degree of Land Surface; China	MUNICIPALITIES; COMPETITION; FEDERATION; AREAS	This article examines the spatial characteristics of public service supply and the factors influencing such supply in cities of Sichuan Province, China using spatial-autocorrelation and spatial econometric models with statistical data in 2012. The results demonstrate that expenditures on different types of public services present different spatial autocorrelation patterns. Although the spatial differences in basic public service expenditures are relatively small, a clear fan-shaped spillover to the east can be seen in Chengdu City. Chengdu also shows high clustering of advanced public service expenditures, being a typical core-periphery pattern. Post-earthquake reconstruction expenditures are clustered in the "5.12 Wenchuan earthquake" region and spill over toward cities to the east. The efficiency of public services in the mountainous areas in western Sichuan is low and exhibits a pattern of low-low spatial autocorrelation. The efficiency of public service supply is affected by economic, social, political and geographical factors. Based on the results of this analysis, we recommend a supply strategy that incorporates different types of public services and a specialized public service supply strategy for mountainous areas. Overall public service efficiency should be enhanced by focusing on narrowing the gap in farmers' income among regions and accelerating urbanization. Decision-makers should consider more supportive policies with regard to providing basic public services in mountainous areas to ensure an equalized supply of basic public services. To enhance the efficiency of advanced public service supply, additional growth pole should be encouraged and incentivized; however, investments are required to drive the development of the peripheral regions through regional economic integration. Both software and hardware types of infrastructure are required to supply services efficiently during post-disaster reconstruction.

The tolerance factor, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra analysis show that La3+ and Nd3+ predominantly dissolve in (K, Na) sites and induces the unit cell shrinkage, while Yb3+ occupies both (K, Na) and Nb cationic sites and causes the unit cell expansion. Due to defect dipoles polarization, P-D(A) and P-D(AB), KNN-Re2O3 ceramics display different ferroelectric properties. Ferroelectric order of KNN-Yb2O3 ceramics were stabilized by P-D(AB), so their ferroelectric properties (P-r similar to 32.7 mu C/cm(2), E-c similar to 7.6 kV/cm) and thermal stability were improved. A constricted hysteresis loop in KNN- Yb2O3 ceramic at a high measurement temperature is formed because of the domain pinning from Nb5+, K and Na+ ions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Materials and Methods: A total of eight New Zealand white rabbits were included in DCE-MRI. The two-compartment model was modified with the impulse residue function in this study. First, the reliability of GFR measurement of the proposed model was compared with other published models in Monte Carlo simulation at different noise levels. Then, functional parameters were estimated in six healthy rabbits to test the feasibility of the new model. Moreover, in order to investigate its validity of GFR estimation, two rabbits underwent acute ischemia surgical procedure in unilateral kidney before DCE-MRI, and pixel-wise measurements were implemented to detect the cortical GFR alterations between normal and abnormal kidneys. Results: The lowest variability of GFR and RPF measurements were found in the proposed model in the comparison. Mean GFR was 3.03 +/- 1.1 ml/min and mean RPF was 2.64 +/- 0.5 ml/g/min in normal animals, which were in good agreement with the published values. Moreover, large GFR decline was found in dysfunction kidneys comparing to the contralateral control group. Conclusion: Results in our study demonstrate that measurement of renal kinetic parameters based on the proposed model is feasible and it has the ability to discriminate GFR changes in healthy and diseased kidneys.

This paper presents an automatic gust front identification algorithm. Totally 879 radar volume-scan samples selected from 21 gust front weather processes that occurred in China between 2009 and 2012 are examined and analyzed. Gust front echo statistical features in reflectivity, velocity, and spectrum width fields are obtained. Based on these features, an algorithm is designed to recognize gust fronts and generate output products and quantitative indices. Then, 315 samples are used to verify the algorithm and 3 typical cases are analyzed. Major conclusions include: 1) for narrow band echoes intensity is between 5 and 30 dBZ, widths are between 2 and 10 km, maximum heights are less than 4 km (89.33% are lower than 3 km), and the lengths are between 50 and 200 km. The narrow-band echo is higher than its surrounding echo. 2) Gust fronts present a convergence line or a wind shear in the velocity field; the frontal wind speed gradually decreases when the distance increases radially outward. Spectral widths of gust fronts are large, with 87.09% exceeding 4 m s(-1). 3) Using 315 gust front volume-scan samples to test the algorithm reveals that the algorithm is highly stable and has successfully recognized 277 samples. The algorithm also works for small-scale or weak gust fronts. 4) Radar data quality has certain impact on the algorithm.

There exists obvious Indian Ocean basin mode (IOBM) after canonical El Nio, while insignificant SST anomalies exist in the Indian Ocean after El Nio Modoki. Anomalous downdraft and updraft appear over the eastern and western Indian Ocean, respectively, during canonical El Nio, while anomalous updraft is weak over the Indian Ocean during El Nio Modoki. Besides, the strength of El Nio Modoki is slightly weaker than that of canonical El Nio. According to previous studies, two mechanisms can explain IOBM after canonical El Nio: tropospheric temperature (TT) mechanism and ocean dynamics. However, both of them do not exist during El Nio Modoki. Comparing with the complicated oceanic processes, it is convenient to verify the observed TT anomalies and test the possible mechanism using the simple model. Therefore, we pay more attention on the question why TT mechanism does not work during El Nio Modoki. Using a linear barocinic model (LBM), we demonstrate that the strength of SST anomalies and cold SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific have an influence on TT anomalies. Especially, cold SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific cancel the effects of warm SST anomalies in the central Pacific on TT anomalies. It suggests that the SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific are important for the TT mechanism in two types of El Nio.

Compared with the original NLM method, which uses intensity similarity to weigh the voxel, the proposed method weighs the voxel using tensor similarity measures in the diffusion tensor space. Euclidean distance with rotational invariance, and Riemannian distance and Log-Euclidean distance with affine invariance were implemented to compare the geometric and orientation features of the diffusion tensor comprehensively. The accuracy and efficacy of the proposed novel NLM method using these three similarity measures in DTI space, along with unbiased novel NLM in diffusion-weighted image space, were compared quantitatively and qualitatively in the present study.

The morphology shows a uniquely oriented film structure with hexagonal platelets accurately being upright on substrate surface. An array detector with 12 pixels was fabricated based on this structure of the thick film. It is shown that the dark current is lower than 3 nA at bias voltage below 500 V, and the dark resistivity is as high as 10(11) Omega cm. A mapping of dark current density of the sensitive area of the array detector exhibits a better uniformity in the central area than the fringe area. A quick photocurrent response to X-ray excitation was obtained. The photoresponse rise time about 250 mu s was obtained from the detectors and the photocurrent decays in a few seconds. The values of photocurrent are higher about two orders of magnitude than the values of dark current. The distribution of photocurrent is more uniform than that of dark current in the sensitive area of the detector.

An important feature of vector analysis is that it can closely combine the geometric ideas with algebraic calculations. Through coordinate transform, the relationship between the frame of radar antenna and the ground, under aircraft motion attitude, is derived. Under the time-space analysis, the overlap area between the footprint of radar beam and the pulse-illuminated zone is obtained. Furthermore, the Doppler frequency expression is successfully deduced. In addition, the Doppler frequency distribution is plotted finally. Using the time-space analysis results, some important parameters of a specified airborne radar system are obtained. Simultaneously, the results are applied to correct the phase error brought by attitude change in airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging.

Apart from the conventional MI gain spectrum, we find two additional MI gain spectra that arise from the second-order nonlinear dispersion in the MM (provided that the group-velocity dispersion does not vanish): one showing a low cutoff frequency but no high cutoff frequency and the other showing no cutoff frequency. Under certain conditions, a threshold power may be required for MI to occur. These MI gain spectra rarely exist in conventional materials and suggest the possibility of observing MI at arbitrarily high perturbation frequencies, which could be explored for the generation of high-repetition-rate ultrashort electromagnetic pulse trains.

N-2 adsorption (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the influence of BaO on the physicochemical properties of catalyst. And catalytic activity tests for methanol, CO, C3H8 and NO conversion were evaluated. Catalytic activity results showed that BaO had a positive effect on the conversion of all pollutants. H-2-TPR results suggested that the addition of BaO increased the reductive ability of the palladium catalysts. The XPS results indicated that doping BaO also improved the dispersion of Pd species and increased the amounts of Ce3+ on the Pd-Ba/CZLA catalyst surface, which led to a better redox property. The excellent redox property helped to improve the catalytic activities toward all the pollutants over Pd-based catalysts.

Meanwhile, the flocculation mechanism of MBFR10543 was discussed. Results have demonstrated that the removal efficiency of Pb(II) reached 94.7 % (with the sorption capacity of 81.2 mg g(-1)) by adding MBFR10543 in two stages, separately, 3 x 10(-2) % (w/w) in the 1.0 min's rapid mixing (180 rpm) and 4 x 10(-2) % (w/w) after 2.0 min's slow mixing (80 rpm) with pH value fixed at 6. Pb(II) flocculation process could be described by the Langmuir isotherms model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The negative Gibbs free energy change indicated the spontaneous nature of the flocculation. Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis indicated that functional groups, such as -OH, C=O, and C-N, were existed in MBFR10543 molecular chains, which had strong capacity for removing Pb(II). Furthermore, both charge neutralization and bridging being the main mechanisms involved in Pb(II) removal by MBFR10543.

Photon 4 in each five-particle cluster state is sent to the controller as permission. Unitary operation I (U) on photon 4 according to identity-string of the receiver is used to forbid the controller to deduce secret message. The classical XOR operation serving as a one-time-pad is used to forbid external eavesdroppers to eavesdrop. Eavesdropping detection and identity authentication are implemented by previously shared reusable base identity-strings. In one transmission, one qubit of each five-particle cluster state is used as controller's permission, and two qubits are used to transmit two classical bit information.

In this paper, a one-dimensional reservoir/wellbore coupling model is presented to predict the productivity of perforated vertical high-temperature-high-pressure (HTHP) wells. A comprehensive perforation skin factor is developed in the model, which takes into consideration many reservoir and perforation parameters, such as length, density, radius, anisotropy, phasing, partial penetration, perforation damage and formation damage. An optimisation strategy is established to investigate the effect of the perforation parameters on productivity based on the skin factor of a well. The model is applied to a 7100m deep HTHP gas well to demonstrate its use in determining optimal perforation parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that an optimisation strategy improves the perforated well inflow performance. Then, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of reservoir and perforation parameters on productivity.

After the original heart sound signal was pre-processed, it was analyzed by the optimum multi-scale wavelet packet decomposition (OMS-WPD), and then the wavelet-time entropy was applied to extract features from the decomposition components. The extracted features were then applied to a support vector machine (SVM) for identification of the normal and five types of abnormal heart sounds. To show the robustness of the proposed method, its performance was compared with four other popular heart sound processing methods. Extensive experimental results showed that the feature extraction method proposed in this paper has convincing identification results, which could be used as a basis for further analysis of heart sound.

J	Wu, C; Liu, LP				Wu Chong; Liu Liping			Comparison of the observation capability of an X-band phased-array radar with an X-band Doppler radar and S-band operational radar	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						X-band planar phased-array radar; observational capability; field experiment; quantitative analysis	WEATHER RADAR; EQUATION; STORMS; AGILE	An X-band phased-array meteorological radar (XPAR) was developed in China and will be installed in an airplane to observe precipitation systems for research purposes. In order to examine the observational capability of the XPAR and to test the operating mode and calibration before installation in the airplane, a mobile X-band Doppler radar (XDR) and XPAR were installed at the same site to observe convective precipitation events. Nearby S-band operational radar (SA) data were also collected to examine the reflectivity bias of XPAR. An algorithm for quantitative analysis of reflectivity and velocity differences and radar sensitivity of XPAR is presented. The reflectivity and velocity biases of XPAR are examined with SA and XDR. Reflectivity sensitivities, the horizontal and vertical structures of reflectivity by the three radars are compared and analyzed. The results indicated that while the XPRA with different operating modes can capture the main characteristic of 3D structures of precipitation, and the averaged reflectivity differences between XPAR and XDR, and XDR and SA, were 0.4 dB and 6.6 dB on 13 July and -4.5 dB and 5.1 dB on 2 August 2012, respectively. The minimum observed reflectivities at a range of 50 km for XPAR, XDR and SA were about 15.4 dBZ, 13.5 dBZ and -3.5 dBZ, respectively. The bias of velocity between XPAR and XDR was negligible. This study provides a possible method for the quantitative comparison of the XPAR data, as well as the sensitivity of reflectivity, calibration, gain and bias introduced by pulse compression.

A kind of double-cell ozonesonde has been developed at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (named the "IAP ozonesonde") based on previous experience over the past 20 years of developing the singlecell GPSO3 ozonesonde. The IAP ozonesonde is of the Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) type. A detailed description of the IAP ozonesonde is firstly provided in the present paper, followed by a presentation of results from a series of launches carried out to evaluate its performance. The analysis involved comparing its observations with measurements from the GPSO3 and ECC ozonesondes (Model type ENSCI-Z) as well as a Brewer spectrophotometer. The results showed that the IAP ozonesonde is a vast improvement over the GPSO3 ozonesonde, able to capture vertical ozone structures very well and in good agreement with ECC ozonesonde measurements. The average difference in the ozone partial pressure between the IAP and ECC ozonesondes was 0.3 mPa from the surface to 2.5 km, close to zero from 2.5 to 9 km and generally less than 1 mPa for layers higher than 9 km. The apparent deviation is likely caused by a decreasing pump flow rate in the IAP ozonesonde which needs further improvement. The total ozone amounts measured by the IAP ozonesonde profiles were highly comparable with the Brewer data with a relative difference of 6%. The development of the IAP ozonesonde and its strong performance will surely accelerate the process of conventional observations of ozone profiles over China in the near future as well as provide more data for ozone research in general.

J	Tang, T; Chen, XR				Tang, Tao; Chen, Xiaorong			UWB UHF RFID TAG antenna with branch-line slots for metallic objects	MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						UWB; tag antenna; RFID		A novel UWB ultrahigh frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) tag antenna designed for metallic objects is proposed, which is fabricated on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate for low-cost production, whose relative permittivity is 3.8 and dielectric loss tangent is 0.02. The overall size of the proposed tag antenna is 56 x 10 x 0.8 mm(3). It consists of two coplanar patches which are electrically connected to the metallic ground through two symmetrical shorting walls placed at both edge sides of the patches. The resonant frequency can be adjusted by changing the shorting wall length. Double-symmetrical branch-line slots are created to improve the antenna bandwidth. The simulated bandwidth is about 223.5 MHz, which covers the global UHF RFID frequency range. The experimental results show that the maximum read range of the proposed antenna is larger than 2.6 m when it is mounted on a test metal plate with a size of 150 x 150 x 8 mm(3).

The results show that the TOD causes the asymmetry of the temporal- and spectral-domain, and the chirp characteristics. The OWB generally appears near the pulse center and at the trailing edge of the pulse, instead of at the two edges of the pulse symmetrically in the case of no TOD. With the increase of distance, the relation of OWB to the TOD near the pulse center increases quickly, leading to the generation of ultra-short pulse trains, while the OWB resulting from the case of no TOD at the trailing edge of the pulse disappears gradually. In addition, the positive (negative) QN enhances (weakens) the chirp amount and the fine structures, thereby inducing the OWB phenomena to appear earlier (later). Thus, the TOD and the positive (negative) QN are beneficial (detrimental) to the OWB and the generation of ultra-short pulse trains.

A significant negative correlation (seesaw) has been illustrated between the Somali CEF and the three CEFs north of Australia (the South China Sea, Celebes Sea, and New Guinea; they are referred to in combination as the Australian CEF). A seesaw index is thus defined with a higher (lower) value representing an intensified (weakened) Somali CEF but a weakened (intensified) Australian CEF. The connection of the seesaw with the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is then investigated. The results suggest that an enhanced seesaw corresponds to an intensified EASM with more rainfall in north China, the Yellow River valley, and the upper reach of the Yangtze River. The seesaw reflects the opposite covariability between the two atmospheric action centers in the Southern Hemisphere, Mascarene subtropical high, and Australian subtropical high. Whether the seesaw EASM connection is influenced by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Indian Ocean SST dipole mode (IOD) is analyzed. The results remain unchanged when the ENSO- or IOD-related signals are excluded, although ENSO exerts a significant influence. This implies an additional predictability for the EASM from the CEF seesaw.

The expression indicates that cascading inductance can significantly increase the load capacitance sensitivity. Experiments using nominal capacitors in series with a calculated inductance validated the theoretical derivation and showed that the frequency pulling sensitivity versus capacitance variations was considerably improved in different levels depending on the quartz crystal fundamental frequency. A quartz crystal capacitive proximity sensor with a calculated inductance was also investigated.

The sensing structure consists of bi-layer films, in which graphene oxide (GO) film serves as an isolation layer between the electrode of the QCM and polyaniline (PANI) sensing film. The quality (Q) factor of the QCMs was measured with and without the GO isolation layer. The experiment results indicate that the quality factor of QCM with GO layer is about two times larger than that of the QCM without GO in the whole detection range, which means the introduction of GO isolation layer can effectively improve the quality factor of the QCM. The improvement of the Q factor is ascribed to the high elasticity modulus of GO isolation layer, which produced the suppression of the surface energy loss of the QCMs. The use of GO as isolation layer provides a simple way to realize high stability QCM sensors.

In this paper, we settle a question raised by Mahdou and Tamekkante in [On (strongly) Gorenstein (semi) hereditary rings, Arab. J. Sci. Eng. 36 (2011) 436] about the coherence of G-hereditary rings. It is shown that a ring R is Gorenstein semihereditary if and only if every finitely generated submodule of a projective module is Gorenstein projective. As a consequence of this result, we have that every G-hereditary ring R is coherent.

In this layer the lidar backscatter, the depolarization ratio, the ice water content, the effective radius of ice particles, and the cloud optical depth all decrease sharply toward the cloud edge. In general, the width of this layer (6.4 +/- 3.1km over land) decreases with increasing ambient temperature. The estimated longwave radiative forcing associated with the layer is about 10W/m2. Due to its extremely small optical depth (less than 0.3), such lateral boundary layer may be missed by conventional satellite passive optical sensors. As a consequence, the mentioned radiative forcing has not been credited with its deserved share in the Earth's radiative energy budget.

The atmospheric anomalies associated with the drought over the Yangtze River basin during spring 2011	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; WATER-VAPOR TRANSPORT; ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; ARCTIC OSCILLATION; WESTERN PACIFIC; SOUTH CHINA; SNOW COVER; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; SST ANOMALIES; INDIAN-OCEAN	The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLRY) suffered a once-in-a-50-year drought during the spring of 2011. The abnormality of the atmospheric circulation in the spring is characterized by the deeper-than-normal trough over East Asia and the northwest Pacific while stronger-than-normal high-pressure system over the west, which results in a stronger-than-normal meridional circulation. Meanwhile, the western Pacific subtropical high is weaker than normal and retreats to the east, so the spring monsoonal moist air from lower latitudes is relatively weak. The anomalous northerly wind in higher latitudes suppresses the northward motion of the moist air and brings dry air to the MLRY. The northerly wind also suppresses the northward motion of warm air and brings cold air to the MLRY. So finally, the air over the MLRY is drier, but colder than normal, which is different from many other droughts. The coldness of the air plays a negative role to the drought. Results from comparing the C-q and C-T, the measures of the changes in moisture and temperature between this spring and the normal spring defined based on the tight precipitation-relative humidity relation, indicate that the dryness of the air is much stronger than the coldness, and the air over the MLRY thus maintains a lower-than-normal relative humidity. The animation of daily Cq and CT shows that dry and cold air moves from the northwest to the MLRY in a manner of low-frequency oscillation.

The full physical radiative transfer model, vector radiative transfer model based on successive order of scattering, which is based on the successive order of scattering approach, was used to simulate the measurements of CarbonSpec/TanSat, as well as the kernel matrix in the inversion algorithm, and then the surface pressure and other related atmospheric parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface albedo, and temperature were derived through optimal estimation theory. Sensitivities of the algorithm to surface albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), viewing zenith angle (VZA), aerosol type, and AOD were investigated, and the results showed that the absolute error of retrieved surface pressure increases with decreasing surface albedo or increasing SZA and VZA. An accuracy of < 4 hPa over bright surfaces (surface albedo a parts per thousand yen0.15) could be derived for various SZAs and viewing geometries. Moreover, the algorithm can simultaneously retrieve the surface albedo, AOD, and its vertical distribution indicated by scale height.

The vegetation, which impacts the erosion processes of the gully, is important to the ecological environment. In this study, we investigated the vegetation in gully n1 of Yuanmou County, which is a typical area of the Dry-hot Valley. A total of 82 vegetation quadrats on a relatively gentle section of gully n1 (slope was mostly less than 45 degrees) and nine points on a steep slope (slope higher than 70 degrees) were investigated in 2012. The vegetation indices, in addition to the soil conditions and topography, were measured through field investigations and the gully Digital Elevation Model (DEM). On the gully sidewall, almost no vegetation grew in the steep slope, whereas the slope gradient and the slope aspect exhibited a weak relationship with the vegetation indices when the slope was less than 45 degrees. On the gully bed, the runoff path was the most important factor that affected the vegetation. The average vegetation cover inside the runoff path was 5.2%, whereas the average vegetation cover outside the runoff path increased to 56.3%. The vegetation strongly impacted the soil moisture during the rainy season. However, this relationship was not observed during the dry season, which indicates that the water conservation effects exerted by the vegetation cannot last a long time in the Dry-hot Valley. The active part of gully n1 has a vegetation cover (average 16.9%) that is significantly lower compared with the stable parts of the gully (55.1%). This finding indicates that the vegetation in the gully is not only impacted by the soil and the topography in the area of vegetation growth but also influenced by the runoff processes upstream of the gully heads.

Here, we demonstrate a type of red-emitting phosphors Eu3+-doped barium molybdate phosphors effectively excited by the blue light (464 nm). These phosphors present the strong emission spectra around 613 nm and their color coordinate values are close to the NTSC standard values. More importantly, by constructing a complete 3003 x 3003 energy matrix by an effective operator Hamiltonian including the free ion and crystal field interactions, for the first time, the fluorescent mechanism for Eu3+ ions at the tetragonal (S-4) Ba2+ site of BaMoO4 crystal were investigated by a complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method (CMD). The fitting values are close to the experimental results, demonstrating the feasibility of using the complete diagonalization method to study the phosphors for w-LEDs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Four CE318 sun photometers were verified using the proposed calibration method and operational protocol. The calibration results showed that the instrument coefficients differed by less than 3% for visible (similar to 5% for infrared) wavelengths from the original ones stated by Cimel Electronique. In situ validation experiment data showed that radiances at +/- 6 degrees measured by sun collimator (aureole) were consistent with those measured by sky collimator (sky), under both almucantar (ALMUC) and principal plane (PPLAN) scenarios.

A heuristic algorithm based on combination theory is presented to approach the optimal partition. As the heuristic algorithm automatically searches for the number of partitions, no user intervention is required. Finally, experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the results show that our method generates higher quality results than the state-of-art methods, cross-association and bipartite, recursively induced modules. Experiment results also show the good scalability of the proposed algorithm. The method is applied to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula and Chinese herbal network whose community structure is not well known, and found that it detects significant and it is informative community division.

We can take advantage of these anomalies for hydrocarbon detection. Based on the Teager-Kaiser (TK) energy characteristics, a method that uses this energy in association with the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is proposed for hydrocarbon detection in carbonate reservoirs. The EMD method, which can decompose the original seismic signals into a finite number of monocomponent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in the temporal domain, is used for multiband filtering. A TK energy separation algorithm is used to estimate the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the selected IMFs from the EMD method. The proposed method can generate a joint time-frequency representation that can reflect the energy tracking of the seismic signals. The instantaneous spectrums produced by the EMD/TK method have the capability to detect hydrocarbon. The model results to the gas field, which located in the eastern Ordos Basin, China, show that the EMD/TK method can be adopted and they detect the gas-bearing reservoir efficiently. Application of the EMD/TK method in hydrocarbon detection in a gas field located in the Eastern Ordos Basin shows its effectiveness. The EMD/TK method can be used as a new analysis tool to determine the instantaneous spectral properties of a reservoir to detect hydrocarbon.

High monthly AODs were observed in March, August and December, while a low value was observed in October. Monthly variations in Angstrom exponent were opposite to the AODs in March and August. The averaged PM10 showed a significantly seasonal variation with a peak in winter. There is a complicated (not linear) positive correlation between total AOD and PM10 near the surface. Three typical cases under the conditions of dust and haze were studied, and the results showed that the AODs on the dust days were largest while minimum AODs occurred on haze days. On the contrast, the Angstrom exponent distributions among three weather conditions were opposite to the AODs. The 3-day back-trajectory analysis indicated that the origin of the air masses largely affected the aerosol optical properties over the Sichuan Basin.

The average grain size of Ti-substituted NiZnCo ferrite thin films increased with Ti substitution. The saturation magnetization gradually increased with the increase of Ti substitution when x <= 006, and decreased when x > 0.06.

It is shown that the focused AiVB represents singular behavior at the focal plane, and the ballistic dynamics of the Airy beam is no longer parabolic but polynomial trajectory because its acceleration is a variant value relating to propagation distance. At critical distance the main lobe of Airy beam is overlapped by vortex core, and then it presents rotating about the closest vortex and the Airy-like pattern is self-reconstructed as the propagation distance further increase, which is due to the self-healing property of the Airy beam, on the other hand it is result of the rotation of vortex. The accelerating vortex deflections of the focused AiVB and an individual component are also illustrated by numerical examples. The results show that the vortices exhibit transverse deflection and their accelerating vortex behaviors also follow polynomial rather than parabolic trajectories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of YM addition on the structure, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties of KNN-xYM ceramics were systematically investigated. With increase of YM content, from the rhombohedral to orthorhombic transition temperature (TR-O) moves close to room temperature against the direction of the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition temperature (TO-T). A polymorphic phase transitions (PPT) between rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases exists at x similar to 0.01 and the optimum electrical characterization (d(33) similar to 140 pC/N, k(p) similar to 0.42, Q(m) similar to 214, epsilon(r) similar to 634, tan delta similar to 0.02, and Tc similar to 386 degrees C) is also given to the compositions (x = 0.01) around PPT. In addition, KNN-xYM ceramics became a relaxor ferroelectric gradually with increasing YM content. These results indicate that the enhanced piezoelectric properties can be achieved based on the coexistence of rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Uncertainties of the gridded data and national average, linear trends and their uncertainties, as well as the homogenization effect on uncertainties are assessed. It is shown that the sampling error variances of homogenized Tmax and Tmin, which are larger in winter than in summer, have a marked northwest-southeast gradient distribution, while the sampling error variances of the original data are found to be larger and irregular. Tmax and Tmin increase in all months of the year in the study period 1951-2004, with the largest warming and uncertainties being 0.400 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) +/- 0.269 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) and 0.578 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) +/- 0.211 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) in February, and the least being 0.022 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) +/- 0.085 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) and 0.104 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) +/- 0.070 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) in August. Homogenization can remove large uncertainties in the original records resulting from various non-natural changes in China.

Both predictands and predictors were first decomposed into interannual and decadal components. Two predictive equations were then built separately for the two distinct timescales by using multivariate linear regressions based on independent sample validation. For the interannual timescale, 850-hPa meridional wind and 500-hPa geopotential heights from multiple dynamical models' hindcasts and SSTs from observational datasets were used to construct predictors. For the decadal timescale, two well-known basin-scale SST decadal oscillation (the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) indices were used as predictors. Then, the downscaled predictands were combined to represent the predicted/hindcasted total rainfall. The prediction was compared with the models' raw hindcasts and those from a similar approach but without timescale decomposition. In comparison to hindcasts from individual models or their multi-model ensemble mean, the skill of the present scheme was found to be significantly higher, with anomaly correlation coefficients increasing from nearly neutral to over 0.4 and with RMSE decreasing by up to 0.6 mm d(-1). The improvements were also seen in the station-based temporal correlation of the predictions with observed rainfall, with the coefficients ranging from -0.1 to 0.87, obviously higher than the models' raw hindcasted rainfall results. Thus, the present approach exhibits a great advantage and may be appropriate for use in operational predictions.

The surface temperature was above normal during 2008 winter, and was below normal during 2012 winter. The atmospheric circulation anomalies are the direct reasons for the different climate. In 2008 winter, the North Atlantic Oscillation anomaly was in positive phase, benefited the Europe warming. During 2012 winter, the blocking over the North Atlantic and high-latitude Eurasia benefited the extreme cold event in Europe. The role of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration anomalies were investigated by one atmospheric general circulation model. The SST anomalies over the North Atlantic can explain the atmospheric circulation over Atlantic in Europe in a certain extent separately for these two years, so they are important for the climate differences. While the tropical SST anomalies can just simulate similar atmospheric responses over the North Atlantic in 2012 winter, while they seemed play a negative role in 2008 winter. The loss of sea ice over Arctic adjoined Europe lead to cold conditions over Europe, so it played a negative role during 2008 winter, while a positive role during 2012 winter.

For evaluating the performance of ND-coated QCM humidity sensor, a series of humidity-sensing experiments were carried out by using both oscillating circuit and impedance analysis methods. Based on the large specific surface area and high mechanical modulus, the ND-coated sensor exhibited large humidity-sensing response and good stability. In addition, the resultant sensors displayed low hysteresis, good repeatability, and short response time. The influence of the depositing amount of ND on the sensor's performance has also been discussed. The result indicated that the stability of QCM humidity sensor showed an extreme decrease when the deposition amount of ND on QCM is large enough. The possible reason for this anomalous phenomenon is analyzed and discussed. This study suggests that ND could be a promising candidate material for developing high-performance QCM humidity sensor.

The higher the concentration of the raw swine slurry, the higher the recovery rate of organic matter from the raw slurry to the high solids content liquid, the lower the concentration multiple for the organic matter. However, the separation efficiency of organic matter from the raw slurry with an intermediate solids content was higher than that from the raw slurry with either a high or low solids content. In terms of biogas production, separation efficiency increased as the concentration of the raw slurry declined. The high solids content liquid, whose volume accounted for 9.72-28.5% of that of the raw slurry, contained 52.7-70.6% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD), 57.6-80.1% of the biological oxygen demand (BOD5). In particular, it produced more than 75% of the total biogas yield. When heated using limited energy, the high solids content liquid, with lower volume, could achieve higher digestion temperature than the raw slurry. The high solids content liquid had 2.48-5.42 times greater COD content and 2.81-5.92 times greater BOD5 than the raw slurry and had a quicker degradation rate according to the kinetics equation. These two factors: enhanced digestion temperature and increased concentration of the substrate, could improve the efficiency of the entire biogas fermentation system in winter. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The VFP surrounded by oxide is inserted in the bulk of the drift region. Compared to the surface local depletion of the conventional lateral field plate (LFP), the depletion layer of the VFP expands to the bulk of the drift region, which enhances the bulk electric field. Therefore, ultralow R-ON,R-sp is realized in the VFP device due to high drift-region doping (N-d) and short cell pitch. An analytical FP model is developed to describe the behavior of the VFP, in which the breakdown voltage (BV) and N-d are found to be proportional to the FP factor k. Then the uniform-doped VFP laterally diffused MOSs and the step-doped VFP laterally diffused MOS are proposed. The optimized device exhibits a BV of 945 V and a R-ON,R-sp of 34 m Omega center dot cm(2) which are superior to those of similar devices and the silicon limit.

The computed equilibrium lattice constants in this work are in agreement with those experimental values. We plot the planar contours of Young's moduli and sound velocities of TiO2 structures at several crystallographic planes to reveal their anisotropic properties. The minimum thermal conductivities of them are calculated using either Cahill-Pohl model or Cahill model. Our results imply that TiO2 polymorphs have strong anisotropic elasticity, but they exhibit weak anisotropies in sound velocities. Otherwise, Cahill-Pohl model gives reasonable estimations for the minimum thermal conductivities for amorphous TiO2 structures. The anisotropy in sound velocity revealed by Christoffel equation can be considered as a good starting point for investigating the anisotropy of lattice thermal conductivity in a crystalline material.

The soil resistivity will decrease due to the breakdown process caused by strong electric field of the HPM, and this process will in turn lead to dramatic attenuation of the HPM. The soil resistivity changes with time, which can be described by time-varying partial differential equations. Combined with the Maxwell equations, a model of HPM propagation in soil has been established, and numerical simulation has been made by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Finally, the physical processes of the HPM propagation in soil have been revealed by the numerical results.

Then variations of gain spectra of MI with the normalized angular frequencies and the optical power densities are calculated in real units. In the negative refractive region, two kinds of gain spectra are discovered. The first (second) one is close to (far from) the zero perturbation frequencies and it corresponds to the lower (higher) normalized angular frequencies. Moreover, the second one has higher cutoff frequency, which is obviously beneficial to generation of high-repetition-rate pulse trains. While in the positive refractive region, only the first kind of gain spectra is found. With increase of the optical power densities, the peak gains and the spectral widths of MI increase before decrease, but they vary the most rapidly (slowly) for the exponential (conventional) saturable nonlinearities. The MI characteristics and their corresponding applications can be adjusted by several methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

And then taking four-beamlet Airy array beam in same array orientation as an example, square optical spot array obtained in focal field can be used for simultaneous trapping multiple Rayleigh particles with relative refractive index larger than 1. The transverse gradient forces serving as restore forces tend to push particles at different initial positions to their individual optical spot center. The analysis of trapping stability indicates that larger input peak intensity of Airy beamlet and smaller particle size are benefit to trapping particle owing to many deeper potential wells. Vortex array produced by coherent combined Airy array beam in this paper is expected to be useful for simultaneous trapping microparticles with relative refractive index smaller than 1.

The costless and high-accurate Sidi-Israeli quadrature formula are applied to deal with the integrals in which the kernels have a logarithmic singularity. Especially, the Sidi transformation is used for the polygon cases in order to obtain a rapid convergence by degrading the singularity at the corners on the boundary. The convergence and stability of the MQMs solution are proved based on Anselone's collective compact theory. In addition, asymptotic error expansion of the MQMs shows that the approximation order is of O(h(3)), where h is the partition size of the boundary. Finally, numerical examples are tested and results verify the theoretical analysis.

The results show that only surface waves of TE mode can propagate in this peculiar waveguide, no TM mode in any forms can propagate in it. In addition, TE waveguide modes will be affected by permeability ratio mu(1)/mu(2) and dielectric layer thickness ratio P. Finally, from the electric field distribution of TE mode, we find the amplitude and location of the electric field can be adjusted by changing the thickness ratio P. (c) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

When it is applied to TSP, its runtime is proportional to the squared size of problem.. so as to look less efficient. The following statistical feature is observed during the authors' long-termgene data analysis using ACO: when the data size.. becomes big, local clustering appears frequently. That is, some data cluster tightly in a small area and form a class, and the correlation between different classes is weak. And this feature makes the idea of divide and rule feasible for the estimate of solution of TSP. In this paper an improved ACO algorithm is presented, which firstly divided all data into local clusters and calculated small TSP routes and then assembled a big TSP route with them. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the running speed of ACO by 200 factors under the condition that data set holds feature of local clustering.

In real CVS, the customer data usually include lots of missing values, which may affect the performance of CVS model greatly. This study proposes a one-step dynamic classifier ensemble model for missing values (ODCEM) model. On the one hand, ODCEM integrates the preprocess of missing values and the classification modeling into one step; on the other hand, it utilizes multiple classifiers ensemble technology in constructing the classification models. The empirical results in credit scoring dataset "German" from UCI and the real customer churn prediction dataset "China churn" show that the ODCEM outperforms four commonly used "two-step" models and the ensemble based model LMF and can provide better decision support for market managers.

J	Wang, Y; Wu, X; Li, XH; Zhou, JL				Wang, Yan; Wu, Xi; Li, Xiaohua; Zhou, Jiliu			Vehicle Type Recognition in Sensor Networks Using Improved Time Encoded Signal Processing Algorithm	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	Vehicle type recognition is a demanding application of wireless sensor networks (WSN). In many cases, sensor nodes detect and recognize vehicles from their acoustic or seismic signals using wavelet based or spectral feature extraction methods. Such methods, while providing convincing results, are quite demanding in computational power and energy and are difficult to implement on low-cost sensor nodes with limitation resources. In this paper, we investigate the use of time encoded signal processing (TESP) algorithm for vehicle type recognition. The conventional TESP algorithm, which is effective for the speech signal feature extraction, however, is not suitable for the vehicle sound signal which is more complex. To solve this problem, an improved time encoded signal processing (ITESP) is proposed as the feature extraction method according to the characteristics of the vehicle sound signal. Recognition procedure is accomplished using the support vector machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The experimental results indicate that the vehicle type recognition system with ITESP features give much better performance compared with the conventional TESP based features.

Results show that CPT is a common phenomenon throughout the negative CG lightning discharge process, 243 times of CPT discharge events occurs during 323 negative CG lightning, a proportion reaching 75.2%. CPT in negative CG can occur before the first return stroke, between the strokes, and after the last stroke. The proportion of 66.7% of the total subsequent strokes is preceded by CPT, and CPT occurs after 11.5% of the total last strokes. It is also found that there are four distributions prior to subsequent strokes: single CPT-c (CPT connecting with subsequent strokes), single CPT-i (CPT occurring in an interval between CPT and return strokes), CPT-c and CPT-i occur concurrently, and several CPT-is appear concurrently. Single CPT-c is the most common, 39.4% of subsequent strokes are preceded by single CPT-c, and several CPTs are easier to occur before the first and second subsequent strokes, which are respectively the corresponding strokes 9.4% and 7.7% of the total number. With the increase of the order of subsequent stroke, there is a decreasing trend for the occurrence of CPT, and in addition to the previous two subsequent strokes, the number of CPT-c is obviously greater than CPT-i before the others. In addition, CPT-i and CPT-a both occur to add on the negative CG K-change, and some also correspond to the process of J-change in the slow electric field wave.

Column aerosol optical properties and aerosol radiative forcing during a serious haze-fog month over North China Plain in 2013 based on ground-based sunphotometer measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TEMPORAL VARIATIONS; DELTA REGION; AERONET; DEPTH; DUST; CLIMATOLOGY; VARIABILITY; ALGORITHMS; ABSORPTION; VISIBILITY	In January 2013, North China Plain experienced several serious haze events. Cimel sunphotometer measurements at seven sites over rural, suburban and urban regions of North China Plain from 1 to 30 January 2013 were used to further our understanding of spatial-temporal variation of aerosol optical parameters and aerosol radiative forcing (ARF). It was found that Aerosol Optical Depth at 500 nm (AOD(500nm)) during non-pollution periods at all stations was lower than 0.30 and increased significantly to greater than 1.00 as pollution events developed. The Angstrom exponent (Alpha) was larger than 0.80 for all stations most of the time. AOD(500nm) averages increased from north to south during both polluted and non-polluted periods on the three urban sites in Beijing. The fine mode AOD during pollution periods is about a factor of 2.5 times larger than that during the non-pollution period at urban sites but a factor of 5.0 at suburban and rural sites. The fine mode fraction of AOD(675nm) was higher than 80% for all sites during January 2013. The absorption AOD(675nm) at rural sites was only about 0.01 during pollution periods, while similar to 0.03-0.07 and 0.01-0.03 during pollution and non-pollution periods at other sites, respectively. Single scattering albedo varied between 0.87 and 0.95 during January 2013 over North China Plain. The size distribution showed an obvious tri-peak pattern during the most serious period. The fine mode effective radius in the pollution period was about 0.01-0.08 mu m larger than during non-pollution periods, while the coarse mode radius in pollution periods was about 0.06-0.38 mu m less than that during non-pollution periods. The total, fine and coarse mode particle volumes varied by about 0.06-0.34 mu m(3), 0.03-0.23 mu m(3), and 0.03-0.10 mu m(3), respectively, throughout January 2013. During the most intense period (1-16 January), ARF at the surface exceeded -50 W m(-2), -180 W m(-2), and -200 W m(-2) at rural, suburban, and urban sites, respectively. The ARF readings at the top of the atmosphere were approximately -30 W m(-2) in rural and -40-60 W m(-2) in urban areas. Positive ARF at the top of the atmosphere at the Huimin suburban site was found to be different from others as a result of the high surface albedo due to snow cover.

A binary string is used to express the identity of the receiver, which is encoded as a single sequence of photons. The encoded photon sequence acts as a detection sequence and implements authentication. An XOR operation serves as a one-time pad and is used to ensure the security of the protocol. The binary string is reused even in a noisy channel and proves to be unconditionally secure. In contrast with the protocols proposed by Wang et al. [Chin. Phys. 16 1868 (2007)] and Yang et al. [Chin. Phys. B 19 070304 (2010)], the protocol in this study implements the identity authentication with a reusable binary string; no hash function or local unitary operation is used. The protocol in this study is also easier to implement and highly efficient without losing security.

After 60 h of fermentation, three forms of bioflocculant (broth, capsular, and slime) were extracted, and maximum broth bioflocculant of 2.9 and 4.1 g L-1 were produced in sterilized and alkaline-thermal treated sludge as compared to that of 1.8 g L-1 in acid-thermal treated sludge. Higher bioflocculant quantity was produced in SS of 15, 25, and 35 g L-1 compared to that produced in SS of 45, 55, and 65 g L-1. Bioflocculant combined with 0.5 g Ca2+ in 1.0 L kaolin suspension acted as conditioning agent, and maximum flocculating activity of 94.5% and 92.8% was achieved using broth and slime bioflocculant, respectively. The results demonstrated that wastewater sludge could be used as sources to prepare bioflocculants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is the major precipitation-producing weather system over the plateau, but the knowledge of its climatology and understanding of generation mechanisms are limited because of the lack of adequate observations in this harsh mountainous region. In this study, the high-resolution NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data have been used to perform a statistical survey of these vortices over 10 warm seasons (April-October of 2000-09). The purpose is to document their climatological features, including genesis, size, life cycle, propagation, and diurnal variation.Results show that similar to 103 plateau vortices occur on average every year. Most are detected from May through August, with the maximum monthly count in July. The primary area of origin exhibits a west-east orientation in correspondence with a large-scale confluence zone, and the most concentrated source lies in the area of 33 degrees-36 degrees N, 84 degrees-90 degrees E in the high elevated central and western plateau. Significant diurnal variations are observed, characteristic of a preferential genesis during late afternoon to evening hours and a late night dissipation peak. The vortex events have an average life span of similar to 15 h and an average horizontal dimension (effective diameter) of similar to 280 km. In accordance with the steering environmental flow, an overwhelming majority travel eastward with a mean translation speed of similar to 10 m s(-1). A small fraction of systems (approximately nine cases annually) move off the plateau, predominantly from the eastern edge.

The effects of lithium on the phase structures, electrical properties, and thermal stability were investigated. A polymorphic phase boundary between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases has been found in the composition range of 0.02 <= y <= 0.03 at room temperature. With the increasing content of Li, T-C gradually raised while TO-T reduced, respectively. The TO-T value of KNLN-0.03-BC ceramic is close to room temperature, resulting in good electrical properties (d(33)similar to 180, k(p)similar to 0.326). Moreover, KNLN-gamma-BC ceramics possess a lower TO-T and higher T-C (> 400 degrees C) when y >= 0.03, that means they have a better thermal stability and might be used in a broader temperature range.

Two kinds of dopants, oxide Bi2O3 (BI) and ferroelectric ceramic Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT), are used in different amounts or combinations (2wt%BI, 2wt%BIT, 2wt%BI + 2wt%BIT, 4wt%BI, and 4wt%BIT) to promote the sintering process. Variation of microstructure and density in each sample has been analyzed. Influence of the doping mode on the magnetic properties of the ferrite has been investigated. It can be found that the ferrite doped with BI has an obvious decrease of both M-S and H-C in contrast with the ferrite doped with same amount of BIT. Appropriate amounts of BIT is helpful to not only increase M-S, but also decrease of H-C, compared with the ferrite without doping.

The total-field/scattered-field, Mur's first-order absorbing and dielectric boundary conditions for CMMs slab are discussed in the paper. Numerical results show that the cross-polarized reflected coefficient of the CMMs slab is zero. Negative index of refraction phenomenon and optical property of giant optical activity in CMMs slabs are illustrated with 1D auxiliary differential equation-finite-difference time-domain method.

During the analysis period, distinctively active and suppressed periods of TP vortices genesis are noticed. In 1998, nine active periods of TP vortices occurred, which were largely clustered by the cyclonic circulations associated with the intraseasonal oscillation of 500-hPa relative vorticity. In addition to the well-recognized 30-60-day oscillation, the clustering of TP vorticity in the 1998 summer are more likely modulated by the 10-30-day oscillation, because all active periods of TP vortices fall into the positive phase of the 10-30-day oscillation in 1998. Even in the negative (i.e., anticyclonic) phases of the 30-60-day oscillation, the positive (i.e., cyclonic) 500-hPa 10-30-day oscillation can excite the clustering of TP vortices. This result indicates that the 10-30-day oscillation more directly modulates the activities of TP vortices by providing a favorable (unfavorable) cyclonic (anticyclonic) environment. The analysis of the 10-30-day atmospheric oscillation suggests that the westerly trough disturbances, in conjunction with convective instability due to low-level warm advection from the Indian monsoon region, are important in the clustering of TP vortex activities. In particular, the moisture flux from the southwest boundary of TP is essential to the accumulation of convective energy. Thus, a better understanding and prediction of the 10-30-day intraseasonal oscillation is needed to advance the extended-range forecasting of TP vortices and their downstream impacts on the weather and climate over East Asia.

In order to analyze the basic characteristics of waves in the vortex, the governing equations for the vortex were established in column coordinates with the balance of gradient wind. Based on this, the type of mixed waves and their dispersion characteristics were deduced by solving the linear model. Two numerical simulations with triple-nested domains-one idealized large-eddy simulation and one of a TPV that took place on 14 August 2006-were also carried out. The aim of the simulations was to validate the mixed wave deduced from the governing equations. The high-resolution model output data were analyzed and the results showed that the tangential flow field of the TPV in the form of center heating was cyclonic and convergent in the lower levels and anticyclonic and divergent in the upper levels. The simulations also showed that the vorticity of the vortex is uneven and might have shear flow along the radial direction. The changing vorticity causes the formation and spreading of vortex Rossby (VR) waves, and divergence will cause changes to the motion of the excitation and evolution of inertial gravity (IG) waves. Therefore, the vortex may contain what we call mixed inertial gravity-vortex Rossby (IG-VR) waves. It is suggested that some strongly developed TPVs should be studied in the future, because of their effects on weather in downstream areas.

This study explored the in-situ variations in soil loss rates and morphological characteristics in active bank gully heads, testing the overland flow discharge with a range of 30 to 120 L min(-1). In response to this flow, actively migrating headcuts developed with retreat rates ranging from 2.6 to 7.9 mm h(-1). All experimental runs resulted in a gradual increase in soil loss volume, incision depth, and retreat distance over time due to set flow rates. For the gully beds and upstream areas of gully heads, the soil erosion rates were greatest at the beginning of each run and progressively decreased during the scouring test. Non-steady state soil erosion rates were observed in the headwall for the flow discharge levels examined for this study. This was due to an abrupt slope collapse after long-term scouring effects. As degradation progressed, similar trends emerged for temporal variations within the fractal dimensions of topographic surfaces, in both the gully heads and upstream areas. After the scouring was run for a period of 90 min, asymptotic fractal dimensions of topographic surfaces were attained in the upstream areas and gully heads, suggesting that steady state morphological characteristics had been realised. It should be noted that headwall collapses are typically associated with a substantial increase in sediment yield where no other obvious change in morphological characteristics occurs in the headwall. Therefore, even though a significant difference in the soil erosion rates and fractal dimensions of topographic surface values could be found between the bank gully heads and upstream areas, the temporal variation in the morphological characteristics of bank gully heads was similar to those observed in upstream areas where ephemeral gullies developed.

The partial differential equations governing the coupled longitudinal-transverse vibration of the blade with large bending deflection are obtained by applying Hamilton's principle. The modal problem of the coupled vibration is handled by using the method of numerical integration of Green's function. Influences of the rotating speed, the pitch angle, the setting angle, and the aerodynamic loads on natural frequencies are discussed. Results show that: (1) Lagwise natural frequencies ascend with the increase of rotating speed; effects of the rotating speed on low-frequencies are dramatic while these effects on high-frequencies become less. (2) Influences of the pitch angle on natural frequencies are little; in the range of the normal rotating speed, the first frequency ascends with the increase of the absolute value of the pitch angle, while it is contrary to the second and third frequencies. (3) Effects of the setting angle on natural frequencies depend on the rotating speed; influences are not significant at low speed, while they are dramatic on the first frequency at high speed. (4) Effects of the aerodynamic loads on natural frequencies are very little; frequencies derived from the model considering aerodynamic loads are smaller than those from the model neglecting aerodynamic loads; relative errors of the results corresponding to two models ascend with the increase of the absolute value of the setting angle.

The T-DBLs are formed by the first T-shaped dielectric layer and the second dielectric layer. A lot of holes are accumulated on the top interface of the second dielectric layer, which compensates for the charge imbalance of the surface N and P pillars, thus the substrate-assisted depletion (SAD) effect is eliminated in the new device. The electric field of the second dielectric buried layer, E-12, is enhanced by the interface charges, and the breakdown voltage V-breakdown is increased E-12 = 515 V/mu m is obtained in the T-DBL SOI SJ. The V-breakdown of the new device is increased from 124V of the conventional SOI SJ to 302V with a 15 mu m length drift region. The specific on-resistance (R-on,R-sp) of the T-DBL SOI SJ is only 0.00865 Omega.cm(2) and the FOM (FOM=V-breakdown(2)/R-on,R-sp) is 10.54MW/cm(2).

J	Chen, JN; Li, GP				Chen, Jiaona; Li, Guoping			Diurnal variations of ground-based GPS-PWV under different solar radiation intensity in the Chengdu Plain	JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS			English	Article						Ground-based GPS; Precipitable water vapor; Radiation intensity; Diurnal cycle	PRECIPITABLE WATER-VAPOR	The estimated zenith total delays (ZTD) in Chengdu are calculated from the ground-based GPS data using the GPS analytic software package. The 30-min interval precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from GPS is calculated based on meteorological data observed at automatic weather stations (AWS). Combining the daily global solar radiation and sunshine data, characteristics of GPS-PWV in both strong and weak solar radiation days are analyzed. The relationship between GPS-PWV and surface temperature is also investigated. The results show that the GPS-PWV under weak radiation is larger than that under strong radiation. dPWV (the difference between PWV under the weak and strong radiation days) and dQ (the difference of global radiation) are positively correlated. Without precipitation, dPWV is distinct in the daytime. During the daytime with strong radiation (sunny day), GPS-PWV is negatively correlated with temperature. The GPS-PWV declines mainly after sunrise. While temperature reaches its daily maximum, the GPS-PWV reaches its minimum. During the daytime of weak radiation (cloudy day), GPS-PWV and temperature are positively correlated. Accompanying the temperature rise after sunshine, GPS-PWV increases gradually. However, variation of GPS-PWV is lagged to the variation of temperature due to the greenhouse effect of water vapor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a novel and robust method for automatic vehicle detection using aerial images over highway was presented. In the method, a GIS road vector map was used to constrain the vehicle detection system to the highway networks. After the morphological structure element was identified, we utilized the grayscale opening transformation and grayscale top-hat transformation to identify hypothesis vehicles in the light or white background, and used the grayscale closing transformation and grayscale bot-hat transformation to identify the hypothesis vehicles in the black or dark background. Then, targets with large size or covering a large area were sieved from the hypothesis vehicles using an area threshold that is much larger than a typical vehicle. Targets, whose width is narrower than the diameter of structure element utilized in the grayscale morphological transformation, were smoothed out from the hypothesis vehicles using binary morphological opening transformation. Finally, the hypothesis vehicles detected in both cases were overlaid. It should be noted that in the detection system, a vehicle could be detected twice by the two approaches. The two identical hypothesis vehicles should be amalgamated into a single one for accuracy assessment subsequently. We tested our system on seventeen highway scenes of aerial images with a spatial resolution of 0.15 x 0.15 m. The experimental results showed that the correctness, completeness, and quality rates of the proposed vehicle detection method were about 98%, 93%, and 92%, respectively. Thus, our proposed approach is robust and efficient to detect vehicles of highway using high resolution aerial images.

J	Chang, Y; Xu, CX; Zhang, SB; Yan, LL				Chang Yan; Xu ChunXiang; Zhang ShiBin; Yan Lili			Quantum secure direct communication and authentication protocol with single photons	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						quantum secure direct communication; single photons; authentication; security	HORNE-ZEILINGER STATE; ENTANGLED STATES; SECRET; HYPERENTANGLEMENT; SCHEME	A quantum secure direct communication and authentication protocol is proposed by using single photons. An information transmission is completed by sending photons once in quantum channel, which improves the efficiency without losing the security. The protocol encodes identity-string of the receiver as single photons sequence, which acts as detection sequence and implements authentication. Before secret message is encoded as single photons sequence, it is encrypted with identity-string of the sender by using XOR operation, which defends quantum teleportation attack efficiently. The base identity-strings of the sender and the receiver are reused unconditionally secure even in noisy channel. Compared with the protocol proposed by Wang et al. (Phys Lett A, 2006, 358: 256-258), the protocol in this study sends photons once in one transmission and defends most attacks including 'man-in-the-middle' attack and quantum teleportation attack efficiently.

Unfortunately, it's hard to obtain the application energy consumption for the end user based on professional measurement devices. Therefore, it is crucial to model the energy consumption of applications to easily understand the application power behavior for end users without external tools. In this paper, a time energy model (TEM) is proposed, which is a regression model to estimate the application energy consumption on real mobile devices. Compared with the component energy model (CEM), TEM uses a time variable to characterize and contain a variety of mobile devices' properties, such as power consumption and performance, to simply, rapidly and accurately estimate the mobile devices' energy consumption during application execution. Based on our TEM, the execution time of an application can be easily measured and obtained as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of TEM, the energy consumptions of three applications are measured by our energy monitor, PowerTutor and a HOIKI 3334 power meter, respectively. The experiment results show that, on average, our TEM can achieve a 1.30% error rate compared to CEM, a 2.88% error rate compared to PowerTutor and a 8.98% error rate compared to HOIKI 3334. Therefore, TEM can help end users rapidly and conveniently predict the applications energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

J	Adu, JH; Gan, JH; Wang, Y; Huang, J				Adu, Jianhua; Gan, Jianhong; Wang, Yan; Huang, Jian			Image fusion based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform for infrared and visible light image	INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Image fusion; Nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT); Regional visual characteristics; Cross-gradient	WAVELET DECOMPOSITION; ICA BASES; CONTRAST; DISCRIMINATION	In this paper, a new method based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is proposed to fuse the infrared image and the visible light image, which will produce a new fused image by which the target can be identified more easily. Firstly, two original images were decomposed into low frequency subband coefficients and the bandpass direction subband coefficients by using NSCT. Secondly, the selection of the low frequency subband coefficient and the bandpass direction subband coefficient is discussed in detail. The low frequency subband coefficients are selected based on the regional visual characteristics. For the selection of bandpass direction subband coefficients, this paper proposes a minimum regional cross-gradient method, and the cross-gradient is gained by calculating the gradient between the pixel of bandpass subbands and the adjacent pixel in the fused image of the low-frequency components. Comparison experiments have been performed on different image sets, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better in both subjective and objective qualities.
