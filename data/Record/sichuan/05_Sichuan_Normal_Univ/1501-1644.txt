The bond dissociation energy (BDE) for removal of the NO2 group in nitroamine molecules with nitro alkyl, and benzoate with nitro alkyl were calculated at the same level. The calculational results of B3LYP/6-31G* and B3P86/6-311G* levels showed that the strength of C-NO2 is weaker than that of N-NO2 bond in nitroamine molecules with nitro alkyl. The weakest bond is the C-NO, in these computed molecules. The relationship between the impact sensitivities and the weakest C-NO2 bond dissociation energy values was examined. The results indicate a nearly linear correlation between the impact sensitivity and the ratio of the BDE value to the molecular total energy. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The geometric configurations of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were optimized and verified by means of vibration frequency calculations. A four-step mechanism was proposed for the reaction. The first step was the rate-control step. Two possible pathways in the fourth step were investigated, and the main pathway was identified by comparing their activation and dissociation energies. For comparison, the same calculations were performed to the reaction without the CuI activator. The activation barrier with CuI is 76 kJ mol(-1) smaller than that without CuI. It turns out that CuI can promote the reaction by lowering the activation energy. Our calculations reveal the crucial role of CuI in the reaction and agree well with experimental findings.

By diagonalizing the complete energy matrix, local structure and EPR g factors for Cr3+ ions doped in KA1(MoO4)(2) and RbIn(MoO4)(2) have been investigated, respectively. It is found that the orbit reduction effect is very important to understand the EPR g factors for Cr3+ ions doped in KA1(MoO4)(2) and RbIn(MoO4)(2), and some characteristics of orbit reduction on the EPR g factors are discussed firstly. Simultaneously, by simulating the calculated optical spectra and the EPR spectra data to the experimental results, we obtain the local structure parameters R = 2.043 angstrom, theta = 53.5940 degrees and R = 2.065 angstrom, theta = 56.0434 degrees for Cr3+ ions doped in KA1(MoO4)(2) and RbIn(MoO4)(2), respectively. The calculated results show the local lattice structure of the octahedral Cr3+ centers in KA1(MoO4)(2) and RbIn(MoO4)(2) exhibit an elongation and a compression distortions, respectively.

To discuss the possibility of N5H5 isomers as candiate of energetic materials, energies and heats of formation were calculated by the G3B3 method. The results indicated that chain isomers were the most stable isomers and the isomer containing a tetrazetinyl group was the most unstable isomer. The existence of N=N double bonds were beneficial to their stabilities. The formation heats of all conformers were positive, and isomer El had the highest formation heat. In addition, at 6-311++G * * level by the B3LYP method the molar volume of N5H5 was estimated, and from the density formula: rho=M-T/V-mol, we could know that the density of E1 was the largest.

J	Wang, WX; Liu, HJ; Wang, YD; Yang, Y; Liu, DS				Wang Wenxing; Liu Huajie; Wang Yiding; Yang Yang; Liu Dongsheng			Circular dichroism study on the stability of mismatched G-quadruplex	ACTA POLYMERICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						G-qudruplex; circular dichroism; telomere; DNA	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; DNA QUADRUPLEX; SELECTIVITY; POLYMERS; REPEAT; SODIUM	It is hell reported that human telomeric DNA sequence [AGGG(TTAGGG)(3)] can form a well-defined quadruplex structure with the hydrogen bonds between guanine bases in the appearance of K+ and Na+. It was reported that the formation and stability of the structure was meaningful for both gene regulation and apoptosis. In this study,the replacement of guanine bases in this sequence with thymine,adenine and cytosine at different position was carried out respectively. Their ability to form G-quadruplex as well as the G-quadruplex stability has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. All oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Saibaisheng company. The concentrations of the oligonucleotides, expressed in singlestrand molarity,were determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using a 'nearest-neighbor' approximation. Circular dichroism experiments were performed on a JASCO model J-810 circular dichroism spectrapolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. All samples (10 mu mol/L in 10 mmol/L tris-HCl buffer containing 100 mmol/L NaCl at pH 7) were preheated to 95 degrees C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature prior to measurements. A 1 mm path length cell was used for all measurements, and each spectrum was an average of five scans at 5 degrees C. The G-quadruplex solutions were recorded in the 5 degrees C to 95 degrees C temperature range, using a scan rate of 0.5 K min(-1) and following the variation of CD absorption at its peak around 295 nm. Analysis of the thermal curves was performed by using the software origin. Van't Hoff thermodynamic analysis was carried out fur the intramolecular G-quadruplex oligonucleotides. Their thermal reversibility ( superimposable heating and cooling profiles) allowed the calculation of the value of the equilibrium constant ( K) assuming a two-state model. Application of the Van't Hoff equation (In K = - Delta H/RT + Delta S/R) yielded to the determination of the enthalpy (Delta H) a:ad entropy (Delta S) of the process, as described elsewhere. Results show that the replacement of guanine bases in the middle of the three stacking quartets brings the biggest influence on the stability of the formed G-quadruplex. Data also show that potassium ions bring more stability than sodium ions to the formed G-quadruplex in most cases. It is very interesting to find that,when guanine base is replaced by cytosine or adenine at specific sites,the formed structure has comparable or even higher stability as the original sequence.

Three segments, separated by two discontinuities, appear in the VL pH (shock pressure) plot. Analyses show that the first discontinuity at about 64 GPa, with a sharp increase of VL of about 21%, is judged to be a phase transition from enstatite to Pbmn perovskite (PV); while the second one at about 83 GPa, with a dramatic decrease of VL of about 23%, is likely caused by a subtle structural change from Pbnm PV to tetragonal PV, accompanied by material strength softening clue to melting of oxygen sublattices. This strength softening evidence is obtained first from shock wave experiments, and probably has profound implications for probing into the origin of low seismic velocity anomaly in the Earth's lower mantle and thus constraining the geophysical and geochemical models for the Earth's lower mantle.

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we determine the pressure dependence of the band gap of perfect Al2O3 to 220GPa, and investigate the optical absorption of Al2O3 without and with oxygen and aluminum vacancies within 220GPa. Our results indicate that: 1) the onset of the conductivity increase is attributed to a band-gap decrease due to the Rh2O3(II)-CaIrO3 transition at similar to 130GPa and similar to 1500 K; 2) this transition is not responsible for the transparency loss, but heterogeneous absorption in the visible-light region, induced by the +2 charge oxygen vacancy, should be a source of this phenomenon. The calculations of perfect MgSiO3, a material analogous to Al2O3, suggest that a perovskite to post-povskite transition in MgSiO3 at similar to 125GPa and similar to 2500K also yields a band-gap reduction. This causes an increase in electrical conductivity in MgSiO3 at pressure-temperature conditions of the Earth's D '' layer. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2008.	[He, L.; Jing, F.

The observed miscibility characteristics of the two-dimensional (2D) assembly structures could enable studies on the heterogeneous molecular interfaces of guest-host architectures. In addition, it could be envisioned that large cavity networks should be beneficial for studying the clustering behavior of molecular aggregates of similar or dissimilar species, chemical interactions in nanometre scale constrained areas, as well as the design of complex molecular architectures.

The propagation of M x N Gaussian beams through atmospheric turbulence and M x N H-G beams in free space are treated as special cases of our general result. The power in the bucket (PIB), beta-parameter and Strehl ratio are chosen as the parameters characterizing the beam quality in the far field. The dependence of PIB, beta-parameter and Strehl ratio of M x N H-G beams through atmospheric turbulence on the refraction index structure constant C-n(2), beam numbers M, N, mode indices m, n and separate distances x(d), y(d) is illustrated numerically and interpreted physically. It is found that M x N H-G beams are less sensitive to the effects of turbulence than M x N Gaussian beams.

Numerical calculations show that the valence band extends to a larger range while the conduction band acts to the contrary, as the strength of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping interaction increases. The width of the Peierls gap and the number of the bound states trapped in have almost no changes. If the coupling strength beta<0.15, the transition energy from the lower gap level to the higher one for a combined electron-polaron matches the long-lived 1.5 eV photoinduced absorption peak [J.M. Leng, R.P. McCall, K. R. Cromack, Y. Sun, S.K. Manohar, A.G. MaeDiarmid, A.J. Epstein, Phys. Rev.

Plants were supplied with NO3- and two amino acids (AA), glutamic acid (Glu), and glutamine (Gln), at six NO3--N/AA-N molar ratios: (1) 100:0, (2) 80:20, (3) 60:40, (4) 40:60, (5) 20:80, (6) 0:100. The total N concentration was 12.5 mmol/L for all treatments in nutrient solutions. Both AAs reduced plant growth with decreasing NO3--N/AA-N ratios, but the reduction was for Gln than for Glu. At 80:20 NO3--N: Gln-N ratio, the Gln had no significant effect on pakchoi fresh weights. Decreasing NO3--N/AA-N ratios reduced NO3- concentrations in the plant, regardless of AA sources. Adding an appropriate portion of AA-N to nutrient solutions for hydroponic culture increased concentrations of N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in pakchoi shoots. Substituting 20% or less of NO3--N with Gln-N in hydroponic culture will increase the pakchoi quality by reducing NO3- concentration and increasing mineral nutrient concentrations in shoots without significant reduction of crop yields.

The influence of turbulence on the spreading of partially coherent H-G beams is studied quantitatively by examining the mean-squared beam width. It is found that the smaller the coherence length sigma(0) of the source is, and the larger the beam order m and the wavelength lambda are, the less partially coherent H-G beams are affected by the turbulence, although the beams with smaller sigma(0), larger m, and larger lambda have greater spreading in free space. In addition, it is shown that two partially coherent H-G beams may generate the same angular spread and that there exist equivalent partially coherent H-G beams that may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in turbulence.

The mean-squared width of polychromatic GSM beams in turbulence is derived by using the effective source and the strong fluctuation models. It is shown that the same result is obtained using both the models. The diffraction, atmospheric turbulence and beam polychroism result in a spreading of polychromatic GSM beams. If the scaling law fails, the spreading of polychromatic GSM beams increases with increasing bandwidth F, but the influence of F on the spreading of polychromatic GSM beams becomes small as the structure constant C-n(2) of the refractive index and spatial correlation parameter a increase. The spreading of polychromatic GSM beams increases as C-n(2) increases and alpha decreases. Spatially partially coherent polychromatic beams are less sensitive to the effects of atmospheric turbulence than spatially fully coherent polychromatic beams. (C) 2007 Elsevier GrnbH.

First, a cobalt layer of similar to 15 nm with a Si cap layer with a different thickness deposited onto the Si surface with a thin silicon oxide buffer is applied to investigate the formation of CoSi2 by ex situ rapid thermal annealing. It was found that a 13 nm thick Si cap layer could significantly improve the crystal quality of oxide-mediated CoSi2 film. Setting the Si cap thickness at 13 nm, we revealed that introduction of Ni can further improve the crystal quality of the silicide film in comparison to the pure Co silicide, and a ratio of Ni to Co at round 1:8 causes the lowest sheet resistance, similar to 5 Omega/sq.

The two-dimensional (2D) assemblies of these molecules deposited an a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface are identified with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Structures with large cavities are formed by symmetric molecules, while uniform and closely packed stripe-assembled structures are obtained for asymmetric molecules. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results support the observation of an ordered hexagonal columnar mesophase for symmetric molecules and a rectangular columnar mesophase for asymmetric molecules. The study demonstrates that the substitution symmetry has significant effects on the assembly characteristics of molecular architectures and also on the three-dimensional (3D) macroscopic properties of the molecular materials.

Four classes of systems of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium problems are introduced and studied in FC-spaces. The notions of C-i(x)-FC-quasiconvexity, C-i(x)-quasiconvexity and C-i(x)-quasiconvexity-like for set-valued mappings are introduced in FC-spaces. By applying these notions and the equilibrium existence theorems for generalized games obtained in the author's preceding paper, some new existence theorems of solutions for these systems of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium problems are established in noncompact product FC-spaces. These results improve and generalize some recent results in literature to product FC-spaces without any convexity structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their structures were characterized by H-1 NMR, IR spectra and elemental analysis. Their mesomorphism was investigated with differential scanning calorimetry and polarizing optical microscopy. The result showed that all these triphenylene derivatives exhibited enantiotropic hexagonal columnar mesophases. DSC investigations showed that the clearing points of the triphenylenes containing phenylpropionyloxy la similar to 1f gradually decreased with n from 4 to 9. The compound 1g containing phenylpropenoyloxy has almost the same clear point with, but lower melting point and crystallization point and wider columnar mesophase range than its counterpart compound 1c.

Similar to P. shangchengensis, H. yunanicus has a diploid chromosome number of 64, with five large pairs, six medium pairs, and 21 microchromosome pairs. In both H. yunanicus and P. shangchengensis, the vomerine teeth are arranged in two arched series, the lacrimals do not reach the orbits but are in touch with the external nares, and a gap between the pterygoid and maxillary is always present. The two species not only clustered together on a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data but also share an identical haplotype. Therefore, H. yunanicus is not a valid species but a synonym of P. shangchengensis.

We examine the dependence of the stability on the long-range nonlinear interaction of spin waves excited at different lattice sites. The long-range nonlinear spin coupling in the optical lattice is due to light-induced and static magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between atoms. We compare the spin wave dynamics in an atomic spin chain of spinor BECs formed in an optical lattice with that in a Heisenberg-like spin chain in solid-state physics. This reveals the important differences of the spin chain with long-range spin coupling from that with the short-range one.

These systems use very low transmission power, spread over a bandwidth of several gigahertz. The very low transmission power and the large bandwidth used, enable UWB radio systems to co-exist with other narrowband systems over the same frequency band without interfering the narrowband systems. Nevertheless, these narrowband systems may cause interference which may jam the UWB receiver completely. Since standard narrowband interference suppression techniques are not applicable, techniques for interference suppression have to be developed. In this paper, the method of the local polynomial estimator in time-hopping impulse radio (TH-IR) for UWB communication is considered, which should not estimate any parameter of channel. And the narrowband interference (NBI) is modeled as a stationary process. Theoretical analysis of this algorithm reveals that it can eliminate the narrowband interference almost completely and can be computed by simple expression. Moreover, the sampling rate is very low.

The target compounds were characterized with 600 MHz H-1 NMR and elemental analysis. Their mesomorphic properties were studied with polarizing optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that all of these dimesogens exhibited a cholesteric phase. For these dimesogens containing terminal alkoxy chain (X=OCnH2n+1), some also showed the smectic A phase. And it was discovered that, as the length of terminal alkoxy chain increased, the clearing points of these dimesogens decrease slowly, but the entropy change (Delta S=Delta H/T) of these dimesogens from the cholesteric phase to isotropic liquid had an obvious odd-even effect. At the same time, the influences of the terminal substituent group X on the stability of the cholesteric phase were studied and it was discovered that the sequence of stability was: MeO > Cl > Br > Me > F. The results confirmed that the chancre of the terminal substituent group has a remarkable influence on the phase transition temperatures as well as the mesomorphic behavior.

Firstly we point out that every fuzzy relation R is always generally a-decomposable, and give an algorithm to construct Q and T with R = Q alpha T for a given R. Secondly, we show that the general content rho(R) with rho(R) = min{vertical bar Z vertical bar : R = Q alpha T, Q epsilon F(X x Z), T epsilon F(Z x Y)j is equal to the chromatic number of the simple graph F-R generated by R. Therefore, finding an exact algorithm for calculating rho(R) is an NP-complete problem. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The numerical simulation shows that, in contrast to purely QWS-DFB laser, the enhanced dynamic single-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) can be reached by QWS-CG-DFB laser. Under the smaller biasing current, the modulation band-width in presence of chirped grating is narrower, this difference shrinks for larger biasing current. For large signal modulation, the chirped grating is helpful to increase the output extinction ratio, but worsens the frequency chirping. The good dynamic characteristic can be obtained by selecting system parameters reasonably. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this report, biphenylyl 4-perfluorohexylbenzoate liquid crystalline compounds ROC6H4C6H4O2CC6H4C6F13 and C3H7C6H4C6H4O2CC6H4C6F13, (R=CnH2n+1, n=6, 8, 10, 12, 16) have been synthesized. Their mesogenic behavior was investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). The results showed that the alkyl chain compounds exhibited nematic phases with higher melting points, lower clearing points, therefore narrower mesophase temperature ranges. The perfluoroalkyl chain containing molecules showed highly ordered smectic phases with lower melting points, higher clearing points and broader mesophases.

Analytically we obtained the criteria for the MI of nonlinear coherent spin waves and its relation with the long-range nonlinear spin coupling. We analysed the MI in the case of blue-detuned and red-detuned opctical lattice respectively. It was found that the long-range nonlinear spin coupling in the optical lattice is due to light-induced and static magnetic field-induced dipole-dipole interaction.

Theoretical investigation on its FWM characteristics has been carried out by using the traveling wave and carrier rate equations combined with nonlinear dynamics of carrier density pulsation (CDP), carrier heating (CH), and spectral-hole burning (SHB). The stable mode-locked conjugate pulse with short-duration high-repetition frequency can be obtained by the PMLL. The pedestal-free conjugate pulse has narrower width and larger amplitude jitter compared with the pump wave. Smaller absorption recovery time is helpful to extend the stable conjugate output regime. There exists a down-limit for absorption recovery time to avoid self-pulsation (SP) instability. The larger injection current is required for smaller absorption recovery time to reach the given conversion efficiency. The larger conversion efficiency and narrower conjugate pulse can be obtained by proper design of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) coupling strength. The DBR bandwidth must be designed to be within signal-pump detuning to avoid resonance-induced conjugate pulse distortion. The FWM in PMLL has considerable potential such as demultiplexing in optical time-division multiplexing systems.

Relation between giant magnetoresistance and interlayer exchange coupling in the magnetic multilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							CU LAYERS; SUPERLATTICES; OSCILLATIONS; ENHANCEMENT; FE; DEPENDENCE; PERIOD; FE/CR	In this paper, we reveal the relation between the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect and the phase of interlayer exchange coupling. A factor (alpha) drawn from the phase shift of interlayer exchange coupling can well account for the GMR of ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic (FM/NM) multilayers. It is shown that the achievable maximum GMR value generally occurs to the FM/NM multilayered structure with the alpha value approaches 1.0. The result presented in this work is highly relevant in the search for the multilayered ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic system possessing high GMR.

The existence of uniform global error bound has been carefully studied in Burke and Tseng (SIAM J. Optim. 6(2), 265-282, 1996) which unifies and extends many existing results. Our results on the uniform global error bound (see Theorem 3.2) generalize Theorem 9 in Burke and Tseng (1996) by weakening the constraint qualification and by widening the varying range of the parameter. As an application, the existence of global error bound for convex multifunctions is also discussed.

In particular, we find that the oscillatory behavior and phase singularities of the spectral degree of coherence may appear when partially coherent flat-topped beams propagate through the turbulent atmosphere; this behavior is very different from the behavior of Gaussian Schell-model beams. But the oscillatory behavior becomes weaker with increasing turbulence and even disappears when the turbulence is strong enough. The width of the spectral degree of coherence is always smaller than that of the spectral density in the far field when the turbulence is strong enough, whereas the width of the spectral degree of coherence in free space can be either larger or smaller than that of the spectral density in the far field.

The spectral shifts and the transition height decrease as the turbulence increases and the lower-order spectral switch may disappear.

The design method for detuning adjustment according to input power level and expected on-off ratio is also provided. The results display that, for tapered NLBG, the broad operation range and greater on-off ratio can be achieved by using larger taper slope; there exists an optimization range of chirp coefficient for chirped NLBG; the operation range boundary is shifted toward lower input power with the increased detuning; and the tapered NLBG is more preferable to obtain the larger on-off ratio and wider operation range simultaneously compared with chirped NLBG.

When 20% of nitrate-N was replaced with arginine (Arg) compared to the full nitrate treatment, pak-choi shoot fresh and dry weights increased significantly (P <= 0.05), but when 20% of nitrate-N was replaced with alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), proline (pro), phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), lysine (Lys), glycine (Gly), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), cysteine (Cys), and tyrosine (Tyr), shoot fresh and dry weights decreased significantly (P <= 0.05). After replacing 20% of nitrate-N with asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln), shoot fresh and dry weights were unaffected. Compared to the full nitrate treatment, amino acid replacement treatments, except for Cys, Gly, histidine (His), and Arg, significantly reduced (P <= 0.05) nitrate concentrations in plant shoots. Except for Cys, Len, Pro, and Met, total N concentrations in plant tissues of the other amino acid treatments significantly increased (P <= 0.05). Amino acids also affected total P and K concentrations, but the effects differed depending on individual amino acids. To improve pak-choi shoot quality, Gln and Asn, due to their insignificant effects on pak-choi growth, their significant reduction in nitrate concentrations, and their increase in macroelement content in plants, may be used to partially replace nitrate-N.

In addition, nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to discuss bond natures and orbital interactions. The two simplified models of single ZnO with hydroxyl group and double ZnO with hydroxyl group have been used in the research respectively. The results of two different levels indicated that the reaction mechanism and the change trend of correspondence energy were consistent, and the reaction which was catalyzed by double ZnO with hydroxyl group was easier to occur.

To obtain more accurate energy information, energy calculations were carried out at QCISD(T)/6-3 11 G(d,p) basis set. The twenty-one isomers were divided into four kinds of chain compounds: A of straight chains, B with one side chain, C with two side chains, and D with three side chains. The numbers of stable structures of A, B, C and D are 2, 12, 6 and 1, respectively. And the more stable isomers for each sort are B2-1, B2-3 and C23-2, respectively. The isomers of the chain N8H8 involving N = N were found more stable.

The effect of the dispersive solvents acetonitrile (ACN) and cyclohexane (CH), the cross-linkers ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) and trimethylpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM), and the template on particle size and morphology of polymers was investigated in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and BET adsorption isotherm determination. When used as HPLC stationary phase, the microspheres exhibited strong affinity for the template DEHP with an imprint factor (IF) higher than 8.0 in ACN/water (60:40, v/v) as mobile phase. Furthermore, baseline separation of DEHP from benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) could be achieved. In contrast, no or only poor separation could be observed with non-imprinted polymeric polymers (NIPs) or imprinted bulk polymers (MIB), respectively. Similarly, the obtained MINs exhibited an imprinting effect in pure ACN, i.e. the bond amount of DEHP was significantly higher compared to NIPs, as was shown in rebinding experiments. Besides their use as an HPLC stationary phase, MIMs might further be applicable for SPE sample cleanup, while MINs could be used as a recognition layer on sensor surfaces.

Usually the area to be reclaimed is drained first and some of the mud is air-dried for a few weeks before it is buried by fill. After reclamation, the terrestrial groundwater, which is relatively acidic and with high dissolved oxygen, gradually displaces the seawater, which is alkaline with high salinity. The changes in the burial conditions of mud and the properties of the pore water in the mud may induce the release of some heavy metals into the mud. Field survey confirms that the pH and salinity of the groundwater in the reclamation site are much lower than the seawater. Chemical analyses of mud and groundwater samples collected from the reclamation sites reclaimed in different years indicate that most of the heavy metals in the mud decrease gradually with time, but the heavy metals in the groundwater are increased. The release of heavy metals into pore water due to reactivation of heavy metals in the mud is of environmental concern. To understand why some of the heavy metals can be released from the mud more easily than others, a sequential extraction method was used to study the operationally determined chemical forms of five heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in the mud samples. Heavy metals can be presented in five chemical forms: exchangeable, carbonate, Fe-Mn oxide, organic, and residual. Ni and Pb were mainly associated with the Fe-Mn oxide fraction and carbonate fraction; Zn was mainly associated with organic fraction and Fe-Mn oxide fraction, while Cu and Cd were associated with organic fraction and carbonate fraction, respectively. If the residual fraction can be considered as an inert phase of the metal that cannot be mobilized, it is the other four forms of heavy metal that cause the noticeable changes in the concentration of heavy metals in the mud. On the basis of the speciation of heavy metals, the mobility of metals have the following order: Pb (36.63%) > Cu (31.11%) > Zn (20.49%) > Ni (18.37%) > Cd (13.46%). The measured metal mobility fits reasonably well with the degree of concentration reduction of the metals with time of burial observed in the reclamation site.

In order to form the desired surface morphology and crystal structure, a mild oxidizing agent, NaClO, seems to be the key to the high crystallinity. In alkaline solution, the molybdenum substrate can gradually convert MoO42- ions, combined with Ba2+ ions which have a poor migration just depending on thermal motion to form a film. XRD and SEM results indicate that the films have single phase and uniform surfaces. FA results reveal that the films appear to have scintillating luminescent character when they are under different excitations at room temperature. Further, the excitation and emission wavelengths comply with a linear relationship which will be a potential technological application of BaMoO4 in a variety of optical devices.

The numerical simulation indicates that, compared with purely QWS-DFB laser, the better dynamic single-mode can be achieved by QWS-DCC-DFB laser; Under the smaller biasing current, the modulation band-width is narrower, this difference shrinks for larger biasing current; For large-signal modulation, the distributed coupling coefficient is helpful to increase the output extinction ratio, but worsens the wavelength chirping. The good dynamic characteristic can be obtained by selecting system parameters reasonably. QWS-DCC-DFB laser would have potentials in optics communications because of better dynamic SMSR.

The harmonic frequencies of all the structures are calculated. The results show that the transition states of the tautomerism are four-membered ring conformations in gas phase, whereas six-membered ring conformations in water and methanol. In the first proton transfer, the activation energy Delta E-# is 69.9 and 62.0 kJ/mol for water and methanol, respectively, which is much lower than that in gas phase (189.7 U/mol). Water and methanol molecules produce an important catalytic effect in the tautomerism, especially for methanol system. The AIM and NBO analyses show that there exists an H-bonding complex between the cyanuric acid and the water (methanol). By viewpoints of the reaction enthalpy and reaction rate, keto-enol tautomerism in water and methanol systems is easier than that in gas phase. The keto-enol tautomerisms are endothermic both in gas phase and in water and methanol, so the enol forms are less stable than the keto ones. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigate the effects of the coherent fields, the dissipation as well as the incoherent coupling on the following dynamical properties of the system: photon transfer, reversible decoherence, and quantum state transfer, etc. We find that the photons in the cavities do not leak completely into the environment due to the collective coupling between the cavities and the enviroment, and the photons are transferred irreversibly from the cavity with more photons to the cavity with less ones due to the incoherent coupling so that they are equally distributed among the two cavities. The coherent field pumping on the two cavities increases the mean photons, complements the revived magnitude of the reversible decoherence, but hinders the quantum state transfer between the two cavities.

To investigate both the hydrogen bonding and the ordering in the symmetrical and asymmetrical triphenylene discotic liquid crystals, quantum chemical ONIOM (B3LYP(6-3lG(d,p) : UFF) calculations were performed on C18H6(OC2H5)3(OCH2CONHCH3)3 and C18H6(OC2H5)(3)(OCH2COOCH3)(3)- In the optimized structures of the dimers, the distances between the pi-pi stacked triphenylene cores are calculated to be about 0.35 nm, in good agreement with the experimental X-ray result. A C=O center dot center dot center dot H-N hydrogen bond is formed between two triphenylene derivatives containing amide group, which are optimized at r(N-H center dot center dot center dot O)=0.301 nm, a near-optimum length for such an H-bond. The results show that, for compounds containing amide group, the symmetrical compounds have bigger interaction energy and higher rotation energy barrier than their correcponding asymmetrical ones due to more H-bonds formation for the forrner. And the compounds containing amide group have bigger interaction energy and higher rotation energy barrier than ones containing ester group due to the formation of H-bonds for the former. We predict a significant increase in the charge mobility when going fromC(18)gH(6)(OC5H1)(3)(OCH2CONHC4H9)(3) to C18H6(OC5H1)(3)(OC3H6CONHC4H9)3 because the rotational angle betwee two adjacent discs in the stack of the latter by optimizing is of 10.1 degrees, which is much less than that of the former 42.6 degrees.

Soliton excitations in pernigraniline-base polymer: Effects of next-nearest-neighbor hopping	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						polymer; electron-phonon interaction	NEUTRAL SOLITONS; POLYANILINE; DISORDER; POLARONS	Next-nearest-neighbor hopping interaction is considered to investigate the soliton excitations in a pernigraniline-base polymer on the basis of the Baranowski-Buttner-Voit model. Numerical calculations show that the valence band (VB) expands to a larger range and the conduction band (CB) acts to the contrary. For a positive combined soliton, some new shallow levels emerge at the top edge of both the VB and CB with the increase in the next-nearest-neighbor coupling strength. For a negative combined soliton, only one bound state (the soliton state) appears in the Peierls gap and no other shallow levels exist. We find that, while the coupling strength beta takes the value 0.04, the calculated charged soliton excitations (1.15 eV for S+ and 1.34 eV for S-) are in good agreement with the low-energy photo-induced absorption peak (1.0 and 1.3 eV).

In order to investigate the influence of semi-fluorinated chain on mesomorphism of disctoic molecules, a series of new triphenylene derivatives C18H6(OCnH2n+1)(5)(OCOC2H4C6F13) with a semi-fluorinated chain, and their hydrocarbon analogues, C18H6(OCnH2n+1)(5)(OCOC8H17), n=4 similar to 9, were synthesized. Studies of DSC and POM texture observations revealed that these triphenylene derivatives showed enantiotropic hexagonal columnar mesophases. Compared with the hydrocarbon ester chain, the semi-fluorinated ester chain increased the melting points and clearing points, and stabilized the columnar mesophase of triphenylene discogens.

Based on the unified theory of coherence and polarization, the expressions for the spectrum and the degree of polarization of polychromatic partially coherent EChG beams in the turbulent atmosphere are derived, and the conditions for keeping polarization invariance and for determining the position where the degree of polarization becomes zero along the propagation path are also given. It is shown that the normalized spectrum is close to the normalized source spectrum due to turbulence. The reasonable physical explanation of spectral shift is given. On the other hand, the bandwidth does not affect the degree of polarization, and the degree of polarization tends to the value at the source plane due to turbulence in the long-propagation distance limit. The spectrum and polarization of polychromatic electromagnetic Gaussian Schell-model (EGSM) beams and electromagnetic Gaussian (EG) beams in turbulence are treated as special cases of polychromatic partially coherent EChG beams.

The spectral shift and spectral transition are studied, and reasonable physical explanations are given. It is shown that the spectrum depends on the structure constant of the refractive index, order of the Hermite polynomial, pulse duration and position of the observation point. The on-axis spectrum is blue-shifted, the off-axis spectrum becomes red-shifted with increasing transverse coordinate, and the position with null spectral shift is independent of pulse duration. Furthermore, there exists an off-axis spectral transition when the turbulence. reaches a certain degree. The behavior of the off-axis spectral transition in turbulence is very different from that in free space, which is analyzed in detail.

By applying a coincidence theorem in noncompact FC-space without any convexity structure due to author, a new KKM type theorem is first proved under noncompact setting of FC-spaces. The equivalent relation between the coincidence theorem and the KKM type theorem is also established. As applications of the KKM type theorem, we establish some new existence theorems of solutions for three classes of generalized vector equilibrium problems under noncompact setting of FC-spaces. These theorems improve and generalize many known results in literature.

Their geometric configurations were optimized by ab initio method at B3LYP/6-31G level. Vibrational analyses were performed, and there was no imaginary frequency in their vibrational spectra. On these bases, their electronic spectra were calculated by CIS method at B3LYP/6-31 + G level. The calculated results are basically consistent with the experimental values. In addition, the results also indicate that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding in N-1 compound has formed and the bond length is about 0. 234 8 nm.

Hydrogen bonding stabilized triphenylene discotic liquid crystals with ordered COl(ho) phases and wider mesophase ranges are the goals of present research. In this paper, three series with total of eighteen triphenylene discotic liquid crystalline compounds possessing two different kinds of peripheral chains, which are abbreviated as C18H6(OR)(5)(OCH2COOEt), C18H6(OR)(5)(OCH2COOBu) and C18H6(OR)(5)(OCH2CONHBu), R=C(n)H2(n+1), n=4 similar to 9, were synthesized. The structural characterization of these compounds was carried out with H-1 NMR and elemental analysis. The thermal gravimetry analysis showed that all these compounds had good thermal stability up to 300 degrees C. Their thermotropic liquid crystal properties were studied through polarized optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that, for compounds C18H6(OR)(5)(OCH2CONHBu) and C18H6(OR)(5)(OCH2COOBu), the former has higher melting and clearing points than the latter due to the intra-columnar intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

The geometries and vibration frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were calculated. In addition, the bonding circumstances and orbital interactions were analyzed by natural bond orbital (NBO). The results of two different levels indicated that the mechanism and the corresponding energy changing trend were consistent. The activation process could be divided into C-C bond activation and C-H bond activation, and the C-H bond activation was easier than the C-C bond activation.

Comparison of coherent and incoherent nucleation fields demonstrates that the coherent rotation can take place at very small defect size. The critical size below which the coherent rotation is favorable is roughly the domain wall-width with 3-D soft defects and is smaller for oriented exchange-coupled permanent magnets with planar soft defects. The effect of misaligned grains has also been considered and it is illustrated that the effective anisotropy has to be used very carefully: it can only be used in limited cases and its expression varies as the microstructures change.

The geometries and vibration frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states and products have been calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++ G(d, p) level. Two main pathways, C-C bond activation and C-H bond activation, are identified. In former channel, the rate-limiting step is found to be hydrogen-transferring step with a high barrier of 227 kJ center dot mol(-1). In the C-H bond activation pathway, the second hydrogen-transferring step is the rate-determining step of the whole reaction. The barrier of the step is 71 kJ center dot mol-1. Our results show that the studied reaction would undergo along C-H bond activation pathway to form the products H-2 molecule and Ni center dot center dot center dot ethene complex. The present theoretical work indicates that Ni atom is more active than Ni+ cation in activating ethane.

A strong chemical adsorption on the sapphire(0001) is observed. It is found that interfacial atoms have different diffusivity at 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C. The temperature has a decisive effect on the surface and interface structures of ZnO/alpha-Al2O3(0001) and on the growth mode of ZnO thin films. In the whole process of the adsorption and growth of ZnO, the diffusivity of 0 atoms is higher than that of Zn, and the interlayer diffusion has an important impact on growth of the thin films. There are two growth modes of ZnO on sapphire(0001), which is further demonstrated by theoretical calculation. It can be observed from the calculation that the vacancies of Zn where the atomic layer is near to the alpha-Al2O3(0001) surface is more than that of O atoms.	[Chun, Yang; Li, Y.

The numerical simulation indicates that, larger biasing current and smaller detuning expand the dynamic range of conversion efficiency and extinction ratio, but worsen the frequency chirp. Due to the lasing effect, the peak modulation frequency of extinction ratio and chirp occur at the relaxation oscillation frequency. Good conversion characteristics can be obtained by selecting system parameters reasonably. This configuration would have potentials in optics communications because of its wide-band, high-speed and without pump input.

We use the auxiliary principle technique to suggest a new class of iterative algorithms for solving generalized mixed implicit quasi-equilibrium problems. We also prove that the convergence of the suggested methods requires only the continuity and the partially relaxed strongly jointly pseudomonotonicity. Since generalized mixed implicit quasi-equilibrium problems include equilibrium, variational inequality and complementarity problems as specials, our results represent improvement and generalization of the previously known results.

Then the result of how small the initial data for which the solution exists globally was proved by using the scaling argument.

Eleven key reaction pathways were identified. Although Cl-2 and HCl are generally low in concentration in coal and in the combustion flue gases, owing to their strong oxidizability, these oxidants should be considered for some trace element oxidation. A detailed kinetic modeling consisting of 354 reactions and 64 species especially for tin in combustion-generated flue gases was performed. The quantum chemistry and sensitivity simulations illustrated that the pathways Sn + O-2 = SnO + O and Sn + CO2 = SnO + CO are more significant than the other nine reactions. The present study shows that O-2 and CO2 are the two main oxidants for tin oxidation. (c) 2007 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Band structures, and magnetic and transport properties of La doped two dimensional Sr2CoO4	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Joint Magnetism and Magnetic Materials Conference/International Magnetics Conference	JAN 07-11, 2007	Baltimore, MD	Amer Inst Phys, IEEE, Magnet Soc				In this work, we report on our studies on the band structure calculations, structures, transport, and magnetic properties in two dimensional layer structured perovskite compounds Sr2-xLaxCoO4. Structure refinement results reveal that these compounds crystallized in K2NiF4-type structures with space group I4/mmm. The temperature dependence of resistivity shows a semiconductorlike behavior over a wide range of temperatures, a metal-insulator transition at 240 K, and an upturn at 160 K for the x=1, 1.25, and 0.75 samples. A coercive field is about 1 T for the sample with x=0.75, while it is about 0.05 T for x=0.75 and 0.1 T for the x=1.25 samples. A negative field hysteresis magnetoresistance in close correlation with the coercive field has been observed and can be explained by the grain boundary tunneling effect. The first-principles band structure calculations were carried out for Sr1.5La0.5CoO4 and the results indicate that the system is metallic with a high spin polarization which is responsible for the observed large magnetoresistance.

Self-pinning: Dominant coercivity mechanism in exchange-coupled permanent/composite magnets	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Joint Magnetism and Magnetic Materials Conference/International Magnetics Conference	JAN 07-11, 2007	Baltimore, MD	Amer Inst Phys, IEEE, Magnet Soc			PERMANENT-MAGNETS; MICROMAGNETIC ANALYSIS; NUCLEATION; REMANENCE	Our micromagnetic calculation demonstrates that the dominant coercivity mechanism is self-pinning in most exchange-coupled permanent and composite magnets. Such a pinning is attributed to the change of the intrinsic parameters associated with the phase change at the interface. From this self-pinning some more specific formulas on pinning field can be derived. In particular, for sufficiently large soft grains/defects, the pinning field can be expressed as H(P)=alpha H(K), where H(K)=2k/M(S) is the anisotropy field and alpha depends on the material parameters and micromagnetic structures. For an exchange-coupled Nd(2)Fe(14)B-alpha Fe system with abrupt change of parameters in the interface, alpha approximate to 0.1. Reducing the size of the soft grain will increase the coercivity, while the smooth change of the parameters in the interface will lead to a reduction in the coercivity. Comparison with experimental data justifies our calculation. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

It is found that interfacial atoms have different diffusivity at 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C. The temperature has a decisive effect on the surface and interface structures of ZnO/alpha-Al2O3 (0001) and on the growth mode of ZnO thin films. In the whole process of the adsorption and growth of ZnO, the diffusivity of O atoms is higher than that of Zn, and the interlayer diffusion has an important impact on the homogeneous growth of thin films. There are two growth modes of ZnO on sapphire ( 0001), which is further demonstrated by theoretical calculation. The growth mode at about 400 degrees C has a character of mainly spiral-twisted growth with Zn-hexagonal symmetry structure, and it is favorable for forming the Zn-terminated surface. But in the case of 600 degrees C, a regular in-plane growth is observed, which facilitates the O-terminated surface of the ZnO thin film. It can be observed from the calculation that the vacancies of Zn where the atomic layer is near to the alpha-Al2O3 ( 0001) surface is more than that of O atoms.

Theoretical investigations of the optical spectra and g-shift in CsVX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						optical spectra; g factor; molecular orbital model	FOCK WAVE FUNCTIONS; CRYSTALS; ION; CR2O3; ATOMS; MN2	The paper presents a molecular orbital calculation of the optical spectra and g shift in CsVX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), in which the contribution due to the electrostatic parameter A(0), the Trees correction, the spin-orbit coupling of the central transition metal ion and the ligand are included. In the present calculations, instead of the 10 parameters in the previous works, there are three fitting parameters because the appropriate double-xi function of V2+ is used. The calculated optical spectra and g shift agree well with the available experimental data. This indicates again that the double-C wave functions are the appropriate approximation in the calculation of the electronic structure properties. The results show that the contribution due to the 3s of the ligand and the conjunct action between the center metal ion and the ligand cannot been neglected. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It is difficult to do quantum chemical calculation on so large molecule pairs. Various level calculations have been performed on pairs of benzene derivatives and 1,3,5-benzenetrisamide. The results have been compared with those by high level ONIOM [MP2/6-31G*(0.25):HF/6-31G(d,p)) calculations, finding that the results with ONIOM (HF/STO-3G:AM1:UFF) level calculations are best. The hydrogen bond is dominated by the electrostatic contributions, well covered at the HF/STO-3G level. The stabilization of the stacked molecules was mostly assumed to be due to the dispersion energy, which could be estimated with a UFF method. Triphenyl substituted trimesamide is then optimized at ONIOM (BF/STO-3G:AM1:UFF) level, and the result is in good agreement with the crystallographic data. As an example, 1,3,5-benzenetrisamide. with three pendant hexaalkoxytriphenylene groups has been calculated at ONIOM (BF/STO-3G: AM1:UFF) level. The results reported here supported the previous assumption about good charge transfer property of this liquid crystal.

The calculation results indicate that die compounds have C-1 structure. The carbon and the oxygens in the ester group come into formation of different large pi bonds with the benzene ring and there is a dihedral angle between 60 degrees and 62 degrees because of place blocking and conjugate effects. On this basis, the first vertical excited state electronic transition energy was calculated by time-dependent density function theory (TD-DFT), and lambda(max) was obtained. The computed results show that the length of alkyl chain in the end of stilbazoles has no effect on the structure and electronic spectra.

It is found that in this system, the persistent current depends sensitively on the parity and size of the ring. With the increase of interdot coupling, the persistent current is suppressed due to the enhancing Fano interference weakening the Kondo effect. Moreover, when the spin of quantum dot embedded in the Aharonov-Bohm ring is screened, the persistent current peak is not affected by interdot coupling. Thus this model may be a new candidate for detecting Kondo screening cloud.

Identifications were performed by comparing the retention time, UV and mass spectra of samples with standards or/and earlier publications. The crude methanolic extracts of these plants were assayed directly using LC/MS without any further pretreatment. The proposed method is rapid and reproducible and is useful for characterization and evaluation of different plant flavonoids and CQAs. A total of 41 different flavonoids and 6 CQAs were identified and confirmed by APCI-MS. The main components of three Compositae plants were also compared. Although there exist some similarities in the flavonoidic content of the leaf and flower of C. morifolium, significant variations in their varities and concentrations were observed. Artemisia annua processes substantial amount of alkylated derivatives of flavones and Chrysanthemum coronarium contains only CQAs. These findings suggest that although all the plants studied are from the same Compositae family, their flavonoids and phenolic compositions are markedly different. The proposed method is useful for further chromatographic fingerprinting of plant flavonoids. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Eleven species are found, six of which are reported for the first time. The structures, stabilities, thermochemical properties, and tautomerism between them are studied and discussed. The most stable N4H4 isomer is the straight-chain tetrazene (NH2-N=N-NH2). The results show that N4H4 isomers have high positive heats of formation (Delta H-f298) and are highly energetic. The calculated Delta H-f298 values are about 300-600 kJ/mol. If synthesized, they would be possible candidates of high-energy-density materials (HEMDs). (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the unapertured case, the necessary condition for the focal switch and the expression for the amplitude of the focal switch are derived. It is shown that if the truncation parameter delta <= delta(c) or beam parameter beta <= beta(c), (delta c, beta(c) are the corresponding critical values), there exits only one axial intensity maximum, and the focusing without focal shift can be achieved for u/f = 1 (u is the separation between the aperture and lens, f is the focal length of the lens); if delta > delta(c) and beta > beta(c), there exist two axial intensity maxima, and the focal switch can take place at the turning point u/f = 1 for both apertured and unapertured cases. The dependence of the amplitude of focal switch and normalized axial intensity minimum on the truncation parameter, beam parameter and Fresnel number is also studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

At last we prove the instability of standing wave by combing those results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ji, XL; Zhang, ET; Lu, BD				Ji, Xiaoling; Zhang, Entao; Lu, Baida			Spectral properties of chirped Gaussian pulsed beams propagating through the turbulent atmosphere	JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS			English	Article							PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; FAR-FIELD DIFFRACTION; OPTICAL BEAMS; LIGHT; MEDIA; DEGRADATION; INVARIANCE; APERTURE	The spectral properties of chirped Gaussian pulsed beams propagating through the turbulent atmosphere are studied. The analytical expression for the spectrum, algebraic equation governing the position omega(max) of the maximum spectrum and algebraic equation governing the position r(0) without spectral shift are derived. It is shown that the spectrum at the observation point (r, z) depends on the structure constant of the refractive index C-n(2), chirp parameter C and pulse duration T. The normalized on-axis spectrum S(omega) is blue-shifted, and the off-axis spectrum becomes red-shifted with increasing radial coordinate. The effect of turbulence on the spectral shift of chirped Gaussian pulsed beams becomes smaller with decreasing C and increasing T. The position ro without spectral shift is dependent on omega(0), C-n(2), and z, but independent of T and C. In addition, there exists an off-axis spectral transition of a chirped Gaussian pulsed beam in the turbulent atmosphere. The physical explanations of the spectral shift and spectral transition of chirped Gaussian pulsed beams propagating through the turbulent atmosphere are given.

Various structures of 1,3,5-triazine-(water)(3) and 1,2,4-triazine-(water)(3) complexes are investigated, and the seven and eight stable structures are reported for 1,3,5-triazine-(water), and 1,2,4-triazine-(water),, respectively. Many-body analysis is also carried out to obtain relaxation energy and many-body interaction energy (two-, three-, and four-body), and the most stable conformer has the basis set superposition error corrected interaction energy of -92.09 and -99.53 kJ/mol. The two- and three-body interactions have significant contribution to the total interaction energy, whereas the relaxation energy, four-body interactions are very small for 1,3,5-triazine-(water)(3) and 1,2,4-triazine-(water)(3) complexes.

Replacing of the alkoxy peripheral chains of triphenylene by oxygen-atom containing ester chains would result in novel mesomorphism. A series of mixed tail triphenylenes containing propoxyacetyloxy and alkoxy, abbreviated as C18H6(OCnH2n+1)(3)(OCOCH2OC3H7)(3), n=4-8, and hexa(propyloxyacetyloxy)triphenylene, C18H6(OCOCH2-OC3H7)(6) were synthesized. Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) of three discogens showed that they had good thermal stability till 350 degrees C. The mesomorphism was investigated through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). The preliminary X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of one compound showed that it exhibited ordered hexagonal columnar (Col(ho)) mesophase. These mixed tail triphenylene derivatives possessed much stable Col(ho) mesophase and wider mesophase ranges than their hexaalkoxytriphenylene C18H6(OR)(6) and hexaalkanoyloxytriphenylene C18H6(OCOR')(6) analogues. The asymmetrical compounds 2,6,11-trialkoxy-3,7,10-tri(2-propyloxyacetyloxy)triphenylenes with n=5-8 displayed higher clearing points and wider temperature ranges than their symmetrical isomers 2,6,10-trialkoxy-3,7,11-tri(2-propyloxyacetyloxy)triphenylenes, while C18H6(OCOCH2OC3H7)(6) had the highest clearing point due to the beta-oxygen-atom effect.

The numerical simulation indicates that, the larger biasing current and smaller detuning can expand the dynamic range of conversion efficiency and extinction ratio, but worsen the frequency chirp. Due to the lasing effect, the peak modulation frequency of extinction ratio and frequency chirp occurs at relaxation oscillation frequency. The good conversion characteristic can be obtained by selecting system parameters reasonably. This configuration could have potentials in optical communications because of wideband, high-speed, and no need for pump input.

The geometries and harmonic frequencies of the reactants, intermediates, transition states and products have been calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. The results show that the reaction is very complicated. Nine possible reaction pathways were identified. The results show that the most feasible reaction channel is the hydrogen-transfer pathway CH2CH + HNCS -> IMA1 -> TSA1 -> CH2CHH+ NCS. The pathway VIC C-S addition channel (CH2CH+ HNCS -> TSD5 -> IMD4 -> TSD9 -> CH2CHS + CNH) can also occur easily. Ethene and radical NCS is the main product of the studied reaction, and product P8 (CH2CHS and CNH) may also be observed. Compared with our previous study on the reaction HNCS + CH2CH, the present reaction is easier to proceed.

The geometries of these complexes have been fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-311+G(d) levels. The stabilization energies and charge changes of some atoms have been calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that the catalysis metabolites and water can form stable hydrogen-bonded complexes. Nine complexes are identified. It is important and necessary to add zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) and basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections for calculating stabilization energy. The results also reveal an important relationship between the relative stabilities of hydrogen-bonded complexes and the final products of tirapazamine medication. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A two-layer-ligand model, which includes six F- ions in the first layer and eight next nearest-neighbor K+ ions in the second layer, has been proposed to describe the real ligand-field. By simulating the second-order and fourth-order EPR parameters D and (a - F) simultaneously, a displacement of a K+ ion along C-3-axis towards the Fe3+ ion has been found theoretically, and this displacement will give rise to the distortion of the octahedron constructed by six F- ligand ions in the first layer. Delta Z is used to describe the displacement of a K+ ion along C3-axis towards the Fe3+ ion, and two angles theta(1) and theta(2) between the Fe3+-F- band and C3-axis are taken to describe the local distortion along the [111] direction. By adjusting the Delta Z, the range of the local distortion parameters Delta theta(1) = 5.54 degrees-6.07 degrees, Delta theta(2) = -4.60 degrees to -5.00 degrees are determined, and the EPR spectrum of the KMgF3:Fe3+ system has been satisfactorily explained by the two-layer-ligand model.

In the model, the forces acting on an adsorbate atom from its NN substrate atoms in different layers may be either repulsive or attractive, depending on whether the bond between the adsorbate atom and its NN substrate atoms is compressed or stretched. It is found that the forces on the adsorbate atom from its NN substrate atoms in the sub-surface layer play a more important role for the buckling of surface alloy than those from its NN substrate atoms in the surface layer do. The bucklings expected by the model are significantly smaller than those predicted by the simple hard sphere model and are in good agreement with the experiments when the equilibrium bond length of the NN adsorbate-substrate atom pairs is taken as the sum of the corresponding metal radii.

An S-adenosylmethionine enriching strain S42-12, identified as Candida sp., was chose to develop a SAM-accumulating mutant successfully. The final SAM-accumulating mutant strain YQ-5 was isolated by UV radiation or by NTG treatment using ethionine selection and nystatin selection method. The mutant strain YQ-5 accumulated 112.1 mg per gram biomass, was 3.14-fold higher than the original strain S42-12. When cultivated in the optimal medium with a favourable fermentation conditions, SAM content of the mutant strain reached at 1740 mg L-1. Trend of SAM and ergosterol contents and methionine adenosyltransferase activity of SAM-accumulating mutants during fermentation were analysed. The results suggested that one of the reasons why the mutants accumulated SAM in significantly high amounts may be the lower consumption of SAM for ergosterol biosynthesis, other than improvement of methionine adenosyltransferase activity.

Denote the n x n power GCD (resp. power LCM) matrix on S having the e-th power of the greatest common divisor (x(i), x(j)) (resp. the e-th power of the least common multiple [x(i), x(j)]) as the (i, j)-entry of the matrix by ((x(i), x(j))e) (resp. ([x(i), x(j)](e))). We call the set S an odd gcd closed (resp. odd lcm closed) set if every element in S is an odd number and (x(i), x(j)) epsilon S (resp. [x(i), x(j)] epsilon S) for all 1 <=, i, j <=, n. In studying the divisibility of the power LCM and power GCD matrices, Hong conjectured in 2004 that for any integer e >=, 1, the n x n power GCD matrix ((x(i),x(j))e) defined on an odd-gcd-closed (resp. odd-lcm-closed) set S divides the n x n power LCM matrix ([xi,xj]e) defined on S in the ring Mn(Z) of n x n matrices over integers. In this paper, we use Hong's method developed in his previous papers [J. Algebra 218 (1999) 216-228; 281 (2004) 1-14, Acta Arith. 111 (2004), 165-177 and J.

Optical spectrum and local lattice structure for ruby	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							CRYSTAL FIELDS; IONS; ABSORPTION; COVALENCY; SHIFTS; AL2O3; LINE	By diagonalizing the 120 x 120 complete energy matrices for d(3) ion in trigonal crystal field, which contains the electrostatic interaction, the trigonal field as well as the spin-orbit interaction, the unified calculation of the whole optical and EPR spectra for ruby are made. And matrix elements of the Zeeman energy with the magnetic field parallel or perpendicular to the trigonal axis are introduced into the complete energy matrices for obtaining the g factors of the energy levels. It is concluded that zero-field splitting and optical spectra as well as g factors are in good agreement with the experimental data and the distorted local lattice structure is determined firstly results from a stretching of the O2- ions along the C-3 axis. The pressure-induced shifts of energy levels, g factors and local lattice structure are also discussed. In particular, all the calculations are carried out successfully within the framework of the crystal-field model which is consistent with the opinion of Macfarlane and Sturge that if all terms within the d(3) configuration are included, one need not go outside conventional crystal-field theory.

Temporal change in the landscape erosion pattern in the Yellow River Basin, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						soil erosion; landscape pattern; remote sensing and geographical; information system; Yellow River Basin	LOESS PLATEAU; SATELLITE IMAGES; GIS; POLICY; DELTA; SOIL	Using Landsat TM data from 1995 and 2000, changes in the landscape erosion pattern of the Yellow River Basin, China were analysed. The aim was to improve our understanding of soil-erosion change so that sustainable land use could be established. First, a soil-erosion intensity index model was developed to study soil-erosion intensity change in the study area. Over the 5 years, the areas of weak erosion, moderate erosion, severe erosion, and very severe erosion all increased. The area of weak erosion increased dramatically by 7.94 x 10(5) ha, and areas of slight erosion and acute erosion decreased by 1.93 x 10(6) ha and 4.50 x 10(4) ha, respectively. The results show that while the intensity of soil erosion has gradually been decreasing as a whole, in some regions the soil erosion is becoming more severe. Based on landscape indices, the pattern of changes in soil erosion over the past 5 years was analysed. The changes in landscape pattern of soil erosion resulted from human activities. Analysis showed that human impact increases fragmentation, having three major effects on landscape pattern, reduction in patch area, variations in patch shape, and changes in spatial pattern. In the study area, population growth, farming, governmental policy and forest degradation are the major factors causing soil erosion change over a 5-year period.
