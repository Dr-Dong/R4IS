All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure and no second phases can be detected. After the addition of a small amount of Bi(Zn0.5Ti0.5)O-3 (x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05), the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are improved and the grain growth is promoted. However, excess Bi(Zn0.5Ti0.5)O-3 (x a parts per thousand yen 0.10) retards the grain growth, degrades the ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity, and induces two dielectric anomalies at high temperature. The ceramics can be well sintered at the very wide range of low sintering temperatures (880-980 A degrees C) and exhibit good densification (relative density: 96.2-98.4 %) and strong electric insulation. The increase in the sintering temperature promotes the grain growth and improves the ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 0.05 sintered at 880-980 A degrees C possesses improved ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties with remanent polarizations P (r) of 21.9-28.1 mu m/cm(2), piezoelectric constants d (33) of 125-139 pC/N and planar electromechanical coupling factors k (p) of 30.1-32.4 %, and high Curie temperatures T (C) of 523-565 A degrees C. A weak ferromagnetism with remanent magnetizations M (r) of 0.0411-0.0422 emu/g and coercive fields H (c) of 1.70-1.99 kOe were observed in the ceramics with x = 0-0.025.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Quantitative information architecture, granular computing and rough set models in the double-quantitative approximation space of precision and grade	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Granular computing; Double quantification; Quantitative information architecture; Variable precision rough set; Graded rough set	INCLUSION DEGREE; CLASSIFICATION; MEMBERSHIP; REDUCTION; SYSTEMS; RULES; BETA	Because precision and grade act as fundamental quantitative information in approximation space, they are used in relative and absolute quantifications, respectively. At present, the double quantification regarding precision and grade is a novel and valuable subject, but quantitative information fusion has become a key problem. Thus, this paper constructs the double-quantitative approximation space of precision and grade (PG-Approx-Space) and tackles the fusion problem using normal logical operations. It further conducts double-quantification studies on granular computing and rough set models. (1) First, for quantitative information organization and storage, we construct space and plane forms of PG-Approx-Space using the Cartesian product, and for quantitative information extraction and fusion, we establish semantics construction and semantics granules of PG-ApproxSpace. (2) Second, by granular computing, we investigate three primary granular issues: quantitative semantics, complete system and optimal calculation. Accordingly, six types of fundamental granules are proposed based on the semantic, microscopic and macroscopic descriptions; their semantics, forms, structures, calculations and relationships are studied, and the granular hierarchical structure is achieved. (3) Finally, we investigate rough set models in PG-Approx-Space. Accordingly, model regions are proposed by developing the classical regions, model expansion is systematically analyzed, some models are constructed as their structures are obtained, and a concrete model is provided. Based on the quantitative information architecture, this paper systematically conducts and investigates double quantification and establishes a fundamental and general exploration framework.

Previous research found that American participants, when provided with different accounts of wrongdoing, were comfortable endorsing dispositional explanations of the behavior, but suspected that psychologists were exonerating wrongdoers when they were provided with situational explanations. The current study extends this research by examining the moderating effect of culture on laypeople's perceptions of different explanations of wrongdoing. Chinese and American participants read about two hypothetical studies about wrongdoing and learned that either situational factors or personality variables seemed to account for the behavior. They then made responsibility attributions for the wrongdoer from both their own perspective and from what they perceived was the psychologists' perspective. When given dispositional explanations, both Chinese and Americans reported consistency between their own and what they perceived to be the psychologists' perspectives. However, when given situational explanations, although Chinese participants again reported consistency between their own and the psychologists' perspectives, American participants thought the psychologists were exonerating the wrongdoer. These findings shed light on why social-psychological research sometimes faces skepticism and on cross-cultural variations in how people explain human behaviors. Practical implications of the study include a reminder that when social psychologists package their messages, they should take into account the biases of different targeted audiences.

Structure, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of Ba0.90Ca0.10Ti1-xSnxO3 lead-free ceramics	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						BaTiO3-based; Sn-substitution; Piezoelectricity; Dielectric property	BARIUM-TITANATE CERAMICS; HIGH CURIE-TEMPERATURE; SIZE	Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics Ba0.90Ca0.10Ti1-xSnxO3 have been prepared by a conventional ceramic fabrication technique and the effects of Sn4+ on the structure, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics have been investigated. All the ceramics exhibit a pure perovskite structure. After the substitution of Sn4+, the crystal structure of ceramics is transformed gradually from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic phase, and becomes a pseudo-cubic phase at x >= 0.14. The substitution also decreases the Curie temperature greatly from 138 degrees C at x=0 to 33 degrees C at x=0.12, and shifts the orthorhombic- tetragonal phase transition to higher temperatures. Coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is formed in the ceramic at x=0.10, leading to significant improvements in the piezoelectric properties: d(33)=521 pC/N and k(p)=45.5%. Our results also reveal that the ceramics sintered at higher temperatures contain larger grains, and thus exhibit more noticeable tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition and enhanced ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties.

In this paper, we settle a question raised by Mahdou and Tamekkante in [On (strongly) Gorenstein (semi) hereditary rings, Arab. J. Sci. Eng. 36 (2011) 436] about the coherence of G-hereditary rings. It is shown that a ring R is Gorenstein semihereditary if and only if every finitely generated submodule of a projective module is Gorenstein projective. As a consequence of this result, we have that every G-hereditary ring R is coherent.

We show that if the module M is LCM-stable over a GCD-domain R, then the polynomial module M[X] is LCM-stable over R[X]; if R is a w-coherent locally GCD-domain, then LCM-stability and reflexivity are equivalent for w-finite type torsion-free R-modules. Finally, we introduce the concept of w-LCM-stability for modules over a domain. Then we characterize when the module M is w-LCM-stable over the domain in terms of localizations and t-Nagata modules, respectively. Also we characterize Prufer v-multiplication domains and Krull domains in terms of w-LCM-stability.

Based on an exact analytical and numerical analysis, we demonstrated that the beating of the screened potential as well as the undamped plasmon mode can be taken as fingerprints of a topological phase transition in doped silicene and doped germanene. Thus our proposal here establishes the connection between the topological phase transition and the density oscillations that can be accessed by a variety of experimental techniques.

J	Wan, Y; Zheng, QJ; Lin, DM				Wan Yang; Zheng Qiaoji; Lin Dunmin			Recent Development of LiMnPO4 as Cathode Materials of Lithium-ion Batteries	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA			English	Review						LiMnPO4; Jahn-Teller effect; thermal stability; morphology; synthesis processes; surface coating; doping	CARBON-COATED LIMNPO4; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; LIMPO4 M; THERMAL-STABILITY; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; NANOCOMPOSITE CATHODE; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; SOLVOTHERMAL PROCESS; DEFECT CHEMISTRY	Similar to LiFePO4, LiMnPO4 possesses the following advantages: eco-friendliness, low cost and excellent safety performance. Moreover, high energy density (similar to 700 Wh.kg(-1)) of LiMnPO4 is 20% larger than LiFePO4, which is due to LiMnPO4 with high operating voltage similar to 4.1 V vs. Li falling within the electrochemical stability window of conventional electrolyte solutions. Therefore, LiMnPO4 is considered as a next generation cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. However, the lithium ion conductivity of LiMnPO4 is lower than that of LiFePO4. The main difference between the kinetics in the initial stage of charging of two olivine materials may originate from the formation energy of vacancy-polaron complex in LiMnPO4 than in LiFePO4. In addition, the anisotropic lattice distortion of Mn06 octahedron during repeated charge/discharge process hinders lithium removal/uptake reactions in LiMnPO4 and thus leads to the large volume change. This distortion is not a strict Jahn-Teller effect but is a preferential elongation of two of the equatorial Mn-O bonds (edge-sharing with the PO4). These intrinsic defects result in rapid capacity fading upon extended cycling and poor rate capability during cycles. To overcome these problems, it is an effective approach to prepare nanometer-sized and rod/sheet-like materials through proper synthesis method. These special morphologies in LiMnPO4 can stimulate the rate of Li extraction/insertion. However, the surface structural instability of particles may occur at size d<35 nm. The awkward situation may be solved by effective surface coating. Surface coating can decrease the disorder toward amorphous state and the poison of impurities on the surface of particles; especially, coating can promote the ionic and electronic conductivity. Therefore, a coating leads to a remarkable improvement of the electrochemical performance of LiMnPO4. In addition, doping is also a method for improving the electrochemical property of LiMnPO4. As a Fe-doped material, LiMnyFe1-yPO4 has been widely investigated. In this paper, the recent advances in LiMnPO4 as cathode materials of lithium-ion batteries are reviewed. The characteristics, morphologies, and possible reaction mechanisms of the material were summarized systematically. Some open questions (e.g. the facticity of Jahn-Teller effect in LiMnPO4, the thermal stability of LiMnPO4, etc.) are discussed in detail. Moreover, some improved methods, (controlling the particle morphology, surface coating, and doping) for the electrochemical property of LiMnPO4 are expounded.

Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that both strains were members of the genus Oceanobacillus and most closely related to Oceanobacillus chironomi LMG 23627(T) with pairwise sequence similarity of 96.0%. The isolates contained menaquinone-7 (MK-7) as the respiratory quinone and anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-15:0 as the major fatty acids (>10%). Polar lipids consisted of a predominance of diphosphatidylglycerol and moderate to minor amounts of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The DNA G C content was 38.6-39.2 molok. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain WW1 T displayed 99.7% similarity to that of strain WM-4, and DNA-DNA hybridization between the two strains showed a relatedness value of 91 %. Based on the results of this polyphasic study, strains WM-1(T) and WM-4 represent a novel species in the genus Oceanobacillus, for which the name Oceanobacillus luteolus sp. nov. is proposed.

Cells of strain DX-1(T) were oxidase-positive, catalase-positive and Gram-staining-negative. The strain was found to be rod-shaped and non-Motile and to produce subterminal spores. The strain was able to grow with NaCl at concentrations ranging from 0 to 6%, at temperatures of 25-60 degrees C (optimum 55 degrees C) and pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DX-1(T) formed a cluster with Ureibacillus thermosphaericus DSM 10633(T) (96.9% 16S rRNA sequence similarity), Ureibacillus composti DSM 17951(T) (95.8%), Ureibacillus thermophilus DSM 17952(T) (95.7%) and Ureibacillus terrenus DSM 12654(T) (95.3%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.4 mol%. The major quinone was MK-7, the peptidoglycan type was L-Lys <--D-Asp, and the major cellular fatty acids (>5%) were iso-C-16:0, and iso-C-14:0. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phospholipids of unknown composition. Based on phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic features and results of phylogenetic analyses, the strain was determined to represent a distinct novel species of the genus Ureibacillus, and the name proposed for the novel species is Ureibacillus defluvii sp. nov., with type strain DX-1(T) (=CGMCC 1.12358(T)= KCTC 33127(T)).

A pioneering video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on segmentation and space-time regularisation	IMAGING SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm; Segmentation; Image mosaic; Bilateral total variation; Space-time regularisation	IMAGE REGISTRATION; RESOLUTION	In view of the common existing problems in present video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction, this paper proposes a pioneering video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on segmentation and space-time regularisation to solve these problems. First, a video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on segmentation is proposed to eliminate reconstructed temporal ringing and to improve the times of reconstruction. Second, considering that image mosaic is involved in our proposed reconstruction algorithm, an improved fade-in and fade-out method is proposed to make the mosaic image looks more natural. At last, an improved space-time regularisation algorithm is put forward to remove noise and preserve image edge at the same time. Using several experiments, we prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve state-of-the -art reconstruction effect.	[Guo, L.; He, X. H.; Qing, L.

Many researchers have been studying the objective quality assessment method based on human visual system. Recently, the single-scale feature-similarity index metric has been proposed to provide a good approximation to perceived image quality. However, this metric does not take into account the fact that features in a certain scale cannot reflect various distorted details in the image. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-scale structural image quality assessment based on two-stage low-level features, which supplies more flexible than previous single-scale method by incorporating the variations of viewing conditions and resolution. In this multi-scale framework, different weights are assigned to various scales with different levels of importance. Extensive experiments on the five public benchmark databases indicate that the proposed metric is more consistent with the subjective evaluations than all the other competing methods evaluated.

An R-module M is said to be w-projective if Ext(R)(1)(M, N) is GV-torsion for any torsion-free w-module N. In this paper, we define a ring R to be w-semi-hereditary if every finite type ideal of R is w-projective. To characterize w-semihereditary rings, we introduce the concept of w-injective modules and study some basic properties of w-injective modules. Using these concepts, we show that R is w-semi-hereditary if and only if the total quotient ring T(R) of R is a von Neumann regular ring and R-m is a valuation domain for any maximal w-ideal m of R. It is also shown that a connected ring R is w-semi-hereditary if and only if R is a Pri Her v-multiplication domain.

It is shown that turbulence results in beam spreading, and the effect of spherical aberration on the beam spreading decreases due to turbulence. Gaussian beams with negative spherical aberration are more affected by turbulence than those with positive spherical aberration. For the negative spherical aberration case, the focus position moves to the source plane due to turbulence. It is mentioned that the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability defined by a certain energy (i.e. PIB = 63%) is very heavy when the negative spherical aberration is very heavy. On the other hand, the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability defined by the energy within a given bucket radius (i.e. mean-squared beam width) is heaviest when a certain negative spherical aberration coefficient is adopted.

In this paper, we extend their model to the situation where retailer's delay in payments is permitted by the supplier. We introduce the corresponding inventory game with permissible delay in payments, and prove that its core is nonempty. Then, a core allocation rule is proposed which can be reached through population monotonic allocation scheme. Under this allocation rule, the grand coalition is shown to be stable from a farsighted point of view. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Calculated structures and band gaps of these alloys are in good agreement with available experimental and other theoretical values. Present results show that the prominent peaks of the dielectric functions and absorption coefficients have a slight red shift and the amplitudes become larger with the increasing concentration of Cd and Se. Moreover, present findings predict that Zn1-xCdxS and ZnS1-ySey alloys are promising for solar cells and photoconductor and electroluminescent devices due to their high absorption of solar radiations and photoconductivity in the energy region from visible light to ultraviolet.

The calculated values at zero pressure are in good agreement with experiments and similar theoretical calculations. Among them, the mechanism of the high pressure induced structural phase transition of RhSi has been studied in a detailed fashion. Under compression, the theoretical calculations show that RhSi will undergo a structural phase transition from B31-phase to B20-phase at 5.59 GPa. Based on the semiempirical method of the evaluation of covalent crystal, the hardness H-v of RhSi is estimated under high pressure. Remarkably, the theoretical results suggest that at zero pressure, the hardness value of B31-RhSi is 14.8 GPa and that of B20-RhSi is 19.0 GPa. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Our calculation indicates that the orthorhombic phase with Pnnm symmetry is the most energetically stable one. The other four new dynamically stable phases belong to space groups monoclinic C2/m, orthorhombic Pmmn, trigonal R (3) over barm, and hexagonal P6(3)/mmc. Their mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities are verified by calculating elastic constants, formation enthalpies, and phonon dispersions. We found that all phases are stabilized further under pressure. Above the pressure of about 50 GPa, the formation enthalpy of Pmmn is almost equal to that of P6(3)/mmc phase. The analysis on density of states not only demonstrates that formation of strong covalent bonding in these compounds contributes greatly to their stabilities but also that they all exhibit metallic behavior which does not relate to the approach used. By considering metallic contributions, the estimated Vickers hardness values based on the semiempirical model show that the OsB4-structured FeB4, with a hardness of 48.1 GPa, well exceeding the limitation of superhardness (40 GPa), is more hard than the most stable phase. The others are predicted to be potential hard materials. Moreover, the atomic configuration and strong B B covalent bonds are found to play important roles in the hardness of materials.

The integration of learning styles into an intelligent system is a possible solution to the problems of "learning deviation" and "cognitive overload." In this study, we propose a learning style prediction method based on a pattern recognition technique. The main contributions of this method are: (1) it is a form of middleware that can be applied to other intelligent tutoring systems, and (2) it can process topic-dependent data to make predictions and update learning style profiles in a recursive manner. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of this prediction method.

Without the condition that either H is finite dimensional or the sum of n operators is maximal monotone, we prove that the sequence generated by the proposed method is strongly convergent to an extended solution for the problem, which is closest to the initial point.

On this basis, the excited states geometry structure was optimized by the CIS method, and finally the fluorescence emission spectra were calculated through the TD-DFT method. The results showed that: the four compounds, a large conjugated system, is preferably coplanar structure. Because of introducing hydroxyl and halogen atom on the benzene ring, the molecular pi-electron conjugation is relatively larger, emission wavelength is relatively longer, and fluorescence spectra show different degrees of red shift. As the electron donating group is hydroxy, the fluorescence phenomenon is more obviously red shifted.

Rietveld analysis reveals that the crystal structure changes from one orthorhombic phase with Pbcm space group to another orthorhombic phase with P222(1) space group when increasing x. The morphotropic phase boundary between two different orthorhombic symmetries is formed at 0.14<x<0.18. Excess LiTaO3 causes an abnormal grain growth behavior. The pure NaNbO3 presents four current peaks in the I-E loop, indicating electric-field-induced transitions. A low LiTaO3 doping induces ferroelectricity in the initially antiferroelectric (AFE) NaNbO3. Enhanced ferroelectricity is obtained at x=0.02-0.12. The addition of LiTaO3 makes the ceramics undergo a transition from an antiferroelectricity dominant to a ferroelectricity dominant phase state. The optimum d(33), k(p), Q(m), and P-r values of 46 pC/N, 18.3%, 1333, and 27.1Ccm(-2) are obtained when x equals 0.12, and the ceramic exhibits good temperature stability because of its high T-C.

A methodology of urban eco-security evaluation has been introduced, including a conceptual framework of pressure-state-response (PSR) model, setting-up of the indicator system of urban eco-security evaluation (ISUESE) and empirical research. By virtue of the mean-deviation method, the weight coefficient of every indicator is confirmed. It has been found that the top three indicators are: per capita area of paved road, per capita area of cultivated land and green coverage rate of built-up area, which has a relatively prominent status in he urban ecological security. A calculation procedure of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method is applied in empirical research. The Mianyang statistical data during the period of 2005-2012 shows that eco-security keeps a favorable trend, but criticality security and slight insecurity are dominant. It has also been found that insecurity membership degree (MD) of environment pressure accounts for a very large proportion of total pressure. Membership degrees of criticality security and security in environment state are increasing gradually, and as far as environment response is concerned, security is significantly increased.

Our results indicate that in the weak coupling regime, the AF spin coupling strengthens the Kondo resonance, while the interdot Coulomb repulsion suppresses them for the equilibrium case. In the non-equilibrium case, the AF spin coupling strengthens the Kondo resonance only when J > 2.5T(K)(0), while the interdot Coulomb repulsion does not suppress Kondo peaks. In the strong coupling regime, the bias voltage has no effects on the Kondo resonance in this system, and the AF spin coupling increases the height of Kondo peaks only when J > 2.5T(K)(0). However, the inter-dot Coulomb repulsion suppresses the spin Kondo effect, which induces the orbit Kondo effect. Moreover, the relevant underlying physics of these problems are discussed.

Thus, it is important to detect glass transition temperature (T (g)) with a sensitive and proper method. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is one of the most frequently used methods to determine T (g) due to its advantage of high sensibility. However, there is controversy in the past literatures to determine the proper glass transition temperature among three transition temperatures, i.e., T (g1), T (g2) and T (g3) in the dynamic mechanical spectra, which correspond to the temperature abscissa of intersect value of two tangent lines on storage modulus (E'), the peak of the loss modulus (EaEuro(3)) and the peak of the loss tangent (tan delta). In this work, these three transition temperatures were compared with the glass transition temperature determined by DSC (T (gDSC)). Based on the discussion of different modes of molecular motion around the glass transition region, it is demonstrated that T (g1) and T (g2) have the same molecular mechanism as T (gDSC), i.e., local segmental motion which is enthalpic in nature and determines the proper glass transition temperature, while T (g3) is assigned to the transition temperature of entropic Rouse modes, thus cannot be used as the proper glass transition temperature.

Growth occurred with 0-5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0-1 %) and at pH 5.0-10.5 (optimum pH 8.5) and 4-40 A degrees C (optimum 30 A degrees C) in Luria-Bertani medium. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that strain WM-2(T) is a member of the genus Pseudomonas and most closely related to P. guguanensis, P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis, P. toyotomiensis, P. alcaliphila and P. mendocina with 97.1-96.6 % sequence similarities. In terms of gyrB and rpoB gene sequences, strain WM-2(T) showed the highest similarity with the type strains of the species P. toyotomiensis and P. alcaliphila. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain WM-2(T) with P. guguanensis and P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis was 48.7 and 37.2 %, respectively. Chemotaxonomic characteristics (the main ubiquinone Q-9, major fatty acids C-18:1 omega 7c/C-18:1 omega 6c, C-16:0 and C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16:1 omega 6c and DNA G+C content 65.2 +/- A 0.7 mol%) were similar to those of members of the genus Pseudomonas. Polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an unknown aminophospholipid, an unknown phospholipid and five unknown lipids. According to the results of polyphasic analyses, strain WM-2(T) represents a novel species in the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas sihuiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WM-2(T) (=KCTC 32246(T)=CGMCC 1.12407(T)).

Skin mark patterns and blood vessel patterns are recently proposed to address this problem. However, they are invisible in low-resolution images and dense androgenic hair can cover them completely. Medical research results have implied that androgenic hair patterns are a stable biometric trait and have potential to overcome the weaknesses of skin mark patterns and blood vessel patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no one has studied androgenic hair patterns for criminal and victim identification before. This paper aims to study matching performance of androgenic hair patterns in low-resolution images. An algorithm designed for this paper uses Gabor filters to compute orientation fields of androgenic hair patterns, histograms on a dynamic grid system to describe their local orientation fields, and the blockwise Chi-square distance to measure the dissimilarity between two patterns. The 4552 images from 283 different legs with resolutions of 25, 18.75, 12.5, and 6.25 dpi were examined. The experimental results indicate that androgenic hair patterns even in low-resolution images are an effective biometric trait and the proposed Gabor orientation histograms are comparable with other well-known texture recognition methods, including local binary patterns, local Gabor binary patterns, and histograms of oriented gradients.

After the addition of Bi(Mg0.5Zr0.5)O-3, the crystal structure of the ceramics is transformed from rhombohedral to tetragonal phase and the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phase is formed at x = 0.01. The grain size of the ceramics increases with x increasing from 0 to 0.02 and then decreases with x further increasing. The dielectric peak of the ceramics becomes diffusive with x increasing after the addition of Bi(Mg0.5Zr0.5)O-3. The ceramics with x = 0-0.08 exhibit much better electric insulation with the resistivity of 1.0 x 10(9)-5.0 x 10(9) Omega center dot cm than pure BiFeO3 ceramic with the resistivity of similar to 5 x 10(7) Omega center dot cm. Due to the formation of the MPB, the ceramics with x = 0-0.02 possess good densification with the relative densities rho (r) of 94.9-96.3 %, strong piezoelectricity with the d (33) of 129-135 pC/N and very high Curie temperature with the T (C) of 559-610 A degrees C.

In the linear optical behavior, the incoherent population exchange suppresses the linear resonance such as the Autler-Townes absorption and the electromagnetically induced transparency in the same manner as the dephasing. While in the cross-Kerr optical responses these two decoherence mechanisms affect the nonlinearity in different ways. The dephasing enhances the nonlinear absorption at resonance, while the incoherent population exchange leads to cross-nonlinear gain and also broadens its spectrum. In particular, the large cross-Kerr nonlinearity without nonlinear absorption can be realized by suitably adjusting the incoherent population exchange. Additionally, the dependence of y-intercepts of absorption or dispersion curves without control field on the population exchange rate can be used to estimate the incoherent population exchange rate of the system. The results provided here are useful not only for illustrating distinct physical mechanisms of these two kinds of decoherence in nonlinear optics, but also for potential applications of cross-Kerr nonlinearity in quantum information processing.

The BSA prediction has attracted unceasing research back more than a century on animals, especially on humans and rats. Few studies in this area for anurans were reported, and the equation for body surface area (5) and body mass (W): S = 9.9 W-0.56, which was concluded from toads of four species in 1969, was generally adopted to estimate the body surface areas for anurans until recent years. However, this equation was not applicable to Odorrana grahami. The relationship between body surface area and body mass for this species was established as: S = 15.4 W-0.579. Our current results suggest estimation equations should be used cautiously across different species and body surface area predictions on more species need to be conducted.

By means of NMR and EPR spectroscopy, the nature of the Ti species formed in the catalyst systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO, (FI)TiCl3/MMAO, and (FI)TiCl3/AlR3/[Ph3C](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-) (R = Me, Et, Bu-i) has been studied. It was shown that outer-sphere ion pairs of the type [(FI)(TiMe2)-Me-IV](+)[A](-) ([A](-) = [MeMAO](-), [MeMMAO](-), [B-(C6F5)(4)](-)) are formed at the initial stage of the reaction of (FI)TiCl3 with MAO, MMAO, and AlMe3/[Ph3C](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-). These ion pairs further partially convert into Ti-III and Ti-II species. In the systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO and (FI)TiCl3/AlMe3/[Ph3C](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-), complexes with the proposed structures (FI)(TiMe2)-Me-III, (FI)(TiCl)-Cl-II, and [(FI)Ti-II(S)](+)[A](-) ([A](-) = [MeMAO](-), [B(C6F5)(4))](-), S = solvent, vacancy) were observed (concentrations of Ti-III species was lower than those of the Ti-II congeners). In contrast, in the system (FI)TiCl3/MMAO, the concentrations of Ti-II species (ion pairs of the type [(FI)Ti-III(mu-H)(mu-Cl)(AlBu2)-Bu-i](+)[MeMMAO](-)) were higher than those of the Ti-II counterparts (ion pairs [(FI)Ti-II(S)(+)[MeMMAO](-)). The system (FI)TiCl3/MMAO displays lower activity and selectivity in 1-hexene formation, in comparison to (FI)TiCl3/MAO, due to undesirable PE generation. Probably, Ti-II and Ti-IV ion pairs are those participating in ethylene trimerization.

This chart is a self-starting scheme, and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages rather than having to wait for the accumulation of sufficiently large calibration samples. It does not require any prior knowledge of the underlying distribution. The choice of the chart parameters is studied and a simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also efficiently detects various magnitudes of shifts. An illustrative example is also given to introduce the implementation of this proposed control chart.

The mixture behavior is described according to four Davidson-Cole terms whose evolution with composition is analyzed. Numbers of hydrogen bonds and bonding energies between alcohol-alcohol and DMSO-alcohol pairs are estimated from the dielectric constants' using the Luzar model. The average number of hydrogen bonds associated with DMSO decreases with increasing mole fraction of DMSO. The binding energy for alcohol-alcohol (E-11) and DMSO-alcohol (E-12) interactions decreases with the increased numbers of carbon atoms in the alcohols.

In this kind of model, the creation of upper level coherence does not require non-orthogonal dipoles. It is found that due to the microwave-induced coherence, refraction-absorption properties can be controlled by the relative phase of applied fields, and high refractive index without absorption can be always achieved just by choosing proper values of the relative phase.

G. Carter et al., Nat. Photon. 7, 329 (2013)] in an all-optical way. Adopting full quantum theory in real space, we analytically calculate the transport coefficients of single photons scattered by a A-type QD embedded in single-and two-mode photonic crystal cavities (PCCs), respectively. Our numerical results clearly show that the photonic transmission properties can be exactly manipulated by adjusting the coupling strengths of waveguide-cavity and QD-cavity interactions. Specifically, for the PCC with two degenerate orthogonal polarization modes coupled to a A-type QD with two degenerate ground states, we find that the photonic transmission spectra show three Rabi-splitting dips and the present system could serve as single-photon polarization beam splitters. The feasibility of our proposal with the current photonic crystal technique is also discussed.

Structural, optical, and magnetic properties of (Co, Cu)-codoped ZnO films with different Co concentrations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ROOM-TEMPERATURE FERROMAGNETISM; DOPED ZNO; THIN-FILMS; CU; SEMICONDUCTORS; TRANSITION	Zn0.99-xCoxCu0.01O films with different Co concentrations from 0% to 20% were fabricated by a sol-gel method. Moderate Co doping is found to improve the surface uniformity and crystal quality of the films, and causes a redshift of the band edge of Zn(Co, Cu) films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of Co ions causes the valence state of Cu to change from +2 to +1; while at Co concentrations lower than 10%, the Co exists in the +2 valence state. Strong blue emission at similar to 420 and 440 nm are observed, decreasing with increasing Co concentration, but becoming strong again as the concentration is increased to 20%. Enhanced room-temperature ferromagnetism is observed for the (Co, Cu)-codoped ZnO films at Co concentrations lower than 10%. These interesting magnetic properties are explained based on charge transfer, together with the defect-related model for ferromagnetism. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Xu, M.; Yuan, H.; Zhou, P.

The first one is how to represent giant data, such as image data, using quantum state without losing information. The second one is how to load a colossal volume of data into the quantum registers of a quantum CPU from classical electronic memory. Researches on these two questions are rarely reported. Here an entangled state is used to represent an image (or vector) for which two entangled registers are used to store a vector component and its classical address. Using the representation, n(1) + n(2) + 8 qubits are used to store the whole information of the gray image that has a 2(n1) x 2(n2) size at a superposition of states, a feat is not possible with a classic computer. The way of designing a unitary operation to load data, such as a vector (or image), into the quantum registers of a quantum CPU from electronic memory is defined herein as a quantum loading scheme (QLS). In this paper, the QLS with time complexity O(log(2) N) is presented where N denotes the number of vector components, a solution that would break through the efficiency bottleneck of loading data. QLS would enable a quantum CPU to be compatible with electronic memory and make possible quantum image compression and quantum signal processing that has classical input and output.

After the addition of Ba-0.6(Bi0.5K0.5)(0.4)TiO3, two dielectric anomalies are observed at high temperatures (T (1) similar to 453-710 A degrees C and T (2) similar to 716-755 A degrees C, respectively). The ceramic with x = 0.275 exhibits the optimum piezoelectricity (d (33) = 48 pC/N and k (p) = 13.6 %, respectively). The Ba-0.6(Bi0.5K0.5)(0.4)TiO3 doping and the increasing in sintering temperature improve significantly the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics.

The optimized structure of GaSe has been found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The mechanical stability of epsilon-GaSe is confirmed by calculations of the elastic constants. The calculated band structure shows that the crystal has a direct band gap of 0.816 eV.

By analyzing the variational characteristics of this equation, we established two types of invariant flows. Then approximating this equation by the energy-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equations with the same initial data and combining the properties of the invariant flows, we obtain the sharp conditions of global existence for this equation. Moreover, when the solution is globally defined, we prove the scattering. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The obtained formation enthalpies, energy-volume (E-V) curves and enthalpy-pressure (H-P) curves indicate that orthorhombic B31-IrSi is more stable than cubic B20-IrSi at both ambient and pressure conditions. The elastic stiffness constants, bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, Poisson's coefficients and elastic anisotropy factors of the two phases IrSi are studied for the first time. The small elastic stiffness constant C-22 of B31-IrSi induces easily compressibility along the b axis. Moreover, based on the Mulliken overlap population analysis, the hardness H-v of B31-IrSi (H-v = 11.9 GPa) and B20-IrSi (H-v = 13.4 GPa) are evaluated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The Chinese Family Assessment Instrument, originally designed for completion by adolescents, was adapted for completion by parents. A sample of 700 parent dyads of elementary school children (382 girls and 318 boys) completed the adapted questionnaire. Initial factor analyses showed that the existing five-factor structure used for adolescents' responses was not a good fit for these data. Instead, a four-factor solution emerged where the factors were positive family functioning, negative family functioning, tolerance for family members, and parental understanding. This structure was the same for both mothers and fathers. Further studies of the Chinese Family Assessment Instrument parent adaptation are required to test the factor structure that emerged. Following such studies, validation studies will be required.

Five structures are considered, i.e., delta-MON, WC-MoN, NiAs-MoN, NaCl-MoN and CsCl-MoN. The obtained lattice constant, elastic constants are in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. delta-MoN phase is found to be energetically the most stable phase closely followed by NiAs-MoN phase at ambient conditions. On the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, a pressure-induced structural phase transition from delta-MoN to NiAs-MoN is observed. Elastic properties, Poisson's ratio, Debye temperature, and thermal expansion coefficient of MoN under high pressure are derived. Furthermore, the bonding nature of MoN can be described as covalent-like due to hybridization of N and Mo states, together with ionic and metallic characters. Based on Mulliken population analysis, hardness of MoN is evaluated and the obtained results, namely, NiAs-MoN (26.6 GPa) and delta-MoN (24.7 GPa), are consistent with experimental data excellently. Moreover, the hardness of MoN increases with the pressure. This is a first-principles investigation on the structural and thermodynamic properties of MoN, and it still awaits experimental confirmation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the B or P-doped have little impact on the energy gap value (3. 12 eV) of silicon nanocrystals (SiNcs), except that some energy levels will be introduced in the forbidden band. The energy level caused by three-coordinated B-doped SiNcs is E-c - 0. 8 eV, while it is E-v + 0. 2 eV for the three-coordinated P-doped. However, the energy level position is E-v + 0. 4 eV for the four-coordinated B-doped SiNcs, and E-c - 1. 1 eV for the four-coordinated P-doped. Total energy of the system with the four-coordinated doped is lower than that with the three-coordinated doped in the other same conditions. The total energy of SiNcs system lessen when the surface is modified with appropriate ethyl or isopropyl. The total energy decreases with the surface coverage of organo-functional group increasing. But, the calculation can't converge because of too high resistance when the SiNcs surface are grafted with too many organic groups.

In terms of Strauss' arguments in Strauss (1977) [22], we find a new compactness lemma for radial symmetric functions. Thus, we use it to derive the best constants of two generalized Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequalities. Moreover, we obtain a more precisely sharp criteria of blow-up and global existence, and derive the weak concentration phenomenon of blow-up solutions by the variational methods.

Bi- and tri-dentate imino-based iron and cobalt pre-catalysts for ethylene oligo-/polymerization	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS			English	Review							TRIDENTATE BIS(IMINO)PYRIDINE COMPLEXES; OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS; SUBSTITUTED 2,6-BIS(IMINO)PYRIDYL IRON; HIGH-TEMPERATURE CATALYSTS; HIGHLY-ACTIVE CATALYSTS; LINEAR ALPHA-OLEFINS; DICHLORIDES SYNTHESIS; CHLORIDE COMPLEXES; SELECTIVE OLIGOMERIZATION; METAL-CATALYSTS	Recent progress on the use of iron and cobalt complex pre-catalysts for ethylene reactivity is reviewed. The review is organized in terms of the denticity of the chelate ligands employed, with particular reference to the influence of the ligand frameworks and their substituents on the catalytic performance for ethylene oligomerization/polymerization catalysis. The majority of the systems bear tri-dentate ligation at the iron/cobalt centre, though it is clear that bi-dentate iron/cobalt complex pre-catalysts have also attracted significant attention. Such systems produce in most cases highly linear products ranging from oligomeric alpha-olefins to high molecular weight polyethylene, and as such are promising candidates for both academic and industrial considerations.

In a previous study, the ERD15 gene was shown to be an important regulator of the abscisic acid response and salicylic acid-dependent defense pathway, acting as an important negative regulator of abscisic acid. The complete IbERD15 gene (accession No. KF723428) was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The IbERD15 gene contains an open reading frame of 504 bp, encodes a peptide of 167 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 18.725 kDa. The transcript levels of the IbERD15 gene in a variety of tissues were examined by digital gene expression profiling. The roots of the sweet potato were treated by 3 degrees of polyethylene glycol, and the results indicate that the IbERD15 gene might play an important role in the defense response to drought stress. Moreover, the IbERD15 gene was successfully transformed into yeast cells for analysis of drought tolerance in transgenic yeast.	[Chen, S. D.; Ma, Q. Q.; He, B.; Yuan, X.

But the problems of temperature distribution non-uniformity and low power efficiency in the heating process are becoming a new obstacle in the application of microwave chemistry. An optimized microwave oven with two sources is proposed in this paper from the view of feeding system to overcome these disadvantages. As water is usually concerned as important solvent and reactant, a beaker of water is used as heating load in this study. By modeling the process of heating water for 180 s, the standard deviation and the average temperature are compared between the domestic microwave oven and the optimized microwave oven with two sources. As a result, the power is utilized more efficiently as a 20.14% increase can be seen by using the optimized microwave oven under the same microwave power and more uniformity is obtained as a 11.23% increase is performed by the use of the optimized microwave oven under the same heating conditions.

The influence of the essential oil on histological changes and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) production associated with carrageenan-induced rat paw edema was also investigated. The essential oil (0.5, 0.25, 0.13 ml/kg b.w.) showed significantly inhibition of inflammation along with a dose-dependent manner in the three experimental models. The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oil was occurred both in early and late phase and peaked at 4 h after carrageenan injection. The essential oil resulted in a dose dependent reduction of the paw thickness, connective tissue injury and the infiltration of inflammatory cell. The essential oil also significantly reduced the production of PGE(2), histamine and 5-HT in the exudates of edema paw induced by carrageenan. Both the essential oil and indomethacin resulted relative lower percentage inhibition of histamine and 5-HT than that of PGE(2) at 4 h after carrageenan injection.

In this paper we propose to combine two methods to produce virtual face images for single sample face recognition. We firstly use a symmetry transform to produce symmetrical face images. We secondly use the linear combination of two samples to generate virtual samples. As a result, we convert the special single sample problem into a non-single sample problem. We then use the 2DPCA method to extract features from the samples and use the nearest neighbor classifier to perform classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the recognition rate of single sample face recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Methods: From the viewpoint of semiology, demography, surgical treatment and prognosis evaluation, we compared 19 MRI-negative, PET-positive TLE patients to 41 TLE with hippocampal sclerosis patients, and then statistically analyzed the differences between these 2 cohorts. Results: Under intraoperative electrocorticography monitoring, all patients underwent successful standard anterior temporal lobectomy. It appears that there is no significant difference between the surgical outcome of MRI-negative/PET-positive TLE (Engle class I: 68.4%, Engle class I + II:84.2%) and TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (Engle class I: 68.3%, Engle class I + II: 80.5%). The analysis also shows that to some extent MRI-negative, PET-positive TLE might be distinct from TLE with hippocampal sclerosis as a clinical entity, i.e. the former is not a subtype of the latter. History of febrile convulsion and occurrence of secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure may possibly differentiate them from each other. Conclusion: Successful resective surgery of MRI-negative TLE based on PET can yield similar favorable results to TLE with hippocampal sclerosis. This study demonstrates that with reasonable presurgical workup, such TLE subtypes can be surgically treated without invasive intracranial electrode implantation. (C) 2014 S.

J	He, JY; Li, C; Wu, G				He, Jiao-Yu; Li, Cheng; Wu, Guo			Discovery of potential drugs for human-infecting H7N9 virus containing R294K mutation	DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY			English	Article						H7N9; neuraminidase; mutation; virtual screening; inhibitor	FREE-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; INFLUENZA-A VIRUS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; DOCKING; SIMULATION; RESISTANCE; THERAPY; ALGORITHM	Background: After the first epidemic wave from February through May 2013, the influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and has followed a second epidemic wave since June 2013. As of June 27, 2014, the outbreak of H7N9 had caused 450 confirmed cases of human infection, with 165 deaths included. The case-fatality rate of all confirmed cases is about 36%, making the H7N9 virus a significant threat to people's health. At present, neuraminidase inhibitors are the only licensed antiviral medications available to treat H7N9 infections in humans. Oseltamivir is the most commonly used inhibitor, and it is also a front-line drug for the threatening H7N9. Unfortunately, it has been reported that patients treated with oseltamivir can induce R294K (Arg294Lys) substitution in the H7N9 virus, which is a rare mutation and can reduce the antiviral efficacy of inhibitors. Even worse, deaths caused by such mutation after oseltamivir treatment have already been reported, indicating that the need to find substitutive neuraminidase inhibitors for currently available drugs to treat drug-resistant H7N9 is really pressing. Materials and methods: First, the structure of H7N9 containing the R294K substitution was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, and structural information of approved drugs was downloaded from the ZINC (ZINC Is Not Commercial) database. Taking oseltamivir carboxylate as a reference drug, we then filtered these molecules through virtual screening to find out potential inhibitors targeting the mutated H7N9 virus. For further evaluation, we carried out a 14 ns molecular dynamic simulation for each H7N9-drug complex and calculated the binding energy for each candidate drug. Results: We found five inhibitors that could be candidate drugs for treating the mutated H7N9 virus. Docking poses showed these drugs could bind to the virus effectively, with the contribution of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. With regard to the molecular dynamic simulations, receptor-ligand complexes formed by these candidate drugs were more stable than the one formed by oseltamivir carboxylate. The binding energy of oseltamivir carboxylate was-122.4 kJ/mol, while those for these potential inhibitors were-417.5, -404.7, -372.2, -304.3, and -289.9 kJ/mol, much better than the reference drug. Conclusion: Given the current and future threat of the mutated H7N9 virus, it is urgent that potent drugs and effective antiviral therapeutics be found. Our study therefore is able to complement currently available drugs for influenza A infectors and helps to prevent the ongoing threat of H7N9 virus.

It is shown that the influence of oceanic optical turbulence on propagation of laser beams becomes stronger as tau (ratio of temperature to salinity contribution to the refractive index spectrum) and chi r (rate of dissipation of mean-squared temperature) increase and epsilon (rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid) decreases, which is in agreement with the further analysis of oceanic turbulence shown in this paper.

Reaction of 2-((2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-quinolin-8-ylimino)methyl)-4,6-R-1,R-2-phenols (R-1 = R-2 = Bu-t; (LH)-H-2), (R-1 = R-2 = Me; (LH)-H-3) or (R-1 = Me, R-2 = Ad; (LH)-H-4) with [VO(OnPr)(3)] afforded complexes of the type [L2-4VO] (where L-2 = 3, L-3 = 4, L-4 = 5). The molecular structures of 1 to 3 are reported; the metal centre adopts a distorted octahedral, trigonal bipyramidal or square-based pyramidal geometry respectively. In Schlenk line tests, all complexes have been screened as pre-catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene using diethylaluminium chloride (DEAC) as co-catalyst in the presence of ethyltrichloroacetate (ETA), and for the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone in the presence of benzyl alcohol. All pre-catalyst/DEAC/ETA systems are highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts affording linear polyethylene with activities in the range 3000-10 700 g (mol h bar)(-1); the use of methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified MAO as co-catalyst led to poor or no activity. In a parallel pressure reactor, 3-5 have been screened as pre-catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of either DEAC or DMAC (dimethylaluminium chloride) and ETA at various temperatures and for the co-polymerization of ethylene with propylene. The use of DMAC proved more promising with 3 achieving an activity of 63 000 g (mol h bar)(-1) at 50 degrees C and affording UHMWPE (M-w similar to 2 000 000). In the case of the co-polymerization, the incorporation of propylene was 6.9-8.8 mol%, with 3 exhibiting the highest incorporation when using either DEAC or DMAC. In the case of the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone, systems employing complexes 1-5 were virtually inactive at temperatures <110 degrees C; on increasing the CL : V ratio at 110 degrees C, conversions of the order of 80% were achievable.

The one is a small antipodal Vivaldi antenna for a 4.1-20 GHz frequency range, and its dimension is only 34 x 50 mm(2). Another proposed high gain antenna can achieve the maximum gain of 15.2 dBi within its operating band. Measured results of the manufactured antipodal Vivaldi antennas are in good agreement with the simulated ones. Besides the vertical bar S-11 vertical bar, far field radiation pattern, current distribution, phase, gain, and group delay which are important parameters of impulse distortion in ultra-wide band antenna are well analyzed. All results show that the proposed antipodal Vivaldi antennas have better performances and they are well suited for ultra-wide band communications.

Here we investigated whether this interaction between time and number could be modulated by working memory (WM). In experiment 1 participants first memorized a digit and then judged which of the two digits presented in succession were presented for longer (or shorter), with either one or neither of them being the same as the WM digit. The results showed that, when one of two digits was the same as the WM content, the numerical magnitude effect on temporal performance was abolished, whereas the interference effect occurred only when both the two digits were not the same as the WM content. In order to further investigate whether this effect was due to stimuli repetition, we instructed participants in experiment 2 to merely attend to the original digit but not memorize it during a time judgment task. The results did not reveal the modulation of WM content on time number link The WM-based interference effect, however, might reflect decision bias rather than perception illusion. In experiment 3 we eliminated response biases by using equality judgments, and found that WM content had no impact on time number link. Finally, we conducted experiment 4 (comparative duration judgment) and experiment 5 (equality duration judgment) by manipulating WM load, and demonstrated that the WM-based interference effect was relevant to the duration of the WM content solely in comparative judgment. We concluded that the mental association between time and number representation could be modulated by WM at decision level.

The results showed that the water lettuce had higher removal efficiency with low concentrations of livestock wastewater. The removal efficiency of water lettuce for different initial concentrations of livestock wastewater within 8 d was as follows: chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) (68-82%)> NH3-N (57-69%) > TP (27-45%). The speed of purification of water lettuce for CODcr, NH3-N and TP conformed to first order kinetics equations. The water quality indices CODcr, NH3-N and TP had a higher linear correlation with peroxidase (POD) activity (R-2>0.9(2)) than with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, which indicates that the main reacting enzyme of water lettuce under high CODcr stress is peroxidase.

By using the THz time domain measure system, the terahertz dispersion characteristics, loss characteristic and energy focusing characteristic of air-core single-layer and dual-layer dielectric tube are obtained. The results show that this type of air-core dielectric tube can realize low dispersion characteristics. Due to the difference of refractive index between two dielectric materials, stronger energy focusing can be achieved in air-core dual-layer dielectric tube. After the coupling of the THz pulse using the dual-layer dielectric tube waveguide, the THz pulse increased 2.4 times compared with the single-layer dielectric tube waveguide at 1.5 THz.

We focus our attention in the interplay between the quantum interference and the squeezed field on the population distribution. It is shown that an atomic population inversion can be attained on one of the optical transitions due to the SV. Additionally, we show, with the proper value of the relative phase, the SV can also lead to unexpected population inversion on the transition between two different levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

When it is applied to TSP, its runtime is proportional to the squared size of problem.. so as to look less efficient. The following statistical feature is observed during the authors' long-termgene data analysis using ACO: when the data size.. becomes big, local clustering appears frequently. That is, some data cluster tightly in a small area and form a class, and the correlation between different classes is weak. And this feature makes the idea of divide and rule feasible for the estimate of solution of TSP. In this paper an improved ACO algorithm is presented, which firstly divided all data into local clusters and calculated small TSP routes and then assembled a big TSP route with them. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the running speed of ACO by 200 factors under the condition that data set holds feature of local clustering.

Analyzing the difficulties to choose the fractional orders and unsatisfied processing results in signal processing using fractional-order partial differential equations and related methods; we think that the nonzero values of the truncated fractional order derivatives in the smooth regions are major causes for these situations. In order to resolve the problem, the absolute values of truncated parts of the G-L formula are estimated by the median of signal values of the remainder parts, and then the truncated G-L formula is modified by replacing each of the original signal value to the differences of the signal value and the median. Since the sum of the coefficients of the G-L formula is zero, the median correction can reduce the truncated errors greatly to proximate G-L formula better. We also present some simulation results and experiments to support our theory analysis.

J	Peng, J; Chen, XH; Liu, T				Peng, Jian; Chen, Xiaohai; Liu, Tang			A Flow-Partitioned Unequal Clustering Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							ENERGY-EFFICIENT; PROTOCOL	Energy efficiency and energy balance are two important issues for wireless sensor networks. In previous clustering routing algorithms, multihop transmission, sleep scheduling, and unequal clustering are always used to improve energy efficiency and energy balance. In these algorithms, only the cluster heads share the burden of data forwarding in each round. In this paper, we propose a flow-partitioned unequal clustering routing (FPUC) algorithm to achieve better energy efficiency and energy balance. FPUC consists of two phases: clustering and routing. In the clustering phase, the competition radius is computed according to the node density and the distance from sensor nodes to the sink. The sensor nodes that have more residual energy and larger overlapping degree have higher probability to be selected as cluster heads. In the routing phase, each cluster head first finds the gateway nodes and then distributes the data flow to each of its gateway nodes depending on residual energy. After that, each gateway node forwards the data to the next hop with minimum cost. Two metrics called network lifetime and coverage lifetime are used to compare the performance of FPUC with that of the existing ones. Simulation results show that FPUC can achieve longer network lifetime and coverage lifetime than previous algorithms.

An adaptive adjustment strategy of the quantum rotation which is introduced in this study helps improving the convergence speed, search ability, and stability. Cooperative learning enhances the search ability in the high-dimensional solution space by splitting a high-dimensional vector into several one-dimensional vectors. The experimental results demonstrate good performance of the IQGA in solving multilevel thresholding segmentation problem by compared with QGA, GA and PSO.

The results showed that the introduction of electron-drawing group -CF3 and -C3F7 on beta-diketonate made the strongest absorption peak red-shift and the lowest energy absorption blue-shied. Introduction of -OC2H5 on the benzene or pyridine ring made the lowest energy absorption blue-shift. When the -C2H3 was introduced on the benzene or pyridine ring, the lowest energy absorption was red-shifted. Introduction of electron-donating group on beta-diketonate can enlarge their nonlinear optical properties. On the contrary, the introduction of electron-drawing group dropped it down.

Here we report an efficient strategy to enhance the recyclability of the heterogeneous catalysts by in situ entrapment of active nanoparticles in mesoporous carbon. A hard template method was used to fabricate the desired catalyst, where Al2O3 was employed as the template and polyphenols were used as carbon source as well as the stabilizing agent. Based on N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis, the catalysts adopt the high surface area of the Al2O3 template and feature mesoporous pores. Additionally, the noble metal nanoparticles (Pd) were found to be well entrapped inside the carbon matrix with good dispersion. The as-prepared catalysts were highly active in various heterogeneous hydrogenations of C=C containing substrates (quinoline, cinnamaldehyde, etc.) and exhibited excellent cycling stability without any significant loss of activity for 10 recycles, which is superior to that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

Influence of generalized exponent factor alpha of the atmospheric power spectrum and the type of beam combinations on the spreading of Gaussian array beams is studied. It is shown that for both coherent and incoherent combinations, the dependence of z(R), z(T) and theta on alpha is not monotonic. When alpha = 3.108, z(R) and z(T) reach their minima, and theta reaches its maximum. This means that the spreading is largest, and the spreading is enormously affected by turbulence when alpha = 3.108. For the incoherent combination the spreading is larger than that for the coherent combination, but for the incoherent combination the spreading is less affected by turbulence than that for the coherent combination. It may be that, for the small free-space diffraction we have z(T) < z(R), i.e., the spreading is affected by turbulence within the Rayleigh range; for the large free-space diffraction we have z(T) > z(R), i.e., the spreading is less affected by the turbulence within the Rayleigh range.

In the scheme, the sender Alice distributes a quantum secret with a Bell-state measurement and publishes her measurement outcomes via a classical channel to three agents who are divided into two grades. One agent is in the upper grade, while the other two agents are in the lower grade. Then by introducing an ancillary qubit, the agent of the upper grade only needs the assistance of any one of the other two agents for probabilistically obtaining the secret, while an agent of the lower grade needs the help of both the other two agents by using a controlled-NOT operation and a proper positive operator-valued measurement instead of the usual projective measurement. In other words, the agents of two different grades have different authorities to reconstruct Alice's secret in a probabilistic manner. The scheme can also be modified to implement the threshold-controlled teleportation.

They all contain a distinctive 19(18 -> 17)-abeo-28-noroleanane-type spirocylclic skeleton with a trans or a cis acyl substituent at C-3 or C-23. Similar to the previously known leonurusoleanolides A/B (7/8) and C/D (9/10), compounds 1/2 and 3/4 were also found to exist as equilibrium mixtures of trans and cis isomers. The isolated pure compounds and mixtures were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines (BGC-823 and KE-97 gastric carcinoma, Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma, Jurkat T cell lymphoblasts, and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma) using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay method. Among them, (2 alpha,3 beta,17R*,18 beta)-3-O-(trans-caffeoyl)-19(18 -> 17)-abeo-28-norolean-12-ene-2,18,23-triol (leonurusoleanolide J, 6) showed the most potent cytotoxic activity, with IC50 values less than 10 mu M.

To solve this problem, the streakline framework based on Lagrangian fluid dynamics had been proposed recently. However, this framework computed optical flow field using conventional optical flow method (Lucas Kanade method) which has poor anti-interference performance, and serious deviation would be brought to the computation of optical flow field. Moreover, our experimental results show that using the formulation of streak flow similarity in this framework can result in incorrect flow segmentation. Therefore, we combine this framework with a high accurate variational model, and modify the corresponding formulation of streak flow similarity after analyzing the streakline framework in detail. Finally, an improved method is proposed to solve flow segmentation in crowded scenes. Experiments are done to compare these two methods and results verify the validity and accuracy of our method.

J	Li, XQ; Ji, XL				Li, Xiaoqing; Ji, Xiaoling			Propagation characteristics of decentered annular beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; MOMENTS	This paper studies the propagation characteristics related to higher-order moments of decentered annular beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence. The analytical expressions for the mean-squared beam width w, the skewness parameter A, and the kurtosis parameter K are derived. The analytical expression for the non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameter T' is also derived, and the differences between two non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameters T' and T are examined. It is shown that K depends on both T and T', but w and A only depend on T. K decreases monotonically as the spectral power law exponent a increases, but there exist a maximum of w and a minimum of A when alpha = 3.112. When propagation distance z is long enough, A reaches zero, i.e., the intensity distribution is perfectly symmetric about the centroid position axis. In free space, both A > 0 and A < 0 may appear on propagation. However, it is always A > 0 or A < 0 on propagation when turbulence is not weak. On the other hand, in turbulence, the maximum of K increases as the decentered parameter increases and the obscure ratio decreases. In particular, when z is long enough, the beam spot is elliptical in free space, but it becomes circular in turbulence.

This paper investigates the conditions under which the solution sets of fuzzy relational equations with sup-inf composition over complete Brouwerian lattices form lattices. We first give some properties of the decompositions of elements in complete lattices, then present a necessary and sufficient condition that the meet of a solution with any other solution is again a solution.

In this paper we prove that bipolar fuzzy sets and [0, 1](2)-sets (which have been deeply studied) are actually cryptomorphic mathematical notions. Since researches or modelings on real world problems often involve multi-agent, multi-attribute, multi-object, multi-index, multi-polar information, uncertainty, or/and limit process, we put forward (or highlight) the notion of m-polar fuzzy set (actually, [0, 1](m)-set which can be seen as a generalization of bipolar fuzzy set, where m is an arbitrary ordinal number) and illustrate how many concepts have been defined based on bipolar fuzzy sets and many results which are related to these concepts can be generalized to the case of m-polar fuzzy sets. We also give examples to show how to apply m-polar fuzzy sets in real world problems.

However, many of these needs have received little attention, and some of them may be less relevant now than they were 70 years ago. Two studies were conducted to investigate current motives. In Study 1, we used the Striving Assessment to elicit the personal strivings of 255 undergraduate university students. Murray's taxonomy was unable to account for 50% of the 2,937 strivings. These strivings were thematically groups into 11 new categories and combined with 7 Murrayan needs to form the Comprehensive Motivation Coding System (CMCS). In Study 2, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) stories produced by 143 undergraduate student participants were coded by these two systems. Murray's system was unable to fully account for 42% of motives identified in the TAT stories, but the CMCS was able to account for 89%. These findings suggest that Murrayan needs may not adequately describe contemporary motivations and that the CMCS has the potential to do so. However, due to the limited demographics of our sample, further investigations are needed.

J	Ji, XL; Baykal, Y; Jia, XH				Ji, Xiaoling; Baykal, Yahya; Jia, Xinhong			Changes of the centroid position of laser beams propagating through an optical system in turbulent atmosphere	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Centroid position; Turbulent atmosphere; Laser beams with distortion	NON-KOLMOGOROV TURBULENCE; PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; WAVE	In this paper, the effects of atmospheric turbulence, initial field amplitude, optical system and thermal blooming on the centroid position of laser beams propagating through the atmosphere are studied in detail. With the average over the ensemble of the turbulent medium, the centroid position is independent of turbulence. However, the centroid position depends on the centroid positions at the source plane and in the far-field, and the elements of ray-transfer-matrix. The physical reason why the centroid position changes on propagation is that the far-field centroid position is not located on the propagation z-axis due to the field phase distortion and the decentred intensity. The centroid position of laser beams with the spherical aberration and the decentred intensity is examined analytically. When laser beams with the decentred intensity propagate through the atmosphere, the effect of thermal blooming on the centroid position is investigated by using the four-dimensional (4D) computer code of the time-dependent propagation of high power laser beams through the atmosphere.

Eight candidate structures of known transition-metal compounds are chosen to probe for rhenium diboride ReB2. The calculated lattice parameters are consistent with the experimental and theoretical values. Based on the third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, the transition pressure P-t between the ReB2-ReB2 and MoB2-ReB2 phases is firstly determinate. Elastic constants, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature are derived. The single-bonded B-B feather remains in ReB2 compounds. Furthermore, according to Mulliken overlap population analysis, a semiempirical method to evaluate the hardness of multicomponent crystals with partial metallic bond is presented. Both strong covalency and a zigzag topology of interconnected bonds underlie the ultraincompressibilities. In addition, the superior performance and large hardness (39.1 GPa) of ReB2-ReB2 indicate that it is a superhard material. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The predicted new phase of CrB3 belongs to the rhombohedral phase with R-3m symmetry and it transforms into a hexagonal phase with P-6m2 symmetry at 64 GPa. The mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities of CrB3 are verified by the calculated elastic constants and formation enthalpies. Also, the full phonon dispersion calculations confirm the dynamic stability of predicted CrB3. Considering the role of metallic contributions, the calculated hardness values from our semiempirical method for rhombohedral and hexagonal phases are 23.8 GPa and 22.1 GPa, respectively. In addition, the large shear moduli, Young's moduli, low Poisson's ratios, and small B/G ratios indicate that they are potential hard materials.

The trimers consist of three triphenylene discotic units linked to a central 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene ring via flexible spacers. The trimers were synthesized in the yields up to 70% by mixing the monomers with 10 mol% of Co-2(CO)(8) as the catalyst in refluxing 1,4-dioxane. The liquid crystalline properties were investigated by using polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Trimer 4 with an ester connecting group and a longer spacer exhibited a rectangular columnar mesophase, while 5b and 5c possessing an ether linkage and a shorter spacer display a hexagonal columnar mesophase. The connecting functional group and the length of the flexible spacer between the central benzene ring and the triphenylene units have pivotal influence on the mesomorphism.

Although dimeric porphyrin ligands and platinum(II) complexes display nearly the same absorption spectra in the concentration range from 10(-7) to 10(-4) mol.dm(-3), these ligands and their complexes show concentration-dependent emission when the length of aliphatic chain is beyond four carbon atoms. At elevated concentration of the ligands and complexes, the emission spectra show obvious red-shifts. For complex Pt2C6(OPTPP)(2) and Pt2C10 (OPTPP)(2), the emission maxima at 652 nm are red-shifted to 676 and 681 nm at concentrations >10(-4) mol.dm(-3). Emission spectra of the sublimate films of complexes also display similar red-shifts: 43 nm for Pt2C6(OPTPP)(2) and 53 nm for Pt2C10(OPTPP)(2). The concentration-dependent emission indicates that there are intramolecular pi-pi interactions in porphyrin dimers and platinum(II) metalloporphyrins.

The mixture behavior is described according to four Davidson-Cole terms whose evolution with composition is analyzed. The binding energies and hydrogen bond (HB) numbers between solute-solute and solvent-solute pairs are obtained from the permittivity using the Luzar model. The average HBs number associated with DMSO decreases with increasing mole fraction of DMSO. The binding energy of solute-solute (E-11) and solvent-solute (E-12) interaction decreases with the increased numbers of carbon atoms in the alcohols.

J	Pu, ZL; Rao, RF				Pu, Zhilin; Rao, Ruofeng			Exponential robust stability of T-S fuzzy stochastic p-Laplace PDEs under zero-boundary condition	BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS			English	Article								In this paper, the stability of a class of time-delay Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy Markovian jumping partial differential equations (PDEs) with p-Laplace diffusion are investigated, and several criteria for asymptotical stability and robust exponential stability are obtained. Different from all the previous related literature, the authors use the contraction mapping theory to obtain in this paper the existence of other solutions for PDEs with p-Laplace besides the trivial solution. In fact, if there is only the trivial solution for the PDEs, the stability criteria about the trivial solution would become meaningless. Moreover, infinitely many solutions for these PDEs of all the previous related literature can be obtained by employing the methods of this paper. In a word, the works of all the related literature were found more meaningful owing to the methods and results of this paper.

Methods: Cytotoxicity was characterized by 50 % inhibition (IC50) of human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthaizol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was analysed by Hoechst33258 staining and DNA ladder. MCF-7 cellular superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) vitality and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evaluated. Results: The essential oil was cytotoxic to MCF-7 cell line. A dose- and time-dependent inhibition was observed with IC50 values of 18.75, 9.45 and 10.50 mu g/ml at 6, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Analyses by Hoechst33258 staining and DNA ladder indicate that the essential oil induced apoptosis. SOD vitality significantly decreased (p < 0.05) by 51 % when the concentration of the essential oil increased from 1.25 to 12.5 mu g/ml while CAT vitality significantly increased (p < 0.05) by 71 % when essential oil concentration was similarly increased. The MDA content of each treatment group, when compare to control, did not show any significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The essential oil of C. ambrosioides was cytotoxic to MCF-7 cell line and induced apoptosis.

Growth occurred with 0-5.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 10-42 degrees C (optimum 30 degrees C) in trypticase soya broth. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes identified the isolate as a member of a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas. Strain SgZ-6(T) exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to 'Pseudomonas linyingensis' CGMCC 1.10701 (97.5 %), followed by Pseudomonas sagittaria JCM 18195(T) (97.4 %), P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis DSM 21016(T) (96.6 %), P. tuomuerensis JCM 14085(T) (96.5 %) and P. alcaliphila JCM 10630(T) (96.4 %). Strain SgZ-6(T) showed the highest gyrB gene sequence similarity of 93.7% to 'P. linyingensis' CGMCC 1.10701 among all type strains of genus Pseudomonas. DNA DNA pairing studies showed that strain SgZ-6(T) displayed 47.1 and 40.3% relatedness to 'P. linyingensis' CGMCC 1.10701 and P. sagittaria JCM 18195(T), respectively. The major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone 9 (Q-9). The whole-cell fatty acids consisted mainly of summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c), C-16:0 and summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c). The DNA G C content of the genomic DNA was 68.1 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain SgZ-6(T) is proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas guangdongensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SgZ-6T (=CCTCC AB 2012022(T)=KACC 16606(T)). An emended description of the genus Pseudomonas is also proposed.

Growth occurred with 0-3.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.0 %), at pH 5.5-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 25-42 A degrees C (optimum 30-37 A degrees C) in liquid Reasoner's 2A medium. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and gyrB gene sequences revealed that strain WM-3(T) was most closely related to the type strains of the species Pseudomonas linyingensis and Pseudomonas sagittaria. Its sequence similarities with P. linyingensis CGMCC 1.10701(T) and P. sagittaria JCM 18195(T) were 97.4 and 97.3 %, respectively, for 16S rRNA gene, and were 94.1 and 94.2 %, respectively, for gyrB gene. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain WM-3(T) and these two type strains showed relatedness of 35.6 and 30.9 %, respectively. G+C content of genomic DNA was 69.4 mol%. The whole-cell fatty acids mainly consisted of C-16:0 (30.0 %), C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c (19.3 %) and C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c (16.3 %). The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated that strain WM-3(T) belongs to genus Pseudomonas but represents a novel species, for which the name Pseudomonas oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WM-3(T) (=KCTC 32247(T) =CGMCC 1.12417(T)).

Growth was observed to occur at 35-60 A degrees C, at pH 7.0-10.0 and with 0.5-10 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum growth: 50 A degrees C, pH 8.0 and 0.5-3 % NaCl). Cells were determined to be catalase- and oxidase-positive. The predominant respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7; the major polar lipids were determined to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, glycolipid, aminoglycolipid and an unidentified phospholipid; the DNA G+C content was determined to be 46.6 mol%; and the major fatty acids (> 5 %) were identified as anteiso-C-15:0 (33.6 %), iso-C-15:0 (24.1 %) and anteiso-C-17:0 (13.4 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain DX-5(T) should be assigned to the genus Bacillus, and was related most closely to the type strains of B. fortis DSM 16012(T) (96.3 %), B. composti KACC 16872(T) (96.3 %) and B. fordii DSM 16014(T) (95.8 %).

The ceramics sintered at 1000 degrees C for 2h possess a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and pseudocubic phases is formed at x = 0.025. The addition of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 retards the grain growth and induces two dielectric anomalies at high temperatures (T-1 similar to 450-550 degrees C and T-2 similar to 700 degrees C, respectively). After the addition of 2.5 mol% Bi0.5K0.5TiO3, the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are improved and very high Curie temperature of 708 degrees C is obtained. Sintering temperature has an important influence on the microstructure and electrical properties of the ceramics. Critical sintering temperature is 970 degrees C. For the ceramic with x=0.025 sintered at/above 970 degrees C, large grains, good densification, high resistivity and enhanced electrical properties are obtained. The weak dependences of microstructure and electrical properties on dwell time are observed for the ceramic with x = 0.025. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Use of acetaldoxime as the hydrolysis reagent instead of H2O facilitates the operation of the reaction. The significantly decreased amount of nitriles, along with use of weak base K2CO3 instead of strong base KOH, makes this transformation atom-efficient and environmentally benign. A variety of N-arylamides and benzoxazole derivatives can be synthesized according to this approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We generated AFLP fingerprints for 96 leaf samples, collected at 30 m intervals in the two populations, using ten selective primer pairs. A total of 92 genotypes were identified from the both populations. The mean proportion of distinguishable genotypes (G/N) was 0.9583 (0.9375 to 0.9792) and Simpson's index of diversity (D) was 0.9982 (0.9973 to 0.9991). So, two B. fangiana populations were multiclonal and highly diverse. The largest single clone may occur over a distance of about 30 m. Our results demonstrated that the genotypic diversity and genet density of B. fangiana clonal population did not change significantly (47 versus 45) with genet aging and low partitioned genetic differentiation was between the two populations (Gst = 0.0571). The analysis of molecular variance consistently showed that a large proportion of the genetic variation (87.79%) existed among the individuals within populations, whereas only 12.21% were found among populations. In addition, the high level of genotypic diversity in the two populations implies that the further works were needed to investigate the reasons for the poor seed set in B. fangiana after flowering.

A novel low-energy hybrid process for the removal of organic contaminants in ultrapure water systems	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						carbon adsorption; TOC; photocatalytic oxidation; ultrapure water; nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide	DOPED-TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES; CARBON SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; ACTIVATED CARBON; PHOTOCATALYTIC OXIDATION; DRINKING-WATER; ADSORPTION; POLLUTANTS; PESTICIDES; OXIDES	To achieve the goal of implementation of low-energy and low-chemical usage for trace organic compound removal, the hybrid oxidation/adsorption purification system using nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide catalytic oxidation followed by activated carbon adsorption was proposed in this paper. When isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, and urea were selected as model components, superior oxidation effects were achieved by combination of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide with 254nm UV unit than by traditional high-energy-consumed 185nm UV unit, which indicated such configuration would be an ideal candidate to replace the current high-energy-consumed UV unit. By incorporating this new configuration into the semiconductor wastewater recycling system, the granule-activated carbon bed adsorption efficiency for total organic carbon was compared with the granule-activated carbon adsorption efficiency for total organic carbon in traditional purification system, where the 185nm UV lamp was used as oxidation unit. The experimental results showed that the hybrid low energy consumption catalytic oxidation/adsorption system had higher efficiency than the traditional high-energy-consumed oxidation/adsorption system for trace organic compound removal. This was because the radicals formed in the UV oxidation process reacted with the organic compounds adsorbed on the activated carbon and regenerated the adsorption sites.

Nonuniformity behavior during regeneration of the diesel particulate filter	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						diesel particulate filter; nonuniformity; temperature excursion; wrong-way	WRONG-WAY BEHAVIOR; WALL-FLOW; THERMAL REGENERATION; SOOT COMBUSTION; CATALYTIC REGENERATION; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; EMISSIONS	The incomplete regeneration of diesel particulate filter may cause a local build-up of the soot on the partially regenerated areas during next filtration cycle. This may be one of reasons causing the melting of the ceramic filter during regeneration. In this paper, we investigated several situations at which the particulate matter was partially regenerated. The simulations illustrated that at stationary feed conditions, the influence of nonuniformity of soot loading on the peak temperature rise was less important. When regeneration was conducted at transient feed conditions, the peak temperature attained under the condition of uneven soot distribution along the channel, especially more soot accumulated near the end of the diesel particulate filter, was much higher than that attained under the condition of even soot distribution inside the channel.

The isolate could grow in the presence of 0-3.0% NaCl (w/v), at temperatures of 30-60 degrees C and at pH 5.5-9.5, forming ivory-coloured colonies. When the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was compared with those of other bacteria, the highest similarity was observed with Kroppenstedtia eburnea DSM 45196(T) (96.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.3 mol%, the cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, the main polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol, and the major menaquinone was MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids (>5 %) were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0 and anteiso-C-15:0. On the basis of its phenotypic and phylogenetic properties, chemotaxonomic analysis and the results of physiological and biochemical tests, strain GD02(T) (=CGMCC 1.12404(T)=KCTC 29149(T)) was designated the type strain of a novel species of the genus Kroppenstedtia, for which the name Kroppenstedtia guangzhouensis sp. nov. is proposed.

A fast and efficient coupling-matrix method is designed to calculate the Chern number in finite crystalline and disordered systems. To show its effectiveness, we apply the approach to the Haldane model and the lattice Hofstadter model, and obtain the correct quantized Chern numbers. The disorder-induced topological phase transition is well reproduced, when the disorder strength is increased beyond the critical value. We expect the method to be widely applicable to the study of topological quantum numbers.

The calculation shows that the deviation of the easy axis affects the magnetization reversal process seriously. When beta not equal 0 degrees, there is no obvious nucleation in the magnetization reversal process. The remanence decreases as beta decreases, and the squareness of the hysteresis loops is weakened, leading to the sharp decrease of energy product. For Nd2Fe14B(10 nm)/alpha-Fe(8 nm), the energy product decreases by 30.3% when beta = 10 degrees. In the magnetization reversal process, as the total energy reaches the maxium, Zeeman energy decreases with increasing of beta, and the exchange energy first increases and then decreases slightly, and the anisotropic energy increases with the increasing of beta. The deviation of easy axis has a greater influence on the energy product of the bilayer system with larger soft thickness. The out-of-plane deviation of easy axis has a similar effect.

Especially, some birds can use the geomagnetic field for navigation. According to the avian magnetoreception mechanisms, birds can build magnetic map for orientation and navigation by sensing the intensity and incline of geomagnetic field. However, researches on the magnetoreceptor of birds are still at the stage of discovery and identification, and it is necessary to study the iron-mineral-based structures to know whether they have the physical and magnetic properties to act as magnetoreceptor in living system. In this paper, the maghemite platelet chains in the iron-mineral-based magnetoreceptor have been studied with three-dimensional simulation based on the theories of micromagnetics. The reaction of the maghemite platelet chains with geomagnetic field has been investigated. Result indicates that the maghemite platelet chains with vortex domain can response to the change of the orientation of geomagnetic field.

During the process, l-lysine played important roles such as complexing agent as well as combusting agent and adjusting the pH values of solution. The physical characteristics of Li4Mn5O12 were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical capacitance performance of Li4Mn5O12 electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These analyses indicated that Li4Mn5O12 was able to deliver 168 F g(-1) within the potential range of 0-1.4 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) in 1 mol L-1 Li2SO4. Nine hundred cycles later, the capacitance faded to 165 F g(-1) with cutting down by 0.003 F g(-1) per cycling period and also can remain 98.2 % of original value, displaying a good cycling performance.

The present study examined whether deviant peer affiliation mediated the relationship between school connectedness and PIU, and whether this mediating process was moderated by adolescent self-control. A total of 2,758 Chinese adolescents (46 % male; mean age = 13.53 years, SD = 1.06) from 10 middle schools completed anonymous questionnaires regarding school connectedness, deviant peer affiliation, self-control, and PIU. After controlling for gender, age, socioeconomic status, and parental attachment, it was found that the negative association between school connectedness and adolescent PIU was partially mediated by deviant peer affiliation. Moreover, this indirect link was stronger for adolescents with low self-control than for those with high self-control. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the social control theory and organism-environment interaction model to understand how and when school connectedness impacts adolescent PIU.

Aiming at improving the frequency efficiency of the secondary network, we set a multiantenna relay station in the secondary network to perform two-way relaying. Three linear processing schemes at the relay station based on zero forcing, zero forcing-maximum ratio transmission, and minimum mean square error criteria are derived to guarantee the quality of service of primary users and to suppress the intrapair and interpair interference among secondary users (SUs). In addition, the transmit power of SUs is optimized to maximize the sum rate of SUs and to limit the interference brought to PUs. Numerical results show that the proposed multiuser two-way relay processing schemes and the optimal power control policies can efficiently limit the interference caused by the secondary network to primary users, and the sum rate of SUs can also be greatly improved.

In comparison to conventional bi-directional 1st-order DRA, the effective noise figure (ENF) is found to be lower by amount of 0 to 4dB due to the RFL-based 2nd-order pump, depending on the on-off gain, while the low-noise 1st-order Raman pump is used for compensating the worsened signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the vicinity towards the far end of the fiber and avoiding the potential nonlinear impact induced by excess injection of pump power and suppressing the pump-signal relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer. As a result, the gain distribution can be optimized along ultra-long fiber link, due to combination of the 2nd-order RFL and low-noise 1st-order pumping, making the transmission distance be extended significantly. We utilized such a configuration to achieve ultra-long-distance distributed sensing based on Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA). A repeater-less sensing distance record of up to 154.4km with 5m spatial resolution and similar to +/- 1.4 degrees C temperature uncertainty is successfully demonstrated.

To achieve the task, Bell state measurement and unitary operation are needed. It is shown that the quantum information initially distributed in five spatially separated qubits can be remotely and probabilistically concentrated back to a single qubit without performing any global operations. The result shows a peculiar phenomenon that the RIC is not always performed perfectly. It can be achieved with certain probability.

In 2006, Chen et al. initiated the study of rough approximations on a complete completely distributive lattice (CCD lattice for short) and brought generalizations of rough sets into a unified framework. In this paper, we discuss the approximation operators on a CCD lattice. Based on the concept of neighborhood, three kinds of upper approximation operators and a kind of lower approximation operator are constructed. Basic properties of lower and upper approximation operators are examined. Furthermore, the relationships among these operators are analyzed. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Four base pair adjacent base substitution mutations (CAAA to TTTT) and eight bp insertion mutations were found in orf366-c compared with orf364. ORF366-C was predicted to contain one membrane-spanning domain using TMHMM online software. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that orf366-c was upregulated in the CMS-C line in comparison to its maintainer line at the uninucleate stage. The protokaryotic protein expression of orf366-c in Escherichia coli showed that ORF366-C could be a cytotoxic protein. All the results indicated that orf366-c may be associated with maize CMS-C.

The geometries of the reactants, transition states, intermediates and products have been optimized completely at B3LY P/6-31+G* level with the validation of the vibration analysis and the energy calculation. Atoms in molecules (AIM) theories and nature bond orbital (NBO) have been applied to discuss the orbits interaction and the bond natures. Catalytic mechanism is also interpreted by frontier orbital theory. Two possible reaction paths I-A and I-B were obtained. The results indicated that I-A is the really main possible path of the reaction. Meanwhile, the single point energy of the reaction process in gas and solvent at 6-311+G* level has been individually investigated with higher precision. The results indicate that the reaction mechanism and the change trend of correspondence energy at two different levels are consistent. The final result of the our theory study agrees with the experimental data, and it illustrate that CuI is an effective catalyst in this reaction.

The results show that when the middle layer is semiconductor layer, influenced by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the minimum transverse times difference between the spin-up and down electrons can appear if the relative angle values in two ferromagnetic layers are nearly the ii/2 and 3Tc/2, respectively. When the middle layer is insulator, the transverse time difference between the different spin orientations can be varied with the potential barrier heights and flip if the height exceeds a critical value.

Eighteen stable structures for the luteolin-guanine complexes have been found respectively. The results indicate that the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. Meanwhile, both the number and strength of hydrogen bond play important roles in determining the stability of the complexes which can form two or more hydrogen bonds. Theories of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital have also been utilized to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all the systems. The interaction energies of all the complexes which were corrected by basis set superposition error are 6.04-56.94 kJ/mol. The calculation results indicate that there are strong hydrogen bonding interactions in the luteolin-guanine complexes. We compared the interaction between luteolin and four bases of DNA, and found luteolin-thymine was the strongest and luteolin-adenine was the weakest. The interaction between luteolin and DNA bases are all stronger than luteolin-water.

The scheme takes on new process and framework in sign protocol, of which the TPM has only to perform three exponentiations, moreover, the signature which isn't knowledge of signature, is a signature of the ordinary ecliptic curve system itself. Compared to other schemes, the whole performance of the scheme is the best, and the scheme not only satisfies the same properties, but also is more simple and efficient. This paper gives not only a detailed security proof of the proposed scheme which shows that the scheme meets the security requirements of anonymity and unlinkability, but also a careful performance analysis by comparing with the existing DAA schemes.

This paper explores classification method suitable for the ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) in mountainous terrain. Mountainous terrain mapping using ALOS image faces numerous challenges. These include spectral confusion with other land cover features, topographic effects on spectral signatures (such as shadow). At first, topographic radiometric correction was carried out to remove the illumination effects of topography. In addition to spectral features, texture features were used to assist classification in this paper. And texture features extracted based on GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) were not only used for segmentation, but also used for building rules. The performance of the method was evaluated and compared with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Results showed that the object-oriented method integrating spectral and texture features has achieved overall accuracy of 85.73% with a kappa coefficient of 0.824, which is 13.48% and 0.145 respectively higher than that got by MLC method. It indicated that texture features can significantly improve overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and the classification precision of existing spectrum confusion features. Object-oriented method Integrating spectral and texture features is suitable for land use extraction of ALOS image in mountainous terrain.

Differing from the conventional WDM-PON systems, the downstream and upstream data are physically encrypted by chaotic carriers, and the decryption processes are performed based on WDM chaos synchronization. We numerically demonstrate that with sufficient wavelength spacing, a high quality chaos synchronization between the chaotic carriers with identical wavelength can be maintained, which enables the proposed WDM-PON to afford multichannel chaotic communications at high bit rates in both the downstream and upstream directions; in addition, the security of the physical layer can be greatly enhanced.

The obtained ground state structure properties are found to be consistent with existing experimental and theoretical results. The pressure-induced variations of structure parameters (a, b, c and V) indicate that the solid nitromethane has an anisotropic compressibility, and the compression along the c direction is more difficult than along a and b directions. From the vibration curves of intermolecular bond length and bond angle, we find that the C-N bond is the most sensitive among these bonds under pressure, suggesting that the C-N bonds may be broken first under external loading. The influence of pressure on the electronic properties of solid NM has been studied, indicating that solid NM is an insulating compound with a large indirect band gap and tends to be a semiconductor with increasing pressure. Finally, we predict the elastic constants and their pressure dependence for the solid NM with the bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio derived.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure and La3+ diffuses into the Bi-0.5(Na0.84K0.16)(0.5)TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a rhombohedral symmetry. The addition of La leads to the significant change in the grain morphology and size for the (Bi1-xLax)(0.5)(Na0.84K0.16)(0.5)TiO3 and a number of rod grains with the length of 10-50 mu m and the diameter of 1-2 mu m are observed in the ceramic with x = 0.04 sintered at 1,140 A degrees C for 2 h. However, as sintering temperature increases to 1,160 A degrees C, the rod grains disappears and the uniform and rectangular grains are observed in the ceramics with x = 0.04. As x increases from 0 to 0.06, the coercive field E (c) of the ceramics decreases from 4.33 to 2.81 kV/mm and the remanent polarization P (r) of the ceramics retains the high values of 25.9-27.7 mu m/cm(2). The depolarization temperature T (d) decreases from 154 to 50 A degrees C with x increasing from 0 to 0.10. All the ceramics exhibit the diffusive phase transition at high temperature (280-320 A degrees C). The ceramic with x = 0.04 sintered at 1,150 A degrees C for 2 h exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d (33) = 165 pC/N and k (p) = 32.9 %. The optimum sintering temperature is 1,150 A degrees C at which the improved piezoelectric properties (d (33) = 165 pC/N and k (p) = 32.9 %) are obtained. At the high La3+ level (x = 0.10 and 0.12), the ceramics exhibit weak ferroelectricity (P (r) = 13.0-21.2 mu m/cm(2)) and thus possess poor piezoelectricity (d (33) = 17-27 pC/N).

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Two basic double-quantitative rough set models of precision and grade and their investigation using granular computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Rough set theory; Granular computing; Variable precision rough set; Graded rough set; Double quantification; Model region	INFORMATION GRANULATION; APPROXIMATION SPACES; INCLUSION DEGREE; BETA; CLASSIFICATION; MEMBERSHIP; RULES	The precision and grade of the approximate space are two fundamental quantitative indexes that measure the relative and absolute quantitative information, respectively. The double quantification of the precision and grade is a relatively new subject, and its effective implementation remains an open problem. This paper approaches the double quantification problem using basic rough set models. The Cartesian product is a natural operator for combining the two indexes given their completeness and complementary natures, and we construct two new models using this strategy. The fundamental items (i.e., the complete system, quantitative semantics and optimal computing) of the model regions are studied using granular computing. First, the model regions (MR granules) and basic model regions (BMR granules) are defined in the traditional fashion using logical double-quantitative semantics; basic semantics (BS) is provided for the double-semantic description, and the semantic extraction of the MR and BMR granules is realized within the BS framework. Computing granules (BMRC granules) are then proposed for the basic model regions to optimize the computation, and a two-dimensional plane and granular hierarchical structure are provided. Two basic algorithms for computing the MR and BMR granules are proposed and analyzed, and the BMRC-granules algorithm generally exhibits superior performance in terms of the temporal and spatial complexity. We also explore the properties of the approximation operators and the notions of attribute approximate dependence and reduction. Finally, we provide an example application from the medical field. The two models provide a basic double quantification of the precision and grade and have concrete double-quantitative semantics; they also represent a quantitatively complete expansion of the Pawlak model.

The 3D calculations are numerically solved using the finite difference method, where the results are carefully compared with those calculated by one-dimensional (1D) model. It is found that the calculated hysteresis loops and energy products based on the two methods are consistent with each other. Both nucleation fields and coercivities decrease monotonically as the soft layer thickness L-s increases. In addition, the calculated spatial distributions of magnetization orientations in the thickness direction at various applied fields based on both methods signify a three-step magnetic reversal process, which are nucleation, growth and displacement of the domain wall. The calculated magnetic orientations within the film plane, however, are totally different according to the two methods. The 3D calculation exhibits a process of vortex formation and annihilation. On the other hand, the 1D calculation gives a quasi-coherent one, where magnetization orientation is coherent in the film plane and varies in the thickness direction. This new reversal mechanism displayed in the film plane has a systematic influence on the nucleation fields, coercivity and energy products. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Yuan, X.

In this work, the characteristics (including gain, nonlinear impairment and noise figure) for forward and backward pumping of the ring-cavity based DRA scheme are fully investigated. Furthermore, as a typical application of the proposed configuration, ultra-long-distance distributed sensing with Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) over 142.2km fiber with 5m spatial resolution and +/- 1.5 degrees C temperature uncertainty is achieved, without any repeater. The key point for the significant performance improvement is the system could offer both of uniform gain distribution and considerably suppressed pump-probe relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer, by optimized design of system structure and parameters.

The study examined the archived logs from the group wild 'Discussion' and 'History' modules with a focus on the group members' scaffolded interaction when co-constructing texts in the wild space. The analysis revealed that the participants were actively engaged in reciprocal communication in terms of content discussion, social talk, task management, technical communication and language negotiation. They were also found to have scaffolded each other's writing efforts during co-constructing the product via multiple writing change functions, including addition, deletion, rephrasing, reordering and correction. This study explicated a distinct case of 'collective scaffolding' (Donato, 1994) in collaborative writing activities, where group members were simultaneously individual novices and collective experts as they pooled their knowledge and mutually guided each other through problem solving as to writing tasks.

The absorbance of the complex is measured at 630nm. Chemical factors and rrFIA variables affecting the system are also discussed. Under the optimal conditions, the linear range of this method is 0.005-1.0mg.L-1; the detection limit is 4.01 mu g.L-1; the precision is 0.583%. Comparing the method with the National Standard Method of China, the error is within +/- 5% which meets the requirements. The proposed method is simple and convenient for the determination of formaldehyde in tannery effluent.

Moreover, NMR spectra of curcumin analogues compounds were studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) by GIAO method. The results show that the structure of four kinds of compounds, a larger conjugated system, has good planarity. Because of introducing hydroxyl and methoxy, the compound-B/C/D-C-3, C-4 and compoud-A and compound-D-C, have greater delta value. delta value of compound-A-C,. C-6 is relatively smaller, and value of C-3 is relatively larger. In the conjugated carbonyl compounds, compared with the acetaldehyde value (201 ppm), carbonyl C-13 delta value (183 ppm) decreases relatively, C-11, 15 (a-carbon) delta value(122 ppm) decreases relatively, and C-9,(17) (beta-carbon) value(145 ppm) increases relatively. Finally, the correlation between experimental & value and theoretical & value of the H-1 NMR was analyzed through the linear regression method. Results show that they have good correlation, and the experimental values coincide with the theoretical values.

The results show that the hole and electron transport rates of the six truxene derivative molecules are 0.018-0.062 and 0.055-0.070 cm(2).V-1.s(-1), respectively, and the truxene derivative molecule with 3, 8, 13-three octyloxy chains can be designed into dual polarity transport materials. In truxene derivative molecules with three alkoxy chains, introduction of three methoxyl or hydroxyl group could reduce hole and electron transport rate. The introduction of electron-donating groups or conjugated groups would reduce the energy gap of truxene derivative molecules, which meet the requirements for the organic semiconductor.

XRD patterns and HRTEM reveals that the as-synthesized MnO nanoparticles are of pure crystalline phase. TEM image shows that the MnO nanoparticles are in spherical shape with a narrow size distribution. Both oil phase and the nanoparticles protected with inert gas in the synthesis process can avoid the oxidization of Mn2+. The obvious exchange bias effect can be observed from the M-H loop of MnO nanoparticles under zero field cooling (ZFC) and FC measurements. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent AC susceptibility of the MnO nanoparticles reveals that the exchange bias effect originates from the antiferromagnetic MnO core and the spin-glass surface, rather than the superparamagnetic phase.

The performance of the Monte Carlo approach is compared with the performance of the modified maximum global discrimination index (MMGDI) method on simulations in which the only content constraint is on the number of items that measure each attribute. The results of the two simulation experiments show that (a) the Monte Carlo method fulfills all the test requirements and produces satisfactory measurement precision and item exposure results and (b) the Monte Carlo method outperforms the MMGDI method when the Monte Carlo method applies either the posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler algorithm or the hybrid Kullback-Leibler information as the item selection index. Overall, the recovery rate of the knowledge states, the distribution of the item exposure, and the utilization rate of the item bank are improved when the Monte Carlo method is used.

Method The mothers and fathers of 729 children attending primary school in Chengdu, China participated in this study. Each parent completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Chinese Family Assessment Instrument, and the Children's Attitudes and Behaviours towards Animals questionnaire. Results Findings from an actor partner interdependence model demonstrated that parents' ratings of family functioning and of their child's externalizing coping style predicted only modest amounts of variance in animal cruelty. In particular, parents' ratings of their child's externalizing coping style most consistently predicted animal cruelty. Family functioning, fathers' ratings in particular, played a minor role, more so for boys compared with girls. Conclusion This study provided the first insight into childhood animal cruelty in China, and suggests that further research may enhance our understanding of these phenomena.

Firstly, under the framework of gravitation based co-evolution, individuals of the population are divided into two subpopulations according to their fitness values (objective function values), i.e., the elitist subpopulation and the common subpopulation, and then three types of gravitation-based update methods are implemented. With the cooperation of opposition-based operation, the proposed algorithm conducts the optimizing process collaboratively. Three benchmark algorithms and fifteen typical benchmark functions are utilized to evaluate the performance of GCOO, where the substantial experimental data shows that the proposed algorithm has better performance with regards to effectiveness and robustness in solving unconstrained optimization problems.

Topological phase transitions with and without energy gap closing	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							QUANTIZED HALL CONDUCTANCE; HGTE QUANTUM-WELLS; SINGLE DIRAC CONE; INSULATORS; SURFACE; REALIZATION; BI2TE3	Topological phase transitions in a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) with an exchange field of strength g are studied by calculating spin Chern numbers C-+/-(k(z)) with momentum k(z) as a parameter. When vertical bar g vertical bar exceeds a critical value g(C), a transition of the 3D TI into a Weyl semimetal occurs, where two Weyl points appear as critical points separating k(z) regions with different first Chern numbers. For vertical bar g vertical bar < g(C), C-+/-(k(z)) undergo a transition from +/- 1 to 0 with increasing vertical bar k(z)vertical bar to a critical value k(z)(C). Correspondingly, surface states exist for vertical bar k(z)vertical bar < k(z)(C), and vanish for vertical bar k(z)vertical bar >= k(z)(C). The transition at vertical bar k(z)vertical bar = k(z)(C) is accompanied by closing of the bulk spin spectrum gap rather than the energy gap.	[Yang, Yunyou; Li, Huichao; Sheng, L.; Shen, R.; Xing, D.

The obtained normalized volume dependence of the resulting pressure is in excellent agreement with our experimental data investigated using high-P synchrotron x-ray diffraction. The elastic constants as a function of the applied pressure, the bulk modulus, Young's modulus and shear modulus on the pressure P are also successfully obtained. The superior mechanical properties indicate that c-W3N4 is a potential candidate structure to be one of the ultra-incompressible and hard materials. The high-pressure elastic constants indicate that c-W3N4 is mechanically stable up to 50GPa. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that c-W3N4 is not stable above 110GPa. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio indicated that c-W3N4 possesses ductile nature in the range of pressure from 0 to 50GPa. The calculated elastic anisotropic factors suggest that c-W3N4 is elastically anisotropic. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also investigate the thermodynamic properties of c-W3N4.

J	Zhang, DG; Ting, CS				Zhang, Degang; Ting, C. S.			Proposed detection of time-reversal symmetry in topological surface states	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SINGLE DIRAC CONE; INSULATORS; BI2TE3	By employing the T-matrix approach, we investigate a nonmagnetic impurity located on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators, where the time-reversal symmetry is preserved. It is shown that the images of the local density of states (LDOS) around the single impurity have dip-hump structures with six-fold symmetry at different bias voltages. The peaks are produced by quasiparticle interference, while the local minima at the backscattering wave vectors are due to the absence of backscatterings. With increasing the bias voltage, the peaks and dips move forward to the location of the impurity. These dips at the backscattering wave vectors in the LDOS spectra can be regarded as a signature of the time-reversal symmetry in the topological surface states, which can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy.

Growth occurred with 0-3% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.2) and at 40-60 degrees C (optimum 50 degrees C). The main respiratory quinone was MK-7. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-15:0. The DNA G+C content was 46.6 mol%. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain S9Z-7(T) should be assigned to the genus Bacillus and was related most closely to Bacillus drentensis LMG 21831(T) (sequence similarity 97.2%). The result of the DNA DNA hybridization experiment revealed a low relatedness (27.2%) between the isolate and B. drentensis LMG 21831(T). The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated that strain SgZ-7(T). represents a novel species, for which the name Bacillus thermocopriae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SgZ-7(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012030(T)=KACC 16700(T)).

This study proposes an alternative approach for obtaining optimized impurity structures using molecular dynamics calculation in conjunction with the superposition model. This new approach is specifically applied to a system named alpha-Al2O3:Yb3+, in which the simulated defect structure is used to fit the superposition model parameters directly onto the observed energy levels. Such an approach provides predicted values of crystal-field parameters, Zeeman splitting g-factor, and hyperfine structure constants. Moreover, the C-3v site symmetry is found to be a good approximation for the actual C-3 site of Yb3+, as doped in an alpha-Al2O3 crystal.

Under some suitable conditions, relations between Levitin-Polyak well-posedness and Hadamard well-posedness of a general mixed variational inequality are studied. We also establish some characterizations of Hadamard well-posedness for a genaral mixed variational inequality.

The symmetrical compounds 1, 3,7,11-trimethoxytriphenylene-2,6,10-triyl tris(3,4,5-tris(alkyloxy)benzoate), with alkyl chain lengths of C7, C8, C10, and C12, and the unsymmetrical compounds 2 were studied by using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the symmetrical compounds 1a (C7) and 1b (C8) exhibit a plastic columnar mesophase, whereas the other compounds display a hexagonal columnar mesophase over a wide temperature range. All symmetrical compounds 1 display higher isotropization temperatures than that of the unsymmetrical 2. The clearing points are lowered as the alkyl chain lengthened.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted on data collected from 700 Chinese mothers and 700 Chinese fathers, and 385 Malay parents of children aged 6-12 years. The CFA results suggested that the model was a good fit for both the Chinese and Malaysian responses. Furthermore, invariance testing showed that although there was factor loading invariance across cultures, the assumption of intercept invariance did not hold. This suggests that although the scale is suitable for use in both cultures, mean comparisons across contexts could be problematic. The internal reliabilities for the Typical and Malicious cruelty subscales were adequate across the samples. All findings show that the CABTA is a promising scale for international use.

The influence of the bandwidth Omega of spectrum, the beam decentered parameter beta, and the fractal constant alpha of the atmospheric power spectrum on the beam spreading is examined in detail. It is found that polychromatic laser beams are less sensitive to turbulence than monochromatic ones, and decentered laser beams are less sensitive to turbulence than centered ones. The larger the Omega and beta are, the larger the beam spreading is in free space, but the less the beam spreading is affected by turbulence. In turbulence laser beams with different values of beta will have the same directionality if the angular spread is chosen as the characteristic parameter of beam directionality, which is quite different from the behavior in free space. The beam spreading is largest and the influence of turbulence on the beam spreading is also largest when alpha is in a region about 3.1. In addition, the dependence of the turbulence distance on Omega and beta is also investigated, and some interesting results are obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is demonstrated that by employing a maximally entangled (respectively, nonmaximally entangled) four-particle cluster state as the quantum channel, quantum information initially and generally (respectively, specially) distributed in three spatially separated qubits can be remotely and probabilistically concentrated back to a single qubit without performing any global operations. Moreover, the total success probabilities of these two protocols are also worked out. It is more easier to realize experimentally by POVM than by projective measurement.

These catalysts are found to be highly selective and active in aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis of cinnamaldehyde and quinoline, and can be reused at least 3 times without significant loss of activity. Moreover, the catalytic activity and reusability of the catalysts can be rationally controlled by simply adjusting the content of polyphenols in the catalysts. Our strategy may be extended to design a wide range of aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis system.

By the nonequilibrium Green's function theory, we calculate the linear conductance of the system, which possesses a different Fano structure both in the parallel and anti-parallel configuration of the FM leads. The results come from the quantum interference between resonant and nonresonant processes in the system. Our studies indicate that the system is an ideal platform to investigate the Fano physics, even in some relevant experiments. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

We used genome-wide RGA markers for genetic analyses of structure and diversity in a global rice germplasm collection. Of the 472 RGA markers, 138 were polymorphic and these were applied to 178 entries selected from the USDA rice core collection. Results from the RGA markers were similar between two methods, UPGMA and STRUCTURE. Additionally, the results from RGA markers in our study were agreeable with those previously reported from SSR markers, including cluster of ancestral classification, genetic diversity estimates, genetic relatedness, and cluster of geographic origins. These results suggest that RGA markers are applicable for analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice. However, unlike SSR markers, the RGA markers failed to differentiate temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and aromatic subgroups. The restricted way for developing RGA markers from the cDNA sequence might limit the polymorphism of RGA markers in the genome, thus limiting the discriminatory power in comparison with SSR markers. Genetic differentiation obtained using RGA markers may be useful for defining genetic diversity of a suite of random R genes in plants, as many studies show a differentiation of resistance to a wide array of pathogens. They could also help to characterize the genetic structure and geographic distribution in crops, including rice, wheat, barley, and banana.

Growth occurred with 0-1 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%) and at pH 5.5-8.5 (optimum pH 7.2) and at 25-37 degrees C (optimum 30 degrees C) in nutrient broth (NB). The strain had the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions via the oxidation of various organic compounds coupled to the reduction of anthraquione-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS). Chemotaxonomic characteristics (main ubiquinone Q-10, major fatty acid C-18:1 omega 7c/C-18:1 omega 6c and DNA G+C content 67.7 mol%) were similar to those of members of the genus Azospirillum. According to the results of phylogenetic analyses, strain SgZ-5(T) belonged to the genus Azospirillum within the family Rhodospirillaceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria, and was related most closely to the type strains of Azospirillum lipoferum, Azospirillum thiophilum and Azospirillum oryzae (98.0, 97.6 and 97.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively). DNA DNA pairing studies showed that the unidentified organism displayed reassociation values of 36.7 +/- 3.7, 24.1 +/- 2.2 and 22.3 +/- 2.4 % to the type strains of A. lipoferum, A. thiophilum and A. oryzae, respectively. Similarities between nifH gene sequences of strain SgZ-5(T) and members of the genus Azospirillum ranged from 94.0 to 97.0%. A combination of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic and genotypic data clearly indicated that strain SgZ-5(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Azospirillum humicireducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SgZ-5(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012021(T)=KACC 16605(T)).

The influences of the beam decentred parameter beta, the fractal constant alpha of the atmospheric power spectrum, and the bandwidth Omega of spectrum on propagation property are studied. It is shown that the larger the value of beta, the bigger the deviation of centre of beam gravity from the propagation axiis, and the more unsymmetrical the coherence degree is. However, the on-axis spectrum is nearly independent of beta. The influence of alpha on total intensity, on-axis spectrum and coherence degree is non-monotonic. When alpha = 3.1, the propagation properties are most affected by turbulence. It is mentioned that at certain propagation distances, the shifts of on-axis spectrum are the same for different values of alpha. Furthermore, the on-axis spectral shift disappears at other propagation distances which are independent of Omega, and these propagation distances decrease due to turbulence. The results obtained in this paper will be useful for the applications of polychromatic partially coherent decentred laser beams propagating in non-Kolmogorov turbulence.

The phytase gene (phyC) of B. subtilis GYPB04 was cloned into the plasmid pMG36e for expression in Lactococcus lactis. The enzyme activity in L lactis cultured in GM17 broth was 20.25 U/mL at 36 degrees C. The expressed phytase was characterized as active in a pH range of 2.0-9.0 at a temperature range of 20-80 degrees C, with an optimum pH of 5.5-6.5 and temperature of 60 degrees C. When cultured in food-grade milk broth, the transformed L lactis grew to an OD600 nm value of 1.05 and had a phytase yield of 13.58 U/mL. In same broth under optimized conditions for cell growth and phytase production, the transformant reached an OD600 nm value of 1.68 and a phytase yield of 42.12 U/mL, representing approximately 1.6-fold and 3.1-fold increases, respectively, compared to growth in natural milk broth. Fermentation was scaled to 5 L under optimized conditions, and product analysis revealed a final OD600 (nm) value of 1.89 and an extracellular enzyme activity of 24.23 U/mL. The results of this study may be used in the dairy fermentation industry for the development of functional, healthy yogurts and other fermented dairy foods that provide both active phytase and viable probiotics to the consumer.

We first consider the situation of two sender and demonstrate a flexible deterministic joint remote state preparation compared with previous probabilistic schemes. And then generalize the protocol to multi-sender and show that by only adding some classical communication the success probability of preparation can be increased to four times. Finally, using a proper positive operator-valued measure instead of usual projective measurement, we present a new scheme via two non-maximally entangled states. It is shown that our schemes are generalizations of the usual standard joint remote state preparation scheme and more suitable for real experiments with requirements of only Pauli operations.

These two metabolites produced in high yield were purified and were characterized on the basis of spectroscopic features ((HNMR)-H-1, C-13 NMR, IR and TOF-MS). The effects of some process conditions, like the pH value, concentration of substrate, solubilizing agents have been investigated. When tween-80 was used to solubilized progesterone with concentration of 10g/L, the substrate was completely consumed at 120 h and the yield of ADD reached its maximum at 120 h with concentration of 8.355 g/L and testolactone reached its maximum at 240 h with concentration of 8.682 g/L. The conversion rate of progesterone to androstadienedione and testolactone was not affected by progesterone concentration below 10 g/L. The optimum pH value for the bioconversion was 5.8. The results obtained in this study indicate that the strain of Fusarium solani 14-2 has the ability to convert a high concentration of progesterone to produce androstadienedione and testolactone in high yield and indicating its potential for commercial production of testolactone or ADD.

The magnetic fields induce some nonlocal effects in these nonlinear Schrodinger systems, and the main goal of this paper is to understand these effects. The key is to establish some a priori estimates on the nonlocal terms generated by the magnetic field, through which we obtain various conclusions including finite time blow-ups, sharp threshold of global existence and instability of standing waves for these equations.

A K0.5Na0.5NbO3-based solid solution with perovskite structure is formed after the addition of Bi-0.5(Na0.7K0.2Li0.1)(0.5)TiO3 to K0.5Na0.5NbO3. A small amount of Bi-0.5(Na0.7K0.2Li0.1)(0.5)TiO3 retards the grain growth, induces a diffuse phase transition at T-C, decreases Curie temperature and weakens the ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The ferroelectric orthorhombic-ferroelectric tetragonal phase at TO-T is shifted to low temperature after the addition of (Na0.7K0.2Li0.1)(0.5)TiO3, leading to the formation of the coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases near room temperature at 0.015 < x < 0.035. Because of the more possible polarization states resulting from the coexistence of the two phases, enhanced piezoelectric properties are obtained in the ceramics situated near the coexistence zone of two phases. The ceramic with x=0.030 possesses the relatively high T-C of 372 degrees C and large d(33) of 183 pC/N. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study is based on the results of analytic derivation as well as those of the random phase screen approach. Our results are displayed in graphs as variations of radius of curvature against propagation distance at various settings of beam order, width parameter, source focal length, wavelength, refractive index structure constant. Our findings indicate that mBG beams, in general will have larger radius of curvature values than BG beams. It is further observed that increases in beam order will lead to greater radius of curvatures. Rises in the width parameter will reveal more the differentiations between BG and mBG beams. At small focal lengths, the difference between BG and mBG beams is hardly noticeable. Higher wavelengths will initially cause a reduction in the radius of curvature, but at longer propagation distances, the reverse will happen. Increases in the refractive index structure constant will lead to smaller radius of curvature values. A general agreement is found in comparing the analytic results of BG beams with those of phase screen approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Upon co-doping with transition metal (TM) and carbon, the calculated results show a shift in the Fermi level and a remarkable change in the covalency of ZnO. Such cases energetically favor ferromagnetic semiconductor with high Curie temperature due to p-d exchange interaction between TM ions and holes induced by C doping. The total energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic configurations, spatial charge and spin density, which determine the magnetic ordering, were calculated in co-doped systems for further analysis of magnetic properties. It was also discovered that optical properties in the higher energy region remain relatively unchanged while those at the low energy region are changed after the co-doping. These changes of optical properties are qualitatively explained based on the calculated electronic structure. The validity of our calculation in comparison with other theoretical predictions will further motivate the experimental investigation of (TM, C) co-doped ZnO diluted magnetic semiconductors.

A maintenance policy (N-1,N) based on the number of failures of the service machine is introduced into the system. Assuming that a failed service machine after repair will not be as good as new', and the spare service machine for replacement is only available by an order. More specifically, we suppose that the procurement lead time for delivering the spare service machine follows a phase-type (PH) distribution. Under such assumptions, we apply the matrix-analytic method to develop the steady state probabilities of the system, and then we obtain some system performance measures. Finally, employing an important Lemma, the explicit expression of the long-run average cost rate for the service machine is derived, and the direct search method is also implemented to determine the optimal value of N for minimising the average cost rate.

Firstly, we establish a global existence-uniqueness lemma for the SFDEs under the global Lipschitz condition in a", without the linear growth condition. Then, under the local Lipschitz condition in a",, we show that the non-continuable solution of SFDEs still exists if the drift coefficient and diffusion coefficient are square-integrable with respect to t when the state variable equals zero. And the solution of the considered equation must either explode at the end of the maximum existing interval or exist globally. Furthermore, some more general sufficient conditions for the global existence-uniqueness are obtained. Our conditions obtained in this paper are much weaker than some existing results. For example, we need neither the linear growth condition nor the continuous condition on the time t. Two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The performances of various exchange-correlation functionals and basis sets used in the polarizability calculations for these non-bonded systems were carefully examined.

However, this does not mean a simple summation rule for the polarizability of methane hydrates.

Three candidate structures of known transition-metal diborides are chosen to probe. The calculated lattice parameters, elastic properties, Poisson's ratio, and B/G ratio are derived. It is observed that the ReB2-type structure containing well-defined zigzag covalent chains exhibits an unusual incompressibility along the c axis comparable to that of diamond. Formation enthalpy calculations demonstrate that the ground-state phase is synthesizable at low pressure, whereas the other phase can be achieved through the phase transformation. Moreover, according to Mulliken overlap population analysis, a semiempirical method to evaluate the hardness of multicomponent crystals with a partial metallic bond is presented. The predicted hardness of WB2-WB2, ReB2-ReB2, and OsB2-OsB2 is in reasonable agreement with experiment data. Both strong covalency and a zigzag topology of interconnected bonds underlie the ultraincompressibilities. In addition, the superior performance and largest hardness of ReB2-ReB2 indicate that it is a superhard material. This work provides a useful guide for designing novel borides materials having excellent mechanical performances.

This paper presents a kernelized version of a quantile estimator integrated with coefficient-based regularization, which can be solved efficiently by a simple linear programming. Fast convergence rates are obtained under mild condition on the underlying distribution. Besides, this algorithm can be adapted easily to large scale problems and sparse solution is often achieved as that of Lasso. In our work we make the following main contributions: girst, improved learning rates are obtained by employing so called variance bounds, which is optimal in the literatures of learning theory; second, we establish stronger convergence rates by employing self-calibration inequalities; third, our learning rates can also be derived by a simple data-dependent parameter selection method; finally, the performance of the classical and our new algorithms are compared respectively in a simulation study and an actual problem.

Both tree and one-loop diagrams for the processes are evaluated. In addition to their decay rates and dilepton invariant mass distributions, we focus on the forward-back asymmetries in these modes. Our calculation shows that the forward-backward asymmetries in h -> gamma e(+)e(-) and h -> gamma mu(+)mu(-) could be up to 10(-2) while in the tau(+)tau(-) final state, these asymmetries are below 1%. Thus the forward-backward asymmetries in h -> gamma l(+)l(-) might be interesting observables in the future precise experiments both to test our understanding of Higgs physics in the standard model and to probe the novel Higgs dynamics in new physics scenarios.

J	Ma, Y; Ji, XL				Ma Yuan; Ji Xiao-Ling			Average intensity of tilted and off-axis Gaussian Schell-model beams propagating through a cat-eye optical lens in atmospheric turbulence	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						cat-eye optical lens; atmospheric turbulence; partially coherent beam; intensity	NON-KOLMOGOROV TURBULENCE; RETRO-REFLECTOR; LASER; RETROREFLECTOR; DESIGN; CAVITY	The influences of atmospheric turbulence and the beam coherence on the average intensity of tilted and off-axis laser beams propagating through a cat-eye optical lens in the turbulence are studied. It is shown that the oscillatory behavior and the skewness of average intensity may appear because there exist apertures and active detection laser beams are tilted or off-axis. The skewness is independent of turbulence, but the oscillatory behavior disappears due to turbulence. For a small positive defocus of a cat-eye optical lens, the on-axis average intensity reaches its maximum. The a positive defocus value becomes small as the focal length of the cat-eye optical lens decreases, but it is independent of atmospheric turbulence and the coherence of active detection laser beams. And the average intensity becomes an off-Gaussian-like profile when the propagation distance is large enough in turbulence. However, less beam spreading may occur with increasing propagation distance for active detection laser beams with less coherence, which is quite different from the behavior of laser beams propagating in free space. The better the coherence of active detection laser beams is, the more the average intensity is affected by the turbulence, but the difference is small. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for the applications is active laser detection.

The successful probability and fidelity of the four schemes reach 1. In the first two schemes, the receiver can only apply one of the unitary transformations to reconstruct the original state, making it easier for these two schemes to be directly realized. In the third and fourth schemes, the sender can preform Bell-state measurements instead of multipartite entanglement measurements of the existing similar schemes, which makes real experiments more suitable. It is found that the last three schemes may become tripartite controlled teleportation schemes of teleporting an arbitrary multi-particle state after a simple modification. Finally, we present a new scheme for three-party sharing an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state. In this scheme, the sender first shares three three-particle GHZ states with two agents. After setting up the secure quantum channel, an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state can be perfectly teleported if the sender performs three Bell-state measurements, and either of two receivers operates an appropriate unitary transformation to obtain the original state with the help of other receiver's three single-particle measurements. The successful probability and fidelity of this scheme also reach 1. It is demonstrated that this scheme can be generalized easily to the case of sharing an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state among several agents.

A computational model of visual attention was developed for solving the problem, inspired by the behavior and the neuronal architecture of human visual attention. Firstly, the global feature was extracted from input image by law's rules, then local features were extracted and evaluated with an improved saliency map model of Itti. The local features were fused into a single topographical saliency map by a multi-feature fusion operator differenced from Itti model, in which the better feature has the higher weighting coefficient and more contribution to fusion of the feature's images. Finally, the regions were "popped out" in the map. Experimental results show that the model can locate regions of interest and exclude the most background regions.

Using the probability decomposition theory and renewal process, two variants on this model, namely the late arrival system with delayed access (LAS-DA) and early arrival system (EAS), have been examined. For both the cases, recursive solution for queue length distributions at arbitrary, just before a potential arrival, pre-arrival, immediately after potential departure, and outside observer's observation epochs are obtained. Further, various performance measures such as potential blocking probability, turned-on period, turned-off period, vacation period, expected length of the turned-on circle period, average queue length and sojourn time, etc. have been presented.

The progress of synthetic organic chemistry and new molecular designing ideas will result in improved discotic liquid crystalline semiconductors. In this report, we have investigated the CuI-Et3N catalyzed click reaction between terminal alkyne and azide, both of which contain a triphenylene moiety. Series new mono-dispersed triphenylene discotic liquid crystal oligomers containing the 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole ring have been synthesized. Their structures have been fully characterized by FT-IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, MALDI Mass spectrometry. The monodispersity of oligomers has been confirmed by the result of GPC. Their thermal stability and liquid crystalline properties have been studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrated that all oligomers possessed the hexagonal columnar mesophase, and were room temperature liquid crystals.

With proper values of the relative phase, the transient absorption can be eliminated, and the high refractive index without absorption can be achieved. It is shown that amplitude of the microwave field is also important factor that can result in different gain and dispersion behaviors of the probe.

Due to its extremely harsh environment, the Tibetan Plateau breeds possibly abundant, extreme microorganisms. In this research, 67 phytate-degrading bacteria were isolated from different habitats in the Tibetan Plateau. Among all isolates, 40.3% were screened from farmland, 25.3% from wetland, 4.5% from saline-alkaline soil, 7.5% from hot springs, and 22.4% from lawns, which showed that the distribution of the phytate-degrading bacteria varied with habitats. By the PCR-RFLP method, 16 different species were identified and named, 4 of which are reported for the first time as phytate-degrading bacteria, that is, Uncultured Enterococcus sp. GYPB01, Bacillaceae bacterium strain GYPB05, Endophytic bacterium strain GYPB16, and Shigella dysenteria strain GYPB22. Through the assay of phytase activity of 16 strains, Klebsiella sp. strain GYPB15 displayed the highest capability of phytase production. Through analysis of the optimum pH, the optimum temperature, and the thermal stability of enzyme from 16 strains, some especial phytate-degrading bacteria were obtained. Our findings clearly indicate a good relation between the composition of the soils from the different environments in the Tibetan Plateau and populations of cultivable phytate-degrading bacteria. Moreover, extreme harsh soils are logically the best soils in which to find some strains of phytate-degrading bacteria for exploiting in the fields of biotechnology and industry.

In this article, we provide a sequential rank-based nonparametric adaptive EWMA (NAE) control chart for detecting the persistent shift in the location parameter. This NAE chart is a self-starting scheme and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages rather than waiting for the accumulation of sufficiently large calibration samples. Moreover, we do not require any prior knowledge of the underlying distribution, and to prespecify any tuning parameter either. A Markov chain model is suggested to calibrate the run-length distribution of NAE, which is shown to have approximate tail probability as a geometric distribution. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also is efficient in detecting various magnitude of shifts. A real-data example from manufacturing shows that it performs quite well in practical applications.

The results show that, the forward random laser pumping exhibits larger averaged gain and gain fluctuation while the backward random laser pumping has lower averaged gain and nonlinear impairment under the same signal input power and on-off gain. The effective noise figure (ENF) of the forward random laser pumping is lower than that of the bi-directional 1st-order pumping by similar to 2.3dB, and lower than that of bi-directional 2nd-order pumping by similar to 1.3dB at transparency transmission, respectively. The results also show that the spectra and power of RFL are uniquely insensitive to environmental temperature variation, unlike all the other lasers. Therefore, random-lasing-based distributed fiber-optic amplification could offer low-noise and stable DRA for long-distance transmission.

Among them, the mechanism of the high pressure structural phase transition has been studied in a detailed manner. Our results show that the structural phase transition pressure from MnP- to CuTi-structure in NiSi is 14.6GPa, which is in good agreement with other theoretical report. We have also calculated the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's coefficients, and elastic anisotropy factors of MnP-type NiSi under high pressure. We find that the pressure has an important influence on the elastic modulus. Moreover, on the basis of the Mulliken overlap population analysis, the hardness H (H=11.3GPa) of the MnP-type NiSi has been obtained, which is compatible with the experimental value.

In this paper, we assume that the retailer will provide a full trade credit to his/her good credit customers and request his/her bad credit customers pay for the items as soon as receiving them. Under this assumption, we model the retailer's inventory system as a cost minimization problem to determine the retailer's optimal inventory cycle time and optimal payment time under the replenishment rate is finite. Then, an algorithm is established to obtain the optimal strategy. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and obtain some managerial phenomena.

We study the global well-posedness, finite time blowup and asymptotic behavior of this problem. By Hamiltonian property, we establish two types of invariant evolution flows. Then from one flow and the stability of classical energy-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that the solution exists globally and scattering occurs. Finally, we get a precise blowup criterion of this problem for positive energy initial data via the other flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using the total probability decomposition technique, we study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursion expressions of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursion expressions of the steady state queue length distribution at arbitrary time epoch n(+). The results obtained in this paper indicate that the queue length distribution in equilibrium no longer follows the stochastic decomposition discipline. The important relations between the steady state queue length distributions at different time epochs (n(-), n, n(+)) are discovered. Finally, by numerical examples, we discuss the sensitivity of the steady state queue length distribution towards system parameters, and illustrate the application of the expressions for the steady state queue length distribution in the system capacity design.

J	Yu, MM; Tang, YH; Liu, LP; Cheng, J				Yu, Miaomiao; Tang, Yinghui; Liu, Liping; Cheng, Jiang			A phase-type geometric process repair model with spare device procurement and repairman's multiple vacations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Reliability; Maintenance; Phase-type distribution; Geometric process; Procurement	OPTIMAL REPLACEMENT POLICY; SHOCK MAINTENANCE MODEL; DETERIORATING-SYSTEM; TRANSIENT ANALYSIS; DISTRIBUTIONS; PRIORITY; FAILURE; TIMES	This paper analyzes a phase-type geometric process repair model with spare device procurement lead time and repairman's multiple vacations. The repairman may mean here the human beings who are used to repair the failed device. When the device functions smoothly, the repairman leaves the system for a vacation, the duration of which is an exponentially distributed random variable. In vacation period, the repairman can perform other secondary jobs to make some extra profits for the system. The lifetimes and the repair times of the device are governed by phase-type distributions (PH distributions), and the condition of device following repair is not "as good as new". After a prefixed number of repairs, the device is replaced by a new and identical one. The spare device for replacement is available only by an order and the procurement lead time for delivering the spare device also follows a PH distribution. Under these assumptions, the vector-valued Markov process governing the system is constructed, and several important performance measures are studied in transient and stationary regimes. Furthermore, employing the standard results in renewal reward process, the explicit expression of the long-run average profit rate for the system is derived. Meanwhile, the optimal maintenance policy is also numerically determined. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to decrease or avoid the shortage during the teleportation process based on probabilistic channel, we propose a new scheme to reconstruct a deterministic teleportation eight-qubit channel using Bell-state measurements based on the probabilistic channel, which replaces high-dimensional unitary operations. In our scheme, a new quantum channel without alterable parameters replaces the general quantum channel with parameters as probabilistic teleportation. It shows that if we choose an eight-qubit probabilistic channel to construct deterministic channel, the relevant parameters of the eight-qubit probabilistic channel can be avoided. Thus, in quantum teleportation process, quantum channel can be chosen as a deterministic channel. This shows that our scheme makes real experiments more suitable.

In the scheme, the sender Alice distributes a quantum secret with a Bell-state measurement and publishes her measurement outcomes via a classical channel to three agents who are divided into two grades. One agent is in the upper grade while other two agents are in the lower grade. Then introducing an ancillary qubit, the agent of the upper grade only needs the assistance of any one of the other two agents for probabilistically getting the secret, while an agent of the lower grade needs the help of all the other two agents by implementing a controlled-NOT operation and a proper positive operator-valued measurement instead of usual projective measurement. In other words, the agents of two different grades have different authorities to reconstruct Alice's secret by a probabilistic manner. Moreover, the total success probability and the maximum success probability of the scheme are also worked out.

With increasing the ratio of solvophilic to block length to solvophobic block length(R-H/T), solvophobic sphere, ordered hexagonal phase, onion phase, perforated onion phase and flocculent phase are formed, respectively. Since onion phase has potential application in controlled drug release, it has received wide attention experimentally and theoretically. Our simulation indicates onion phase forms at a certain R-H/T(close to but less than 1). A star-block copolymer molecule has two conformations in onion phase: either fully located in a shell or shared by two neighboring shells. Central structure affects onion's final shape. The molecular number of the copolymer in each shell is a quadratic function of the shell's radius. The arm number of star-block copolymer has little influence on onion's structure, but slightly affects the solvent content. Additionally, we studied the influence of arm length on onion's structure.

The results obtained in this paper are general, which can reduce to higher-order intensity moments of an arbitrary optical beam propagating in both free space and turbulence. Taking the Gaussian beam for example, the propagation of the kurtosis parameter in atmospheric turbulence is studied. It is shown that the kurtosis parameter of Gaussian beams is not a propagation invariant in atmospheric turbulence, which depends on propagation distance, waist width, inner and outer scales of turbulence and refraction index structure constant. This result is different from that obtained by using the quadratic approximation of Rytov's phase structure function or the strong fluctuation condition of turbulence. The reasonable explanations for the differences are given in this paper.

The results indicate that imaginary part decreases with frequency increasing, and tetrahedral structure of H2O and hydrogen bond of aqueous NaCl solution is broken by high temperature, leading to the decreasing of real part of dielectric. The loss angle tangent in solution obviously decreases in a low frequency zone at 353 K compared with that in pure water. Temperature window effect that complex dielectric increases or decreases with temperature varying at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz, thereby leading to the oscillation of dissipation power in microwave heating process and the nonequilibrium distribution of temperature is also confirmed.

Due to the covalent effect, the doped Fe and Co atoms preferentially occupy the A sites. It causes that some MnA (-2.1 mu B) atoms become MnD (3.2 mu B) and a local ferromagnetic structure of MnB-CoC-MnD is generated in the ferrimagnetic matrix, showing that an increment of molecular moment is as high as 6.18 mu B. The achievement of the ferromagnetic structure consumes the exchange interaction energy, consequently, reducing the T-C in Fe doping alloys. It is found that the toleration for doping Co in Mn2CoAl reaches up to x = 0.64, much more than that in Mn2CoGa (x = 0.36), and the change from ordered B2 to A2 structures along with the decrease of Al content. These observations reveal the importance of the covalent effect in these intermetallic compounds. The Cr doping shows an abnormal increment of molecular moment of 3.65 mu B and increases the T-C rapidly, which implies that Cr atoms may take an atomic configuration thereby disobeying to the occupation rule.

Calculated lattice parameters, elastic constants and theoretical Vickers hardness are in excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical results. The transition pressure from NaCl to CsCl phase is determined with values of 5.695 Mbar for TiC and 3.482 Mbar for TiN. Pressure-induced effects on mechanical properties of NaCl-type TiC and TiN show that the Vickers hardness increases first, to a maximum value 43.65 and 27.48GPa at the pressure of 2.1 and 0.9 Mbar for NaCl-type TiC and TiN, respectively, and then decreases with increasing pressure.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure. The ceramics have an orthorhombic symmetry at x <= 0.05 and transform gradually to a tetragonal structure with x increasing. A morphotropic phase boundary is formed at 0.05 < x < 0.125. A small amount of Ba-0.6(Bi0.5K0.5)(0.4)TiO3 (x >= 0.025) transforms NaNbO3 from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric and strong ferroelectricity is observed in the ceramics with x = 0.05-0.175. The ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition becomes diffusive with x increasing. High mechanical quality factor Q(m) values of 1211-1862 are obtained at x = 0.05-0.075. Due to the MPB and the weakened stability of ferroelectric domain induced by the decrease in the T-c, the ceramics with x = 0.10-0.175 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d(33) = 105-131pC/N and k(p) = 20.8-26.5%.

The obtained data were mainly used to explore origins of the observed optical-transparency loss and behaviors of the refractive-index change for MgO under relatively strong shock compression. Results show that the V-0(+2)-induced heterogeneous absorption within similar to 300-700 nm should be a source causing the transparency loss. It is found that the refractive index of perfect MgO at 532 nm increases with shock pressure. The V-0(+2) leads to a rise in refractive index, and the increment increases with shock pressure. If the vacancy concentration increases with shock pressure, effects of the V-0(+2) on refractive index are enhanced further. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[He, L.; Tang, M.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure, indicating that La ions are incorporated into Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 lattices to form a lead-free solid solution. The ceramics are transformed from coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases to pseudocubic phase with the doping level of La increasing. After the doping of La, grain growth is inhibited, ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition temperature (T (C)) is decreased and the degree of diffuse phase transition is increased. The ferroelectricity of the ceramics is weakened after the addition of La. Unlike donor-doped lead zirconate titanate ceramics, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are degraded after the partial substitution of La3+ for (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(2+) because of the weakness or disappearance of coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases near room temperature.

Nine college students from a Chinese university participated in the wiki-mediated collaborative writing project. Analyses of data from the wiki Discussion, Page, and History modules on each group tab revealed that the three small groups displayed three distinct patterns of online interaction: collectively contributing/mutually supportive, authoritative/responsive, and dominant/withdrawn. These patterns were substantiated by the roles group members assumed and members task approaches in terms of equality and mutuality. Also, findings from semi-structured interviews suggested that the different patterns of interaction influenced the students perceived learning experiences. The collectively contributing/mutually supportive group reported themost learning opportunities. This study not only fills a gap in current collaborative writing literature but also makes a theoretical contribution to research on computer-mediated interaction in collaborative learning. Pedagogical implications on how to conduct computer-mediated collaborative writing are also addressed.

The Boss Alice wants to distribute a quantum secret to seven distant agents who are divided into two grades. Three agents are in the upper grade and four agents are in the lower grade. Every agent of the upper grade only needs the collaboration of three of the other six agents to get the secret, but all the agents of the lower grade need the collaboration of all the other six agents. In other words, different agents in different grades have different authorities to recover Boss' secret. And the agent in upper grade is more powerful than the one in the lower grades which needs more information to recover the secret.

The initial state is setup by coating an amphiphilc solution with a layer of water, which prevents the formation of crossing periodic configuration. The influence of the concentration of the amphiphilc solution is investigated. At low concentration, amphiphilic molecules aggregate into a lot of micelles and small vesicles. With the increase of amphiphilc concentration, vesicles with simple and complex structures are formed. A new vesicle formation pathway, which is slightly different from the classic vesicle formation pathway, is observed in current simulation condition. Vesicle is formed by the union of many large micelles directly instead of by bilayer-vesicle transition. At high concentration, complex vesicles with multichamber structures are formed. These chambers are separated by bilayer membranes and filled with solvent particles. The volume of complex vesicle as well as its chamber number is increasing with the initial concentration. Present simulation results are in well agreement with experimental result.

The addition of 0.25 mol% MnO2 promotes grain growth, improves the ferroelectricity of the ceramics and strengthens ferroelectric tetragonal-ferroelectric orthorhombic phase transition near 40 degrees C. Because of the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases and the combinatory effects of soft and hard doping of Mn ions, the ceramic with x = 0.25 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties (d(33) = 306 pC/N and k(p) = 42.2 %, respectively). Excess MnO2 inhibits the grain growth and degrades the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. Sintering temperature has an important influence on the microstructure, tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition near 40 degrees C, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. The increase in sintering temperature leads to large grains and more noticeable tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition near 40 degrees C, enhances ferroelectricity and thus improves effectively the piezoelectricity of the ceramics. The Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 ceramic sintered at 1350 degrees C possesses the optimum piezoelectric constant d(33) value of 373 pC/N.

Our calculations are based on the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) plus local orbitals method, together with generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation potential. Half-metallic (HM) ferromagnetism is observed in these binary compounds for their optimized cell volumes. In the HM state, these compounds possess an integer magnetic moment (1.000 mu(B)) per formula unit, which is one of the important characteristics of half-metallic ferromagnets (HMFs). The ferromagnetic (FM) state is found to be stable for ZB TcC, TcSi and TcGe against the nonmagnetic (NM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states. Calculations show that half-metallicity can be maintained for a wide range of lattice constants in these binary compounds. Density functional calculations of exchange interactions and the Curie temperatures reveal similar trends for the three compounds with respect to the lattice parameter. These compounds are compatible with the traditional semiconductors, and could be useful in spinelectronics and other applications. The most important aspect of this work is to explore the possibility of not only magnetism, but HM ferromagnetism in compounds involving NM elements and 4d transition element Tc.

It is proved in this note that a domain R is a G-Dedekind domain if and only if every ideal of R is Gorenstein-projective (G-projective for short). We also show that nontrivial factor rings of Dedekind domains are QF-rings. We also give an example to show that factor rings of QF-rings are not necessarily QF-rings.

The changes of the intensity distribution, the centroid position and the mean-squared beam width of an Airy beam propagating through the atmosphere are studied by using the four-dimensional (4D) computer code of the time-dependent propagation of Airy beams through the atmosphere. It is shown that an Airy beam can't retain its shape and the structure when the Airy beam propagates through the atmosphere due to thermal blooming except for the short propagation distance, or the short time, or the low beam power. The thermal blooming results in a central dip of the center lobe, and causes the center lobe to spread and decrease. In contrast with the center lobe, the side lobes are less affected by thermal blooming, such that the intensity maximum of the side lobe may be larger than that of the center lobe. However, the cross wind can reduce the effect of thermal blooming. When there exists the cross wind velocity v(x) in x direction, the dependence of centroid position in x direction on v(x) is not monotonic, and there exists a minimum, but the centroid position in y direction is nearly independent of v(x).

The field includes AD gene clustering by computing gene order which generates higher quality gene clustering patterns than most other clustering methods. However, there are few available gene order computing methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Further, their performance in gene order computation using AD microarray data is not known. We thus set forth to evaluate the performances of current gene order computing methods with different distance formulas, and to identify additional features associated with gene order computation. Methods: Using different distance formulas- Pearson distance and Euclidean distance, the squared Euclidean distance, and other conditions, gene orders were calculated by ACO and GA (including standard GA and improved GA) methods, respectively. The qualities of the gene orders were compared, and new features from the calculated gene orders were identified. Results: Compared to the GA methods tested in this study, ACO fits the AD microarray data the best when calculating gene order. In addition, the following features were revealed: different distance formulas generated a different quality of gene order, and the commonly used Pearson distance was not the best distance formula when used with both GA and ACO methods for AD microarray data. Conclusion: Compared with Pearson distance and Euclidean distance, the squared Euclidean distance generated the best quality gene order computed by GA and ACO methods.

The structure and physical chemistry properties of the target molecule have been discussed, ranging from the traditional H-1 NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), over UV and PL spectra, and to the surface science research. The results revealed that the Py-TP2 molecule shows a narrowed energy gap between LUMO-HOMO and a bathochromic shift of 27 nm in the solid state as compared to that in solution, which is important for its practical applications in optoeletronic devices. Moreover, combined with DFT calculations, our STM results clearly show that the Py-TP2 molecule assembled into a stable long-ranged zigzag structure on HOPG surface. The interesting results in this contribution will boost the physical chemistry study of other functional materials under such methods.

We investigate the dependence of the transport properties on the wire-graphene coupling strength in detail. It is found that the peaks of the density of states fade away and the current is suppressed with the increasing wire-graphene coupling strength. The spin polarized strength of the two leads can effectively suppress the current and the transmission. The results obtained provide valuable theoretical guidance to the spintronics experiment.

Different from many previous related literatures, the nonlinear p-Laplace diffusion item plays its role in the new criterion though the nonlinear p-Laplace presents great difficulties. Moreover, numerical examples illustrate that our new stability criterion can judge what the previous criteria cannot do.

J	Liao, ZW				Liao, Zhiwu			Low-Dosed X-Ray Computed Tomography Imaging by Regularized Fully Spatial Fractional-Order Perona-Malik Diffusion	ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ABDOMINAL CT IMAGES; ANISOTROPIC DIFFUSION; NOISE-REDUCTION; EDGE-DETECTION; RECONSTRUCTION; QUALITY; SPACE	Existing fractional-order Perona-Malik Diffusion (FOPMD) algorithms used in noise suppressing suffer from undesired artifacts and speckle effect, which hamper FOPMD used in low-dosed X-ray computed tomography (LDCT) imaging. In this paper, we propose a new FOPMD method for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging, which is called regularized fully spatial FOPMD (RFS-FOPMD), whose numerical scheme is also given based on Grunwald-Letnikov derivative (G-L derivative). Here, fully spatial FOPMD represents all the integer-order derivatives (IODs) in the right hand of Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) which are replaced by fractional-order derivatives (FODs). Since the new scheme has advantages of both regularization and FOPMD, it has good abilities in singularities preserving while suppressing noise. Some real sinogram of LDCT are used to compare the different performances not only for some classical but also for some state-of-art diffusion schemes. These schemes include PMD, regularized PMD (RPMD), and FOPMD in (Hu et al. 2012). Experimental results show that besides good ability in edge preserving, the new scheme also has good stability for iteration number and can avoid artifacts and speckle effect with suitable parameters.

J	Liao, ZW				Liao, Zhiwu			Regularized Multidirections and Multiscales Anisotropic Diffusion for Sinogram Restoration of Low-Dosed Computed Tomography	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							ABDOMINAL CT IMAGES; NONLINEAR DIFFUSION; FACE RECOGNITION; NOISE-REDUCTION; EDGE-DETECTION; QUALITY; RECONSTRUCTION; OPTIMIZATION; SPACE	Although most of existing anisotropic diffusion (AD) methods are supported by prefect mathematical theories, they still lead to smoothed edges and anatomy details (EADs). They are caused by not considering the discrete nature of digital signal. In order to improve the performance of AD in sinogram restoration of low-dosed computed tomography (LDCT), we propose a new AD method, named regularized multidirections and multiscales anisotropic diffusion (RMDMS-AD), by extending AD to regularized AD (RAD) in multidirections and multiscales. Since the multidirections can reduce the discrete errors to the maximum extent, meanwhile multiscales and RAD make searching neighborhood of solution be as large as possible which can get more optimal solution to AD, the new proposed method can improve the performance of AD both in denoising and in stability of solution. Moreover, the discrete errors and ill-posed solutions occur mostly near the EADs; the RMDMS-AD will also preserve EADs well. Comparing the proposed new method to existing AD methods using real sinogram, the new method shows good performance in EADs preserving while denoising and suppressing artifacts.

J	Cao, R				Cao, Rui			Travelling Wave Solutions for Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with a Higher-Order Dispersive Term	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article								A nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a higher-order dispersive term describing the propagation of ultrashort femtosecond pulses in optical fibres is considered and is transformed into a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We investigate the exact travelling wave solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using three methods, namely, the auxiliary equation method, the first integral method, and the direct integral method. As a result, Jacobi elliptic function solution, hyperbolic function solution, trigonometric function solution, and rational solution with parameters are obtained successfully. When the parameters are taken as special values, the two known solitary wave solution and periodic wave solution are derived from the solutions obtained. The aim of the paper is to compare the efficiency of the three methods.

A splitting is used to establish the approximating equation of the system for a sufficiently small singular perturbation parameter. The approximating equation is a stochastic parabolic equation when the power exponent of the singular perturbation parameter is in [1/2, 1) but is a deterministic wave equation when the power exponent is in (1, +infinity). Moreover, if the power exponent of a singular perturbation parameter is bigger than or equal to 1/2, the same limiting equation of the system is derived in the sense of distribution, as the perturbation parameter tends to zero. This limiting equation is a deterministic parabolic equation.

Phase-dependent squeezing and entanglement in a cavity QED	OPTIK			English	Article						Squeezing; Entanglement; Cavity QED; Relative phase	ATOMIC SYSTEM; SINGLE-ATOM; QUANTUM; OUTPUT; LIGHT; FIELD	The output squeezed spectrum of the output two modes from a cavity QED system which is embedded by a four-level atom driven by two classical fields are calculated. The effects of the cavity decay rates, relative phase between two classical fields, and effective coupling constants between the atom and the cavity on the entanglement and squeezing of the two cavity modes are investigated. It is shown that the depth of the squeezing or entanglement spectrum is insensitive to the cavity decay rates while its width is dependent on the cavity decay rates and the coupling constants. In particular, the squeezing or entanglement spectrum including their maximal values and widths is remarkably affected by the relative phase between the classical fields. It is found that the output spectrum varies with the relative phase in a cosine-like behavior with a period of 2 pi. The results can indicate how to suitably adjust the relative phase for acquiring maximal squeezing or perfect entanglement for the two cavity fields. This will be useful in quantum communication and computation. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Mu, J. J.; Hou, B.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to obtain the LMI-based stability criterion derived by a fixed point theory. It is worth mentioning that LMI methods have high efficiency and other advantages in largescale engineering calculations. And the feasibility of LMI-based stability criterion can efficiently be computed and confirmed by computer Matlab LMI toolbox. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Here we report the synthesis of three tetraphenylethene-triphenylene oligomers 7, 8E and 8Z by a CuSO4/sodium ascorbate catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC), and the successful separation of the cis-and trans-isomers by column chromatography. The structure and conformation of the oligomers were fully characterized. The photophysical properties were studied by using UV-vision and photoluminescent (PL) spectroscopy. The morphology of the aggregates was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the thermal stability and mesomorphic properties were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results revealed that the oligomers possess an AIE effect, but display no mesomorphism. However, 7 exhibits a hexagonal columnar mesophase when mixed with 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone (TNF), forming a charge transfer complex.

Our probabilistic shape model estimates the probability of an individual voxel belonging to the estimated shape of the object. The probability density of the estimated shape is derived from a combination of the shape variations of target class and the observed shape information. To better capture the shape variations, we used probabilistic principle component analysis optimized by expectation maximization to capture the shape variations and reduce computational complexity. The maximum a posteriori estimation was optimized by the iterated conditional mode-expectation maximization. We used 72 training datasets including low-and high-contrast computed tomography images to construct the shape models for the liver, spleen, and both kidneys. We evaluated our algorithm on 40 test datasets that were grouped into normal (34 normal cases) and pathologic (six datasets) classes. The testing datasets were from different databases and manual segmentation was performed by different clinicians. We measured the volumetric overlap percentage error, relative volume difference, average square symmetric surface distance, false positive rate, and false negative rate and our method achieved accurate and robust segmentation for multiple abdominal organs simultaneously.

Although species richness, composition, diversity and cover of moss communities vary, they grow well almost in all forests. Why mosses can grow in different conditions? What are the adaptive strategies of mosses in different forests along primary succession sequences? It is not still completely clear. In order to answer these questions, nutrient and carbohydrate accumulation in mosses were tested along the primary succession following deglaciation of Hailuogou glacier, Gongga Mountain, China. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) content, total organic carbon (TOC), soluble sugar and starch accumulated in the dominant moss species were determined and compared. TOC increased insignificantly with forest age. N, P, K contents in mosses were significantly higher in forests with dense shrubs, where N content was seperately 1.69% in A. hookeri and 1.35% in P. schreberi in 30 yr aged forest, P content in 30 yr and 52 yr aged forest was seperately 0.022% and 0.020% in A. hookeri and 0.020% and 0.017% in P. schreberi, and K content in 30 yr and 52 yr aged forest was seperately 0.570% and 0.553% in A. hookeri and 0.490% and 0.493% in P. schreberi. Soluble sugar was higher in the early stage of succession, but the opposite was observed for starch and non-structure carbohydrate content, which was lower in early successional stage. Mosses adopted different adaptive strategies in different aged forests along receding glacier, in which starch and N, P, K contents were key for adaptiation. That is, mosses accumulated much more starch in the severe environment of early succession stage. In more favourable environment, N, P, K was found to be accumulated for plant growth.

Thanks to some methods different from those of previous literature, the difficulties brought by fuzzy stochastic mathematical model and impulsive model have been overcome. By way of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, It formula, Dynkin formula and a differential inequality, new LMI-based global stochastic exponential stability criteria for the above-mentioned PDEs are established. Some applications of the obtained results improve some existing results on neural networks. And some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method due to the significant improvement in the allowable upper bounds of time delays.

The as-prepared CaWO4 microcrystallines were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and photoluminescence spectra (FL). The growth process of these CaWO4 microcrystallines obtained in the presence of CTAB and PVA has been discussed. The structural characterization results indicate that the obtained CaWO4 are ellipsolid-like microcrystallines with the average size of approximate to 350 nm in short axis and approximate to 800 nm in long axis, and the CaWO4 microcrystallines possess a pure scheelite structure with a tetragonal symmetry. The FTIR spectra provide the evidence of W-O stretching vibration in [WO4](2-) tetrahedrons at 796 cm(-1) and W-O bending bands at 438 cm(-1). FL spectra reveal that the CaWO4 microcrystallines exhibit the only green peak at 430nm excited by ultraviolet ray (UV) with the wavelength at 220 nm, 240 nm and 260 nm, respectively. The SEM results indicate that the morphology of the CaWO4 microcrystallines can be affected by the concentration of surfactants.

Fuzzy mathematical model brings a great difficulty in setting up LMI criteria for the stability, and stochastic functional differential equations model with nonlinear diffusion makes it harder. To study the stability of fuzzy CGNNs with diffusion, we have to construct a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional in non-matrix form. But stochastic mathematical formulae are always described in matrix forms. By way of some variational methods in W-1,W-p(Omega), Ito formula, Dynkin formula, the semi-martingale convergence theorem, Schur Complement Theorem, and LMI technique, the LMI-based criteria on the robust exponential stability and almost sure exponential robust stability are finally obtained, the feasibility of which can efficiently be computed and confirmed by computer MatLab LMI toolbox. It is worth mentioning that even corollaries of the main results of this paper improve some recent related existing results. Moreover, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed method due to the significant improvement in the allowable upper bounds of time delays.

We find that the vacuum-induced coherence and the relative phase between probe and coupling fields can clearly affect the transient absorption (gain) properties, but the steady-state value of the probe absorption (gain) is remarkably dependent on the incoherent pumping. And the steady population distribution is sensitive to the incoherent pumping and insensitive to the relative phase. Additionally, it is shown that the lasing with inversion can be reached with the incoherent pumping. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The polymer is shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) with carboxyl groups; the mesogenic unit, named as cholesteryl isonicotinate (INCh), is a liquid crystal compound with an electron-rich pyridine ring. The H-bonding interactions between carboxyl and pyridine ring are proved by FT-IR spectroscopic analysis and H-1 solid-state NMR. The introducing of INChs promotes the bonded PU segments to change into glassy form by restraining the movement of polymer chains, which is responsible for the triple-shape memory property. Therefore, the composite presents excellent triple-shape effect, and may be of great potential for applications in the biomedical field.

In this paper, we propose a simple way to improve the spatial adaptivity (SA) of NLMs using pointwise fractal dimension (PWFD). Unlike existing fractal image dimensions that are computed on the whole images or blocks of images, the new PWFD, named pointwise box-counting dimension (PWBCD), is computed for each image pixel. PWBCD uses a fixed size local window centered at the considered image pixel to fit the different local structures of images. Then based on PWBCD, a new method that uses PWBCD to improve SA of NLMs directly is proposed. That is, PWBCD is combined with the weight of the difference between local comparison windows for NLMs. Smoothing results for test images and real sinograms show that PWBCD-NLMs with well-chosen parameters can preserve anatomical features better while suppressing the noises efficiently. In addition, PWBCD-NLMs also has better performance both in visual quality and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) than NLMs in LDCT imaging.

We also show the uniqueness of the common fixed point in the case of a generalized ordered g-quasicontraction mapping. Finally, we prove fixed point theorems for mappings satisfying the so-called weak contractive conditions in the setting of a partially ordered metric space. Presented theorems are generalizations of very recent fixed point theorems due to GoluboviA double dagger et al. (Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2012:20, 2012). MSC: 47H10, 47N10.

We find that the spin flip tunneling between dots due to the spin-orbit coupling can lift the quantum dot spin blocking. We also study the effects of the spin flip of quantum dots due to the hyperfine interactions and the spin exchange interaction on magnetic transport properties of the system.

With experimentations, the new algorithm is thereafter evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - Nearest-neighbor algorithm is the earliest proposed and the main collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, and its recommendation quality is seriously influenced by the sparsity of user ratings. By using rough set theory, the nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering algorithm can be improved in the sparsity data situation. The union of user rating items is used as the basis of similarity computing among users, and then a rating predicting method based on rough set theory is proposed to estimate missing values in the union of user rating items for decreasing sparsity. Findings - The sparsity problem of collaborative filtering can be alleviated by using the union of user rating items and estimating missing values based on rough set theory. The experimental results show that the new algorithm can efficiently improve recommendation quality of collaborative filtering. Originality/value - The union of user rating items was used as the basis of similarity computing among users. A rating prediction method based on rough set theory with an assistant method was proposed to complete the missing values in the union of user rating items. Orthogonal list was used to storage user-item ratings matrix.

This paper presents research on the existing clustering algorithm applied in heterogeneous sensor networks and then puts forward an energy-efficient prediction clustering algorithm, which is adaptive to sensor networks with energy and objects heterogeneous. This algorithm enables the nodes to select the cluster head according to factors such as energy and communication cost, thus the nodes with higher residual energy have higher probability to become a cluster head than those with lower residual energy, so that the network energy can be dissipated uniformly. In order to reduce energy consumption when broadcasting in clustering phase and prolong network lifetime, an energy consumption prediction model is established for regular data acquisition nodes. Simulation results show that compared with current clustering algorithms, this algorithm can achieve longer sensor network lifetime, higher energy efficiency, and superior network monitoring quality.

Considering an early arrival system, as soon as the server empties the system in a regular busy period, he leaves the system and takes a working vacation for a random duration at time n. The service times both in a working vacation and in a busy period and the vacation times are assumed to be geometrically distributed. By using embedded Markov chain approach and difference operator method, queue length of the whole system at random slots and the waiting time for an arriving customer are obtained. The queue length distributions of the outside observer's observation epoch are investigated. Numerical experiment is performed to validate the analytical results.

Data used in the study were obtained from 58 Malaysian Malays, 95 Malaysian Chinese, 242 Chinese from China, and 81 non-Asian Australians aged 12-19 years (M=15.72, SD=1.72) who were recruited from high schools. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing dissatisfaction with their body overall, and dissatisfaction with varying aspects of their body. Malaysian Chinese were the most dissatisfied with their bodies. After controlling for body mass index (BMI), age and dissatisfaction with weight/shape, upper, middle and lower body, and muscles, dissatisfaction with the face was positively correlated with overall body dissatisfaction among Malaysian Malays and Australians. These findings demonstrate the importance of using assessment measures that address all possible areas of body focus as well as being tailored to the relevant culture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The monomers [HC C(CH2)(m)C18H6(OC6H13)(5); m = 1, 3] are prepared by consecutive etherization, coupling, and etherization reactions, and the chemical structures were confirmed by mass spectroscopy and H-1/C-13-NMR. The phase behaviors of the monomers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The results show that both of the monomers form a hexagonal columnar liquid crystal phase at room temperature. The monomers are polymerized using [Rh(nbd)Cl](2) as catalyst and producing soluble polymers in the yields of 55% and 52%, respectively. The chemical structures and phase behaviors of the two polymers are characterized and evaluated by IR, NMR, TGA, DSC, and WAXD analyses. Both of the two polymers show enhanced thermal and chemical stability with thermal decomposition temperatures up to higher than 340 degrees C due to the protection of the "jacketed effect" of the side-chain triphenylenes wrapped around the rigid polyacetylene main-chain. The polymers adopt a columnar shaped structure and self-organized into hexagonally packed columnar phase. The relative electron density maps of the columnar structure are also reconstructed.

And then, we employ the first-principles plane wave pseudopotential density functional theory method to calculate the equilibrium lattice parameters and the thermodynamic properties of YAG. The obtained lattice parameters are consistent with the experimental data and the available theoretical data of others. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the dependences of the normalized primitive volume V/V (0) on pressure P, the Debye temperature , and the heat capacity C (V) on pressure P and temperature T, as well as the variation of the thermal expansion alpha with temperature and pressure are obtained successfully.

However, it is a challenge to do this type of reaction in the absence of a copper catalyst. In this report, we overcome this problem and synthesise two non-C 3 symmetric triphenylene discotic liquid crystal trimers by a copper-free click reaction involving a linear internal alkyne and an azide. Both products are liquid crystals at room temperature; one trimer exhibits an ordered hexagonal columnar mesophase (Colho) and a plastic hexagonal columnar mesophase (Colhp) on cooling, and just a plastic hexagonal columnar on heating, whilst the other displays an ordered rectangular columnar mesophase (Colro).

First, an auxiliary mixed equilibrium problem (AMEP) is introduced. The existence and the uniqueness of the solutions to the AMEP are proved under quite mild assumptions without any coercive conditions. Next, by using the solution mapping of the AMEP, a system of generalized equation problems (SGEP) is considered, and its equivalence with the SGMIEP is shown. By using the SGEP, a new iterative algorithm for solving the SGMIEP is proposed and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. These results are new, which unify and generalize some recent results in this field.

In the first scheme, we demonstrate that two non-maximally four-particle cluster states can be used to realize probabilistically sharing an unknown three-particle GHZ-type state within either distant agent's place. In the second protocol, we demonstrate that a non-maximally four-particle cluster state can be used to teleport an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state in a probabilistic manner with appropriate unitary operations and POVM. Moreover the total success probability of these two schemes are also worked out.

It's very significant that designing fast algorithm for set operation. In this paper, the quantum algorithm for calculating intersection set is presented. Its runtime is for case and for case (i.e. C is empty set), while classical computation needs O (|A| x |B|) steps of computation in general, where |.| denotes the size of set. The presented algorithm is the combination of Grover's algorithm, classical memory and classical iterative computation, and the combination method decrease the complexity of designing quantum algorithm. The method can be used to design other set operations as well.

Energy Prices and Housing Property Demand in Shanghai, China	ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY			English	Article						cointegration; energy price; finite sample; housing demand; industrial output; structural break; weak exogeneity	EXPLAINING COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS; LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS; RESIDENTIAL ENERGY; IMPROVEMENTS	This study investigates long-run relations among the prices of fuel and power, sales of new residential constructions, and total industrial output in Shanghai, China. Structural break and unit root tests show that these three variables each contain a unit root. Allowing for finite-sample biases, a trivariate cointegration system is suggested. Both housing property demand and industrial output are weakly exogenous for the equilibrium system, but energy prices are not. Therefore, the results imply that housing demand influences energy prices in the long run, but not vice versa. By decreasing the demand (or expected demand) for residential property, municipal authorities could expect to restrain or reduce energy use and prices, thereby facilitating the restructuring of the economy into a resource-saving one.

The results of X-ray diffraction show that the ceramics exhibit a pure perovskite structure at 0 <= x <= 0.175 and 0 <= y <= 0.175, suggesting that Ca2+ and Zr4+ diffuse into BaTiO3 lattices to form a solid solution. The substitution of Zr4+ for the B-site Ti4+ ions of BaTiO3 decreases greatly Curie temperature T-C and strengthens the relaxor character of the ceramics, while the addition of Ca2+ has a weak influence on T-C and leads to an inhibition of grain growth. Owing to the more possible polarization states resulting from the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases near room temperature, the ceramics with x = 0.075-0.125 and y = 0.1 exhibit excellent piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 254-345 pC/N and k(p) = 38.0-45.2%, respectively.

Thirteen stable structures for the catechin-thymine complexes have been found which form two hydrogen bonds at least. The vibrational frequencies are also studied at the same level to analyze these complexes. The results indicated that catechin interacted with thymine by three different hydrogen bonds as N-H center dot center dot center dot O, C-H center dot center dot center dot O, O-H center dot center dot center dot O and the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. Theories of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital have been adopted to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all systems. The interaction energies of all complexes have been corrected for basis set superposition error, which are from -18.15 kJ/mol to -32.99 kJ/mol. The results showed that the hydrogen bonding contribute to the interaction energies dominantly. The corresponding bonds stretching motions in all complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer, which is in agreement with experimental results.

In the scheme, the Boss Alice partitions her unknown original state with two Bell-state measurements and a single-qubit projective measurement. Then she publishes her measurement results via a classical channel. With an agent Charlie's help, another agent Bob can recover the original state in probabilistic manner by performing a proper POVM.

Compared with the previous researches, the new technique can provide more and accurate information. In this study, ultrasound diagnosis shows that longitudinal wave can real-time characterize the data of the injection process and polymer morphology changes, including melt flow arrival time, the part ejection time, filling and packing stages, polymer solidification process, and the morphology changes during polymer crystallization. Shear waves can real-time diagnose Young's and shear storage modulus, anisotropy property of polymer in injection molding. During our research, real-time ultrasonic diagnosis shows that the storage modulus along the vertical direction is larger than that of the parallel to the melt flow direction under our setup injection conditions. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis measurements present that it is because the crystalline lamellas of HDPE are parallel arrangement and grow in a vertical to melt flow direction owing to injection shear force under a certain injection conditions.

Fast and efficient multidimensional scaling algorithm for mobile positioning	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							OF-ARRIVAL MEASUREMENTS; LOCATION ESTIMATION; SYSTEMS; MITIGATION	Mobile station (MS) localisation that plays an important role in the process of target continuous localisation has received considerable attention. In this study, a new framework based on subspace approach for positioning an MS at minimum localisation system with the use of time-of-arrival measurements is introduced. Unlike ordinary multidimensional scaling algorithm using eigendcomposition or inverse computation to estimate the MS position, a computationally simple weighting estimator is proposed by introducing Lagrange multiplier and mean-square error weighting matrix. Computer simulations are included to corroborate the theoretical development and to contrast the estimator performance with several conventional algorithms as well as the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). It is shown that the new method with low computational complexity attains the CRLB for zero-mean white Gaussian range error at moderate noise level.

The ceramics with perovskite structure are transformed from tetragonal to pseudocubic phases by increasing the doping level of MnO2. After the addition of MnO2, the Curie temperature T-C of the ceramics decreases and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition at T-C becomes more diffusive. Because of the donor and acceptor doping effects of Mn ions simultaneously, the piezoelectric constant d(33), electromechanical coupling coefficient k(p), relative permittivity epsilon(r), and mechanical quality factor Q(m) are enhanced considerably after the addition of 1 mol% MnO2. The ceramic with 1 mol% MnO2 doping possesses the optimum piezoelectricity (d(33) = 131 pC/N and k(p) = 21.8%) and relatively high Q(m) = 627. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Following problems will be discussed: 1) The probability that the server is in a "generalized busy period" at time n; 2) The probability that the service station is in failure at time n, i.e., the transient unavailability of the service station, and the steady state unavailability of the service station; 3) The expected number of service station failures during the time interval (0, n], and the steady state failure frequency of the service station; 4) The expected number of service station breakdowns in a server's "generalized busy period". Finally, the authors demonstrate that some common discrete-time queueing models with unreliable service station are special cases of the model discussed in this paper.

The phase structure is analysed for a strong-coupling Thirring model. Subsequently, a soliton star model with cool Fermi matter coupling is constructed. We found that the soliton state and the mass of a star can change the density and pressure of matter at certain temperatures. Moreover, the stability of dark energy in the center of a star is proved when the coupling coefficient of the scalar field and Fermi matter satisfies some constraint conditions.

First, a system of auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problems are introduced. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the system of auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problems is proved. Next, by using the auxiliary principle technique, an iterative algorithm for solving the system of generalized mixed equilibrium problems is constructed. Finally, the existence of solutions and the convergence of iterative sequences generated by the algorithm are proved under suitable conditions.

The insensitizing problem consists in finding a control function such that some energy functional of the equation is locally insensitive to a perturbation of the initial data. As usual, this problem can be reduced to a partially null controllability problem for a cascade system of two parabolic equations with equivalued surface boundary conditions. Compared the problems with usual boundary conditions, in the present case we need to derive a new global Carleman estimate, for which, in particular one needs to construct a new weight function to match the equivalued surface boundary conditions.

Here, the ring and a tangential lead form a single collimating contact. In the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we exactly treat such tunneling problems. Our numerical results clearly show that if the incident electronic energy E equals to the integer times of the driven frequency omega, i.e., E=nh omega, n = 1,2,3,..., then the resonant peaks of transmissions (along the tangential-connected lead) reveal. The feasibility to test such an effect, due to the nonelastic interactions between the transported electrons and the applied oscillating external fields, is also discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that the calculated hysteresisloops, the critical fields and the magnetic phase diagrams agree well with the results given by the 1D model. However, the calculated nucleation mode is a quasi-curling one where the magnetic moment exhibits a curling in the film plane and varies in the thickness direction, in contrast with the reported quasi-coherent mode. The calculated spatial distribution of the magnetization orientation in the thickness direction at various applied fields signifies a three-step magneticreversalprocess, which includes nucleation, growth and displacement of the domain wall as well as the rotation and the reversal of magnetization in the hard phase. The magneticreversal of the hard phase is much slower than that given by the 1D model, leading to a more slant hysteresisloop near the coercivity point. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigation of eccentric PVA brush behaviors in post-Cu CMP cleaning	MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						CMP; PVA brush; Cleaning; Eccentric; Tribology	MECHANICAL PLANARIZATION	Behavior of an eccentric PVA brush is investigated during post-Cu chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) brush cleaning. It is observed that the measured contact pressure and contact area of the eccentric brush vary significantly under different brush orientations. Moreover, the eccentric brush behaves differently from the good (i.e. concentric) brush in both the variance of shear force as well as the force spectra during cleaning. This study provides a rapid detection method to screen out eccentric brushes before they are used in semiconductor manufacturing, thereby potentially reducing wafer defects as well as chemical, water, and energy consumption associated with using eccentric PVA brushes.

It is found that the results obtained from the two methods are consistent with each other, where the nucleation and coercive fields decrease monotonically as the soft layer thickness L-s increases whilst the largest maximum energy products (roughly 600 kJ/m(3)) occur at L-s = 5 nm. Moreover, the calculated angular distributions in the thickness direction for the magnetic moments are similar. Nevertheless, the calculated critical fields and energy products by 3D OOMMF are systematically smaller than those given by the 1D model, mainly due to the local demagnetization fields, which are taken into account in the 3D calculation and ignored in the 1D calculation. It is demonstrated by the 3D calculation that the large demagnetization fields in the corners of the soft layers reduce the nucleation fields and thus facilitate the magnetic reversal. Such an effect enhancesas L-s increases. When L-s=20 nm, the differences between the coercivity is as large as 30%, while the nucleation fields obtained by the two methods have opposite signs.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure. The coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases is formed at room temperature in the ceramics with 0.45 <= x <= 0.55. The tetragonal-orthorhombic phase-transition temperature TO-T decreases from 110 to 54 degrees C with x increasing from 0.35 to 0.55 and then increases from 84 to 144 degrees C with x further increasing from 0.6 to 0.7, while the Curie temperature T-C deceases from 388 to 348 degrees C with x increasing from 0.35 to 0.70. Because of the coexistence of the two phases near room temperature, the ceramics with x = 0.50 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 230 pC/N and k(p) = 49%. The ceramics possess good time stability of piezoelectric properties. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The results indicate that as the intensity of the electromagnetic filed increased, the radial distribution functions of the aqueous solution of N,N-dimethyl formamide became more pronounced. There appears to be a threshold microwave field intensity below which no tangible field effects are apparent, 10(5) V/m, the lowest field strength used in this study, there was no significant effect on the systems structure. Microwave energy is partly transferred to intermolecular energies of mixture, which induce the change of angle distribution functions of the hydrogen bonding.

The M-2-factor of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs is always larger than that of truncated Gaussian beams both in free space and in turbulence. However, in turbulence the beam quality of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs may be better than that of truncated Gaussian beams if the z(R) is taken as the characteristic parameter of beam quality. For laser beams with AMs and PFs in turbulence, the beam quality expressed in terms of z(R) is consistent with that in terms of the M-2-factor versus the phase fluctuation parameter alpha, but not versus the intensity modulation parameter sigma(A). The beam quality of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs is less sensitive to turbulence than that of truncated Gaussian beams. The beam quality of laser beams with smaller alpha and larger sigma(A) is less affected by turbulence than those with larger alpha and smaller sigma(A). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that the pressures for transition from the NaCl structure to the CsCl structure are 364.1 GPa (for GGA) and 322.2 (for LDA) from equal enthalpies. The calculated ground state properties such as equilibrium lattice constant, bulk modulus, and its pressure derivative are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical data of others. Moreover, the dependences of the relative volume V/V-0 on the pressure P, the Debye temperature Theta(D) , and heat capacity C-V on the pressure P and temperature T, as well as the variation of the thermal expansion alpha with temperature and pressure are also successfully obtained.

All the ceramics possess a perovskite structure with orthorhombic symmetry, indicating that (Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3 diffuses into NaNbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution. A low (Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3 doping level transforms the NaNbO3 ceramics from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric. The ceramics with x <= 0.075 are normal ferroelectric, and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase become diffusives with the doping level of Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 increasing. As x increases, the Curie temperature of the ceramics decreases linearly, while the relative permittivity er increases. 0.925NaNbO(3)-0.075(Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3 ceramic exhibits the relatively large piezoelectric constant (d(33) = 58 pC/N), high Curie temperature (T-C = 228 degrees C) and good temperature stability, suggesting that the ceramics are one of new possible candidates for lead-free piezoelectric materials.

The effective actions at finite temperature are derived by means of the perturbation and non-perturbation functional integrals method. The stability of coexistence phase is analyzed respectively in the weak and strong coupling case. It is shown that the coexistence phase is not stable when fermions have an attractive potential g < 0, and the stable coexistence phase can form when fermions have an exclude potential g > 0.

Three stable phases were considered, i.e., two hexagonal phases (epsilon and theta) and a cubic delta phase. The obtained equilibrium structure parameters and ground state mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with the experimental and other theoretical results. A full elastic tensor and crystal anisotropy of the ultra-incompressible TaN in three stable phases are determined in the wide pressure range. Results indicated that the elastic properties of TaN in three phases are strongly pressure dependent. And the hexagonal theta-TaN is the most ultraincompressible among the consider phases, which suggests that the theta phase of TaN is a potential candidate structure to be one of the ultraincompressible and hard materials. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that theta-TaN is not stable above 53.9 GPa. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio indicated that the epsilon and delta phases possess brittle nature in the range of pressure from 0 to 100 GPa. While theta phase is brittleness at low pressure (below 8.2 GPa) and is strongly prone to ductility at high pressure (above 8.2 GPa). The calculated elastic anisotropic factors for three phases of TaN suggest that they are elastically highly anisotropic and strongly dependent on the propagation direction.

The results showed that appropriate concentration range of REE could promote Spirodela polyrhiza absorbing N, P effectively, improve the carbonic anhydrase activity (a maximum value of 0.684 EU/mu g) and improve the efficiency of light energy utilization and transformation which made photosynthesis improved and thus it could promote plant growth, with the highest rate of growth of Spirodela polyrhiza reaching 63.85% and maximum value of chlorophyll up to 9.594 mg/L and further, with the increase of Spirodela polyrhiza breeding density, dissolved oxygen (DO) reduced but chemical oxygen demand (COD) raised (a maximum value of 6.448 mg/L) in water, which eventually led to the water quality worsen. The research results demonstrate that the suitable contents of REE can promote small aquatic plants such as Spirodela polyrhiza growing, thereby contributing a positive catalytic effect to the development process of eutrophication. This no doubt provides basic theory for sustainable development and utilization of rare earth and provides a scientific basis for the study of rare earth influencing on the promoting regularity of water eutrophication and integrated control of water pollution.

The formation mechanism for the H2D+ under laboratory conditions is also analysed. The structural pattern of H2D+ and the mean internuclear separation are determined using Coulomb explosion technique. Once again, the existence of wake effects in the interaction of molecular ions with solid is confirmed and three-body wake effect module is used to determine the geometric structure of H2D+.

Thicker and larger ring sized annular beams are found to exhibit larger absolute field correlations. For the same transverse distance at the receiver plane, annular beams attain larger field correlations if the transverse distance starts from the receiver origin. Comparisons of the annular beam absolute field correlations in extremely strong turbulence with the no turbulence results show that the absolute field correlation variations follow similar trends, except that the magnitudes of the absolute field correlations are much smaller in extremely strong turbulence and the annular fields become decorrelated at very short transverse distances. When the inner scale of turbulence becomes smaller, the absolute field correlations of the annular beams in extremely strong turbulence become smaller. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this letter, an effective OFDMA cellular mobile system based on multiple fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) angle reuse scheme is proposed. In this system, FrFT angle is regarded as new resource, which can be optimally allocated to each BS of cellular system. Because chirp bases, generated by different FrFT with optimally allocated angle, are mutually approximately orthogonal at same subcarrier, ICI can be perfectly suppressed. Both theory and simulations show the essential advantages over conventional OFDMA cellular systems for ICI suppression and bit error rate.

It is observed that the C-C bonds has maximum variation, followed by C-H and C-O bonds, which means decomposition of the initial explosion may begin with the C-C bonds.

Firstly, we divide the network into rings, and then have an analysis and calculation on nodes' energy consumption in each ring of the network when clustering algorithm is applied to collect data. We also put forward a scheme of nonuniform node distribution on the basis of the proportion of nodes' energy consumption in each ring, and change nodes' active/hibernating states under density control mechanism when network coverage is guaranteed. Simulation shows NNDC algorithm can satisfyingly balance nodes' energy consumption and effectively avoid the problem of energy hole.

Ni complex was found to be an efficient catalyst for the first direct cross coupling of benzyl alcohols with aryl/alkyl Grignard reagents, while Fe, Co, or Ni catalysts could promote the unprecedented conversion of benzyl alcohols to benzyl Grignard reagents in the presence of (n)hexylMgCl.

Based on CBC, an anonymous authentication protocol featured with conditional privacy preservation and non-repudiation is proposed for vehicular ad-hoc network. First, a certificate-based signature scheme with only one pairing computation and only one element signature is proposed. Then, an anonymous authentication protocol is constructed by applying the proposed signature scheme and a novel concept called the account index which helps to realize On-Board Units anonymity, non-reputation, and conditional privacy preservation. A secure session key is established in the protocol which provides perfect forward secrecy.

Our numerical results clearly show that the transporting probabilities of the incident photons are controlled by adjusting the coupling strength between the quantum dot and the surface plasmons. Therefore, the proposed nano-device can be served as either a quantum optical switcher or a beam splitter of the resonant photons.

Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O-3 diffuses into NaNbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with perovskite structure. The addition of Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O-3(x >= 0.025) transforms NaNbO3 from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric. The diffusive ferroelectric - paraelectric phase transition is induced in the ceramics with high concentration of Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O-3. The ceramics with x = 0.05-0.125 possess large P-r values of 18.6-25.5 mu C/cm(2). A morphotropic phase boundary between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases is formed at 0.05 < x < 0.15, leading to a significant enhancement of piezoelectric properties. The ceramic with x = 0.125 situated near the morphotropic phase boundary exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties. d(33) = 151 pC/N and k(p) = 31.6%.

The analytic formula of the effective radius R of curvature of truncated laser beams with amplitude modulations (AMs) and PFs propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived by using the statistical optics method. It is shown that the R in free space increases with the increases of the phase fluctuation parameter, the intensity modulation parameter and the truncated parameter. And the influence of turbulence on the R also increases with the increases of the three parameters. Furthermore, the R of Gaussian beams is largest in free space, but it is most affected by turbulence. Therefore, in turbulence the R of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs is even larger than that of Gaussian beams when the propagation distance is large enough. In particular, the relative effective radius R-r of curvature varies non-monotonically with propagation distance, and there exists a minimum at a propagation distance where the influence of turbulence on the R is largest. In addition, the position where the R-r reaches its minimum increases with the increasees of intensity modulation and phase fluctuation.

J	Liu, J; Kuang, XY; Wang, ZH; Huang, XF				Liu Jun; Kuang Xiao-Yu; Wang Zhen-Hua; Huang Xiao-Fen			Pressure-induced structural transition and thermodynamic properties of RhN2 and the effect of metallic bonding on its hardness	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						phase transition; elasticity; hardness	1ST-PRINCIPLES; NITRIDES; OSN2	The elastic constant, structural phase transition, and effect of metallic bonding on the hardness of RhN2 under high pressure are investigated through the first-principles calculation by means of the pseudopotential plane-wave method. Three structures are chosen to investigate for RhN2, namely, simple hexagonal P6/mmm (denoted as SH), orthorhombic Pnnm (marcasite), and simple tetragonal P4/mbm (denoted as ST). Our calculations show that the SH phase is energetically more stable than the other two phases at zero pressure. On the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, we find that the phase transition pressures from an SH to a marcasite structure and from a marcasite to an ST structure are 1.09 GPa and 354.57 GPa, respectively. Elastic constants, formation enthalpies, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Debye temperature of RhN2 are derived. The calculated values are, generally speaking, in good agreement with the previous theoretical results. Meanwhile, it is found that the pressure has an important influence on physical properties.

The method was applied to images of western Sichuan Province, China taken between 2002 and 2008. The model for extracting data on snow cover from MODIS images was created by spectral analysis. The multi-temporal snow layers were used to evaluate the temporal and spatial change in the area under snow cover between 2002 and 2008 using overlay and statistical analysis in ARCGIS. The majority (60.4%) of western Sichuan was rarely covered by snow and only 0.3% was covered by perennial snow in 2002. Snow cover was primarily distributed in Garz and Aba. The area under snow cover was significantly and negatively correlated with the average monthly temperature and rainfall in 2002. The largest area under snow cover was measured in 2006 and the smallest was in 2007. Similarly, the area of snowmelt was the highest in 2006 and lowest in 2007. In general, the elevation of the snow line increased throughout the period 2002-2008; however, the elevation decreased in some years. Our results provide an important insight into the distribution of snow in this region, and may be useful for climate modeling and predicting the availability of water resources and the occurrence of floods and droughts.

Near-field and far-field spreading of partially coherent annular beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							DARK HOLLOW BEAMS; RANDOM-MEDIA; DIRECTIONALITY	Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle, closed-form expressions for the Rayleigh range and the far-field divergence angle of partially coherent annular beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived by using the Wigner distribution function (WDF). Taking the Rayleigh range and the far-field divergence angle as the characteristic parameters of near-field and far-field spreading, respectively, the spreading of partially coherent annular beams both in free space and in turbulence is studied in detail. It is found that the effect of the strength of turbulence and beam parameters (e.g., the spatial correlation length, the waist width, and the wave length) on the beam spreading in the near field is in agreement with that in the far field. However, in turbulence, the effect of the obscure ratio of annular beams on the spreading is different between in the near field and in the far field. Namely, in turbulence the beam spreading in the near field becomes smaller and the beam spreading in the far field becomes larger as the obscure ratio increases. In particular, the effect of turbulence on the Rayleigh range and the far-field divergence angle is nearly unchanged versus the obscure ratio when the spatial correlation length is small. The main results obtained in this paper are explained physically.

Magnetotransport anisotropy in lattice-misfit-strained ultrathin La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 films epitaxially grown on (110)-oriented SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							THIN-FILMS; MAGNETORESISTANCE	(110)-Oriented manganite thin films are essential for studies on the interface effects concerning spin-polarized electron injection, especially the proximity effect with high temperature superconducting cuprates. However, due to the peculiarity of the (110) plane, an atomically smooth surface generally can only sustain up to a quite low film thickness. Therefore, anisotropy along the two crystallographically asymmetric [001] and [1 (1) over bar0] in-plane directions in ultrathin (110)-oriented manganite films are worthy of a careful investigation. Here, studies on the magnetotransport anisotropy of (110)-oriented epitaxial La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) thin films of 20 nm thickness grown by pulsed laser deposition are reported. Both SrTiO3 (STO) and LaAlO3 (LAO) substrates were adopted to highlight the lattice-misfit-strain effects. While in LCMO/STO film, the magnetic easy axis is along the [1 (1) over bar0] direction, in LCMO/LAO film the [001] direction is easier. Accordingly, the resistivity and magnetoresistance measured along the easy axes are lower. The correlation between the magnetic and transport anisotropy then has been undoubtedly demonstrated. For the LCMO films on STO, property evolutions with temperature and magnetic field are free from fine features, and thus clear and easily understood, making STO a more appropriate substrate for interface studies in (110)-oriented heterostructures.

Significant deterioration of energy products in exchange-coupled composite magnets	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							PERMANENT-MAGNETS; NANOLAYERS; REMANENCE; MEDIA	Hysteresis loops and energy products have been calculated reliably for a hard/soft/hard trilayer system with a deviation of easy axis beta taken into account, which affects the coercivity significantly, and hence leads to much smaller energy products than those predicted by the previous theory. Such a deterioration is much sharper than the corresponding fall for a single-phased material and a 30 degrees deviation of in-plane easy axis could result in a drop of the maximum energy product by more than 60%. Consequently, the advantage of the composite phase can be realized only when the material is well oriented, which offers a possible explanation to the large discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical energy products.

This study investigated the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale (RS) for college students with Wenchuan earthquake exposure. Methods: A total of 888 Chinese college students with Wenchuan earthquake exposure completed a set of scales, including the RS, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Self-rating Scale, the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale for Chinese. The internal consistency and concurrent validity were investigated. Sex and regional differences were also examined. Results: The results of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 4-factor structure was suitable for both Chinese samples 1 and 2. The Cronbach a coefficient was .94 (P < .01), split-half reliability coefficient was .92 (P < .01), and the test-retest reliability coefficient was .82 (P < .01). The total resilience score was correlated negatively with posttraumatic stress disorder (r = 0.21; P < .01), depression (r = 0.45; P < .01), anxiety(r = 0.34; P < .01), and neuroticism (r = 0.23; P < .01), and correlated positively with extraversion (r = 0.23; P < .01). Men showed higher resilience scores than women, and people living in the high earthquake-exposure areas reported higher level of resilience than those from low earthquake-exposure areas. Conclusions: The Chinese version of the RS was demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement in assessing resilience for Wenchuan earthquake survivors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

First, an auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problem (AGMEP) to compute the approximate solutions of the generalized mixed equilibrium problems (GMEP) and bilevel generalized mixed equilibrium problems (BGMEP) involving set-valued mappings is introduced. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the AGMEP is proved under quite mild conditions. By using auxiliary principle technique, new iterative algorithm to compute the approximate solutions of the GMEP and the BGMEP are suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithms are proved under quite mild assumptions. These results are new and generalize some recent results in this field.

Influence of Vessel Configuration and Size of Vessel Wall Based on the Numerical Analysis of Polar Solvent Heated by Microwave	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Microwave heating; Polar solvent; Temperature uniformity; Multiphysics		The choice of vessel is vital for heating polar solvent. In this paper, water at silicon carbide or glass vessel with three different configurations and size of vessel wall were heated by microwave. The uniformities of temperature were analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics under different configurations and size of vessel wall during microwave heating. It was concluded that the temperature uniformities were influenced by the parameters of different configurations and size of vessel wall, when the improvement in temperature uniformity is not obvious for one configuration, it can be significantly improved by changing to another specific configuration and size of vessel wall.

Study on the Temperature Uniformity of Water with Rotation or Stir under Microwave Heating	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Microwave heating; Stir; Rotation; Temperature uniformity		Stir, rotation and other methods have been widely used to improve the heating uniformity during microwave heating nowadays. In this paper, the heating uniformity of water with rotation or stir and their combination under microwaves were investigated through multiphysics calculation. It was found that among the three above cases, the temperature uniformity of water under microwave heating with the combination of stir and rotation is the best. The improvement of temperature uniformity of microwave heating water with rotating tray is poor while the speed is increasing; within a certain range, contrarily,increase of the stir speed can significantly improve the temperature uniformity of water. The hotspots cannot be completely dispelled by stir.	[Li, K.; Yang, X. Q.; Wu, L.; Huang, K.

Seeking for new resistance source is urgently required to meet the challenge of the rapid loss of resistance due to the co-evolution of the pathogen's virulence. Wheat line 07jian126 (Triticum aestivum L.) is highly resistant to the Pm disease prevailing in Sichuan province of China. Previous study showed that a SSR marker Xbarc183 was linked to the Pm resistance in 07jian126, which might be controlled by a single dominant gene, designated as Pm07J126. In this study, two additional F-2 populations were used to confirm the linkage between Pm07J126 and Xbarc183. Furthermore, rye chromatin was detected in 07jian126 by molecular analysis of a rye-specific SCAR marker O5 which co-segregated with Pm07J126. This result indicated that Pm07J126 might originate from rye. The reaction patterns to 21 Bgt isolates and molecular marker analysis implied that Pm07J126 might be different from the known rye-derived Pm genes Pm7, Pm8, Pm17 and PmJZHM2RL. Chromosome observation, molecular marker, and A-PAGE analysis suggested that 07jian126 might be a rye introgression line and neither contain 1RS translocation nor secalins gene. Consequently, 07jian126 could be considered as a valuable resource for Pm resistance development of wheat. Besides, the molecular markers Xbarc183 and O5 are useful in marker-assisted selection of Pm07J126 in wheat breeding programs.

The white noises appear both in the model and in the dynamical boundary condition. Since the energy relation of this stochastic system does not directly imply the a priori estimate of the solution, we propose a pseudo energy equation to infer almost sure boundedness of the solution. Then a unique invariant measure is shown to exist for the system.

J	Liao, QY				Liao, Qunying			The Gaussian normal basis and its trace basis over finite fields	JOURNAL OF NUMBER THEORY			English	Article						Finite fields; Complexity; Trace map; Dual bases; Gaussian normal bases	NORMAL BASES; COMPLEXITY	It is well known that normal bases are useful for implementations of finite fields in various applications including coding theory, cryptography, signal processing, and so on. In particular, optimal normal bases are desirable. When no optimal normal basis exists, it is useful to have normal bases with low complexity. In this paper, we study the type k (>= 1) Gaussian normal basis N of the finite field extension F-qn/F-q, which is a classical normal basis with low complexity. By studying the multiplication table of N, we obtain the dual basis of N and the trace basis of N via arbitrary medium subfields F-qm/F-q with m vertical bar n and 1 <= m <= n. And then we determine all self-dual Gaussian normal bases. As an application, we obtain the precise multiplication table and the complexity of the type 2 Gaussian normal basis and then determine all optimal type 2 Gaussian normal bases.

The results show that, by selecting appropriate input optical power, as large as > 20 dB RIN suppression improvement can be achieved for R-SOA, without sacrificing the noise rejection bandwidth. With increased injection current, the optimized input signal power is decreased and the operation region is extended for the best RIN reduction. For RIN suppression in WDM spectrum slicing, the bandwidth optimization of receiver filter should be performed to avoid the spectral broadening induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) and four wave mixing (FWM). Our derived result is helpful for designing and optimizing the R-SOA in application of noise suppression enhancement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current paper presents a variant of the normalized cut (NCut) algorithm based on homogeneous patches (HP-NCut) for the segmentation of ultrasonic breast tumors. Methods: A novel boundary-detection function is defined by combining texture and intensity information to find the fuzzy boundaries in US images. Subsequently, based on the precalculated boundary map, an adaptive neighborhood according to image location referred to as a homogeneous patch (HP) is proposed. HPs are guaranteed to spread within the same tissue region; thus, the statistics of primary features within the HPs is more reliable in distinguishing the different tissues and benefits subsequent segmentation. Finally, the fuzzy distribution of textons within HPs is used as final image features, and the segmentation is obtained using the NCut framework. Results: The HP-NCut algorithm was evaluated on a large dataset of 100 breast US images (50 benign and 50 malignant). The mean Hausdorff distance measure, the mean minimum Euclidean distance measure and similarity measure achieved 7.1 pixels, 1.58 pixels, and 86.67%, respectively, for benign tumors while those achieved 10.57 pixels, 1.98 pixels, and 84.41%, respectively, for malignant tumors. Conclusions: The HP-NCut algorithm provided the improvement in accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods. A conclusion that the HP-NCut algorithm is suitable for ultrasonic tumor segmentation problems can be drawn. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The results show that higher awards, easier tasks, longer duration and lower competition intensity lead to a higher number of solvers. Higher awards, longer duration and higher difficulty level of tasks lead to higher ability level of winners, but competition intensity and market price for other competing projects do not show significant correlation with the ability level of winners.

Inspired by Newton's universal gravitation model and based on binary differences strategy, we propose an algorithm for global optimization problems, which is called the binary difference gravitational evolution (BDGE) algorithm. BDGE is a population-based algorithm, and the population is composed of particles. Each particle is treated as a virtual object with two attributes of position and quality. Some of the best objects in the population compose the reference-group and the rest objects compose the floating-group. The BDGE algorithm could find the global optimum solutions through two critical operations: the self-update of reference-group and the interactive-update process between the reference-group and floating-group utilizing the gravitational evolution method. The parameters of BDGE are set by a trial-and-error process and the BDGE is proved that it can converge to the global optimal solution with probability 1. Benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of BDGE and to compare it with classic Differential Evolution. The simulation results illustrate the encouraging performance of the BDGE algorithm with regards to computing speed and accuracy.

First, an auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problem (AGMEP) to compute the approximate solutions of the generalized mixed equilibrium problems (GMEP) and bilevel generalized mixed equilibrium problems (BGMEP) involving set-valued mappings is introduced. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the AGMEP is proved under quite mild conditions. By using auxiliary principle technique, new iterative algorithm to compute the approximate solutions of the GMEP and the BGMEP is suggested and analyzed. Strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the proposed algorithms is proved under quite mild assumptions. These results are new and generalize some recent results in this field.

Our phylogenetic results indicate: (1) the subfamily Natricinae is strongly supported as monophyletic including a majority of extant genera, and a poorly known and previously unassigned species Trachischium monticola, (2) two main clades are inferred within Natricinae, one containing solely taxa from the Old World (OW) and the other comprising taxa from a monophyletic New World (NW) group with a small number of OW relatives. Within the first clade, the genera Xenochrophis and Amphiesma are apparently not monophyletic. Divergence dating and ancestral area estimation indicate that the natricines originated in tropical Asia during the later Eocene or the Oligocene. We recover two major dispersals events out of Asia, the first to Africa in the Oligocene (28 Ma) and the second to the Western Palearctic and the New World at 27 Ma. This date is consistent with the dispersal of numerous other OW groups into the NW. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Gong, X; Li, XX; Feng, L; Xia, R				Gong, Xun; Li, Xin-Xin; Feng, Lin; Xia, Ran			A robust framework for face contour detection from clutter background	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Skin color; Single Gaussian model; Face contour; C-V; Level set		When applying Chan-Vese (C-V) model to segment a face from an image, the result is always influenced by the initial position, especially in a real scenarios with clutter background. An improved skin tone detection model is proposed based on the Gaussian function, which could generate an accurate initial contour for C-V model. As the single Gaussian model (SGM) only uses the prior information to determine the likelihood of a pixel, it lacks adaptability for an image with lighting and poses variances. A more adaptive SGM (ASGM) is proposed in this paper that, by updating the model parameters according to the input image, could provide a more stable approximation of face region. And then, we apply the estimated initial contour to C-V model for precise face segmentation. Tests conducted on a public face dataset (220 images with pose and illumination changes) have shown that the accuracy of skin region detected by ASGM is at a ratio higher than 99%, which lays a good foundation for further segmentation by the C-V model. Extensive experiments have validated effectiveness and efficiency of our system in face segmentation.

We put the background spacetime into the Kruskal-like coordinate to find the period with respect to Elucidean time. Our result shows that area spectrum of the rotating black hole is evenly spaced and the spacing is the same as the one of Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that area spectrum of a black hole is independent of its parameters. Different from the quasinormal mode analysis, our study need not to impose the small angular momentum limit.

The spatial and temporal evolution of the predominantly strike-slip movement along the fault remains unclear, as estimates for the initiation age of its different segments range from 5 to 13 Ma. The Jinhe-Qinghe fault (JqF; the south part of the Longmen Shan thrust belt) provides a key for understanding the tectonic role and deformation history of the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault zone in terms of timing, magnitude of displacement, and spatial-temporal evolution. This paper presents research on the structure and chronology of the JqF. The results of a geometric and kinematic study of the Jinhe-Qinghe fault show it to be a thrust fault with a left-lateral strike slip component: The strike slip offset extends at least 13-18 km to southwest, based on the shortening of its folds and faulting, and based on stream deflection. Ten apatite fission track apparent ages shows pronounced change in age/elevation gradient at similar to 17 +/- 2 Ma, consistent with an abrupt increase of exhumation due to uplift of the hanging wall of the JqF at that time. Combined with the age of deformed Tertiary strata in the footwall of the JqF and the geometric relationships of the JqF with the Chenghai fault and the XFZ, this indicates that the JqF was active between 17 and 5 Ma. Based on the fault chronology, geometry, and movement, we suggest that the fault was a transpressional structure at the south end of the XFZ during the period from 17 to 5 Ma. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

But this method can :not be very effective and precise in spatial alignment, due to a small number of moving objects in the scene, limited coverage of the trajectories and the short temporal duration of the trajectories. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a new sequence-to-sequence alignment method, combining the method proposed by Caspi et al. with a feature-based image registration method. In this paper, we made a comparison between our method and that of Caspi et al. Experimental results show that the presented method improves alignment precision both on X-axis orientation and on Y-axis orientation. The PSNR value is approximately improved by 13.5dB. At the same time, the time needed by Our-method will be slightly increased but can be ignored. When the results of the alignment are applied in space-time super-resolution reconstruction, the effect also proves the validity of our-method.

The results showed that: while increasing pressure up to 5.69 GPa, excitation energy for a soliton reduced from 10.02 to 3.64 eV, meanwhile the gap and the lattice distortion disappeared. Original band changed from style of a semiconductor to that of a metal. The results agree with the experimental observations that electrical conductivity is increasing with applied pressure until a saturated value. Our theory supports soliton-conduction mechanism for the polymer under pressures less than 5.69 GPa. Under higher pressure, carriers would be electrons as if in a metal.

The model of extracting vegetation from CBERS images was formulated using the differentiation knowledge of vegetation and non-vegetation discovered by image analysis and geographic analysis. The damage degree index (DDI) of the vegetation was defined here, which was the difference of the normalized difference vegetation index before the earthquake and that after earthquake. The China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite (CBERS)-02's images acquired, respectively, on 6 May and 27 June 2008, the model of extracting vegetation, and DDI were used to obtain the information about the area and degree of the damage vegetation in the study. There was 87.94 square kilometers vegetation damaged by Wenchuan earthquake, which accounted for 7.9% of the total area in Dujiangyan city. The area percentage of the damage vegetation in each grade related strongly and positively to the elevation grade and slope grade and weakly related to the aspect type. The distribution characteristics of the damage vegetation were useful for making plan of restoring vegetation here.

The doped Ln ions have noticeable influences on the TE characteristics of [Ca2CoO3](0.62)[CoO2] system. The substitutions of Ln(3+) for Ca2+ change hole concentration and meanwhile introduce a strong point-defect phonon scattering. From Ln=La to Yb, the increased structural distortion, enhanced electron correlation, and increasing ionic mass fluctuation are responsible for the different TE response. Furthermore, compared with the ceramic bulks, in the highly textured nano-sized compacts the thermal conduction is efficiently suppressed.

The absorption spectrum, PL spectra and photoluminescence efficiency of complexes were compared with the corresponding complexes with acetylacetone (acac) as the ancillary ligand. It was found that all of their photoluminescence efficiency could be improved when sterically hindered 3-acetyl camphor was introduced. When [(ppy)(2)Ir(acam)] was used as light-emitting devices, the EL spectra has the largest peak intensity at 516 nm. The device has the greatest brightness of 10930 cd/m(2) and maximum brightness efficiency of 14.6 cd/A at 12 V. The highest power effciency and brightness are 4.23 lm/W and 698 cd/m(2) respectively at 10.7 V.

J	Dou, LY; Ji, XL; Li, PY				Dou, Lingyu; Ji, Xiaoling; Li, Peiyun			Propagation of partially coherent annular beams with decentered field in turbulence along a slant path	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							DARK HOLLOW BEAMS; FLAT-TOPPED BEAMS; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; GAUSSIAN BEAMS; DIRECTIONALITY; MEDIA	The model of partially coherent annular beams with linear non-uniformity field profile in the x direction is set up. The analytic expressions for the average intensity and the centre of gravity of partially coherent annular beams with decentered field propagating through atmospheric turbulence along a slant path are derived. The propagation equation governing the position of the intensity maximum is also given. It is found that the beam non-uniformity is amended gradually as the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence increase. The centre of beam gravity is independent of both the propagation distance and the turbulence. However, the position of the intensity maximum changes versus the propagation distance and the turbulence, and is farthest away from the propagation z-axis at a certain propagation distance. When the propagation distance is large enough, the position of the intensity maximum reaches an asymptotic value which increases with decreasing the zenith angle and is largest for the free space case. When the propagation distance is large enough, the position of the intensity maximum is not on the propagation z-axis, and is nearer to the propagation z-axis than the centre of beam gravity. On the other hand, changes in the intensity maximum in the far field are also examined in this paper.

The simulation is performed by relaxing disordered copolymer nanodroplets in a solvent bath. Microphase separation is then carried out inside the nanodroplet, which allows block copolymers self-assemble into many new morphologies differing from those formed in pure melts or in solution. These patterned structures depend on the volume ratio of solvophilic/solvophobic blocks (R-H/T). As the value of R-H/T increases, the following structures are formed: plum-pudding microsphere, volleyball-like structure, multilamellar vesicle, cage-like structure, nanorods, and discrete micelles. Density analysis is performed to characterize the onion's structure. At high R-H/T values, block copolymers exhibit mainly solvophilicity and form swollen loose structures or small micelles suspended in the solvent. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical results.

The system error induced by the non-local effect worsens with increased powers of probe wave and Raman pump. For smaller Brillouin pump power, the non-local effect is almost independent of Brillouin pump power. For larger Brillouin pump power, the non-local effect deteriorates gradually due to Raman gain saturation and cross-gain modulation (XGM). The purely backward pumping (relative to probe light) is preferable for non-local effect suppression. The frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) and time-division-multiplexing (TDM) technologies exhibit similar performance for suppressing the non-local effect under the same conditions. The sensing range near the far-end (relative to the Brillouin pump) should be appropriately shorter to minimize the non-local effect in FDM and TDM. The physical mechanisms of the non-local effect in long-distance BOTDA with Raman amplification are also shown.

The performance comparisons on flatness of signal distribution, optical signal-noise ratio (OSNR), and noise figure (NF) among first-order, second-order, and third-order Raman pumping based on UL-FLs are discussed numerically. The results display that the gain distribution is pushed more uniformly along UL-FLs using third-order Raman pumping, which is very useful to further extend the quasi-lossless midspan distance. For transparency transmission, enhanced quasi-lossless transmission could be achieved without sacrifice to OSNR and NF. We also analyze the transmission dynamics of loss-managed fundamental solitons for different pumping configurations. The amplifier span and transmission quality are improved considerably, even for lower dispersion lengths, by employing the proposed scheme.

The observed values of the permittivity gradually increased with increasing concentration of methanol in ethanol, whereas the relaxation time decreased with increasing concentration and temperature. The increase in the dielectric I relaxation time in ethanol-methanol mixtures is attributed to the spatial constraints of ethanol molecules on the hydrogen-bond network. I the reorientation processes in pure liquids and mixtures are controlled by enthalpic rather than by entropic factors.

On the basis of electrostatics, rate theory, solution thermodynamics and hydrogen bond dynamics we have summarized dielectric "mixing rules" that describe the frequency-dependent dielectric properties of the solvent organic aqueous solution based on solution composition and the dielectric parameters for the solution components. These "mixing rules" yield good agreement between the predicted and experimental dielectric properties of DMF-water mixture's over all solution compositions.

Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Blarinella based on one nuclear (ApoB) and two mitochondrial (cyt-b, 16S rRNA) genes. Our results supported the monophyly of the genus Blarinella and the valid species status of Blarinella wardi. Nevertheless, two morphologically defined Blarinella species, B. quadraticauda and B. griselda, were poorly differentiated by molecular data; B. quadraticauda was found embedded within B. griselda making the latter a paraphyletic group. These results indicate that B. quadraticauda might be under a budding speciation scenario or is a restricted geographical subspecies of B. griselda. Phylogeographic analyses suggest that diversification and speciation of Blarinella might have been promoted by vicariance events associated to the complex topography of Southwest China. Further morphological, genetic and ecological studies are necessary to examine these hypotheses.

Impact of step defects on surface states of topological insulators	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SINGLE DIRAC CONE; BI2TE3	The eigenstates in the presence of a step defect (SD) along the x or y axis on the surface of topological insulators are exactly solved. It is shown that unlike the electronic states in conventional metals, the topological surface states across the SD can produce spin rotations. The magnitudes of the spin rotations depend on the height and direction of the SD. The oscillations of local density of states (LDOS) are characterized by a wave vector connecting two points on the hexagonal constant-energy contour at higher energies. The period of the oscillation caused by the SD along the y axis is root 3 (1/root 3) times that induced by the SD along the x axis at a larger positive (negative) bias voltage. With increasing the bias voltage, the period of the oscillation, insensitive to the strength of the SD, becomes smaller. At lower energies near the Fermi surface, the two types of wave vectors coexist in the LDOS modulations. These results are consistent qualitatively with recent observations of scanning tunneling microscopy.	[Zhang, Degang; Ting, C.

We find that the properties of transient process can be greatly affected by the SV whether the vacuum-induced coherence (VIC) exists or not. The combined influence of the SV and the VIC can dramatically modify the transient absorption and gain. Especially, the transient gain can be almost eliminated in the absence of VIC. And the response time from the transient to the steady situation is dependent on the SV. When including the VIC, the transient and steady optical properties display a reverse variation with the SV. Besides, it is shown that the considerable steady state population without inversion can be always induced by the SV.

On the basis of Marcus theory, the charge-transfer is the course of electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction, and the greater the electron-phonon interaction coupling strength, the greater the reorganization energy is, which is not conducive to the charge transport. The greater the electron-electron interaction coupling strength, the greater the charge transfer matrix element is, which is beneficial to the charge transport. Charge transport properties of triphenylene derivative discogens molecules with a 1, 2, 3-triazole, 1, 2, 4-triazole or I. 2, 3-trinitrogen-2, 3-cyclopenten side chain are investigated computationally. The results show that the electronic mobility and the hole mobility of I, 2, 3-triazole triphenylene derivative are nearly equal, and the rate constant is 2 x 10(12) s(-1). The hole transfer rate constant of the 1, 2, 4-triazole triphenylene derivative molecules is 5 x 10(12) s(-1), which is ten times higer than the electronic transfer rate constant. Triphenylene containing 4, 5-dihydro-1, 2, 3-triazole has better electronic mobility but smaller hole mobility than triphenylene discogens containing 1, 2, 3-triazole or 1, 2, 4-triazole, and the electronic mobility is 3 x 10(12) s(-1), which is equal to ten times of the hole mobility. The hole transfer or electron transfer rate of the target molecules is affected mainly by the transfer matrix element, in other words, electron-electron interaction coupling strength determines the magnitude of mobility rate variation.

The results of XRD diffraction show that after the addition of K+, Ba2+, and Li+, a new Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based solid solution with a pure perovskite structure is obtained and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.10 < x < 0.20, 0.01 < y < 0.04, and z = 0.075. The partial substitutions of (Bi0.5K0.5)(2+), Ba2+, and (Bi0.5Li0.5)(2+) for the A-site (Bi0.5Na0.5)(2+) ions of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 decrease effectively the coercive field E-c and improve significantly the remanent polarization P-r. The piezoelectricity of the ceramics is greatly enhanced because of the MPB, lower E-c and higher P-r. The ceramic with x = 0.15, y = 0.02, and z = 0.075 situated at the MPB exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d(33) = 209 pC/N and k(p) = 30.5%. Two dielectric anomalies are observed, suggesting diffuse phase transition characteristics. The depolarization temperature T-d reaches a minimum value near the MPB. The deformed P-E loop is observed near/above T-d, indicating that the ceramics may contain both the polar and nonpolar regions. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The structure of the LiFePO4/C composites was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The micromorphology of the precursors and LiFePO4/C powders was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Laser particle analyzer and BET were also used to characterize the materials. It was found that the micromorphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area of LiFePO4/C composites were greatly influenced by the molecular weight of LiPAA. The electrochemical properties of the LiFePO4/C composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and constant current charge/discharge cycling tests. The results showed that the molecular weight of LiPAA, heating rate, synthetic temperature and sintering duration directly affected the electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/C composites. The sample with the optimized electrochemical properties were obtained in the following conditions, i.e., LiPAA with the molecular weight of 20,000, heating rate of 10 A degrees C min(-1), synthetic temperature of 700 A degrees C and sintering duration of 15 h.

J	Ding, XP				Ding, Xie Ping			Existence and algorithm of solutions for mixed equilibrium problems and bilevel mixed equilibrium problems in Banach spaces	ACTA MATHEMATICA SINICA-ENGLISH SERIES			English	Article						Mixed equilibrium problem; bilevel mixed equilibrium problem; monotonicity; auxiliary principle; iterative algorithm; Banach space	PREDICTOR-CORRECTOR ALGORITHMS; FIXED-POINT PROBLEMS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ITERATIVE SCHEME; MAPPINGS; PRINCIPLE	Some classes of mixed equilibrium problems and bilevel mixed equilibrium problems are introduced and studied in reflexive Banach spaces. First, by using a minimax inequality, some new existence results of solutions and the behavior of solution set for the mixed equilibrium problems and the bilevel mixed equilibrium problems are proved under suitable assumptions without the coercive conditions. Next, by using auxiliary principle technique, some new iterative algorithms for solving the mixed equilibrium problems and the bilevel mixed equilibrium problems are suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the proposed algorithms is proved under suitable assumptions without the coercive conditions. These results are new and generalize some recent results in this field.

We assume that the spare system for replacement is available only by an order and the lead time for delivering the spare follows exponential distribution. Moreover, we also suppose that the repair facility may be subject to failure during the repair period. Under these assumptions, by using the geometric process and the supplementary variable technique, some important reliability indices such as the system availability, rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) and the probability that the system is waiting for replacement are derived. An ordering policy N - 1 and a replacement policy N based on the number of failures of the system are also considered. Furthermore, employing several Lemmas, the explicit expression of the average cost rate is derived. Meanwhile, the optimum value N* for minimizing the average cost rate could be determined numerically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The modified Becke and Johnson potential is used to give a much more reasonable semiconductor gap. Our results demonstrate that ferromagnetic phase is always energetically favorable than the antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic ones for all considered compounds. Magnetic moments are mainly attributed to the partly filled anionic p states. Especially, half-metallic ferromagnetism has been obtained for Ca- and Sr-doped AlAs, which may be promising for spintronic applications. The calculated results are also useful for understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Our data indicate that the calculated refractive-index of a perfect LiF crystal increases more rapidly with increasing pressure than those determined by shock experiments and above similar to 50-60 GPa there is also a similar behavior in density-pressure curve. It is found that Li-1 (+) vacancy-induced decreases in refractive-index and density are supposed to be a possible source causing these differences. Our results support that the vacancy-defect concentrations should increase with increasing shock-pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[He, L.; Tang, M.

J	Lin, DM; Kwok, KW				Lin, Dunmin; Kwok, Kin Wing			Structure and piezoelectric properties of K0.5Na0.5NbO3-Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; SINTERING AID; TEMPERATURE	Lead-free (1-x) K0.5Na0.5NbO3-xBi(0.5)Li(0.5)TiO(3) + 1 mol% MnO2 piezoelectric ceramics have been prepared by a conventional ceramic technique and their structure and piezoelectric properties have been studied. Our results reveal that Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 diffuse into K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a perovskite structure. The addition of Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 to the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 solid solution decreases the paraelectric cubic-ferroelectric tetragonal phase transition temperature (T (C)) slightly, but shifts the ferroelectric tetragonal-ferroelectric orthorhombic phase transition temperature (T (O-T)) significantly to low temperatures. As a result, coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.01 < x < 0.03 near room temperature, leading to a significant improvement in the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 0.025 exhibits a relatively high T (C) (392 A degrees C) and optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 191 pC/N, k (p) = 51.5% and k (t) = 45.5%. The ceramic also exhibit a good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties.

It is shown that the two types of the Rayleigh range definitions are consistent in free space. However, in turbulence the Rayleigh range defined by the mean-squared beam width is smaller than that defined by the effective radius of curvature. The main results obtained in this paper are illustrated by numerical calculation examples, where partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian (PCH-G) beams are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results reveal that the obtained Ca(1-3x/2)TbxWO4 microcrystallines are single-phase scheelite structure with tetragonal symmetry. The doping of Tb3+ inhibits the grain growth, decreases the intrinsic emission of WO42- complex ions and enhances the green emission of the microcrystallines. Moreover, the green emission intensity (lambda = 545 nm) of the as-synthesized Ca(1-3x/2)TbxWO4 microcrystallines phosphors increases with the increasing doping level of Tb3+ ions, giving the maximum value at x = 0.07.

One method of studying AD-related gene is to cluster similar genes together into a gene order. Gene order is a good clustering method as the results can be optimal globally while other clustering methods are only optimal locally. Herein we use the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)-based algorithm to calculate the gene order from an Alzheimer's DNA microarray dataset. We test it with four distance measurements: Pearson distance, Spearmen distance, Euclidean distance, and squared Euclidean distance. Our computing results indicate: a different distance formula generated a different quality of gene order the squared Euclidean distance approach produced the optimal AD-related gene order.

Let H = {R vertical bar R is a commutative ring with 1 not equal 0 and the nilradical n(R) is a divided prime ideal of R}. Let R is an element of H and let T(R) be the total quotient ring of R and define phi : T(R) -> R-n(R) by phi(a/b) = a/b for every a is an element of R and regular element b of R. A nonnil ideal I is a phi-w-ideal if phi(I) is a w-ideal of phi(R) and a phi-ring R is called a phi-SM ring if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on phi-w-ideals. We show that the theory of phi-SM rings resembles that of strong Mori domains.

It is shown that the decentred intensity distribution is amended gradually with increasing the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence, and it becomes an off-axis Gaussian-like beam when the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence become large enough. The centre of beam gravity is independent of both the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence. On the other hand, there are two intensity maxima, and their positions are symmetrical around the propagation z-axis when the propagation distance z is small. With increasing z, there is only one intensity maximum. As z further increases, position of the intensity maximum is further shifted towards the z-axis. When z is large enough, the position of the intensity maximum is unchanged. The unchanged position of the intensity maximum moves further away from the z-axis with an increase in the refraction index structure constant, the decentred parameter and the waist width.

Through a qualitative approach, a case study using semi-structured interview was employed to identify the crucial factors leading the users who do not use m-banking services to reject, postpone, or oppose them. Twenty non m-banking users from each country were interviewed and the data were analysed using qualitative content analysis with the software NVivo9. This study informs m-banking decision-makers of the significant inhibitors of m-banking services use and the characteristics of those who are classified as non-users. The results indicate that well developed traditional electronic banking services are significant barriers to m-banking services use. Perceived risk and lack of knowledge about m-banking contribute to non-use or rejection of m-banking services.

Although bilateral filter provides an efficient way to preserve image details while denoising, its performance in sinogram restoration for low-dosed X-ray computed tomography (LDCT) is unsatisfied. The main reason for this situation is that the range filter of the bilateral filter measures similarity by sinogram values, which are polluted seriously by noises and nonstationary artifacts of LDCT. In this paper, we propose a simple method to obtain satisfied restoration results for sinogram of LDCT. That is, the range filter weighs the similarity by Gaussian smoothed sinogram. Since smoothed sinogram can reduce the influence of both noises and nonstationary artifacts for similarity measurement greatly, our new method can provide more satisfied denoising results for sinogram restoration of LDCT. Experimental results show that our method has good visual quality and can preserve anatomy details in sinogram restoration even in both noises and nonstationary artifacts.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme, named Fractal-order Perona-Malik Diffusion (FPMD), which replaces the integer-order derivative of the Perona-Malik (PM) Diffusion with the fractional-order derivative using G-L fractional derivative. FPMD, which is a interpolation between integer-order Nonlinear Anisotropic Diffusion (NAD) and fourth-order partial differential equations, provides a more flexible way to balance the noise reducing and anatomical details preserving. Smoothing results for phantoms and real sinograms show that FPMD with suitable parameters can suppress the staircase effects and speckle effects efficiently. In addition, FPMD also has a good performance in visual quality and root mean square errors (RMSE).

The singularities are detected by canny operator firstly and then dilated using mathematical morphology for finding pixels "near" singularities instead of "on" singularities. The denoising results for pixels near singularities are obtained by nonlocal means in spatial domain to preserve singularities while the denoising results for pixels in smooth regions are obtained by EM algorithm constrained by a mask formed by downsampled spatial image with dilated singularity prior to suiting the sizes of the subbands of wavelets. The final denoised results are got by combining the above two results. Experimental results show that the scheme can preserve singularity well with relatively high PSNR and good visual quality.

A left R-module M is called Gorenstein FP-injective if there is an exact sequence ... -> E-1 -> E-0 -> E-0 -> E-1 -> ... of FP-injective left R-modules with M = ker (E-0 -> E-1) such that Hom(R)(P, -) leaves the sequence exact whenever P is a finitely presented left R-module with pd(R)(P) < infinity. Some properties of Gorenstein FP-injective modules are obtained. Several well-known classes of rings are characterized in terms of Gorenstein FP-injective modules.

For this purpose, we firstly prove a very general existence result for set-valued variational inequalities, provided that the mapping involved has the so-called variational inequality property and satisfies a rather weak coercivity condition. The result on the Tikhonov regularization improves some known results proved for single-valued mapping.

In particular, high achievement motive is associated with subsequent economic growth, which in turn increases power motive. Increased national achievement and power motives have been argued to precede social changes that lead to decreased affiliation motives, and engagement in wars. The present study aimed to examine differences in achievement, power, and affiliation motives between 266 college students in China (a nation with sustained high economic growth) and 255 college students in the USA (a nation with previously strong but now slowing economic growth, and engaged in war). Analysis of personal strivings suggested that Chinese college students showed significantly higher levels of achievement motive than the American college students, but American college students showed significantly higher levels of affiliation motive than Chinese college students. Overall, males exhibited higher achievement motivation than females. No significant interaction effects were found for gender by location for any of the three motives. The findings are discussed in relation to previous research.

We also tested the reliability and validity of a Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Civilian Version (Weathers, Litz, Huska, & Keane, 1994) with this group. PTSD occurred more frequently among females compared with males, and among those exposed directly, indirectly, or not at all to the earthquake, the highest incidence of PTSD was among the group exposed directly. Among 3 groups aged between 11 and 13, 14 and 15, and 16 and 18, the highest incidence of PTSD was in students aged 14 and 15. Compared with other groups those with the highest incidence of PTSD were students with low socioeconomic status, who witnessed the earthquake, had heavy loss of their houses and other possessions, and whose family members were casualties. Factor analysis showed that the 3-factor model of the PCL-C had good construct validity. The internal consistency of Cronbach's alpha and split-half reliability was also satisfactory. Therefore, the PCL-C was determined to be a reliable instrument to detect PTSD among Chinese adolescents exposed to the earthquake.

The results show that two structures are stable under high pressure and the incompressibility increases with pressure. In addition, the electron structures, the total and the partial densities of states are also calculated. BC5 is found to be metallic with band gap, unlike other B-C compounds. The material properties of BC5 are mainly determined by B 2p(1) and C 2p(2) electronic states together. All these show that BC5 is an unusual super hard material, and it may be a potential candidate for diamond at high temperature. The given density of states indicates the covalent hybridization between B and C atoms in this compound. The pressure slightly influences the density of states and the band gap, indicating stability under high pressure. We also find that pressure has no influence on the density of states near Fermi level and the band gap, except for slight shifts of the bands. It can be further inferred that BC5 will have good stability under high pressure.

After establishing a characterization of epsilon-subdifferential of the minimal time function, we obtain that the limiting subdifferential of the minimal time function is representable by virtue of the corresponding normal cones of sublevel sets of the function and level or sublevel sets of the support function of U. The known results require the set U to have the origin as an interior point and the target set is a fixed set.

We calculate the density of states in this system by solving Green function. Our results reveal that the density of states show some noticeable characteristics not only depending upon the interdot coupling t(ab), the energy level epsilon(d1) of the side coupled quantum dot QD(b), and the relative angle theta of magnetic moment M, but also the asymmetry parameter a in ferromagnetic leads and so on. All these parameters greatly influence the density of states of the central quantum dot QD(a). This system is a possible candidate for spin valve transistors and may have potential applications in the spintronics.

In this article, the physical suitability of cropland and its change were evaluated and analyzed by the combined use of satellite remote sensing, geographical information system, and landscape modeling technologies. The aim was to improve our understanding of cropland change so that sustainable cropland utilization could be established. First, the spatial pattern change of cropland was analyzed using the 1-km(2) area percentage model; second, the numerical model for cropland suitability assessment was explored and developed using analytical hierarchy process analysis method. Using this model, cropland suitability index was computed for the whole of the basin from 1990 to 2005. The cropland suitability index was classified into five levels: better, good, middle, bad, and worse, following the natural breaks classification. The spatial distribution of cropland suitability level and its changes over the 15 years from 1990 to 2005 were analyzed and the driving factors of cropland change were investigated. The results showed that the cropland suitability in the study area was at good level, and the cropland quality had been gradually improved on the whole. However, the cropland quality had become worse over the 15 years in some regions. In the study area, governmental policies for eco-environmental protection and population growth were found to be the major factors that caused the cropland change over the past 15 years.

Then polarized continuum models of tomasi (PCM) have been used to discuss solvent effects. The computational results showed that solvents have no influence on frontier molecular orbital features of crocetin dimethyl ester and solvents action made the maximum absorption wavelength red-shifted about 42 nm.

In vitro antioxidant activities of FPR were investigated through hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activities. In vivo anti-fatigue activity of FPR was investigated through loaded swimming exercise of mice. Results showed that FPR had not only in vitro antioxidant activities, but also an in vivo anti-fatigue activity in mice. FPR possessed superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in in vitro experimental studies. In vivo experimental studies, FPR could evidently extend exhaustive swimming time of mice, inhibit the increase of blood lactic acid (BLA), decrease serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, promote increases in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) of mice after swimming. The results provided an important basis for developing the FPR as a novel antioxidant and anti-fatigue compound.

Following the idea of Moudafi, we consider a system of generalized equations problems and show its equivalence with the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems. By using a fixed point formulation of the system of generalized equation problems, a new iterative algorithm for solving the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems is suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. These results are new and unify and generalize some recent results in this field.

This study constructed a novel insert-type air-cathode microbial fuel cell (ITAC-MFC) as an alternative to a sediment-type MFC and a two-chambered MFC for the generation of bioelectricity and the degradation of sewage sludge organic matter. Meanwhile, a pH adjustment was carried out to enhance substrate bioavailability of sludge and to suppress methane production in the MFC. RESULTS: A maximum power density of 73 +/- 5 mW m(-2) was obtained at sludge pH 10.0, much higher than those of 33 +/- 3 and 4 +/- 0.5 mW m(-2) obtained at pH 8.0 and 6.0, respectively. It was observed that the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of sewage sludge at pH 10.0 was almost three times greater than that at pH 6.0. At the same time, the total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) at pH 10.0 were also much higher than at the other two conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that improved electricity production and organic degradation could be achieved by maintaining the sludge pH at 10.0 in an MFC. ITAC-MFC offers an attractive alternative for the environmentally-friendly removal of organic matter in sewage sludge.

The results of X-ray diffraction show that CaTi0.9Zr0.1O3 diffuse into K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a perovskite structure. After the addition of CaTi0.9Zr0.1O3, both the cubic-tetragonal and tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition temperatures decrease, and a relaxor behavior is induced. Coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is formed in the ceramics with 0.03 < x < 0.07 at room temperature. Owing to the higher number of possible polarization states resulting from the coexistence of the two phases, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are enhanced significantly. The ceramic with x = 0.05 exhibits the following optimum properties: d (33) = 203 pC/N, k (p) = 45.0%, and T (C) = 342 A degrees C.

Here, enzyme catalysis acrylonitrile reaction was carried out and the coupled multiphysics field equations were solved by finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The temperature curves can be obtained under the different power. Then, the results calculated by chemical reaction kinetic show that the power window of product concentration can be induced by thermal effect.

This paper aims to make a comparative study of the 2 models. Rough set regions, primitive notions, are proposed first for the 2 models, which classify the universe more precisely. Then, both of their logical meanings related to quantitative indexes and their basic structure are investigated, and their precise descriptions are obtained as well. Furthermore, in the graded rough set model, macroscopic and microscopic algorithms are proposed and analyzed to calculate rough set regions; then, the conclusion is drawn that macroscopic and microscopic algorithms have advantages in time and space complexities, respectively, and a medical example is provided to illustrate the rough set regions and the 2 algorithms. In addition, 3 new properties of the 2 models are investigated, which are the results of extending the classical rough set model, i.e. the relationships between approximations and the basic set, the power actions of approximation operators, and the modifications of approximation operator actions on set operations. Finally, the classical rough set model is used to obtain many corresponding results, and moreover, the relationship and transformation between the 2 models is investigated. The study results of this paper have extended and enriched rough set theory from both operator-oriented and set-oriented points of view. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Firstly, we establish a global existenceuniqueness theorem for the IDSDEs under the global Lipschitz condition in C without the linear growth condition. Secondly, the non-continuable solution for IDSDEs is given under the local Lipschitz condition in C. Then, the classical ItO's formula is improved and a global existence theorem for IDSDEs is obtained. Our new theorems give better results while conditions imposed are much weaker than some existing results. For example, we need only the local Lipschitz condition in C but neither the linear growth condition nor the continuous condition on the time t. Finally, two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Two kinds of hydrogen bonds with different strength are involved in the multi-component self-assembly, one is H-bond between carboxyl group of sym-TTT and melamine, the other is intermolecular H-bond between melamine molecules. These interactions drive a structural transformation from close-packed network to hexagonal network with active amino groups inside of the cavity. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal that the functionalized network of sym-TTT/melamine could recognise Fe3+. These results could be helpful for designing functionalized molecular networks by multi-component self-assembling strategy.

The homogenous patch, composed by homogenous points, is formed by the points similar to the center point using similarity sorting, similarity decreasing searching, and variance analysis in a very large neighborhood (VLN) to avoid manual selection of parameter for similarity measures. Homogenous pixels in the VLN allow us find the largest number of samples, who have the highest similarities to the center point, for noise estimation, and the noise level can be estimated according to unbiased estimation. Experimental results show that for the simulated noisy sinograms, the method proposed in this paper can obtain satisfied noise estimation results, especially for sinograms with relatively serious noises.

The bonding processing, adsorption energy, dynamic track, and diffusion coefficient are investigated. The results indicate that the adsorption process may be divided into four stages: physical adsorption, chemical adsorption early stage, chemical adsorption late stage, and the superficial stable state. The Si=O structure, the Si-O-Si surface oxygen-bridge structure, and the Si-O-Si oxygen-bridge structure where oxygen atoms are inserted into the backbonds between the surface and the second layer of silicon atoms in the stable adsorption structures, are beneficial to the formation of the silica tetrahedral structure. We conclude that the remarkable difference between the diffusion coefficients during the physical adsorption stage leads to different diffusion paths, which results in the formation of two concomitant stable structures in the early process of silicon surface oxidation.

A system of auxiliary mixed equilibrium problems (SAMEP) for solving the SGMEP is introduced and the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the SAMEP is first proved. Next, by using the auxiliary principle technique, a new iterative algorithm to compute the approximate solutions of the SGMEP is suggested and analyzed. Finally, the strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is also proved under quite mild conditions. These results improve, unify and generalize some known results in recent literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We construct a general inexact hybrid projection-proximal point algorithm, in which an inexact relaxed proximal point step is followed by a suitable orthogonal projection onto a hyperplane. Under some suitable conditions concerned with the pseudomonotone set-valued mapping T, the nonsmooth convex function f and the step size lambda(k), we prove the convergence of the inexact hybrid projection-proximal point algorithm for solving generalized mixed variational inequalities in Hilbert spaces.

Magnetic reversal processes and critical thickness in FePt/alpha-Fe/FePt trilayers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Nucleation field; Hysteresis loop; Critical thickness	EXCHANGE-COUPLED NANOLAYERS; NUCLEATION; COERCIVITY	Magnetic reversal processes of a FePt/alpha-Fe/FePt trilayer system with in-plane easy axes have been investigated within a micromagnetic approach. It is found that the magnetic reversal process consists of three steps: nucleation of a prototype of domain wall in the soft phase, the evolution as well as the motion of the domain wall from the soft to the hard phase and finally, the magnetic reversal of the hard phase. For small soft layer thickness L(s), the three steps are reduced to one single step, where the magnetizations in the two phases reverses simultaneously and the hysteresis loops are square with nucleation as the coercivity mechanism. As L(s) increases, both nucleation and pinning fields decrease. In the meantime, the single-step reversal expands to a standard three-step one and the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning. The critical thickness where the coercivity mechanism alters, could be derived analytically, which is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of the crystalline anisotropy of the hard phase. Such a scaling law might provide an easy way to test the present theory. Further increase of L(s) leads to the change of the coercivity mechanism from pinning to nucleation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, an auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problem (AGMEP) is introduced to compute the approximate solutions of the BGMEP involving the GMVLIPs. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and the uniqueness of solutions of the AGMEP are proved under mild conditions without any coercive assumptions. By using an auxiliary principle technique, the new iterative algorithms are proposed and analyzed, with which the approximate solutions of the BGMEP are computed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequence generated by the algorithms is shown under mild conditions without any coercive assumptions. These new results can generalize some recent results in this field.

At every point inside the target set, the proximal/Fr,chet subdifferential is the intersection of the proximal/Fr,chet normal cone of the target set and an upper level set of a so-called Hamiltonian function which depends only on the linear control system. At every point outside the target set, under a mild assumption, proximal/Fr,chet subdifferential is the intersection of the proximal/Fr,chet normal cone of an enlargement of the target set and a level set of the Hamiltonian function.

First, it introduces the notion of an irredundant decomposition of an element in a join-semiring, then discusses the cardinality of a basis and proves that the cardinality of each basis is n if and only if the multiplicative identity element 1 is join-irreducible. If 1 is not a join-irreducible element then each basis need not have the same number of elements in semilinear spaces of n-dimensional vectors over join-semirings.

The Laplacian Estrada index of a graph G is defined as LEE(G) = Sigma(n)(i=1) e(mu i) where mu(1), mu(2), ... , mu(n) are the Laplacian eigenvalues of G. An edge grafting operation on a graph moves a pendent edge between two pendent paths. We study the change of Estrada index of graph under edge grafting operation between two pendent paths at two adjacent vertices. As the application, we give the result on the change of Laplacian Estrada index of bipartite graph under edge grafting operation between two pendent paths at the same vertex. We also determine the unique tree with minimum Laplacian Estrada index among the set of trees with given maximum degree, and the unique trees with maximum Laplacian Estrada indices among the set of trees with given diameter, number of pendent vertices, matching number, independence number and domination number, respectively.

The surface composition, crystalline components and morphology of V6O13 were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, respectively. An intercalating-exfoliatingself- assembly model was proposed to explain the formation process of hollow-flower structure based on experimental results. The obtained hollow flowers-like V6O13 exhibits high specific capacitance, good cyclability and low resistance as revealed by analysis of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Experimental results also indicate that hollow flowers-like V6O13 can deliver a capacitance of 417 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1). This value would decrease to 400 F g(-1) after 1000 cycles in potential range from 0 to 0.8 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 1 mol L-1 NaNO3 aqueous electrolyte at pH of 2.

It is shown that general truncated beams may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam if a certain condition is satisfied. Taking a truncated sinh-Gaussian beam as an example of general truncated beams, some numerical calculations are performed to illustrate the general results obtained in this paper. The analytic results obtained in this paper are general and very useful in studying the propagation property and the beam quality of laser beams.

Rev. Lett. 95, 213001 (2005); Zhou et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 100501 (2008)] showed that the incident photons cannot transmit along an optical waveguide containing a resonant two-level atom (TLA). Here we propose an approach to overcome such a difficulty by using asymmetric couplings between the photons and a TLA. Our numerical results show that the transmission spectrum of the photon depends on both the frequency of the incident photons and the photon-TLA couplings. Consequently, this system can serve as a controllable photon attenuator, by which the transmission probability of the resonantly incident photons can be changed from 0% to 100%. A possible application to explain the recent experimental observations [Astafiev et al., Science 327, 840 (2010)] is also discussed.

After obtaining some a priori estimates, we prove under certain natural conditions that the solutions to the Cauchy problem of the vector nonlinear Schrodinger equations in two and three spatial dimensions blow up in a finite time. Assuming that a solution to the aforementioned vector nonlinear Schrodinger equations is radially symmetric with respect to spatial variables x, we show that if the initial energy is non-positive, then the solution blows up in three dimensions in a finite time.

Their chemical structures and photophysical properties were characterized by (1)H NMR, MS, UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarizing microscope were used to probe liquid properties of the complexes. The polarized absorption and photoluminescence spectrs of the aligned films of the complexes on the rubbed polyimide film were recorded on a UV-4802S spectrophotometer and Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorometer equipped with a polarizer. It is found that the complexes can be aligned preferably on rubbed polyimide film for their liquid crystal properties. For an aligned film of (C(8)OphQ)(2)Zn complex, the maxima of the absorption dichroic ratio at 332 nm and emission dichroic ratio at 500 nm are 2.0 and 2.4 respectively.

The analytical results obtained from truncated fully coherent H-G beam, truncated Gaussian Shell Model (GSM) beam and truncated Gaussian beam are given as particular examples in this paper. It is shown that the M-G(2), factor of truncated partially coherent H-G beam depends on truncated parameter delta, beam order m, and beam coherence parameter alpha. When the value of delta is very small, the odd-even groups happen to the M-G(2) factor, i. e. , the values of M-G(2) factor with different values of the odd m are nearly the same, and so are they for the even m case. However, this phenomenon disappears as delta increases. For the truncated GSM beams with different values of delta, there exist the cross points between the curves of the M-G(2), factor versus alpha. However, this phenomenon may disappear for truncated partially coherent H-G beams. In addition, the larger the m is, the more the M-G(2) factor is affected by the delta, and the effect of aperture on M-G(2), factor may be neglected when the delta is larger.

Seven hundred parental dyads recruited through schools in Chengdu, China, completed the Chinese version of the Children's Attitudes and Behaviors towards Animals scale. Mothers and fathers of boys reported more cruel behaviors towards animals on the part of their child than did mothers and fathers of girls. The correlations between mothers' and fathers' reports were significant, but moderate, but parents of boys' reports were more consistent than those of parents of girls. No gender-of-parent by gender-of-child effect was found, and fathers of boys reported significantly higher levels of total cruelty than did the boys' mothers. More studies are needed to assess childhood cruelty to animals in China, and to further examine the inter-parent agreement.

Five candidate structures are chosen to investigate for OsN2, namely, the pyrite, CoSb2-type, marcasite, simple hexagonal and tetragonal structures. A comparison among the formation energies of OsN2 explains the synthesis of OsN2 marcasite under high pressure. On the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, the transition pressure P-t (P-t = 223 GPa) between the marcasite and simple tetragonal phase is determinated. Elastic constants, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature are derived. The calculated values are, generally speaking, in good agreement with experiments and other theoretical calculations. Our calculation indicates that the N-N bond length is one determinative factor for the ultrahigh bulk moduli of the heavy-transition-metal dinitrides. Moreover, based on Mulliken overlap population analysis in first-principles technique, a semiempirical method to evaluate the hardness of multicomponent crystals with partial metallic bonding is presented. The effect of metallic bonding on the hardness of OsN2 is investigated and the hardness shows a gradual decrease rather than increase under compression, which is different from diamond. This is a quantitative investigation on the structural properties of OsN2, and it still awaits experimental confirmation.

Furthermore, the ring-openings have been found in the longer N-N single bond by analyzing the length change of N-N bond of ring-shaped isomers in ring-opening processes. In addition, with the activation energies in ring-opening processes, the differences of the activation energies in isomerization between the isomers have been found according to the classification of rings. The activation energies in ring-opening isomerization of six-membered ring-shaped isomers are higher than that of the four-membered ring-shaped isomers. It indicates that six-membered ring-shaped isomers difficult in ring-opening in the isomerization are the steadiest ring-shaped isomers of N8H8 while four-membered ring-shaped isomers easy in ring-opening are the most unstable.

Let r(A) = min{p : A = B circle dot BT; B is an element of L(nxp)}: Then r(A) is called the content of A. Since 1982, how to calculate r(A) for a given nxn realizable fuzzy matrix A was a focus problem, many researchers have made a lot of research work. X. P. Wang in 1999 gave an algorithm to find the fuzzy matrix B and calculate r(A) within [r(A)](n2) steps. Therefore, to find a simpler algorithm is a problem what we have to consider. This paper makes use of the symmetry of the realizable fuzzy matrix A to simplify the algorithm of content r(A) based on the work of Wang (Chin Ann Math A 6: 701-706, 1999).

When the first phase of service is completed, the service process can be interrupted with probability 1 - p (0 <= p <= 1) as a result of the customer leaving the service area to attend to other work. There is a finite space to accommodate the interrupted customers in the queueing system. When the other work is completed, the customer, whose service was interrupted, will re-enter the service area and resume his interrupted service based on the non-preemptive priority rule. Using the matrix geometric method, the steady state behavior of this system is analyzed. Based on the queue length distribution, several important performance measures along with some numerical examples have been discussed.

Six functionalized triphenylene discotic monomers were prepared, and then Pd-catalyzed homo-coupling reaction was used for the preparation of symmetrical discotic liquid crystal dimers, (RO)(5)C(18)H(6)(O(2)CC(6)H(4)C equivalent to C-C equivalent to CC(6)H(4)CO(2))C(18)H(6)(OR)(5) (R=C(n)H(2n+1), n=4 similar to 9), for which two triphenylene discogens was connected via a rigid spacer. The purity and structure of the new compounds was confirmed by using (1)H NMR, IR and high resolution mass. Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) results show that the dimers have good thermal stability, beginning to decompose at 370 degrees C. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results display that the monomers and dimers exhibit columnar mesophases. The dimers display wide mesophase range and are room temperature liquid crystals. The clearing points of dimers increase with the lengthening of peripheral alkyl chain, while the monomers show opposite trend.

Through the current calculations, the density of states (DOS), energy band structure and optical absorption coefficients have been obtained for TiO2 and compared with the doped TiO2, and the influence of electronic structure and optical properties caused by Zr and C co-doping has been presented qualitatively together. The results revealed that the energy band gap has been decreased owing to the doped Zr and C, whereas the optical absorption coefficients have been increased in the region of 400 similar to 800 nm and a red shift of absorption band can be found. Accordingly, photo catalytic activity of TiO2 has been enhanced. The current calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data.

The calculated results obtained by the complete diagonalization method are close to that obtained by the perturbation theory method, and in good agreement with the experimental values. In the complete diagonalization method, the complete diagonalization procedure is established based on the 3d(9) electron system in tetragonal field. From the calculation of the electron paramagnetic resonance parameters, the local defect structure of the [CuO(6)](-10) cluster can be determined as D(4h) with R(x) = R(y) = 0.1952 nm, R(z) = 0.2076 nm.

Our calculations include the variation of band structure with the parameters for the sublayers, and the energy dispersion relations. It is found that by varying the sublayer thickness, the band structures can be well designed in different ways. The strain will change the bandgaps, reduce the band offsets and the sub-bands obviously, and make the valence band more complex. In comparison with the experimental results, our model is rather suited for simulating the narrow-quantum-well structures, while for the wide-quantum-well structures, the build-in field should be considered.

The effects of Co and/or Sn doping on surface morphologies and mircrostructures of ZnO films are investigated by metallurgical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results indicate that all the ZnO samples show preferential orientation along the (002) direction, and that the Sn-doped ZnO thin film exhibits the best c-axis orientation and largest grain size. XPS results reveal that Co and Sn elements exist as Co2+ and Sn4+, indicating that Co and Sn ions have entered into the ZnO crystal lattices successfully. Strong blue double emission and weak green emission are observed in the PL spectra of all the samples. In addition, the ultraviolet peaks appear in the undoped and the Co-doped ZnO thin films. Our results reveal that the Co and/or Sn doping can tune the band gap, meanwhile, such a doping can also affect oxygen dislocation, zinc oxygen and zinc interstial defect concentrations. Finally, the possible luminescence mechanisms of Co and/or Sn doped ZnO films are discussed.
