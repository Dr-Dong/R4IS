First-principles investigation of mechanical and electronic properties of MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ELASTIC PROPERTIES; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; PEROVSKITE; BAFE2AS2; LIFEAS	Mechanical and electronic properties of Cu2Sb-type compounds MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na) have been studied by the first-principles calculations. The main trends in structure parameters, mechanical parameters, electronic bands, and densities of states (DOS) for MFeAs are analyzed according to the variable cation M sites. Our results show that the lattice constants increase, while the bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young's modulus decrease with the increasing radii of M sites in the sequence CuFeAs -> LiFeAs -> NaFeAs. Mulliken overlap population indicates that different M atoms in MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na) would influence the bond nature of Fe-As, which may induce the superconductivity. The disappearance of the hole-pockets affects the superconductivity in CuFeAs. Although the value of the DOSs N(E-F) at the Fermi level grows with decreasing radii of M sites, it is not the only factor influencing the superconductivity. Due to the repulsive interaction between Cu-3d and Fe-3d states in CuFeAs phase, it would change the position of Fe-3d orbits and Fermi energy level after introducing Cu in this structure. Therefore, after introducing Cu in the structure would induce the different position of Fe-3d states and Fermi energy level. Therefore, we believe that the component M has an important influence on the superconductivity. Published by AIP Publishing.	[Chen, Z. J.; Xu, G. B.; Yan, J.

The distinct differences in cationic radius lead to a special morphology, which is attributed to the symmetry of the crystal structure and the differences in the growth rates of various crystals, and it further leads to the variation of luminescence. It was found that the charge transfer band of MWO4:0.04Eu(3+) exhibits a blue shift with an increasing cationic radius, and the shift is ascribed to less covalency being caused by an increase in the cationic radius. The emission intensity obviously increases with cationic radius, increasing for the samples with a monoclinic phase; however, it is the opposite for the samples with a tetragonal phase, and CaWO4:0.04Eu(3+) exhibits an optimal emission intensity. In addition, the possible reasons for the decay lifetime are also discussed in detail. Our results indicate that cations can effectively control the crystal structure, micromorphology, and luminescence in tungstate phosphors, and thus, our approach is effective for obtaining materials with the desired morphology and crystal structure.

The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between negative life events and antenatal depression. Methods Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. Results The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events. Conclusions This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression.

The as-prepared aluminum-humic acid-lanthanum (Al-HA-La) aerogel composites were fully characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR and TGA Then, the adsorption behaviors of fluoride on Al-HA-La adsorbent were investigated systematically, including the influence of initial pH, adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, desorption study, etc. Batch adsorption experimental results showed that the high fluoride removal of Al-HA-La was obtained in a wide initial pH range from 5 to 11. The adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 40 min (pH = 7.0), and the adsorption kinetics could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms could be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir model was high up to 50 mg g(-1) at 298 K (pH = 7.0). Moreover, the co-existing of other anions and cations showed limited influence on the adsorption of fluoride on Al-HA-La. Furthermore, the fluoride adsorbed on Al-HA-La could be effectively desorbed using 10(-2) mol L-1 NaOH, and the desorption efficiency was as high as 90%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of existing algorithms have the problems of large computational cost, ringing and noise sensitivity, hence a novel approach by iterative joint bilateral filtering under Bayesian framework is proposed. Firstly, it utilizes defocus image depth estimation to compute the point spread function in the Bayesian framework. Then a minimum optimization problem is built to represent the blind restoration problem. After inferencing the solution procedure of the minimum optimization problem, we find that the joint bilateral filters can be used to search the optimal solution, which not only simplifies the searching procedure but also reduces the computational cost. Finally, an iterative joint bilateral filtering is designed to realize the image restoration. That means that the original restored image obtained from the bilateral filtering is used to design the guide image for the joint bilateral filters, and the guide image will serve as the input of the optimization problem for acquiring the better optimal result. This procedure is repeated until convergence. The experimental results indicate that this method can yield the ringing, reduce the computational cost, and remove the noise. Generally speaking, the average pixel error of 85% images is under 0.03, which has improved 19% comparing with the same error rang of existing algorithms, and 78% shorter than those of compared algorithms. It can be used in the engineering practice of blind restoration for single defocus image.

Besides the interference power threshold to limit the interference on primary users PUs caused by cognitive users CUs, a proportional fairness constraint is used to guarantee fairness among multiple cognitive cells and the impact of imperfect spectrum sensing is taken into account. Additional constraints in typical real communication scenarios are also considered-such as a transmission power constraint of the cognitive base stations, unique subcarrier allocation to at most one CU, and others. The resulting RA problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. A computationally efficient optimal algorithm cannot therefore be found. Consequently, we propose a suboptimal RA algorithm composed of two modules: a subcarrier allocation module implemented by the immune algorithm, and a power control module using an improved sub-gradient method. To further enhance algorithm performance, these two modules are executed successively, and the sequence is repeated twice. We conduct extensive simulation experiments, which demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.

The HA-Na compositions with the molecular weight beyond 70 kDa showed the most intense affinity toward Hg(II). The results showed that the reaction equilibrium was achieved within 10 min (pH 7.0), and could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The capturing process could be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum capturing capacity of Hg (II) was high up to 9.80 mg g(-1) at 298 K (pH 7.0). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the redox reaction between Hg(II) and HA-Na and the coordination reaction of carboxyl and hydroxy groups of HA-Na with Hg(II) were responsible for Hg(II) removal. The successive regeneration experiment showed that the capturing efficiency of humates for Hg(II) was maintained at about 51% after five capture-regeneration recycles.

It is found that only the Pt-L-1 complexes, in which one flexible long chain is attached to each end of 2-phenylpyridine, display monotropic smectic liquid crystalline behavior. Moreover, mechanochromism has been observed by grinding the solid complexes. It seems that the liquid crystalline and mechanochromic properties of these complexes are relative to the number of flexible alkoxy chains in the cyclometalated ligand.

We present that the solution of the inequality is decided by a finite recursion, whose result is proved to be a continuous, bounded or asymptotic function. Meanwhile, in order to overcome an obstacle from powers of integrals, we modify the method of monotonization into the powered monotonization. Furthermore, relying on the result and our technique of concavification, we discuss a generalized stochastic integral inequality, and give an estimate of the mean square. In the end, as applications, we study uniform boundedness and continuous dependence of solutions for a class of stochastic differential equation in mean square.

After completion of repair of all broken components, the repairman remains idle for a period of time called changeover time, and then takes a vacation following an arbitrary distribution if there is no operating component breaks down during the changeover time. Applying the supplementary variable method, several reliability measures of the system including the steady-state availability, the steady-state rate of occurrence of failures and the mean time to the first failure are obtained. Meanwhile, some numerical illustrations are presented to demonstrate how the various parameters influence the behaviour of the system. Finally, a special case (n-1)-out-of-n:G system is discussed to validate the correctness of the theoretical results.

However, the huge amount of smelting water containing various types of REIs was difficult to separate, which often lead to difficulty in recovery of REIs and water pollution in environment. Selective adsorption was an effective route to recover the REIs in smelting water. Two adsorbents (SiO2-BT, SiO2-BWT) were prepared by grafting plant tannins (Bayberry tannin, Black wattle tannin) onto aminated silica. The as-prepared adsorbents have exhibited a high adsorption capacity to four typical REIs and high selectivity to La3+ among these four REIs (La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+). Furthermore, the after-used adsorbents can be easily regenerated by 0.1mol/L HNO3 solution indicating superior reusability.

A new constrained minimization problem is developed by minimizing the l(2) norm of the a decorrelated posteriori error signal with a constraint on the filter coefficients in the l(2) norm sense. Solving this minimization problem gives birth to the efficient RVSSDNLMS algorithm. The convergence performance and computational complexity of RVSSDNLMS algorithm are analyzed. Finally, simulations show that the proposed RVSSDNLMS considerably outperforms the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS), robust variable step-size NLMS, and pseudoaffine projection algorithms in terms of convergence rate and steady-state error in Gaussian noise and impulsive noise environments.

It is found that the obtained lattice constants of CdSiP2 under zero pressure and zero temperature from our calculations are in favorable agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical ones. The pressure dependences of the elastic constants C (ij); bulk modulus B; shear modulus G; elastic anisotropy index A (U), A (B), and A (G); and Young's modulus E of CdSiP2 are also successfully obtained for the first time. Especially, the elastic constants C (ij) and the Young's modulus E under high pressure up to 20 GPa are obtained and analyzed systematically for the first time. In addition, our calculations give a band gap of 1.358 eV, indicating that the chalcopyrite structure CdSiP2 is a semiconductor, consistent with other theoretical results. Finally, the optical properties such as the dielectric function, refractive index, absorption coefficient, and extinction coefficient for energy up to 22.5 eV under pressure have also been reported.

The effects of off-axis distance, propagation distance, and three oceanic parameters (i.e., the ratio of temperature to salinity contribution to the refractive index spectrum w, the rate of dissipation of the mean squared temperature X-T and the rate of dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy epsilon) on radial component of scintillation index are examined. The influences of propagation distance and three oceanic parameters on the longitudinal component of scintillation index are investigated. It is shown that the radial component of scintillation increases as off-axis distance increases. Both radial and longitudinal components of scintillation increase as propagation distance, w and X-T increase while decreases as e increases. Besides, the longitudinal component of scintillation increases more drastically for plane wave than others, which indicates the plane wave is affected the most at the fixed turbulent strength. The longest weak turbulence distance for a plane wave is shorter than that for a Gaussian or spherical wave. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, compounds that could promote GLUT4 translocation into the PM represent potential drugs for the treatment of diabetes. In this research, we screened for agonists that induce GLUT4 translocation by using a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP)-mOrange2. We identified as well as validated one agonist, staurosporine, from a 64,000 compound library. Staurosporine promotes GSVs translocation into the PM and increases glucose uptake through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, serving as an effective insulin additive analogue in L6 cells. Our work highlights the convenience and efficiency of this novel pH-sensitive fluorescent probe and reveals the new biological activity of staurosporine as an agonist for GLUT4 translocation and as an effective insulin additive analogue.

Here, using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing approaches, we identified a novel BPH resistance gene, LOC_Os06g03240 (MSU LOCUS ID), from the rice variety Ptb33 in the interval between the markers RM19291 and RM8072 on the short arm of chromosome 6, where a gene for resistance to BPH was mapped by Jirapong Jairin et al. and renamed as "Bph32". This gene encodes a unique short consensus repeat (SCR) domain protein. Sequence comparison revealed that the Bph32 gene shares 100% sequence identity with its allele in Oryza latifolia. The transgenic introgression of Bph32 into a susceptible rice variety significantly improved resistance to BPH. Expression analysis revealed that Bph32 was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where BPH primarily settles and feeds, at 2 and 24 h after BPH infestation, suggesting that Bph32 may inhibit feeding in BPH. Western blotting revealed the presence of Pph (Ptb33) and Tph (TN1) proteins using a Penta-His antibody, and both proteins were insoluble. This study provides information regarding a valuable gene for rice defence against insect pests.

J	Zeng, SL; Li, L; Xie, ZW				Zeng Shao-Long; Li Ling; Xie Zheng-Wei			Tunneling times in double spin-filter junctions	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						dwell time; phase time; magnetic tunneling junction; spin filter effect	TRAVERSAL TIME; FERROMAGNETIC/SEMICONDUCTOR/FERROMAGNETIC HETEROJUNCTION; BARRIER; MAGNETORESISTANCE; CONDUCTANCE	Based on the free electronic model and Winful's theory about tunneling times, the dwell times and the phase times in NM/SF/I/SF/NM double spin filter junctions are investigated, where the NM denotes the normal metal, SF the insulator barrier with spin filter effects and I the nonmagnetic insulator barrier. There are three different cases which are analyzed in detail: 1) the dependences of dwell time and phase time on the energy of the incident electron; 2) the dependences of dwell time and phase time on the heights of the barrier; 3) the dependences of dwell time and phase time on the width of the barrier and the molecular field in the spin filter layer. The numerical results show that for the first case, when the electrons have low incident energy (smaller than the barrier height), as the influence of the spin-dependent self-interfere term, the phase times are always larger than the dwell times for electrons with different spinorientations. But when the electrons have high incident energy (higher than the barrier heights), the influence of the self-interfere term disappears and the differences between the phase time and dwell time for electrons with different spin orientations disappear also. For case 2, the numerical results show that the variation of nonmagnetic insulator barrier height has little influence on the dwell time and phase time in NM/SF/I/SF/NM double spin filter junctions. But when the nonmagnetic insulator barrier height is lower than the barrier height of spin filter layer, the quantum well will appear and the resonant tunneling can be induced to lead to the peaks in the dependences of dwell and phase times on the insulator barrier height. The variation of spin-filter barrier height has obvious influence on the dwell time and phase time in NM/SF/I/SF/NM double spin filter junction. With increasing the height of spin-filter barrier, the dwell times and phase time both first increase and then decrease. For case 3, the influences of the widths of the nonmagnetic insulator barrier layer and spin filter layer on the dwell time and phase time are little. But when the barrier height of nonmagnetic insulator barrier is lower than that of spin-filter layer, the variation of width of insulator barrier can lead to the resonant tunneling and the peaks in dwell and phase times. Unlike the influence of width of barrier, the influences of molecular field in the spin filter layer on the dwell time and phase time are obvious. For the up-spin electrons, dwell time and phase time decrease with increasing the molecular fields, which is contrary to the scenario for the down-spin electrons.

Anisotropy is introduced through non-Kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence. The scintillation index results are obtained by employing the Rytov method solution; thus the results are valid for weak anisotropic atmospheric turbulence and for horizontal links. Variations in the scintillations are shown for various higher order laser modes against the changes in the optical source size, power law exponent of anisotropic non-Kolmogorov spectrum, anisotropic factors, and link length. Our results can be used in the design of optical wireless communication systems used between airplanes.

The lattice parameters and elastic constants are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results. The polycrystalline elastic moduli of MgAl2O4 spinel are calculated using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. By the elastic stability criteria, the MgAl2O4 spinel is mechanically stable within 80 GPa. MgAl2O4 possesses ductile nature, and the ductility is enhanced with the increase of pressure. The sound velocities over a wide range of pressures are also obtained. Furthermore, the elastic anisotropies of MgAl2O4 are investigated via the various anisotropic indexes and the 3D surface constructions. It is found that MgAl2O4 is isotropic for bulk modulus, while is anisotropic for shear modulus and Young's modulus, and the elastic anisotropy of MgAl2O4 increases due to the applying pressure. Besides, the directions with smaller values of shear modulus for MgAl2O4 will deform preferentially under high hydrostatic pressure. Through the quasi- harmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of MgAl2O4 spinel.

In this work, novel layered-spinel integrated cathode materials of (1-x) LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2-xLiMni(1.9)Al(0.1)O(4) were synthesized by a sol-gel method, and their phase structures, morphologies and electrochemical performance were investigated. The crystal structure of the (1-x) LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2-xLiMn(1.9)Al(0.1)O(4) is changed from layered to spinel structure with increasing x. All the samples exhibit nanoscale grains with the minimum grain size of similar to 130 nm when x = 0.5. The composite electrode with x = 0.5 exhibits the optimal discharge capacity, presenting a large initial discharge capacity of 236 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 20 mA g(-1). Good rate capability is also obtained at the composite electrode with x = 0.5 where the electrode displays the relatively high discharge capacity of 64.9 mAh g(-1) at the high rate of 5 C. The improved electrochemical performance is related to the introduction of spinel structure into layered structure and small grain size. The spinel structure can stabilize the layered structure, which leads to the improvement in the electrochemical performance of the composites; and the small grain size in the sample with x = 0.5 provides short lithium ion diffusion way and thus enhances the electrochemical performance.

J	Yan, CH; Wei, LF				Yan, Cong-Hua; Wei, L. F.			Photonic switches with ideal switching contrasts for waveguide photons	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							SINGLE QUANTUM-DOT; ATOM; CAVITY	Photonic switches are one kind of key devices in quantum optical networks and have been demonstrated previously through either manipulating the cavity-atom interactions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 193601 (2013)] or driving the additional levels of the switch atoms [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 113601 (2011)]. In this paper, we propose an alternative configuration generated by three empty cavities coupled in series to serve as an ideal photonic switch of the photons along the waveguide, i.e., photons are completely transmitted (reflected) if the three cavities are (are not) exactly resonant. It is shown that the quality of such a detuning-sensitive photonic switch is insensitive to the cavity-cavity, cavity-waveguide, and cavity-atom coupling strengths. The feasibility of the devices is also demonstrated with the current waveguide photonic technique.

The reaction conditions were optimized, including the light intensity, biomass concentration, NaCl addition, and reaction time. The silver nanoparticles fabricated at the optimum conditions (light intensity 60,000 lx, biomass concentration 2 mg/mL, and reaction time 90 min) were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and zeta potential. The TEM results showed that the silver nanoparticles were mostly spherical, with an average diameter of 17.2 nm. The zeta potential of AgNPs reached -21.6 mV. The XRD spectra showed that the AgNPs were highly crystalline, with four characteristic peaks. The FTIR of nanoparticles implied that alcohols and proteins may have a vital role in the formation and stability of AgNPs. The silver nanoparticles synthesized by wheat straw biomass revealed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cesium (Cs) contamination and plant growing stages in crops or vegetables grown on Cs-contaminated soils. Vicia faba was grown on Cs contaminated soils under pot-culture conditions, and Cs uptake and bioaccumulation at various growing stages were then measured. The results showed that Cs uptake by V. faba was significantly greater on soils with a higher Cs content. As shown by the bioaccumulation factor (BCF), the highest transfer coefficient occurred when V. faba reached the maturation stage. Cs was easily transferred to young organs, especially seeds, with an average percentage of 9.60% in seeds during the maturation stage. This implies that Cs can be transferred to the human food chain at all growth stages of the plant, especially the last stages.

Tropical forest vegetation maps are very important for managing tropical forests. Mapping tropical forest vegetation only by spectral-based remote sensing techniques has proven to be problematic. The objective of the study is to develop a rule-based model to identify different forest types using LandsatTMimages and GIS. In this paper, we developed the rule-based model to identify different forest types in Xishuangbanna, P.R. of China, using two temporal Landsat TM images and geo-data such as DEM, rainfall and temperature. The results show that the method put forward is useful and effective in tropical forest vegetation mapping, which can effectively integrate multi-knowledge and multi-resource data to identify the tropical forest vegetation types with higher accuracy.

Longer-term psychological consequences remain unclear. This study explored psychological symptoms in secondary school students who were living in Sichuan province 6 years after the Wenchuan earthquake. Methods: A secondary data analysis was performed on data from a final survey of survivors conducted 6 years after the Wenchuan earthquake as part of the five-year mental health and psychosocial support project. A total of 2641 participants were divided into three groups, according to the level of traumatic experience exposure during the earthquake (0, 1, and 2 or more). ANCOVA was used to compare the mean scores of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) among the three groups, adjusting for covariates such as age, gender, ethnicity, having a sibling, parents' divorce, and socio-economic status. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify relationships between the traumatic experiences and suicidality after the disaster. Results: Having two or more kinds of traumatic experiences was associated with higher psychological symptom scores on the SCL-90 (Cohen's d=0.23-033) and suicidal ideation (OR 1.98, 95% Cls:1.35-2.89) and attempts (OR 3.32, 95% Cls:1.65-6.68), as compared with having no traumatic experience. Limitations: Causality cannot be inferred from this cross-sectional survey, and results may not generalize to other populations due to convenience sampling. Conclusions: Severely traumatized adolescent survivors of the earthquake may suffer from psychological symptoms even 6 years after the disaster. Long-term psychological support will be needed for these individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, La2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode materials were fabricated via a combined method of sol-gel and wet chemical processes. The structural and morphological characterizations of the materials demonstrate that a thin layer of La2O3 is uniformly covered on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles, and the coating of La2O3 has no obvious effect on the crystal structure of Li-rich oxide. The electrochemical performance of La2O3-coated Li-rich cathodes including specific capacity, cycling stability and rate capability has been significantly improved with the coating of La2O3. The Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 coated with 2.5 wt% La2O3 exhibits the highest discharge capacity, improved cycling stability and reduced charge transfer resistance, delivering a large discharge capacity of 276.9 mAh g(-1) in the 1st cycle and a high capacity retention of 71% (201.4 mAh g(-1)) after 100 cycles. The optimal rate capability of the materials is observed at the coating level of 1.5 wt% La2O3 such that the material exhibits the highest discharge capacity of 90.2 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. The surface coating of La2O3 can effectively facilitate Li+ interfacial diffusion, reduce the structural change and secondary reactions between cathode materials and electrolyte during the charge-discharge process, and thus induce the great enhancement in the electrochemical properties of the Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 materials.

The crystal structure of the La-PZTC can be speculated to monoclinic system, P2(1)/c space group based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Thermogravimetric analysis and elemental analysis. Time-dependent experiment was performed to explore temporal morphological evolution, indicating the nucleation and growth of the products take place in a very short time. The luminescent properties of the as-obtained lanthanum pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylate samples have been discussed in detail. Under UV excitation, Eu3+ or Tb3+ doped La-PZTC samples exhibit strong red and green emission, corresponding to the characteristic lines of Eu3+ or Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, the luminescence color of phosphors can be fine-tuned from green to green-yellow, yellow, and red-orange by simply adjusting the concentrations of Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions, making the material has potential applications in building mini-optoelectronic devices and color display fields.

It exhibits different cation occupancy and band gap from normal spinel zinc ferrite. Regarding that band structure plays an essential role in the gas sensing property of semiconducting material, the gas sensing properties of normal spinel and partially inverse spinel are measured and compared. With the favorable adsorption and moderate conductance, the partially inverse spinel zinc ferrite exhibits superior performance both in gas response and selectivity towards H2S. The optimum operating temperature is found to be 260 degrees C and the response time and recovery time are short. The excellent gas sensing properties is attributed to the favorable adsorption and change of it band structure due to special partially inverse spinel structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The surface morphology of TiO2 films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The chemic states of Ti and O elements were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The resistive switching property of the sample was measured using Au/TiO2/Pt capacitor structure fabricated by evaporating Au top electrode. Smooth surface and dense cross structure were observed by AFM and scanning electron microscopy. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 film were confirmed by XPS. Forming free resistance switching was confirmed by the current voltage measurement and the resistance ratio is larger than two orders of magnitude at 2.5 V. The XPS spectrum, asymmetric current loops and conduction mechanism fitting results indicated that the asymmetric electrode structure and oxygen vacancies are the origin of the resistive switching.

Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) and Umbrella Sampling (US) methods were combined to estimate the potential of mean force (PMF) for the PPi release in T7 RNAP. PPi is a small group with negative charges. After binding a Mg2+ ion, the formed (Mg-PPi)(2-) complex is able to bind with both positively and negatively charged groups. Our simulation results show there is a large free energy barrier in the PMF profile for PPi release. Non-bonded interaction analysis suggests that the PPi is firmly trapped in the pore region of the secondary channel, which is composed of many polar, negatively and positively charged groups. Strong electric interactions from the surrounding groups contribute mostly to the high energy barrier for PPi release. Hydrogen bond map clearly exhibits part of the interaction network that the PPi has been trapped in. Therefore, we conclude that PPi is less likely to be released spontaneously. Additional energy input is needed to facilitate this process. It is deduced that NTP addition reaction may serve as an energy provider to drive PPi release. Then the whole NAC mechanism can be well explained. It is expected that our study provides a clear picture on the essential step of RNA transcription at atom-level resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of its antidiabetic effect has been known as it can competitively inhibit sodium-glucose symporters (SGLTs). However, phlorizin has a wide range of two-phase metabolism in systemic circulation and shows poor oral bioavailability. An alternative mechanism may involve gut microbiota in intestine. Sixteen obese mice with type 2 diabetes (db/db) and eight age-matched control mice (db/+) were divided into three groups: diabetic group treated with phlorizin (DMT group), vehicle-treated diabetic group (DM group), and normal control group (CC group). Phlorizin was given in normal saline solution by intragastric administration for 10 weeks. After the last treatment course, body weight, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), insulin resistance, and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were compared. 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR were used to determine the changes in microbiome composition. Coadministration of phlorizin significantly prevented metabolic syndrome by decreasing weight gain, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides, and insulin resistance, and the fecal level of total SCFAs was dramatically increased, especially butyric acid. DGGE and quantitative PCR demonstrated that phlorizin coadministration increased the gut microbial diversity and the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila and Prevotella. Meanwhile, the gut microbiota structure of db/db mice after phlorizin treatment was improved and approached the normal group. The mechanism of the hypoglycemic action of phlorizin is associated with LPS decrease and gut microbiota changes; briefly, it acts in the intestine to modify gut microbial community structure, resulting in lower LPS load in the host and higher SCFAs producing beneficial bacteria.

J	Luo, KJ; Zhang, SL; Su, YW; Li, Q				Luo Kai-Jun; Zhang Shi-Lin; Su Yi-Wei; Li Quan			Dimeric Porphyrins and Platinum(II) Complexes: Red Shifted Emission from Hydrogen Bonds between Dimeric Porphyrins	CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			Chinese	Article						dimeric porphyrin; hydrogen bond; amide; red shift of photoluminescence spectra	PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; PI-PI INTERACTIONS; PHOTOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY; SPECTROSCOPY; DERIVATIVES; HOMOLOGS; LIGANDS	A new series of dimeric porphyrins with two amide groups linkage and the corresponding platinum(II) complexes were synthesized by the amidation of ethylenediamine, 1,3-diaminopropane and 1,4-diaminobutane with 5-(4-carboxy-phenyl)-10,15,20-tri-(4-dodecyloxyphenyl) porphyrin (HAcTPP) and characterized by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, MS, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis and fluorescent spectrometer. It is found that photoluminescence (PL) spectra for the dimers show concentration dependences. In dilute solution (10(-7) mol.L-1), maxima of PL peak for dimers was located at 657 nm, which has identical PL peak with single porphyrin, HAcTPP. When concentration was increased to 10(-3) mol.L-1, the maximal PL peak value (675 nrn) for the dimeric porphyrins exhibited 18 nm bathochromic shift (relative to single porphyrin, HAcTPP). Moreover, the concentration dependence PL spectra become more sensitive for dimeric complexes that were obtained by refluxing dimeric porphyrin with PtCl2 in benzonitrile solution. The maximal PL peak values (about 673 nrn) for dimers complexes showed 16 nm red-shifts compared with that for HAcTPP even in 10(-7) mol.L-1 dilute THE solution. With concentration increase to 10(-4) mol.L-1, the emission peak for complexes of dimeric porphyrin was at 727 nm, which is red-shifted to near-infrared range. To examine the correlation between the luminescence and intermolecular pi-pi and/or Pt(II)-Pt(II) interactions for the dimeric complexes, the solid-state luminescence for the dimeric complex, Pt2C3(AmTPP)(2), at room temperature and 77 K was measured, which showed low-energy emissions with a maximum at 658 nm at room temperature. Upon cooling the solid sample to 77 K, the solid sample exhibited red-shift of 16 nm (from 658 to 674 nm) and there was more structured spectrum with an additional weak emission at 706 nm. Furthermore, sublimating films of the complexes also yielded red-shift emission at about 727 nm and broadened PL profile with an additional tailing at 760 similar to 810 nm, which would account for more intensive pi-pi interaction and/or Pt(II)-Pt(II) interaction in sublimating films.

To enable catalyst recovery, noble metal nanoparticles are often supported onto solid matrices to prepare heterogeneous catalyst. Although recycle of noble metal nanoparticles is realized by heterogenization, a loss of activity is usually encountered. In the present investigation, Pt nanoparticles with tunable particle size (1.85-2.80 nm) were facilely prepared by using polyphenols as amphiphilic stabilizers. The as-prepared Pt nanoparticles colloid solution could be used as highly active catalyst in aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis. The phenolic hydroxyls of polyphenols could constrain Pt nanoparticles in aqueous phase, and simultaneously, the aromatic scaffold of polyphenols ensured effective interactions between substrates and Pt nanoparticles. As a consequence, the obtained polyphenols-stabilized Pt nanoparticles exhibited high activity and cycling stability in biphasic hydrogenation of a series of unsaturated compounds. Compared with conventional heterogeneous Pt-C and Pt-Al2O3 catalysts, polyphenols-stabilized Pt nanoparticles showed obvious advantage both in activity and cycling stability.

The Min(N, V)-policy means that the server commences its service once the number of waiting customers reaches threshold N or when its vacation time ends with at least one but less than N customers waiting for processing, whichever occurs first. Otherwise, if no customer is presenting at the end of the server vacation, the server remains idle until the first arrival occurs. Under these assumptions, the z-transform expressions for the transient queue size distribution at time epoch n(+) are obtained by employing the renewal process theory and the total probability decomposition technique. Based on the transient analysis, the explicit recursive formulas of the steady-state queue length distribution at time epochs n(broken vertical bar), n, n and outside observer's time epoch are derived, respectively. Additionally, the stochastic decomposition structure is presented and some other performance measures are also discussed. Furthermore, some computational experiments are implemented to demonstrate the significant application value of the recursive formulas for the steady-state queue size in designing system capacity. Finally, the optimal threshold of N for economizing the system cost is numerically determined.

We studied the degradation of lignin and cellulose in the foliar litter of four dominant riparian species (willow: Salix paraplesia; azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum; cypress: Sabina saltuaria; and larch: Larix mastersiana) in an alpine forest river. Over an entire year's incubation, litter lignin and cellulose degraded by 14.7-100% and 57.7-100% of their initial masses, respectively, depending on litter species. Strong degradations of lignin and cellulose occurred in the prefreezing period (i.e., the first 41 d) during litter decomposition, and the degradation rate was the highest among all the decomposition periods regardless of litter species. Litter species, decomposition period, and environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability showed significant influences on lignin and cellulose degradation rates. Compared with previously reported data regarding the dynamics of lignin and cellulose during litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, our results suggest that lignin and cellulose can be degraded much more rapidly in lotic ecosystems, indicating that the traditionally used two-phased model for the dynamics of lignin in decomposing litter may not be suitable in lotic ecosystems.

The analytical formulae for the seeing parameter and the tilt variance in oceanic turbulence are derived, and it is found that the relationship between the seeing parameter and the spatial coherence width in oceanic turbulence is just like that in atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, the model of underwater imaging shown in this paper considers both temperature and salinity fluctuations for oceanic turbulence. It is found that, compared with the dominating salinity-induced turbulence, the range of angular spatial frequency where oceanic turbulence plays the major role rather than particle scattering is higher for the dominating temperature-induced turbulence.

The maximum perpendicular field components appearing around the turns located at the two coil ends degrade the critical current and energy storage capacity of the whole coil, and even cause significant AC loss and possible hot-spots during practical SMES operations. To enhance the critical current and reduce the ac loss of the turns located at the two coil ends, this paper investigates a novel ferromagnetic raised-edge disk structure for adjusting the magnetic field orientation to be as close as possible to a parallel angle. Finite element simulations and performance comparisons with a test 0.2-H Bi-2223 solenoid coil without any ferromagnetic disk, with a conventional flat disk, and with the proposed raised-edge disk are presented. The results obtained show that the proposed raised-edge disk has much better effects towards critical current improvement and AC loss reduction compared to a conventional flat disk, especially for the terminal coil turns near the inner wall of the whole coil.

Here, two simple donor-(pi conjugated spacer)-acceptor dyes, in which hexyloxy-substituted phenyl as an electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor and different spacers thiophene (LD03) or furan (LD04) as the pi-linkers, were designed and synthesized as co-sensitizers for N719-based DSSCs. The photophysical, electrochemical, photovoltaic performances and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of these DSSCs were investigated in detail. When compared to the DSSCs fabricated from individual N719, the co-sensitized DSSCs (N719 + LD03 and N719 + LD04) showed significantly enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) and open circuit voltage (V-oc) simultaneously, which owing to the co-sensitizers could effectively overcome the competitive light absorption by I-3(-) in the electrolyte, avoid dye aggregation and reduce the charge recombination.

State-of-the-art CoolMOS MOSFETs are introduced and immersed in liquid nitrogen to save about 85% of conduction losses. Considering the anisotropy of gadolinium barium copper oxide (GdBCO) tapes, ferromagnetic disks with raised edges are optimized to enhance the critical current and reduce the hysteresis loss of the HTS smoothing inductor. As compared to the conventional boost chopper composed of ambient-temperature power electronics and a copper inductor, the total operational loss from the cryogenic MOSFETs and the HTS inductor in the proposed cryogenic boost chopper is reduced by 87% in the case of a 40-kW chopper.

The superconducting dc cables are favored for both high-efficiency power transmission under normal conditions and self-triggering fault-current-limiting operation under fault conditions. The SMES-based HESS is integrated, with the merits of fast response speed and high-power density from the SMES, and high-energy density and high-economic efficiency from conventional battery energy storage (BES), and thus, is much more effective a sole SMES or BES device for smoothing the line voltage fluctuations caused by some sudden load variations or short-circuit faults. The simulation results obtained from energy efficiency analyses and energy management simulations show that the proposed superconducting LVDC network has significant advantages in high-efficiency, high-quality power transmission and distribution compared to conventional ac networks.

However, the magnetic field in an HTS transformer affects the transformer's HTS winding performances. The relationship between HTS tape characteristics and the magnetic field has been studied. The HTS windings critical current can be increased with the perpendicular magnetic field decreasing. A concept of unbalanced degree is introduced in this paper. The unbalanced degree of critical current distributions at the ends of windings decreases with the perpendicular magnetic field and the unbalanced degree of perpendicular magnetic field distributions decreasing. For the effects of flux diverter, the unbalanced degrees of perpendicular magnetic field and critical current distributions are analyzed and optimized.

By performing direct numerical simulations, we investigate the formation and dynamics of the vortices in the wake as a function of the moving velocity and the radius of the potential. For moderate moving velocity, we observe the formation of a bound vortex pair in the wake of the potential. Its shedding period and associated patterns depend on the radius of the potential, showing V-shaped, periodic, or complex wakes. More interestingly, at high velocity both the vortex pair and vortex dipole can be formed simultaneously. Furthermore, the activation time for vortex formation is investigated for different velocities. We also give an experimental protocol to observe these phenomena in future experiments.

We find that the three metallocen molecules structure become stretched along the transport direction, the distance between two C-p rings longer than the other theory and experiment results. The lager conductance is found in nickelocene molecule, the main transmission channel is the electron coupling between molecule and the electrodes is through the Ni d(xz) and d(yz) orbitals and the s, d(xz) d(yz) of gold. This is also confirmed by the highest occupied molecular orbital resonance at Fermi level. In addition, negative differential resistance effect is found in the ferrocene, cobaltocene molecules, this is also closely related with the evolution of the transmission spectrum under applied bias.

A two-year field study conducted in an alpine forest meta-ecosystem-with four litter species (i.e., willow: Salix paraplesia, azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum, cypress: Sabina saltuaria, and larch: Larix mastersiana) that varied widely in chemical traits showed that both litter species and ecosystem type (i.e., forest floor, stream and riparian zone) are important factors affecting litter decomposition, and their effects can be moderated by local-scale environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability. Litter decomposed fastest in the streams followed by the riparian zone and forest floor regardless of species. For a given litter species, both the k value and limit value varied significantly among ecosystems, indicating that the litter decomposition rate and extent (i.e., reaching a limit value) can be substantially affected by ecosystem type and the local-scale environmental factors. Apart from litter initial acid unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) concentration and its ratio to nitrogen concentration (i.e., AUR/N ratio), the initial nutrient concentrations of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were also important litter traits that affected decomposition depending on the ecosystem type.

The obtained results observed that the ferromagnetic order is the most stable ground state and the magnetic moment will collapse at about 50 GPa. As a result, the lattice a axis becomes stiffer above about 420 GPa, ultimately presenting the same axial compressibility trends with those of nonmagnetic compounds Mo2TiAlC2 and hypothetical Cr2TiAlC2. The elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves demonstrate the structural stability during the disappearance of magnetic moment and occurrence of axial alternative compressibility. The density of states and energy band calculations confirmed the existence of magnetic moment of Cr2TiAlC2 at 0 GPa and disappearance at high pressures above 50 GPa. Evolutions of magnetic moment collapse with pressure are confirmed by a variety of properties. The obtained gruneisen parameter and thermal expansion coefficients show the maximum value among the known MAX phases, to date and to the author's knowledge.

In this work, a novel, cloud cap-like and phosphorus/nitrogen co-containing biomass carbon material derived from mushroom as cathode host materials for lithium sulfur batteries were fabricated by a facile H3PO4 activation method. The porous carbon carbonized at 650 degrees C contains abundant micro/mesopores and possesses the high BET surface area of 788 m(2) g(-1) and the main pore size of 1.1-2.5 nm, which can boost the adsorption of sulfur and polysulphides by melt-diffusion technology. The sulfur/biomass carbon composite delivers the high initial specific capacity of 1357.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and high capacity retention of 729 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles due to its specific porous structure. The relatively high discharge capacity of 213 mA h g(-1) is exhibited in the composite even after 72 cycles at higher discharge rates (0.2 C, 0.3 C, 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C). All these superior performances well validate the excellent stability and reversibility of the biomass porous carbon as a promising cathode matrix for lithium-sulfur batteries. In addition, the biomass carbon derived from mushroom contains simultaneously phosphorus and nitrogen, which can improve the specific capacity. For the present carbon materials, the special porous structure may encapsulate sulfur particles, inhibit the dissolution of polysulphides in the electrolyte and thus lead to the excellent performances of the materials.

Unique mechanical properties of nano-grained YAG transparent ceramics compared with coarse-grained partners	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Nano ceramics; YAG; Nanoindentation; Mechanical property; Toughness	ELASTIC-MODULUS; NANOINDENTATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCERAMICS; FABRICATION; COMPOSITES; HARDNESS; LOAD	In order to improve the inherent brittleness of the conventional coarse-grained YAG transparent ceramics, nano-grained YAG transparent ceramics were fabricated at 5 GPa/450 degrees C using the super high pressure sintering technique. Their mechanical properties were investigated by nanoindentation and the Vickers indentation measuring methods. It was found that the nano-grained YAG transparent ceramics exhibited much better ductility compared with the coarse-grained counterparts. The grain-boundary sliding provides the main contribution to plastic deformations of nano-grained YAG transparent ceramics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Wang, H. M.; Huang, Z.

J	He, K; Wang, D; Zheng, XQ				He, Kun; Wang, Dan; Zheng, Xiuqing			Image segmentation on adaptive edge-preserving smoothing	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article						edge-preserving smoothing; region-confidence level; clustering algorithm; image segmentation	EVOLUTION	Nowadays, typical active contour models are widely applied in image segmentation. However, they perform badly on real images with inhomogeneous subregions. In order to overcome the drawback, this paper proposes an edge-preserving smoothing image segmentation algorithm. At first, this paper analyzes the edge-preserving smoothing conditions for image segmentation and constructs an edge-preserving smoothing model inspired by total variation. The proposed model has the ability to smooth inhomogeneous subregions and preserve edges. Then, a kind of clustering algorithm, which reasonably trades off edge-preserving and subregion-smoothing according to the local information, is employed to learn the edge-preserving parameter adaptively. At last, according to the confidence level of segmentation subregions, this paper constructs a smoothing convergence condition to avoid oversmoothing. Experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm has superior performance in precision, recall, and F-measure compared with other segmentation algorithms, and it is insensitive to noise and inhomogeneous-regions.

To improve their applicable property of mesomorphic temperature ranges, we exploit the binary mixtures of electronic donor-acceptor DLC materials. The electron-rich 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(alkoxy) triphenylenes (C4, C6, C8, C10, C12) and an electron-deficient tetrapentyl triphenylene-2,3,6,10-tetracarboxylate have been prepared and their binary mixtures have been investigated. The mesomorphism of the 1:1 (molar ratio) mixtures has been characterized by polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and small angel x-ray scattering (SAXS). The self-assembled monolayer structure of a discogen on a solid-liquid interface has been imaged by the high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The match of peripheral chain length has important influence on the mesomorphism of the binary mixtures.

In addition, we investigate the influence of heating holding time and also compare the observed TME in current study with that of shape memory alloys (SMAs). It is concluded that the TME via DSC (without any macroscopic shape change) is achievable within the glass transition range of a polymer. Conversely, although the observed TME shares the many similar features as those in SMAs, due to the nature of micro-Brownian motion in the glass transition of polymers, the resulted TME is strongly affected by the heating holding time.

Here, two novel metal-free organic dyes, in which dithiafulvenyl unit was introduced into phenothiazine donor as an additional electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor, and without (PTZ-2) or with (PTZ-3) a benzene as the pi-linker between phenothiazine donor and cyanoacrylic acid electron-withdrawing group, were synthesized by modifying the simple D-pi-A dye (PTZ-1) and successfully utilized in DSSCs. Their photophysical, electrochemical, photovoltaic properties and theoretical calculations were further investigated. Relative to the reference dye PTZ-1, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) increased significantly from 4.04% to 5.81% (PTZ-2) and 5.22% (PTZ-3), which came mainly from the enhancement of short-circuit current (J(sc)) due to the broader molecular absorption spectra and higher molar extinction coefficients. What's more, it is worth noting that the dyes of PTZ-2 and PTZ-3 have strong absorption, which can compensate for that of N719 in the low wavelength region, especially in the region of similar to 300-500 nm. Therefore, a co-sensitization approach has been used for achieving enhanced performances in DSSCs wherein N719 was co-sensitized with PTZ-2 and PTZ-3, respectively. Consequently, the co-sensitized DSSC (PTZ-2 + N719) gave the highest efficiency of 8.12%, exhibiting an improvement of 16.50% compared to the device sensitized with N719 alone (PCE = 6.97%) under the same conditions.

Reaction of (LH2)-H-n with two equivalents of AlR'(3) (R' = Me, Et) afforded dinuclear alkylaluminium complexes [(AlR'(2))(2)L1-3] (R = R' = Me (1), R = tBu, R' = Me (2), R = Cl, R' = Me (3), R = Me, R' = Et (4), R = tBu, R' = Et (5), R = Cl, R' = Et (6)). For comparative studies, reactions of two equivalents of AlR3' (R' = Me, Et) with the macrocycle derived from 2,2*-ethylenedianiline and 2,6-dicarboxy-R-phenols (R = Me (LH2)-H-4, tBu (LH2)-H-5) were conducted; the complexes [(AlMe)(AlMe2)L-5]center dot 2 1/4MeCN (7.2-1-,MeCN) and [(AIEt(2))(2)L-4] (8) were isolated. Use of limited AIEt(3) with (LH2)-H-3 or (LH2)-H-5 afforded mononuclear bis(macrocyclic) complexes [Al(L-3)((LH)-H-3)]center dot 4toluene (9-4toluene) and [Al(L-5)((LH)-H-5)]center dot 5MeCN (10.5MeCN), respectively. Use of four equivalents of AlR'(3) led to transfer of alkyl groups and isolation of the complexes [(AlR'(2))(4)L1'-3) (R = L-2', R' = Me (11); L-3', R' = Me (12); L-1', R' = Et (13); L-2', R' = Et (14); L-3', R' = Et (15)), where L-1,L--3' is the macrocycle resulting from double alkyl transfer to imine, namely ([2-(O)-5-(R)C6H2-1-(CH)-3-C(R')H][(O)(2-(N)-2'C6H4N)(2)]}(2). Molecular structures of complexes 7.2 1/4MeCN, 8, 9.4toluene, 10.5MeCN and 11-1 3/4toluene.1 1/4hexane are reported. These complexes act as catalysts for the ring opening polymerisation (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone and rac-lactide; high conversions were achieved over 30 min at 80 degrees C for epsilon-caprolactone, and 110 degrees C over 12 h for rac-lactide.

On the basis of the quantum coherent transport theory and transfer matrix method, we investigate the spin polarized electron transport and the tunnel magnetic resistance (TMR) in parabolic well magnetic tunneling junction with double barriers. We derive the analytical expressions of transmission probability, tunnel magnetic resistance and spin polarization from the new magnetic tunneling junction mode. The significant quantum size, Rashba spin orbit interaction, the angle effect and the thickness of the double barriers layer are discussed simultaneously. The results indicate that the tunnel magnetic resistance shows periodic variation as the width of the parabolic-well at different angles. The TMR is monotonically decreasing when the angle theta varying from 0 to pi, which reflects the structure of the spin valve effect. Meanwhile, results also show that the spin polarization and the tunnel magnetic resistance oscillate with the same period for different barriers thickness. The phase difference appears after inserting the barriers. With increasing the barriers width, phase difference becomes large. The amplitude and peak to alley ratio of the spin polarization and the tunnel magnetic resistance are increase with the barrier width increases. Furthermore, the spin polarization make quasiperiodic oscillation that the oscillation amplitudes become large, the period and peak to alley ratio are decrease as the Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength increases. It appears the spin flip phenomenon as increasing the thickness of the barriers. The TMR shows the typical properties of resonant tunneling with the increasing of the spin orbit coupling strength. In order to better reveal the role of the symmetry double tunnel barriers in the parabolic well structure, we calculate TMR against the thickness of the double barriers. It is found that the existence of the double tunnel barriers increase the TMR and the spin polarization significantly, which shows that the large TMR value can be obtained with the suitable layer thickness of the double barriers layer and the Rashba spin-orbital coupling coefficients. These characteristics are helpful to promote the development and application of new magnetic tunnel junctions.

Structure of the complex was characterized by various physico-chemical methods and single crystal X-ray diffraction. X-ray crystal structure determination reveals that the complex crystallizes as monoclinic space group Cc, with unit cell dimensions a = 13.497(2) angstrom, b = 9.558(2) angstrom, c = 7.010(1) angstrom, beta = 91.447(2)degrees, V = 904.1(3) angstrom(3), Z = 4, R-1 = 0.0461, wR(2) = 0.1240. The asymmetric unit of the compound contains a [AgL] complex moiety and a water molecule of crystallization. Each Ag atom is coordinated by two amino nitrogen atoms, forming a linear geometry. The ligand bridged two silver atoms has a distance of 7.683(2) angstrom. In the crystal structure of the compound, the silver atoms are linked through 3,5-diaminobenzoate ligands, forming chains running along the a axis. The chains are further linked by water molecules through intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds, to generate a three-dimensional network. In addition, pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are observed among the chains. Silver complexes are cytotoxic to most cancer cell lines. The complex in the present work is cytotoxic on human lung cancer cell line A549, with the IC50 value of 11.5 +/- 1.7-mu M.

Then, motivated by the idea of traditional arithmetic operation, we have developed some aggregation operators for aggregating hesitant fuzzy linguistic information: hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted average (HFLWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (HFLOWA) operator and hesitant fuzzy linguistic hybrid average (HFLHA) operator. Furthermore, we propose the concept of the dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set and develop some aggregation operators with dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple attribute decision making problems. Finally, a practical example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

The effects of heat treatment temperatures and Zn doping on the structure, photocathodic protection and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 thin films were investigated. It is indicated that the photoelectrical performance of the Zn-TiO2 films is enhanced with the addition of Zn element compared with the pure-TiO2 film and the largest decline by 897 mV in the electrode potential is achieved under 300 degrees C heat treatment. SEM-EDS analyses show that Zn element is unevenly distributed in Zn-TiO2 films; XRD patterns reveal that the grain size of Zn-TiO2 is smaller than that of pure-TiO2; FTIR results indicate that Zn-O bond forms on Zn-TiO2 surface. Ultraviolet visible absorption spectra prove that Zn-TiO2 shifts to visible light region. Mott-Shottky curves show that the flat-band potential of Zn-TiO2 is more negative and charge carrier density is bigger than that of pure-TiO2, implying that under the synergy of the width of the space-charge layer, carrier density and flat-band potential, Zn-TiO2 with 300 degrees C heat treatment displays the best photocathodic protection performance.

Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) values were calculated to assess the correlations of pre-chemotherapy SUV (SUV1), post-chemotherapy SUV (SUV2), SUV Ratio, total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Twenty-three studies with 1261 patients were identified. The combined HRs for EFS were 1.84 (95% CI: 1.54-2.20) for SUV1, 2.92 (95% CI: 2.15-3.97) for SUV2, 1.90 (95% CI: 1.43-2.52) for SUV Ratio, 3.01 (95% CI: 1.36-6.67) for TLG and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.44-3.75) for MTV. The pooled HRs for OS were 1.85 (95% CI: 1.49-2.30) for SUV1, 2.00 (95% CI: 1.39-2.88) for SUV2, 2.20 (95% CI: 1.18-4.10) for SUV Ratio, 6.19 (95% CI: 2.17-17.66) for TLG and 2.67 (95% CI: 1.52-4.68) for MTV. Besides, high SUV1 was found to be significantly associated with higher rate of metastasis (RR 5.55, 95% CI: 2.75-11.18) and local recurrence (RR 1.87 95% CI: 1.28-2.72). Conclusion: (18)F-FDG PET parameters of SUV1, SUV2, SUV Ratio, TLG and MTV may have effective prognostic significance for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma. (18)F-FDG PET imaging may be a promising tool to help predict survival outcomes of these patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ji, XL; Chen, H; Ji, GM				Ji, Xiaoling; Chen, Hong; Ji, Guangming			Characteristics of annular beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence along a downlink path and an uplink path	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; GAUSSIAN BEAMS; LASER-BEAMS; SCINTILLATION INDEX; RANDOM-MEDIA; SLANT PATH; SATELLITE; SPACE; DIRECTIONALITY; DEGRADATION	Characteristics of annular beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence along a downlink path and an uplink path are studied in detail by using numerical simulation method. It is found that in downlink the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the characteristics is quite different from that in uplink because of the altitude-dependent index structure constant. It is shown that, when the zenith angle. is not large enough, it is always sigma(2)(I up) > sigma(I) (2)(down) down on propagation whatever the value of the obscure ratio epsilon is, where sigma(2)(I up) and sigma(I) (2)(down) are the on-axis scintillation index in uplink and downlink, respectively. However, when theta is large enough, sigma(I) (2)(down) is close to sigma(2)(I up) as the propagation distance theta increases, and sigma(2)(I up) and sigma(I) (2)(down) overlap each other as epsilon increases. Furthermore, as theta increases, sigma(2)(I up) approaches an asymptotical value when theta is not large enough, and the saturation phenomenon of sigma(2)(I up) appears when theta is large enough. But the asymptotical value and the saturation phenomenon of sigma(I) (2)(down) never appear. On the other hand, the energy focusability in downlink is better than that in uplink, and the difference of energy focusability between a downlink and an uplink increases with increasing theta or decreasing epsilon. In addition, in downlink there may exist sidelobes of intensity distributions when theta is not large enough, but the sidelobes never appear in uplink.

Four litter species (i.e., willow: Salix paraplesia, azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum, cypress: Sabina saltuaria, and larch: Larix mastersiana) that had varying initial litter chemical traits were placed separately in litterbags and then incubated on the soil surface of forest floor plots or in the water of the stream and riparian zone plots. Litterbags were retrieved five times each year during the two-year experiment, with nine replicates each time for each treatment. The results suggested that foliar litter lost 32.2%-89.2% of the initial dry mass depending on litter species and ecosystem type after two-year's incubation. The cellulose lost 60.1%-96.8% of the initial mass with degradation rate in the order of stream > riparian zone > forest floor. Substantial cellulose degradation occurred at the very beginning (i.e., in the first pre-freezing period) of litter decomposition. Litter initial concentrations of phosphorus (P) and lignin were found to be the dominant chemical traits controlling cellulose degradation regardless of ecosystems type. The local-scale environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability were important moderators of cellulose degradation rate. Although the effects of common litter chemical traits (e.g., P and lignin concentrations) on cellulose degradation across different individual ecosystems were identified, local-scale environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability were found to be of great importance for cellulose degradation. These results indicated that local-scale environmental factors should be considered apart from litter quality for generating a reliable predictive framework for the drivers of cellulose degradation and further on litter decomposition at a global scale.

Using Pt-n clusters as catalytic models, we studied the selective hydrogenation reaction mechanism for CAL catalyzed by Pt-n (n = 6, 10, 14, 18) clusters by means of B3LYP in density functional theory at the 6-31+ G(d) level (the LanL2DZ extra basis set was used for the Pt atom). The rationality of the transition state was proved by vibration frequency analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate computation. Moreover, atoms in molecules theory and nature bond orbital theory were applied to discuss the interaction among orbitals and the bonding characteristics. The results indicate that three kinds of products, namely 3-phenylpropyl aldehyde, 3-phenyl allyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol, are produced in the selective hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by Pt-n clusters; each pathway possesses two reaction channels. Pt-n clusters are more likely to catalyze the activation and hydrogenation of the C = O bond in CAL molecules, eventually producing cinnamic alcohol, which proves that Pt-n clusters have a strong reaction selectivity to catalyze CAL. The reaction selectivity of the catalyzer cluster is closely related to the size of the Pt-n cluster, with Pt-14 clusters having the greatest reaction selectivity.

J	Liu, L; Liang, HT				Liu, Lu; Liang, Haoting			Influence Analysis for Celebrities via Public Cloud and Social Platform	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						cloud computing; social media analytics; large deviation principle	TV	Recently, the online social networks have emerged as one of the important platforms for social users. Among millions of users, famous person from entertainment circle arouse our interest. They promote social relationship and establish their reputation via these platforms. To analyze the social influence of entertainment stars, we propose and implement a public cloud based framework to crawl celebrities' social messages from Sina Weibo, store the gathered messages, and conduct various analysis to assess the social influence. It consist of three key components: task generation, resource management and task scheduling, and influence analysis. The task generation is responsible of acquiring celebrities' social accounts and issue crawling tasks. We propose a cross-media method to extract social accounts from webpages. The resource management and task scheduling will dynamic adjust the rented resource to minimize the total computing cost while keeping QoS. We propose a dynamic instance provisioning strategy based on the large deviation principle. The influence analysis will undertake various types of analysis, such as fan count, posting frequency, textual analysis, and so on. More than 10,000 celebrities' microblogs have been gathered so far, and some related gainers, such as celebrities and ad agencies can gain the illumination brought by our analysis.

The calculated lattice constants a and c are in agreement with the available experimental data and similar theoretical calculations. Through a series of researches, the mechanical parameters (the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young's modulus) and Debye temperature, the wave velocities are systematically investigated. Additionally, the mechanical anisotropy has been characterized by calculating Young's modulus and described by the three-dimensional (3D) surface constructions and its projections. By using the born stability criteria and phonon frequency, it is concluded that the beta-Si3N4 is stable mechanically and dynamically up to 35 GPa. Finally, the thermal properties have been calculated by employing the quasi-harmonic Debye model at different temperatures (0-800 K) and pressures (0-35 GPa).	[Hou, H. J.; Zhu, H. J.; Lao, C.

In this study, the experiment was designed in two factors and five levels random block design to investigate the interaction effects of Cs and K. Results showed that excessive Cs was one of the main factors influence the growth of Brassica juncea seedlings. And the toxicity of Cs in Brassica juncea is likely to be caused by Cs interacts with K binding sites in essential K-dependent protein, either competes with K for essential biochemical functions, causing intracellular metabolic disturbance. To test the hypothesis that the toxicity of Cs might cause intracellular metabolic disturbance, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based Illumina paired-end Solexa sequencing platform was employed to analysis the changes in gene expression, and understand the key genes in B. juncea seedlings responding to the toxicity of Cs. Based on the assembled de novo transcriptome, 2032 DEGs that play significant roles in the response to the toxicity of Cs were identified. Further analysis showed that excessive Cs is disturbance the auxin signal transduction pathway, and inhibited the indoleacetic acid-induced protein (AUX/IAA) genes expression eventually lead the seedlings growth and development be inhibited. The results suggest that disturbances to tryptophan metabolism might be linked to changes in growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One method of fostering globalisation is to incorporate cross-national asynchronous online discussions with students from different countries within courses. The purpose of this study was to explore if participation by American and Chinese graduate students in cross-national online discussions facilitated construction of new knowledge regarding western and eastern cultures and provided effective international learning experiences. Data sources include students' transcripts and responses to open-ended survey questions on their perceptions regarding the online discussions. Results indicate that cross-national online discussions facilitated new knowledge regarding very different cultures. Further, this research offers a model that provides authentic international learning experiences where students explore meaningful concepts and relationships to address relevant problems in education.

It is found that the dynamical system can be perfectly analyzed by equivalently transforming it into a traditional first order linear dynamical system driven by periodic signal and additive noise in fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain with an optimal rotated angle, and the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that output SNR exhibits the SR behavior when it is plotted as a function of the system parameter. Furthermore, the optimal value of adjusted parameter is obtained, and the possible area of SNR gain is theoretically determined only by center-frequency and modulated frequency of the driving LFM signal.

Three stimuli were displayed sequentially and participants were asked to learn the target category based on the invariant feature among stimuli. The processes of invariance detection and variance inhibition were necessary during certain events; however, these processes were not required for other events. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated that the processes of detecting invariant features and inhibiting variant features were associated with significant activation in the left prefrontal cortex, including the left superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as other regions (e.g., bilateral parietal cortex and putamen). These findings confirmed the important role of the fronto-parietal network and striatum in the invariance detection of category learning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, SH; Cao, XX; He, L; Zhu, WJ				Tang Shi-Hui; Cao Xiu-Xia; He Lin; Zhu Wen-Jun			Effects of vacancy point defects and phase transitions on optical properties of shocked Al2O3	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						high pressure; first-principles calculations; optical properties; sapphire	HIGH-PRESSURE PHASE; REFRACTIVE-INDEX; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; COMPRESSION; SAPPHIRE; CRYSTALS; ALUMINA; LAYER; LIF; GPA	The velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR) and pyrometric measurements in dynamic high-pressure experiments require the use of an optical window, and Alumina (Al2O3) or sapphires is often considered as a window material due to its high shock impedance and excellent transparency. Consequently, understanding the characteristics of its transparency and refractive index change under shock loading is crucial for explaining such experimental data. Experimental studies indicate optical transparency loss in shocked Al2O3. The mechanisms for the phenomenon are some interesting issues. A first-principles study suggests that shock-induced V-O(+2) (the + 2 charged O vacancy) defects in Al2O3 could be an important factor causing the transparency loss. Recently, the red shift of the extinction curve (i.e., the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient) with increasing shock pressure has been observed. It is needed to ascertain whether this behavior is also related to shock-induced vacancy point defects. In addition, up to now, information about Al2O3 refractive index at a wavelength of 532 nm under strong shock compression (the optical source wavelength in VISAR measurement is usually set at 532 nm) has been unknown, and neither the effects of structural transitions nor vacancy point defects on the refractive index of shocked Al2O3 are determined. Here, to investigate the above-mentioned questions, we perform first principles calculations of optical absorption and refractive index properties of Al2O3 crystal without and with V-O(+2) and V-Al(-3) (the 3 charged Al vacancy) defects in a pressure range of 180 GPa (the calculations in CASTEP are carried out by the plane-wave pseudo potential method in the framework of the density functional theory). Our absorption data show that the observed optical extinction in shocked Al2O3 cannot be explained by only considering pressure and temperature factors, but shock-induced V-O(+2) should be an important source for this behavior. On the basis of these results, we may judge that 1) the transparency loss explanation for shocked Al2O3 in the view of vacancy point defects is reasonable; 2) the absorption extinction should dominate the extinction phenomenon observed in shocked Al2O3. Our calculations find that high-pressure structural transition in Al2O3 causes an obvious enhancement of its refractive index. The refractive index decreases with increasing shock pressure in corundum and Rh2O3 regions, and decreases slightly below 172 GPa and increases slowly above 172 GPa with increasing shock pressure in CalrO(3) region. The V-O(+2) and V-Al(-3) defects in Al2O3 have apparent influences on the shock pressure dependence of its refractive index. These results mean that the information about Al2O3 refractive index under strong shock loading cannot be obtained simply by extrapolating its low pressure data. Our prediction could be of importance for future experimental study and new window-material development.

Accordingly, a new ground-state crystal structure WB2 (P6(3)/mmc, 2 fu/cell) is uncovered. The experimental synthesized rhombohedral R (3) over barm and hexagonal AlB2, as well as theoretical predicted RuB2 structures, are no longer the most favorite structures. By analyzing the elastic constants, formation enthalpies, and phonon dispersion, we find that the WB2 phase is 20 thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The high bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, low Poisson's ratio v, and small B/G ratio are benefit to its low compressibility. When the pressure is 10 GPa, a phase transition is observed between the A WB2-MoB2 and the rhombohedral R (3) over barm MoB2 phases. By analyzing the density of states and electron density, we find that the strong, covalent is formed in MOB2 compounds, which contributes a great deal to its low compressibility. Furthermore, the low compressibility is also correlated with the local buckled structure.

Structural stabilities, elastic and electronic properties of chromium tetraboride from first-principles calculations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B			English	Article						CrB4; structures; elastic properties; hardness; electronic properties; first principles calculations	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SUPERHARD MATERIALS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; RHENIUM DIBORIDE; OSMIUM DIBORIDE; PHASE-STABILITY; 1ST PRINCIPLES; METAL BORIDES; HARD; PRESSURE	First-principles calculations are employed to investigate the structural and elastic properties, formation enthalpies and chemical bonding features as well as hardness values of chromium tetraboride (CrB4) with different structures. The lattice parameters, Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio are also derived. Our calculations indicate that the orthorhombic structure with Pnnm symmetry is the most energetically stable one for CrB4. Except for WB(4)P6(3)/mmc structure with imaginary frequencies, another six new structures are investigated through the full phonon dispersion calculations. Their mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities are also studied by calculating the elastic constants and formation enthalpies. Our calculations show that the thermodynamic stabilities of all these CrB4 phases can be enhanced under high pressure. The large shear moduli, Young's moduli and hardness values indicate that these CrB4 phases are potential hard materials. Analyses of the densities of states (DOSS) and electron localization functions (ELFs) provide further understandings of the chemical and physical properties of these CrB4 phases. It is observed that the large occupations and high strengths of the B-B covalent bonds are important for the stabilities, incompressibility and hardnesses of these CrB4 phases.

In this work, we successfully converted commercial cotton threads (CT) into electrically conductive and electrochemically active threads by introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) using a large-scale producible method (dip-coating combined with low-temperature vapour reduction). The rGO coated CT (rGO-CT) has impressive conductivity which is attributed to the wrapped rGO nanosheets and it is steady enough to tolerate washing process for a long time. After coated with CNPs, the conductivity of CNPs/rGO composites coated CT (CNPs/rGO-CT) has been enhanced tremendously. Meanwhile, the rGO nanosheets with implanted CNPs form the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures which provide abundant ion transmission channels. Furthermore, we have prepared the CNPs/rGO-CT based FSC, which exhibits high volumetric capacitance (3.79 mF cm(-3) at 50 mV s(-1)), well cycling stability (95.23% capacitance retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles), and excellent electrochemical stability (92.30% capacitance retention after 2000 bending cycles). Especially, the CNPs/rGO-CT based FSC maintains great capacitive performance when it was knitted into textile, thus making it meet the high performance requirements of energy storage devices for knittable and wearable electronics.

An accurate investigation into this modulation mechanism would reveal how STIM1-dependent channel gating is enhanced, and benefit the future immune enhancer development. Here, we directly probed the pore diameter of CRAC channels and found that 2-APB enlarged the pore size of STIM1-activated Orai1 from 3.8 to 4.6 angstrom. We demonstrated that ions with small sizes, i.e., Ca2+ and Na+, mediated prominent 2-APB-induced I-p on the wildtype (WT) Orai1 channels of narrow pore sizes, while conducted decreased or no I-p on Orai1-V102C/A/G mutant channels with enlarged pore diameters. On the contrary, large Cs+ ions blocked the WT channels, while displayed large 2-APB induced I-p on poreenlarged Orai1-V102C/A/G mutant channels, and the potentiation ratio was highest on Orai1-V102C with an intermediate pore size. Furthermore, we showed that 2-APB potentiated Cs+ current on constitutively active Orai1-V102C/A/G mutants independent of STIM1. Our data suggest that 2-APB directly dilates the pore of open Orai1 channels, both ion size and pore diameter jointly determine the amplitude of I-p on CRAC channels, and the generation of I-p requires the open state of Orai1, not STIM1 itself.

Five model anti-cancer drugs were chosen to evaluate the drug selection, drug loading and releasing performance of carbon nanoparticle suspension. The relative recovery, precision, stability and limited detection range were studied in details. We found that the CNSI selectively adsorbed DOX and EPI and hardly adsorbed PTX, CDDP and 5-FU. The isothermal curves of CNSI adsorption to DOX and EPI are all fitted well with the Freundlich model. The adsorption process is not monolayer adsorption. By in vivo topical administration of DOX-loaded CNSI and EPI-loaded CNSI, we found that the drug-loaded CNSI were not only maintained its lymph node staining properties but also targeted delivery the drugs to the lymph node. The results demonstrated that the CNSI is not only used to vital staining of lymph vessels and lymph nodes but also can be used as drug delivery carrier. CNSI is a promising theranostic carrier for DOX or EPI delivery in cancer therapy.

With increasing the Te concentration, the favorable substitution sites are 2Te-Ga-A and 3Te-Ga-D.

The effects of spin-orbit coupling and rotation on the ground state vortex structures are investigated. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, new nucleated vortices gradually form vortex lines and annular vortex structures with the increase of the rotation frequency. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, part of the vortices arrange in a line and form a stable vortex chain, and the remanent vortices coexist in pairs aside such vortex chain. More specially, the remanent vortices of each component repel each other and form vortex pair for isotropic spin-orbit coupling, while attract each other and locate in the same positions for anisotropic spin-orbit coupling.

The effects of different volatile allelochemicals (volatile oil, cymene and alpha-terpinene) from C. ambrosioides were examined to see their effect on the root length, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels/localization, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and antioxidant enzyme activities in maize radicles. All these allelochemicals inhibited the growth of maize radicles, increased the MDA and ROS contents in tip cells of the root cap and meristem. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were reduced. The volatile oil of C. ambrosioides and its two main components inhibited the growth of maize radical by inducing oxidative stress through the enhanced generation of ROS, accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation and inactivation of antioxidant enzyme system.

The Ethical Judgment and Moral Reaction to the Product-Harm Crisis: Theoretical Model and Empirical Research	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						product-harm crisis; ethical judgment; condemning emotion; purchasing intention; negative word of mouth; product knowledge	CONSUMER RESPONSE; MODERATING ROLE; IMPACT; EMOTIONS; BEHAVIOR; ATTRIBUTIONS; EXPRESSION; REPUTATION; CONTEMPT; TIMES	Based on the dual-process theory of ethical judgment, a research model is proposed for examining consumers' moral reactions to a product-harm crisis. A national-wide survey was conducted with 801 respondents in China. The results of this study indicate that consumers will react to a product-harm crisis through controlled cognitive processing and emotional intuition. The results of the study also show that consumers view a product-harm crisis as an ethical issue, and they will make an ethical judgment according to the perceived severity and perceived relevance of the crisis. The ethical judgment in the perceived crisis severity and perceived crisis relevance will affect consumers' condemning emotions in terms of contempt and anger. Through controlled cognitive processing, a personal consumption-related reaction (purchasing intention) is influenced by the perceived crisis severity. Furthermore, a social and interpersonal reaction (negative word of mouth) is influenced by the perceived crisis relevance through the controlled cognitive processing. This social and interpersonal reaction is also influenced by the perceived crisis severity and perceived crisis relevance through the intuition of other-condemning emotion. Moreover, this study finds that the product knowledge negatively moderates the impact of the perceived crisis severity on the condemning emotions. Therefore, when a consumer has a high level of product knowledge, the effect of perceived crisis severity on the condemning emotions will be attenuated, and vice versa.

In this study, we used real-time qPCR to investigate the abundance of bacteria, archaea, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), and the amoA gene transcripts, during the decomposition of dwarf bamboo (Fargesia nitida) litter under different snow patches at various snow-cover stages in an alpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau in China. The effects of snow thickness were significant, with thicker snow patches resulting in higher microbial abundance and the amoA gene transcripts, while the degree of the effects were different. Compared with AOB, AOA were more abundant on the majority of sampling dates during the freeze-thaw period, and as well as their amoA gene transcripts. AOA are more persistent and abundant than AOB, and the higher AOA/AOB ratios were observed clearly in shrub litter and continued to decrease as the snow thickness increased, meanwhile gradually increased under uniform snow thickness over time. Our results suggested that the reduced seasonal snow cover and shortened freeze-thaw cycle periods caused by winter warming would significantly affect the ammonia oxidizers particularly tied to the ammonia oxidation process, and then could contribute to N cycle as related to litter in alpine forest ecosystems.

It is a coupled system which describes the spontaneous generation of a magnetic field in a cold plasma under the static limit. The main difficulty in the proofs lies in exploring the inner structure of the equations due to the fact that the nonlocal terms violate the inner scaling invariance, which may cause the non-zero energy for the ground state. For this reason, we first make a proper use of the inner structure of the equations to establish the existence of standing waves, and then we apply an energy scaling to obtain the instability of standing waves. Finally we show a sharp threshold for the global existence of solutions to the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equations by a variational method, which depends again on the inner structure of the equations under consideration.

The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters and formation enthalpy are in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. The calculated results indicate that the V-Si compounds are mechanically stable. Elastic properties including bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio are also obtained. The elastic anisotropies of V-Si compounds are investigated via the three-dimensional (3D) figures of directional dependences of reciprocals of Young's modulus. Finally, based on the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, Gruneisen parameter, and Debye temperature of V-Si compounds have been calculated.

The microstructures and luminescence properties of the as-synthesized microcrystals were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Moreover, the photoluminescent properties of Eu3+-doped beta-NaGdF4 samples synthesized at different pH values were systematically discussed. As a result, monodisperse and uniform spherical and rod-like crystals were successfully synthesized by varying Ln(3+)/NaF molar ratio, Ln(3+)/Na(3)Cit molar ratio and pH value, and the obtained feasible range of pH value is 8-11, the optimal molar ratios of Ln(3+)/NaF and Ln(3+)/Na(3)Cit are 1:6 and 1:3, respectively. Our results show that there is an energy transfer process between the host and activator ions, emissions from high energy configurations to ground state are gradually quenched in the beta-NaGdF4: Eu3+ phosphors obtained in the strong alkaline solution. In addition, pure orange-red photoluminescent color can be obtained from beta-NaGdF4: 2 mol% Eu3+ phosphors synthesized under the obtained processing conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BOTDA study that used second-order DBA. Compared with BOTDA assisted by first-order DBA, the proposed approach enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio of the Brillouin trace by similar to 3 dB for a range featuring minimum sensing intensity. Long-distance sensing with similar to 5 m spatial resolution and similar to 1.6 degrees C measurement uncertainty over similar to 99 km fiber was successfully realized by employing high-efficiency pumping using similar to 6 dBm second-order and similar to 1.5 dBm first-order pumps.

It is found that a fully coherent beam is more strongly compressed on the ground than a partially (spatial) coherent beam (PCB), even so, for a PCB the compressed spot size on the ground may be reduced below the diffraction limit due to self-focusing effect, and a PCB has higher threshold critical power than a fully coherent beam. Furthermore, an effective design rule for maximal compression without beam splitting of the transported PCB from orbit to the ground is presented.

However, aryl triflate derivatives have been less used despite their high chemical tolerance, reactivity, and chemical accessibility. In this report, three series of discogens have been synthesized in good yields from appropriate triphenylene triflate precursors by Suzuki coupling reactions with various commercial arylboronic acids (e.g., aryl = phenylene, thiophene, naphthalene, triarylamine, carbazole, and fluorene). The synthesized discogens display broad mesophase ranges and high thermal stabilities. Moreover, those bearing triarylamine, carbazole, and fluorene side groups are also blue-light emitters. The availability of the triflate precursors coupled with their highly efficient cross-coupling with commercial arylboronic acids make this strategy extremely versatile and attractive for the design of new functional materials.

By using renewal process theory and total probability decomposition technique, the authors study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursive expression of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursive formula for calculating the steady state queue length at arbitrary time epoch n(+). Meanwhile, the authors obtain the explicit expressions of the additional queue length distribution. Furthermore, the important relations between the steady state queue length distributions at different time epochs n(-), n and n(+) are also reported. Finally, the authors give numerical examples to illustrate the effect of system parameters on the steady state queue length distribution, and also show from numerical results that the expressions of the steady state queue length distribution is important in the system capacity design.

All the ceramics exhibit a pure perovskite structure with rhombohedral symmetry. The grain growth of the ceramics is inhibited after the addition of Nb doping. High electric insulation (R = 10(9)-10(10) Omega a <...cm) and the poor piezoelectric performance and weak ferroelectricity are observed after the addition of Nb2O5 in the ceramics. Different from the donor effect of Pb-based perovskite ceramics, the introduction of Nb into 0.7BiFeO(3)-0.3BaTiO(3) degrades the piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The Bi0.7Ba0.3(Fe0.7Ti0.3)(1-x) Nb-0.66x O-3 + 1 mol% MnO2 ceramic with x = 0 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties with d (33) = 133 pN C-1 and k (p) = 0.29 and high Curie temperature (T-C = 603(a similar to)C).

All the ceramics possess a perovskite structure. The crystal structure of the ceramics is transformed from rhombohedral to orthorhombic phase with increasing x. The ceramics with x = 0.125-0.15 exhibit good electric insulation (R = 2.75-2.83 x 10(10) Omega cm) and strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 13.4-14.2 mu C cm(-2)). The remanent magnetism M-r and saturated magnetization M-s of the ceramics are greatly improved by 380 and 722 % with increasing x from 0 to 0.15, respectively. The present materials exhibit strong ferroelectricity, considerable improved ferromagnetism and relatively good piezoelectricity, suggesting potential applications in advanced multiferroic devices.

Litter decomposition in terrestrial lotic ecosystem is one of the most important pathways for metallic elements cycling, while little information is currently available about the dynamics of metallic elements in the decomposing litter of lotic ecosystems. The concentrations and release rates of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and aluminium (Al) were investigated in the decomposing foliar litter of four dominant species in an alpine forest river. Over a 1-year period of decomposition, K, Ca, and Mg were released from virtually all types of litter, whereas Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Al were released from willow litter but accumulated in azalea, cypress, and larch litters during litter decomposition. Litter species, decomposition period, and river water characteristics (e.g., temperature, pH, flow velocity, and nutrient availability) were significantly related to the dynamics of these metallic elements in decomposing litter. Our results suggested that the similarity between the dynamics of metallic elements in the decomposing litter of lotic ecosystems reported here and previously for forest floors indicates a general pattern for the cycling of metallic element across different ecosystem types, and the net accumulation patterns for elements such as Zn, Cu, and Al during litter decomposition suggested that some litter species may act as efficient "cleaner" for metal purification in future ecological engineering.

It is shown that the minimal time functions of the Yosida approximation equations converge to the minimal time function of the semilinear control system. Complete characterization is established for the subdifferential of the minimal time function satisfying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. These results extend the theory of finite dimensional linear control systems to infinite dimensional semilinear control systems.

Our results indicate that the a axis is stiffer than c axis within 0-100 GPa. Elastic constants calculations predict the large stability range of Mo2TiAlC2 under pressure. Several important thermodynamic properties are discussed detailedly, including the Debye temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, and heat capacity. The bonding properties are studied from the elastic quantities and electronic properties. The electronic properties are investigated, including the energy band structure, and density of states. The evidence of the instability of Mo3AlC2 and stability of Mo2TiAlC2 are successfully obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that the stability of symmetric DTMs is dominated by the radial pressure force rather than the field line bending force. Owing to the compressibility of rotating plasmas, unbalanced radial forces can just result in the rotating islands drift toward each other in the radial direction but do not trigger the explosive growth of the mode in the interlocking process, which is different from that of antisymmetric DTM without flow.

DNA duplex, coded with A=T and G=C base pairs, is well suited for biological information storage. The interactions between two bases in a base pair contribute to the stability of DNA duplex, and are further related to gene replication and transcription. In this study, we use all-atom Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Umbrella sampling (US) method to determine the free energy profiles and explore the molecular details for base pair dissociations. Four groups of DNA duplexes with different sequences have been constructed and a total of 4.3 mu s MD simulations have been carried out. In the potential of mean force (PMF) profile for G equivalent to C base pair dissociation (denoted as PMF-PGC), we observed three peaks, which correspond to the three moments G equivalent to C base pair loses its three hydrogen bonds respectively. Differently, A=T base pair loses its two hydrogen bonds within a very short time. As a result, only one hydrogen bond rupture peak was observed in its PMF curve (denoted as PMF-PAT). Compared with PMF-PAT, the overall free energy barrier in PMF-PGC is higher, which is due to the better stability of G equivalent to C than A=T. In the latter sections of both PMFs, free energies are still increasing, which is mainly resulted from the rigidity of DNA duplex backbone. We have also investigated the impact of neighboring base pairs on the stability of middle one. It is found that neighboring G equivalent to C base pairs increase the stability of A=T base pair while neighboring C equivalent to G base pairs reduce the stability of A=T base pair. Additionally, neighboring T=A base pairs have little influence on the stability of A=T base pair.

Based on regular Torus topology, NovaCube is constructed by adding a number of most beneficial jump-over links, which offers many distinct advantages and practical benefits. Moreover, in order to enable NovaCube to achieve its maximum theoretical performance, a probabilistic oblivious routing algorithm PORA is carefully designed. PORA is a both deadlock and livelock free routing algorithm, which achieves near-optimal performance in terms of average routing path length with better load balancing thus leading to higher throughput. Theoretical derivation and mathematical analysis together with extensive simulations further prove the good performance of NovaCube and PORA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study we evaluated 20 synthesized phenanthrene analogs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Compounds 10, 11 and 17 were found to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) with IC50 values of 37.26 mu M, 5.05 mu M and 20.31 mu M, respectively. Compound 11 decreased LPS-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), inhibited phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and serine/threonine kinase Akt. It also suppressed the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha (I kappa B alpha).

This structure can avoid the stability problem caused by laser frequency drift. In addition, we used an optical comb technique to suppress the distortion of pump pulse. Moreover, the feasibility of an optical pulse coding technology in this system was studied. In particular, we explored the influence of coding parameters on the transient gain saturation of the coded pulse. Results show that the coded pulse space and coding length must be optimized to suppress its transient gain saturation, by which the sensing with lower decoding error can be achieved.

Based on this new approach, the general formula of the two-frequency mutual coherence function (MCF) of ultra-short pulses in oceanic turbulence is derived. Using a temporal moments approach and combining with this new formula for the MCF, the analytical expression for the pulse width is deduced. Besides, the quantity of Rytov variance sigma(2)(R) in oceanic turbulence is obtained, which is widely used as a measure of the strength of turbulence. In particular, the on-axis relative pulse broadening and turbulent effective coefficient of ultra-short pulses (i.e., femtosecond-picosecond regime) propagating through oceanic turbulence are investigated.

However, its global transcriptomic response remains largely unrevealed. In this study, M. smegmatis MC2 155 cultivated in androstenedione, cholesterol and glycerol supplemented media were collected separately for a RNA-Sequencing study. The results showed that 6004, 6681 and 6348 genes were expressed in androstenedione, cholesterol and glycerol supplemented media, and 5891 genes were expressed in all three conditions, with 237 specially expressed in cholesterol added medium. A total of 1852 and 454 genes were significantly up-regulated by cholesterol compared with the other two supplements. Only occasional changes were observed in basic carbon and nitrogen metabolism, while almost all of the genes involved in cholesterol catabolism and mammalian cell entry (MCE) were up-regulated by cholesterol, but not by androstenedione. Eleven and 16 gene clusters were induced by cholesterol when compared with glycerol or androstenedione, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the cholesterol responsive transcriptome of M. smegmatis. Our results indicated that cholesterol induced many more genes and increased the expression of the majority of genes involved in cholesterol degradation and MCE in M. smegmatis, while androstenedione did not have the same effect.

In this paper, crowd simulation is considered from two aspects: intra-group simulation and inter-group simulation. We propose a unified framework for crowd simulation in real-time virtual environment. Based on this framework, for intra-group simulation, we propose a novel density-based information crowd simulation to collision-free. For inter-group simulation, we propose a novel discrete choice (DC) model to realistic simulation of crowds and path planning. Meanwhile, we also propose a variable bounding box method for intra-group/inter-groups intersection problem. The simulation results show that the developed framework allows different group structures to be easily modeled. And the proposed framework could be used for real-time navigation of many moving crowd in complicated virtual environments.

Yulei1 suspension culture system for enhanced production of the main secondary metabolite, chlorogenic acid. Methods: The callus of L. macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. "Yulei1" was suspension cultured in B5 liquid medium supplemented with different plant growth regulators. Biomass accumulation was calculated by weight method and chlorogenic acid production was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC was carried out on C18 analytical column at 35 degrees C and the detection wavelength was set at 324 nm. Results: The results showed that maximum accumulation of biomass and chlorogenic acid were achieved 15 days after culture growth. The optimized conditions for biomass accumulation and chlorogenic acid production were 50 g/L of inoculum on fresh weight basis, B5 medium supplemented with plant growth regulators, 30 - 40 g/L sucrose and initial medium pH of 5.5. Maximum accumulation of chlorogenic acid and biomass were observed when the culture medium was supplemented with 2.0 mg/L6-BA. Optimal accumulation of chlorogenic acid was observed using combination of hormones 2.0 mg/L 6-Benzyladenine (BA) + 0.5 mg/L2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), while optimal accumulation of biomass was observed with 2.0 mg/L 6-BA + 2.0 mg/L2, 4-D. In addition, phenylalanine also contributed to the synthesis of chlorogenic acid at a concentration > 50 mg/L. Conclusion: Cell suspension cultures of L. macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. "Yulei1" have successfully been established. The findings provide a potential basis for large scale production of chlorogenic acid using cell suspension cultures of L. macranthoides.

We first put forward a protocol for implementing four-party bidirectional states sharing (BQSS) by using eight-qubit cluster state as quantum channel. In order to extend BQSS, we generalize this protocol from four sharers to multi-sharers utilizing two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as channel, and propose two multi-party BQSS schemes. On the other hand, we generalize the three schemes from two senders to multi-senders with multi GHZ-type states of multi-qubit as quantum channel, and give a multidirectional quantum states sharing protocol. In our schemes, all receivers can reconstruct the original unknown single-qubit state if and only if all sharers can cooperate. Only Pauli operations, Bell-state measurement and single-qubit measurement are used in our schemes, so these schemes are easily realized in physical experiment and their successful probabilities are all one.

The radial distribution function, dielectric constant, polarizability, dielectric relaxation time, hydrogen bonding and diffusion coefficient were investigated. Significant alteration in the static electric field has effect on the tetrahedral structure of water; the interaction between microwave and water depends on the hydrogen bonding. The 3 x 10(7) V/m is threshold intensity, as the intensity of the static electric field increases the decline of the dielectric constant becomes more pronounced, and the polarizability obviously increased with the increase of microwave field. And the life of hydrogen bonding is oscillatory under the high static electric field strength. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FM, NM, I and SF represent the ferromagnetic metal, nonmagnetic metal, insulator and spin-filter barrier, respectively. Our results show that due to the spin filtering effect in SF potential barriers, the FM/I/SF/NM can obtain relatively stabilized TMR in higher bias region when it has higher potential height and thicker SF barrier. And, for obtaining large TMR, the total thickness of the barrier region would be carefully selected as the influence of the supplementary I layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tunable optomechanically induced transparency in double quadratically coupled optomechanical cavities within a common reservoir	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; QUANTUM GROUND-STATE; SLOW LIGHT; OSCILLATOR	We consider the optomechanically induced transparency in the double quadratically coupled optomechanical cavities within a common reservoir, in which the two cavities are driven by the coupling fields. It is shown that the probe transparency is improved by increasing the coupling field (the left coupling field) applied on the probing cavity, but the transparency position (the probe frequency of the maximal transparency) is shifted to high frequency. The coupling field (the right coupling field) applied on the other quadratically coupled cavity can lead to a low-frequency shift for the transparency position, which can be used to fix the transparency position by adjusting the right coupling field. We get the quantitative findings that the transparency position is exactly determined by the intensity difference between the two coupling fields. On the other hand, it is found that when the two coupled optomechanical cavities interact with their common reservoir, the cross decay induced by the common reservoir can improve the probe transparency and widen the transparency window. Finally, the effects of the environment's temperature on the transparency are investigated. This will be useful in cooling the membrane, squeezing and entangling the output fields.	[Bai, C.; Hou, B.

Effects of the Land Use Change on Ecosystem Service Value in Chengdu, Western China from 1978 to 2010	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Ecosystem service value (ESV); Land use changes; Sensitivity of ESV; Variable ratio function of ESV; Flows of ESV; Remote sensing (RS)	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPES; GROWTH; SINKS	Analysis of the ecosystem service value (ESV) associated with the observed land use changes is critically important for environmental assessment and sustainable urban development. This research evaluate the effects of land use on ESV in Chengdu based on remotely sensed data and GIS, assessment model, transfer and flows model, sensitivity and variable ratio function. The results show that the ESV is mainly composed of forest land and cultivated land. ESV substantially and continuously decreased by 92 x 10(8) Chinese Yuan (CNY) or about 45 % in Chengdu during the study period and ESV from urban areas in the city center and its surroundings were much lower than those from the natural landscape in the northern and western Longmenshan mountainous region. Land use changes were the major causes of the observed transfer and flows in ESV. The flows of ESV both positive and negative were associated with observed land use changes, but overall land use changes had a negative impact on ESV. The results further indicate that the coefficient change relative to the ESV was inelastic, and the relative sensitivity index was as follows: forest land > cultivated land > water areas, but changes in water area had the largest influence and amplification effect on the ESV. This research offers important insights for use in planning fast urbanizing regions and can assist to achieve more sustainable land use and policy making.

Jatropha seed cake (JSC) was one by-product generated after the biodiesel industry. The solid-state fermentation (SSF) of the zxy-12 strain was exploited for the detoxification of JSC as a growth substrate. The zxy-12 strain showed a high degradation efficiency of phorbol esters (PEs) or derivatives and curcin. The SSF parameters were optimized for the maximum degradation of PEs or derivatives. The quantitative analysis of PEs or derivatives was established by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. PEs or derivatives in JSC were well separated to seven individual peaks, that was similar to the HPLC chart of Jatropha curcas fractions (JCF). Under the optimized conditions, the maximum removal of PEs or derivatives was obtained at the ratio of 92.78% (w w(-1)) as the main toxicant in JSC. In fermented JSC, the crude fat was significantly reduced by 5.53%. Crude proteins and small peptides were greatly increased by 15.11% and 19.61%, respectively, and exceeded soybean meal by 6.2% and 9.93%, respectively. The amino acid composition also significantly increased. Our results suggested that SSF by the zxy-12 strain was a viable detoxification approach to utilize the huge amount of JSC.

The simulated dielectric constant results from the fluctuation method (693) and electric field method (70.12) are in quantitative agreement with the experiment result (64.5). The radial distribution function and coordination structure of Li+ and OH- ions of LiOH aqueous solution change significantly with the intensity of the external E/M fields in the range of 0 and 3 x 10(9) V/m. At the high E/M fields (3 x 10(9) V/m), the interactions of the Li+ and OH- ions with water in first hydration shell are weakening due to the acceleration rotational effect of ions driven by the external E/M fields. The rearrangement and interactions of water molecules around Li+ and OH- ions in hydration shell may be affected by the external E/M fields applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The upstream and downstream carriers consist of a set of wavelength division multiplexed chaotic signals, and each wavelength takes on several bidirectional optical line terminal (OLT)-optical network unit (ONU) transmissions in virtue of the subcarrier modulation multiplexing technology. The numerical results demonstrate that with proper selection of the wavelength spacing, high-quality chaos synchronization can be achieved on each wavelength, and each wavelength can afford several OLT-ONU transmissions by properly allocating the frequency spacing of subcarriers. The proposed scheme can improve the bandwidth utilization efficiency and obviously enhance the information security at the physical layer of the WDM-PON.

In 4S auto maintenance shop, it may appear temporary bottlenecks except for the long-term bottlenecks, and they form multi-constraint machines jointly with the task size reaching the peak. Through scheduling the constraint machines effectively, it can improve overall performance of the system to satisfy the customers' requirements. First, we describe and construct a model for the scheduling problem which can be designed as the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with multi-constraint machines for the goal of minimizing customers' waiting time. Then, putting an emphasis on the constraint machines, we apply the theory of constraint to decompose and simplify the complex system and also construct the coordination mechanism between constraint machines and non-constraint machines. After that, an improved constraint-guided heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the constraint machine scheduling problem, while different dispatching rules are selected for solving the non-constraint machine scheduling according to the location of the non-bottleneck in the system. What is more, we design the rescheduling rules combing characteristics of the problem to realize dynamic scheduling with multi-constraint machines. Finally, 4S auto maintenance shop scheduling with high workload during the rush hour (on the eve of the holiday) served as the actual cases, and the proposed algorithm is compared with three different dispatching rules under various size of problems. The result obtained from the computational study has shown that the proposed algorithm is much better.

Three schemes are presented. Our schemes employ the maximal slice states as quantum channel, which consists of the tripartite entangled state from the first party(Alice), the second party(Bob), the third party(Cliff). The supervisor(Cliff) can supervises and controls the channel between Alice and Bob via measurement. Through carrying out local von Neumann measurement, controlled-NOT operation and positive operator-valued measure(POVM), and introducing an auxiliary particle, we can obtain the success probability of dense coding. It is shown that the success probability of information transmitted from Alice to Bob is usually less than one. The average amount of information for each scheme is calculated in detail. These results offer deeper insight into quantum dense coding via quantum channels of partially entangled states.

The novel SACDCR is formed by one superconducting air-core solenoidal inductor unit and one series-connected superconducting noninductive solenoidal resistor unit. The air gaps between the terminal layers of the superconducting air-core solenoid are optimized to achieve a higher critical current based on anisotropic traits and magnetic field distributions. The superconducting noninductive solenoid, which is inserted into the inner center of the superconducting air-core solenoid, experiences an increased background field under the fault condition and thus achieves better fault current limiting features compared with the same type of superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) without a background field.

In this study, Brassica juncea and Vicia faba were subjected to varying doses of Cs for 21 days to investigate the differences in bio-accumulations, subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cs in two cultivars by differential centrifugation, and extraction of Cs in different chemical forms, respectively. The results showed that 49.87%-61.08% of the Cs were in the leaf of B. juncea, while in V. faba,1.58%-79.29% of the Cs was in the root. The translocation factor (TF) arrived 2.79 to 3.71 in B. juncea, while it only reached 0.26 to 0.62 in V faba. Cs subcellular distribution of the two plants was in sequence as follows: soluble fraction > cell wall >> organelles. Cs was more easily distributed to metal-sensitive fractions of V. faba. The inorganic Cs (F-ethanol), and water-soluble Cs (F-dH(2)O) are the main existing types of Cs in the two plants. In B. juncea, the relative content of inorganic Cs, and organic acids/CsH2PO4 (F-dH(2)O) were higher than that of V faba in the stem. This suggests that Cs may induce related transporter gene expression (such as phosphate transporter, organic cation, high affinity nitrate transporter, amino acid permease, etc.) to help the transport of Cs between root to shoot.

Such analyses are pointing to the existence of many cryptic species, especially in poorly understood groups such as the genus Limnonectes, and the L. kuhlii species complex in particular. To understand the Limnonectes frogs of China, we reconstruct the major matrilineal genealogy of Limnonectes from China and Southeast Asia based on 12S rRNA, tRNA(Val) and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Based on new data we recognize five species of Limnonectes in China including L. bannaensis, L. fujianensis, L. fragilis, L. taylori ( new record), and a new species from southern China and Myanmar. Phylogenetically, the new species is more closely related to the clade comprising L. taylori, L. megastomias, L. isanensis, L. nguyenorum, and L. jarujini from Thailand than to other Chinese species. This study supports previous findings of sympatric members of a species complex that are not each other's closest relatives.

Its scientific construction originally depends on the region-change law. At present, only region-change non-monotonicity/monotonicity is mined in the quantitative/qualitative model. The in-depth region-change truth and its GrC mechanism have significance, especially for follow-up attribute reduction. This paper commences probing region-change essence, mainly from a novel uncertainty/certainty viewpoint. Concretely, we make comparative region-change analyses based on GrC, by resorting to the qualitative Pawlak-Model and quantitative DTRS-Model (the decision-theoretic rough set model). (1) Knowledge-coarsening is investigated to describe attribute deletion. (2) Granule-merging and its region-distribution are studied to probe region-change functions. (3) Region-change is analyzed in Pawlak-Model to mine qualitative region-change certainty and its relevant properties. (4) Region-change is analyzed in DTRS-Model to mine quantitative region-change uncertainty and its relevant properties. (5) Comparative region-change analyses are summarized, and further experiment verification is provided. Knowledge-coarsening and granule-merging establish GrC mechanisms for extensive region-change analyses. Quantitative/qualitative region-change uncertainty/certainty and relevant principles are discovered via DTRS-Model/Pawlak-Model. By virtue of the GrC technology and comparative strategy, this study reveals region-change uncertainty/certainty to deepen region-change non-monotonicity/monotonicity; furthermore, it underlies attribute reduction, especially with regard to quantitative models.

The system behaviour is described according to the Cole-Cole and two Debye-type relaxation functions whose evolution with composition is analysed. Combining the Cole-Cole and two Debye-type relaxation functions, the results of the dielectric properties of aqueous LiCl solution are presented and discussed. The maximum number of water molecules perturbed by ions in the hydration shell decays with its concentration. Using the extended Froehlich theory, it is concluded that the water structure is perturbed by ions beyond the first hydration shell in LiCl aqueous solution system.

We reveal the single nature of urea- water cooperative interaction and draw a profile of the overview that urea- water cooperative interaction plays a dominating role in the aqueous urea solution system using Cole- Cole analysis. The self- diffusion coefficient is related to the concentration of the urea aqueous solution. The decay of the effective number of water molecules bound to the urea molecules with its concentration and the urea perturb the water structure beyond the first hydration shell, which is confirmed in the aqueous urea solution system. And the relation between tau and a may be utilised widely to measure the urea concentration for a microwave biosensor technique.

We used scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to study the floral development of Urophysa rockii Ulbrich, a recently rediscovered species in this genus. The sepals are initiated spirally, whereas other organs are nonsimultaneously whorled; the floral phyllotaxis is whorled. Primordia of the sepals are lunular and truncate, but those of the petals and stamens are hemispherical and rounded. After sepal initiation, there is a delay in development, but the initiation of petals and stamens is continuous. The developmental sequence of the microspores in the stamens is centrifugal, although the stamens are initiated centripetally. The early developmental stages of the staminodes are similar to those of the stamens, although much smaller, so they may be phylogenetically homologous organs. The carpel primordia are lunular in shape and plicate. The mature ovule is anatropous and bitegmic. Urophysa shows similar floral development features as Aquilegia and Semiaquilegia, although with some differences, which supports the relationship inferred by DNA sequence data.

The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products have been calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d, p) level, dichloroethane (DCE) is used as a solvent and the LanL2DZ basis has been used for In atom. Transition states have been confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC). In addition, nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analyze orbital interactions and bond natures. The results showed that the activation energies of rate-determining steps in which N-methylindole reacted with keto ester to form 1,2-adduct and 1,4-adduct were 25.62 and 12.52 kcal/mol catalyzed by InF3 while those were 26.87 and 13.95 kcal/mol when the reaction was catalyzed by InBr3 under the same conditions. Comparing the results of our research, InF3 can effectively catalyze the reaction, and the 1,4-adduct was more likely to be produced. The final result of our theory study agreed with the experimental data, meanwhile, self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) was carried out using the polarized continuum model (PCM) at the same theoretical level for geometry optimizations and frequency calculations in five different salvations. We predicted that the productivity to form 1,4-adduct was more higher catalyzed by InF3 in the solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Effect of exchange coupling on magnetic property in Sm-Co/alpha-Fe layered system	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						hysteresis loops; exchange coupling; micromagnetics; hard/soft bilayers	ENERGY PRODUCT; PERMANENT-MAGNETS; FILMS	The hysteresis loops as well as the spin distributions of Sm-Co/alpha-Fe bilayers have been investigated by both three-dimensional (3D) and one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic calculations, focusing on the effect of the interface exchange coupling under various soft layer thicknesses t(s). The exchange coupling coefficient A(hs) between the hard and soft layers varies from 1.8 x 10(-6) erg/cm to 0.45 x 10(-6) erg/cm, while the soft layer thickness increases from 2 nm to 10 nm. As the exchange coupling decreases, the squareness of the loop gradually deteriorates, both pinning and coercive fields rise up monotonically, and the nucleation field goes down. On the other hand, an increment of the soft layer thickness leads to a significant drop of the nucleation field, the deterioration of the hysteresis loop squareness, and an increase of the remanence. The simulated loops based on the 3D and 1D methods are consistent with each other and in good agreement with the measured loops for Sm-Co/alpha-Fe multilayers.	[Sang, C. X.; Zhao, G. P.; Wan, X.

The obtained equilibrium structures are in excellent agreement with other experimental and theoretical results. The calculated formation energy indicates that the nitrides are thermodynamically metastable but mechanically stable at zero pressure. The calculated B/G ratio indicated RhN2 possesses a ductile nature at 0 GPa, while RuN2, OsN2, and IrN2 are prone to brittleness under pressures of around 20.8, 20.0, and 4.3 GPa, respectively. Then, we calculated the partial and total densities of states. The results show that these four noble-metal nitrides are metallic and the order of metallicity from high to low is: RhN2 > IrN2 > RuN2 > OsN2. Through the charge-density distributions, we find that strong covalency is present in the interstitial dinitrogen units for the four orthorhombic compounds. The calculated hardness of orthorhombic RuN2, RhN2, OsN2, and IrN2 are 13.66, 11.54, 16.33, and 17.92 GPa, respectively. Through the quasiharmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of these four compounds. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Three analogues exhibit a hexagonal columnar (Col(h)) mesophase and their thermal stability increases with the introduction of hydroxyl and methoxy groups. The drift mobility measurements of Trx(OC8)3 and Trx(OH)3(OC8)3 reveal that the drift mobility is on the order of 5 x 10(-2)cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) in the Colh phase and it increases to 10(-1)cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) at the Colh-metastable phase transition, although Trx(OMe)3(OC8)3 shows a drift mobility of 1 x 10(-2)cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) in the Colh phase with temperature dependence. These results indicate that truxene with three alkoxy chains is an interesting molecular core for mesophase semiconductors.

Tunneling interstitial impurity in iron-chalcogenide-based superconductors	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							FE-EXCESS; STATES	A pronounced local in-gap zero-energy bound state (ZBS) has been observed by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on the interstitial Fe impurity (IFI) and its nearest-neighboring sites in an FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconducting (SC) compound. By introducing an impurity mechanism, the so-called tunneling impurity, and based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we investigate the low-lying energy states of the IFI and the underlying Fe plane. The calculations are performed in the presence as well as in the absence of a magnetic field. We find the IFI-induced ZBS does not shift or split in a magnetic field as long as the tunneling parameter between the IFI and the Fe plane is sufficiently small and the Fe plane is deep in the SC state. Our results are in good agreement with experiments. We also show that in the underdoped cases, modulation of the spin density wave or charge density wave will suppress the intensity of the ZBS on the Fe plane in a vortex state.

Lattice constants and electronic band structures are in an excellent agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical values. TaN in both structures studied has a metallic nature and a strong hybridization of Ta 5d and N 2p are found from the spin density of states (DOS). Meanwhile, our LSDA+U calculations predicted a strong ferromagnetic state for CoSn-type structure and an obvious paramagnetic nature for WC-type structure. No phase transition are observed within cubic and hexagonal CoSn and WC structures under high pressures. Our results show WC-type TaN is the calculated ground-state structure among the three crystallographic structures studied under 120 GPa. Optical properties show that TaN in CoSn-type structure is a better dielectric material.

The artificial soil properties are very important for effective management of the slopes. This paper uses fractal and moment methods to characterize soil particle size distribution (PSD) and aggregates composition. The fractal dimension (D) showed linear relationships between clay, silt, and sand contents, with coefficients of determination from 0.843 to 0.875, suggesting that using of D to evaluate the PSD of artificial soils is reasonable. The bias (C-S) and peak convex (C-E) coefficients showed significant correlations with structure failure rate, moisture content, and total porosity, which validated the moment method to quantitatively describe soil structure. Railway slope (RS) soil has lower organic carbon and soil moisture, and higher pH than natural slope soil. Overall, RS exhibited poor soil structure and physicochemical properties, increasing the risk of soil erosion. Hence, more effective management measures should be adopted to promote the restoration of cut slopes.

These 3D flower-like architectures with diameter of about 6-8 mu m are composed of a large number of nanoplates, which are assembled in a radial form from the center to the surface. In addition, the morphology of the products can be easily controlled by the elaborate choice of the dosage of La3+ and organic ligand. Furthermore, these 3D flower-like architectures exhibit obvious and intense UV absorption, which can be used as a new efficient host lattice of luminescent materials.

A field litter decomposition experiment was conducted during the winter in an alpine forest river on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Concentrations, release rates, and release rate per day of chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were investigated in the foliar litter of willow (Salix paraplesia), azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), cypress (Sabina saltuaria), and larch (Larix mastersiana) during the prefreezing, freezing, and thawing periods. Concentrations of Cr in willow, cypress, and larch; Cd in all foliar litter types; and Pb in azalea foliar litter increased following incubation over an entire winter. Both Cr and Pb showed patterns of accumulation during the prefreezing period and patterns of release in the freezing and thawing periods, but Cd showed accumulation in all three periods. Water temperature, pH, flow velocity, conductivity, and nutrient availability in the river were significantly related to the dynamics of these heavy metals in the decomposing foliar litter. The heavy metal accumulation pattern in running water suggested an absolute increase in metal mass, indicating that litter may act as an efficient metal "cleaner" and contribute to an ecosystem's capacity for self-purification.

We found that TSBCS/BS can be mapped to a "fat" combined input-crosspoint queued (CICQ) switch. Consequently, the well-studied CICQ scheduling algorithms can be directly applied in TSBCS. Moreover, BS drastically reduces the time complexity of TSBCS scheduling when compared with ordinary CICQ switches of the same number of switch ports, which enables us to build a larger-capacity switch with reasonable scheduling complexity. We further show that TSBCS/BS can achieve 100 percent throughput under any admissible traffic if a stable CICQ scheduling algorithm is used. Direct cell forwarding schemes are proposed to overcome the performance drawback of BS under light traffic loads. With extensive simulations, we show that the performance of TSBCS/BS is comparable to that of output-queued switches and the latter are usually considered as theoretical optimal.

The results showed that the both the Trp-Sm(III) complex and the AO molecule could intercalate into the double helix of the DNA. The Sm(III)-(Trp)(3) complex was stabilized by intercalation into the DNA with binding constants: K-25 degrees C(circle minus)=7.14x10(5) L.mol(-1) and K-37 degrees C(circle minus) = 5.28x10(4) L.mol(-1), and it could displace the AO dye from the AO-DNA complex in a competitive reaction. Computation of the thermodynamic functions demonstrates that Delta H-r(m)circle minus is the primary driving power of the interaction between the Sm(III)(Trp)(3) complex and the DNA.

The rhombohedral and tetragonal phases co-exist in the ceramics with x = 0-0.036 and the concentration of Er3+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure. The partial substitution of Er3+ for Bi3+ improves the piezoelectricity of the ceramic. The ceramics with x = 0-0.02 possess strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 26.7-29.6 mu C/cm(2)) and good piezoelectric properties (d(33) = 146-181 pC/N, k(p)= 21.2-34.1%, respectively). After the addition of Er3+, the ceramics exhibit the characteristic up/down-conversion emission of Er3+ ions. The ceramic with x = 0.032 possesses the strongest emissions at approximately 535 nm and 549 nm, which are attributed to H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) and S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions, respectively. The ceramics with low Er2O3 levels exhibit simultaneously strong piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity and photoluminescence and thus may have a potential application in multifunctional devices.

Herein we report the synthesis of Ru nanoparticles supported on nanodiamond by a one-step approach through the reduction of RuCl3 using AB as reducing agent. The nanocomposites surfaces with large quantity of oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups resulted in a homogeneous suspension in aqueous phase. The catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond was studied for hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis at 25 degrees C. Results indicated that nanodiamond supported Ru nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 3.7 nm exhibited high catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis, with a turnover frequency number of 229 mol H-2 center dot(mol Ru center dot min)(-1). The high catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond demonstrates that nano diamond is a good media for nanoparticles immobilization. Copyright (c) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this QSS scheme, each agent can obtain a shadow of the secret key by performing single-particle measurements.

Based on the Wigner distribution function, the analytical expressions for the skewness parameter A and the kurtosis parameter K of PCDA beams are derived. The analytical expression for the oceanic turbulence parameter T' related to K is also derived, and characteristics of T' are examined. It is found that the behaviors of A and K in oceanic turbulence are quite different from those in free space. In free space, the mass of the intensity distribution may move from one side of the centroid position axis y(c) to another side at a certain propagation distance z(0), and z(0) is independent of the correlation parameter tau. The mass of the intensity distribution is concentrated on one side of y(c) on propagation only for a poorly coherent beam in free space, but it is always this situation for different value of tau when oceanic turbulence is not weak. In free space, it takes a leptokurtic profile in the far field, and a Gaussian profile appears only for a poorly coherent beam. However, in oceanic turbulence it always reaches a Gaussian profile for different value of r in the far field. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The energy gaps and the conductance for ASiNRs can be effectively modulated by effective spin-orbit coupling lambda(SO) and the potential energy V-0. With increasing lambda(SO), the energy gap for 6-ASiNR and 7-ASiNR decreases, while it remains zero for metallic 8-ASiNR. Interestingly, an energy gap appears for 8-ASiNR in presence of V-0, which results in the appearance of a conductance gap for 8-ASiNR system. Additionally, the dependence of conductance on Anderson disorder strength has been studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lam.] is one of the top six most important crops in the world in terms of production. It has the capacity to tolerate marginal growing conditions better than most other crops. In this study, a proline-and glycine-rich protein encoding gene, IbPGAHRP1, was isolated and characterized from the transcriptome of sweet potato cultivar Xushu 18. Sequence analyses showed that proline, glycine, alanine, and histidine account for 62.6% of the total amino acid residues. Two proline-rich tandem repeats, an alanine-rich repeat, a histidine-rich tandem repeat, and five XYPP motifs were present in IbPGAHRP1. Sequence similarity analysis showed that IbPGAHRP1 shared 41% similarity with GmGPRP4, indicating that IbPGAHRP1 should be a GPRP-like protein and play an important role in stress resistance. RT-PCR results showed that IbPGAHRP1 was specifically expressed in the sweet potato flower. In vivo expression of IbPGAHRP1 demonstrated that it enhanced the cold and drought resistance in the yeast recombinant, but could not trigger the same changes in Escherichia coli. This study revealed that IbPGAHRP1 is a flower-specific gene and should play an important role in response to abiotic stresses.

There is an additive isomorphism between the Chen-Ruan cohomologies phi : H*(CR)(X-s) -+ H*(CR)(X-sf). We study the three-point orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of the exceptional curves Gamma(s) on X-s and F-sf on X-sf and show that the corresponding Ruan cohomology ring structures on the Chen-Ruan cohomologies of X-s and X-sf, defined by these three-point functions, are isomorphic to each other under the map phi and the identification [Gamma(S)] <-> - [Gamma(sf)].

The unique 3D network structures of the aerogels enable a remarkable reduction in their thermal conductivities. It is shown that the CNT-Ag nanocomposite aerogels (CNTANAs) possess low thermal conductivities of only 0.06 to 0.095 W m(-1) k(-1) with various Ag contents at room temperature; these values are much lower than those of other reported CNT and Ag composites with non-porous structures. Moreover, the electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients of the CNTANAs can be simultaneously enhanced by increasing the Ag content in the unique structure; this overcomes a drawback of bulk semiconductors wherein increasing electrical conductivity is generally accompanied by a reduced Seebeck coefficient and enhances the thermal conductivity. As a result, this strategy results in a maximum ZT value of 0.011. This ZT value is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon aerogel and 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the silver/polymer composites and CNT/polymer composites. At the same time, the fragile solid skeleton and highly opencell foam structure of the CNTANAs lead to low apparent density (similar to 130 kg m(-3)). In this study, our study offers a new preparation method for TE materials, which will broaden the development of this facile and novel category of lightweight TE material.

Complexes 1-4 crystallized in the triclinic space group C2/c, P2(1)/n, P-1 and C2/c, respectively. In 1 and 4, Ag+ is four-coordinate with L-1 or L-4 to form 1-D {[Ag(L-1/L-4)(2)](+)} polymeric cations. In 2, Ag+ is three-coordinate by two L-2 ligands and one NO3- ligand to form a 1-D {[Ag(L-2)(NO3)]} zigzag chain. In 3, Ag+ is four-coordinate by L-3 to form a dinuclear [Ag(L-3)(3)](+) cation. The NO3- is a 4-connector bridging group in 1 and 3 and a 5-connector bridging group in 2 and 4. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds and AgO weak interactions play important roles in forming 3-D networks of 1-4. The antibacterial activities for 1-4 were evaluated against Bacillussubtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with MTT method. The antibacterial results indicated that 2 showed the best inhibitory activity against the test bacterial strains, and was as potent as chloramphenicol. [GRAPHICS] .

The beam spreading of truncated laser beams is less affected by thermal blooming than that of untruncated ones. There exists the oscillatory behavior of beam width versus the truncated parameter due to thermal blooming. When there exists the cross wind, under steady-state thermal blooming, the astigmatism of truncated laser beams is better than that of untruncated ones, and the centriod position is furthest away from the propagation axis for a certain value of the truncated parameter.

This material displays excellent thermo-and water-induced shape memory behavior with a recovery ratio of nearly 99%. These UPys are dimerized as DDAA arrays, which present good stability in both water and alkaline solutions (pH 12), or at temperatures below 120 degrees C. UPy dimers act as a fixed phase to hold the material's permanent shape, whereas the PVA chains act as a reversible phase to control the temporary shape. This physical cross-linking, formed by UPy dimerization, can potentially replace traditional chemical cross-linking with covalent bonds, thereby providing a more simple and practical strategy to obtain multi-responsive shape memory polymers.

We perform simulations of the Au-SiC-Au junction breaking process by calculating the conductance in four different anchoring geometries and obtain the equilibrium conductance and the projected density of states of junctions in the optimal position. The hollow-hollow configuration is found to be the most stable contact geometry with the largest conductance. From the calculation of restoring force and the spatial electron density differences after the structural break, we conclude that the Si-C bond is more stable than Au-C and Au-Si bonds in the single-molecular molecular junction. Moreover, the behavior of the junction currents is revealed under small bias. All junctions exhibit a linear current-voltage relationship, indicating characteristic metallic behavior at low bias voltage. The asymmetry of the I-V curves reflects the asymmetry of the molecule and the contact geometry. The origin of the transport spectrum of the junctions is discussed with the molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian (MPSH) states. The calculated results prove that the coupling morphology of the SiC molecule connected with electrodes, the distance and the external bias voltage have a great effect on the conductance of nanoscale junctions.

Applying the Fisher score to identify Alzheimer's disease-related genes	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Fisher score; Feature selection; Gene microarray	CANCER CLASSIFICATION; MICROARRAY; EXPRESSION	Biologists and scientists can use the data from Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene expression microarrays to mine AD disease-related genes. Because of disadvantages such as small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and a high level of noise, it is difficult to obtain accurate and meaningful biological information from gene expression profiles. In this paper, we present a novel approach for utilizing AD microarray data to identify the morbigenous genes. The Fisher score, a classical feature selection method, is utilized to evaluate the importance of each gene. Genes with a large between-classes variance and small within-class variance are selected as candidate morbigenous genes. The results using an AD dataset show that the proposed approach is effective for gene selection. Satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by using only a small number of selected genes.

The rationality of the transition state can be proved by vibration frequency analysis and IRC computations. Moreover, atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory and natural bond orbital (NBO) theory were applied for discussing the interaction among orbitals and the bonding characteristics. The calculating results indicate that Pt-6 clusters are favored for catalyzing the activation and hydrogenation of the C=O bond in cinnamaldehyde molecules, eventually producing cinnamyl alcohol, which proved that Pt-6 clusters have a strong reaction selectivity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Compared with Co-doped Pt clusters, Pt-6 clusters are more likely to catalyze the activation and hydrogenation of the C=O bond. Using Co-doped Pt clusters to catalyze the selective hydrogenation reaction of cinnamaldehyde to produce cinnamyl alcohol, the activation energy is lower than that of the reaction catalyzed by pure Pt clusters. The doped catalyst has a synergetic catalytic effect. Our findings have explained the mechanism of action of the doped catalyst and the experimental phenomena.

To detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting these traits, we developed a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Gang46B (G46B) and K1075, a G46B introgression line with lower PGWC. Based on a linkage map containing 33 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, a total of 15 additive QTLs governing six measured traits were identified on 4 chromosomes across two environments. Of these, the five major QTLs which controlled GW, LWR, GT, PGWC, and TGW, each explaining up to 44.30, 55.29, 62.30, 30.94, and 28.78% of the variation, respectively, were found in the same interval of RM18004-RM18068 on chromosome 5. The G46B alleles contributed to the increase in GW, GT and PGWC at all loci, as well as the increase in TGW at its major QTL locus. Significant interactions between additive QTL and the environment were found at most loci, in which the largest, accounting for 15.06% of variation, was observed between gPGWC-5 and the environment. A total of 15 epistasis QTLs were detected for all the traits, and GL, GW and PGWC had significant epistasis QTLs based on environment interactions with minor effects. These results are valuable for future map-based cloning of the QTLs and the collaborative improvement of G46B in grain appearance quality and yield.

The crystal structure of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 has no obvious change after the coating of 2 wt% Bi2O3. Bi2O3 is homogenously coated on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles. The Bi2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 electrode presents an enhanced cycling stability, better rate performance and lower charge transfer resistance. After the coating of 2 wt% Bi2O3, the initial coulombic efficiency of the material has been improved to 76.9% compared to 72.6% for the bare Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2. After 100 cycles at 0.1C, the Bi2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 electrode retains a discharge capacity of 182.9 mA h g(-1) with capacity retention of 73.5%, which are much higher than those of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (146.9 mA h g(-1) and 58.8%). In addition, the Bi2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 electrode exhibits better rate capability with discharge capacities of 155.8, 124.8 and 89.2 mA h g(-1) at 1, 2 and 5C, respectively, superior to that of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2. The enhanced cycling stability and rate capability should be ascribed to the existence of Bi2O3 on the surface of the active material, which can efficiently restrain the side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, stabilize the structure of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 and improve the lithium ion diffusion.

The advantage of picture fuzzy set is easily reflecting the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments because the picture fuzzy sets are suitable for capturing imprecise, uncertain, and inconsistent information in the multiple attribute decision making analysis. Thus, the cross entropy of picture fuzzy sets, called picture fuzzy cross entropy, is proposed as an extension of the cross entropy of fuzzy sets. Then, a multiple attribute decision making method based on the proposed picture fuzzy cross entropy is established in which attribute values for alternatives are picture fuzzy numbers. In decision making process, we utilize the picture fuzzy weighted cross entropy between the ideal alternative and an alternative to rank the alternatives corresponding to the cross entropy values and to select the most desirable one(s). Finally, a practical example for enterprise resource planning system selection is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

Here, we reported a facile method to prepare poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composites with nano-carbon fillers including zero-dimensional superfullerene (SF), one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNT) and two-dimensional graphene sheets (GS) by simple solution blending and compression molding. The effects of these nano-carbon fillers on the thermal conductivity of PVDF composites were systematically investigated. It was found that PVDF composites exhibit a higher thermal conductivity than that of neat PVDF. Among them, the thermal conductivity of PVDF composites with 20 wt% two-dimensional GS reaches a maximum (2.06 W m(-1) K-1), which is approximately 10-fold enhancement in comparison to that of the neat PVDF. Such highly thermal conductive PVDF composites may enable some prospective applications in advanced thermal management.

To investigate the impact of beta-catenin expression on survival outcomes and clinicopathological features in sarcoma patients, a meta-analysis was conducted. Comprehensive literature searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for relevant studies. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and relative risk (RR) were calculated to assess the correlations of beta-catenin expression with survival outcomes and clinicopathological features. In total, 14 studies with 1036 sarcoma patients were identified. Beta-catenin expression was found to be significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.65-2.69/P<0.001). Further, when the analysis was stratified by histological subtype (bone sarcoma including osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma including synovial sarcoma), subcellular staining position (nuclear staining and nuclear/cytoplasmic staining), and statistical analysis (multivariate analysis and univariate analysis), the significant correlation to poor survival was also observed except in chondrosarcoma group. For clinicopathological features, beta-catenin expression was significantly associated with higher rate of metastasis (RR=1.74, 95% CI=1.35-2.25; P<0.001) and local recurrence (RR=2.84, 95% CI=1.17-6.87; P=0.021), higher tumor grade (RR=1.38, 95% CI=1.02-1.86; P=0.039) and higher stage at diagnosis (RR=1.45, 95% CI=1.14-1.85; P=0.003), but not associated with tumor site and tumor size. In conclusion, beta-catenin expression may be an effective prognostic factor of poor survival and clinicopathological features in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Future studies are needed to validate our findings.

The as-prepared absorbents were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Subsequently, the absorbents were utilized for the removal of Pr3+ and Nd3+ from aqueous solution. We systematically investigated the influences of pH values, initial concentration of metal on the adsorption capacity, as well as the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms. The obtained experimental results suggested that among these absorbents, SiO2-BT exhibited the best performances for the removal of both Pr3+ and Nd3+ in aqueous solutions. Under the optimum conditions, the adsorptive removal efficiency could reach the adsorption equilibrium just within 60min, and the adsorption capacities of Pr3+ and Nd3+ on SiO2-BT were 329.2 and 341.5mg/g, respectively. It was found that the adsorption kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model while the adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir adsorption model.

The mitogenome is 16,331 base pairs in length. The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of E. melanogaster and other 17 rodents were used for phylogenetic analyses. Tree constructed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods demonstrated that E. melanogaster as a sister to E. chinensis, was clustered in subfamily Arvicolinae. The monophyly of the genus Eothenomys was supported as well with Eothenomys sister to the genus Myodes.

They are also one of the best species for biogeographic study and understanding the environmental changes. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Apodemus draco is determined. The mitogenome is 16 220 bp in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a control region, with a base composition of 35.1% A, 29.0% T, 23.8% C and 12.1% G. The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of Apodemus draco and other 23 rodents were used for mitochondrial genome phylogenetic analyses. The monophyly of the genus Apodemus was well supported with sister to the genus Mus. Bayesian analysis also suggested that Apodemus draco was a sister to Apodemus latronum. The present study may facilitate further investigation of the molecular evolution and biogeographic study of the genus Apodemus.

Compared with the previously integrating ones, it can be seen that the two results are in agreement with each other exactly for the collimated and focused beam, respectively. Further, the influences of three main oceanic parameters (i.e., the rate of dissipation of mean-squared temperature xi., the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of seawater a and the ratio of temperature to salinity contribution to the refractive index spectrum w) and the beam radius W-0 on beam wander are investigated in the collimated and focused beam cases. The results indicate that the beam wander increases as a decreases, chi(T) increases, salinity-induced predominates and W-0 decreases in mentioned above cases. In addition, based on the dimensionless quantity Bw, the relation between beam wander and the long-term spot size or turbulence-induced beam spot size is investigated. In particular, to distinguish beam wander among different beam types, the relative beam wander is defined. Based on this definition, the increment of beam wander between focused and collimated beam is larger than that of arbitrary beam type (i.e., 0 <Theta(0)< 1). It is beneficial to select the predominant beam type in laser propagation applications (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

In this article, it is shown that if R has the property (B) that every super finitely presented module has finite Gorenstein projective dimension, then every finitely generated Gorenstein projective module is super finitely presented. As an application of the notion of super finitely presented modules, we show that if R has the property (C) that every super finitely presented module has finite projective dimension, then R is K-0-regular, i.e., K-0(R[x(1), ... , x(n)]) congruent to K-0(R) for all n >= 1.

The considered system consists of a Source-Destination (S-D) pair and a relay node (R). R adopts conditional DF relaying scheme to decide whether to aid S-D pair's information transmission or not, under which R employs the signal-to-noise ratio of S-D link as an indication of the need of the cooperation aid. The outage performance has been investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels for integer values of m, as well as the symbol error performance of multiple phase shift keying and multiple quadrature amplitude modulations. The closed-form analytical expressions for outage probability and average symbol error rate have been derived and verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation and numerical results match very well with each other, which indicates that our proposed analytical models can well predict the outage and symbol error performance of the target conditional DF relaying schemes over Nakagami-m fading channels.

In this study, the shape memory properties of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)-based nanocomposites with nano-crystalline cellulose (NCC) as fillers are investigated via recrystallization at a high temperature under a high-pressure environment. The sizes of spherulites of PCL, the degrees of crystallinity (X-c), and the melting temperature of the PCL-NCC nanocomposites were characterized by polarizing microscopy (POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results exhibit that when the mass ratio of NCC was maintained constant, both the crystal properties and melting temperatures of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing pressure. Furthermore, the shape memory fixity ratios of the recrystallized nanocomposites remained more than 90% due to the fact that the chemical cross-linking structure and the recovery ratios kept increasing with the increase in pressure. The mechanism of the improvement of the shape memory function was further analyzed, and the result demonstrates that the pressure has a significant influence on the crystal properties of PCL polymers during their recrystallization; subsequently the shape recovery ratio is improved since more molecular chains participate in the shape recovery process.

The results from ultraviolet spectroscopic method indicated that VK3 and -CD formed 1:1 inclusion complex, with the inclusion constant K-f = 1.02 x 10(4) L/mol, which is based on Benesi-Hildebrand's viewpoint. The outcomes from the probe method and Scatchard methods suggested that the interaction mode between -CD-K-3 and DNA was a mixture mode, which included intercalation and electrostatic binding effects. The binding constants were K-25 degrees C = 2.16 x 10(4) L/mol, and K-37 degrees C = 1.06 x 10(4) L/mol. The thermodynamic functions of the interaction between -CD-K-3 and DNA were H-r(m) = -2.74 x 10(4) J/mol, S-r(m) = 174.74 Jmol(-1)K(-1), therefore, both H-r(m) (enthalpy) and S-r(m) (entropy) worked as driven forces in this action.

We first discuss some general properties of g-torsion theories, and after that give some applications of them. For example, we generalize a characterization of reflexive modules over quasi-normal domains to a class of non-Noetherian domains. Among other things, a characterization of coherent domains of weak Gorenstein global dimension at most two is also given in terms of Gorenstein projectivity (or Gorenstein flatness) of injective modules relative to the g-torsion theory.

Firstly, a series of polyurethanes were successfully synthesized through solution polymerisation of polyethylene glycol (PEG, M-n = 4000 kg mol(-1)), dimethylolpropionic acid (DMPA) and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI). These polymers were named as PEG-i-MDI-DMPA (i = 20%, 30%, 40%), and i represents the weight content of PEG in the polymers. The results of shape memory testing showed that the PEG-30%-MDI-DMPA displays both the triple-shape memory effect and the pH sensitive dual-shape memory effect. In PEG-30%-MDI-DMPA, the glass transition of PEG chains and the association and disassociation of carboxylic dimers act as two switches to control the triple-shape memory effect, while the carboxylic dimer is affected by pH values to associate in acidic solutions (at pH 2) and dissociate in alkaline solutions (at pH 9) to induce the pH-sensitive shape memory. The carboxylic dimers play an important role in the construction of shape memory properties in this polyurethane.

The partial substitution of (Li0.5Dy0.5)(2+) for Ca2+ ions in CaBi4Ti4O15 leads to great multi-improvement in the ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity, luminescence and thermal stability of the materials. All the ceramics possess a bismuth-layer structure; and the crystal structure of the ceramics is transformed from four layer bismuth-layer structure to a three layer structure with x increasing. For the ceramic with x = 0.2, high resistivity (R = 3.0 x 10(11) Omega cm), good piezoelectricity (d(33) = 10.5 pC N-1), strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 9.92 mu C cm(-2)) and improved luminescence are simultaneously obtained. These enhancements in multifunctional properties are greatly attributed to the contribution of (Li0.5Dy0.5)(2+) in the ceramics. Under the excitation of 451 nm light, the (LiDy)(2+)- modified ceramics exhibit bright blue and yellow emission peaks centered at 484 nm and 574 nm, corresponding to the transition of the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) levels of Dy3+ ions, respectively. Interestingly, excellent temperature stability of the ferroelectricity/ piezoelectricity and luminescence is also observed in the ceramic with x = 0.2. These results show that Ca1-x(LiDy)(x/2)Bi4Ti4O15 multifunctional ceramics may have promising potential in high temperature multifunctional devices.

The fluorescence properties of the DNA-AgNCs are related to the modified position of the DNA. When biotin is linked to the middle thymine base of the DNA sequence, the DNA-AgNCs emit the strongest fluorescence. Moreover, the stability of the DNA-AgNCs was affected by avidin through biotin-avidin binding, quenching the fluorescence of the DNA-AgNCs. In contrast, if free biotin is further introduced into this system, the quenching is apparently weakened by competition, leading to the restoration of fluorescence. This phenomenon can be utilized for the detection of biotin. Under the optimal conditions, the fluorescence recovery is linearly proportional to the concentration of biotin in the range of 10 nM-1.0 mu M with a detection limit of 6.0 nM. This DNA-AgNCs probe with excellent fluorescent properties is sensitive and selective for the detection of biotin and has been applied for the determination of biotin in wheat flour.

Squeezing of output field in a two-mechanical-mode optomechanical system with a nonlinear medium	OPTIK			English	Article						Squeezing spectrum; Two-mechanical-mode optomechanical system; Kerr-down-conversion nonlinear crystal	QUANTUM GROUND-STATE; INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; MECHANICS; LIMITS; LIGHT	We consider the squeezing of output field in a two-mechanical-mode optomechanical cavity, which contains a Kerr-down conversion nonlinear crystal. It is found that the squeezing magnitude of the output field is enhanced by injection of the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and the Kerr medium, and the squeezing region is shifted with the Kerr parameter. When the frequencies of the two movable mirrors are set by different values, the sharp peak with high contrast due to excess noise from thermally occupied mechanical mode will be split into two parts, which are located at the frequencies of the movable mirrors. This can be applied to high precision measurement of the frequencies of the mechanical oscillators. Finally, we consider the influence of the environment temperature on the squeezing spectrum. This is helpful in generating controllable squeezing in the optomechanical system by using nonlinear media. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Li, J. H.; Hou, B.

All of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were optimized with the B3LYP method at 6-31+G(d) basis set. The single-point energy and zero-point energy correction were calculated for the optimized configuration of each compound with the sane method at 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Transition states have been confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reactions coordinate. In addition, nature bond orbital and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analyze orbital interactions and bond natures. The results showed that the activation energy of the rate-determining step in the absence of catalysts was 250.63 kJ.mol(-1), which were 74.01 and 131.68 kJ.mol(-1) via Cu2O and CuI catalyzed, respectively. Results indicated that catalyst Cu2O promotes reaction effectively. All calculations were consistent with experiments. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effects of TRiEGME on water icing behavior in aviation turbine fuel	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						icing inhibitor; icing behavior; low temperature; partition coefficient		The high vapor pressure of diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, the only approved civil aviation fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII), causes the peeling of fuel tank topcoat material. This leads to increased maintenance costs and decreased aircraft mission capabilities. Triethylene glycol monomethyl ether (TriEGME) has been proposed as a potential replacement as it has a low vapor pressure and can partition into any free water in the fuel forming a solution with a low freezing point. However, its use has not been approved by airworthiness authority because very few data are available for its impacts on water solubility and icing behavior in fuel. The effects of TriEGME on water solubility, solidification temperature, and water icing behavior in fuel were thoroughly studied. At added concentration ranging from 0.10 to 0.15 vol. % water solubility in jet fuel almost tripled compared with that without FSII. The solidification temperatures for water in fuel with FSII and for mixture of water and FSII decreased with increased FSII concentration. Moreover, partition coefficient, defined as equilibrium FSII concentration in aqueous phase divided by equilibrium FSII concentration in fuel phase, decreased with increased FSII concentration in fuel. At equilibrium condition with fixed FSII concentration in fuel, decrease in fuel temperature led to an increase in partition coefficient. An estimation of required dosage for TriEGME to prevent water icing in fuel can be achieved by comparison of TriEGME concentration in aqueous phase with its corresponding freezing temperature.

In order to maintain high antiknock performance of avgas, an advanced adsorption method was developed using 5A zeolite to remove linear and monobranched alkane from avgas for octane number enhancement. An experimental study of single, binary, and quaternary adsorption of octane isomers on a fixed bed reactor was performed in this work. The effects of partial pressure, operating temperature, and initial mixture composition on breakthrough curves and sorption selectivity were thoroughly studied. At fixed partial pressure, normal octane was the strongest-adsorbed component, followed by 2-methylheptane, 2, 5-dimethylhexane, and 2, 2, 4-trimethylpentane. Adsorption capacity of all components increased with increased partial pressure and decreased with increased operating temperature. However, for all binary mixtures studied in this work, the sorption selectivity decreased as total pressure increased. At equimolar concentrations the normal and monobranched isomers were preferentially adsorbed, while when the volume percentages of the isomers were different, the adsorption of the isomer with the higher volume ratio was favoured. The quaternary breakthrough curves for octane isomers at 473 K with each component having partial pressure of 0.15 kPa also indicated the feasibility of simultaneous removal of normal and monobranched isomers from a multiple-component mixture by this 5A zeolite.

Many gradient dependent energy functions, such as Potts model and total variation denoising, regard image as piecewise constant function. In these methods, some important information such as edge sharpness and location is well preserved, but some detailed image feature like texture is often compromised in the process of denoising. For this reason, an image denoising method based on local adaptive regularization is proposed in this paper, which can adaptively adjust denoising degree of noisy image by adding spatial variable fidelity term, so as to better preserve fine scale features of image. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising method can achieve state-of-the-art subjective visual effect, and the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) is also objectively improved by 0.3-0.6 dB.

The effects of sintering temperature (T-s) and dwell time (t(s)) on the ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and fluorescence of the ceramics were studied. Furthermore, the influence of poling electrical field on the up-conversion emission intensities was also discussed. As T-s and t(s) increase, the grains grow larger gradually and evolve from spheroid to rectangular shape. By increasing T-s and t(s), the ferroelectricity of the ceramics is improved and the remnant polarization P-r increases. The optimum sintering temperature and dwell time for the piezoelectricity of ceramics are 1200 degrees C and 2 h, respectively. Also, both of the sintering temperature and dwell time make an important influence on the fluorescence of the ceramics. The ceramics sintered at 1140-1160 degrees C for 2 h possess excellent up/down-conversion fluorescence. The up-conversion emission intensity of the ceramics is further enhanced by optimizing poling electric field. This work develops a kind of multifunctional material that simultaneously possesses good ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity and excellent up/down-conversion fluorescence by optimizing sintering temperature and dwell time.

With the theoretical calculation method is more reasonable and calculation accuracy continues to improve, Theoretical calculate advantage is more obvious in the infrared spectrum simulation and vibration modes attributable identified. And it has important reference value for experimental study of infrared spectral analysis. Using density functional theory, geometry optimizations and frequencies calculation of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were performed at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), the stable structure and all vibration modes of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were attained. The results show that the infrared absorption peak of 7-hydroxycoumarin is mainly distributed in the several regions in wave number of 3 700 similar to 3 500, 3 150 similar to 3 000, 1 750 similar to 1 400, 1 400 similar to 1 000, 1 000 similar to 50 cm(-1). In addition to the vibration in a wave number range of 3 700 similar to 3 500, 3 150 similar to 3 000 cm(-1) is relatively independent, and were attributed to OH stretching vibration and benzene ring CH stretching vibration, the other several vibration regions are more complex, the different degree of spectral peaks is composed of multiple vibration modes. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis of the vibration mode, the vibration modes of 7-Hydroxycoumarin molecule were assigned, and in order to discuss the reliability of theoretical calculation method, the correlation diagram of the main absorption peak of 7-hydroxyl group was drawn from the theoretical value of X axis and the experimental value of Y axis, the correlation between experimental IR data and calculated IR data of 7-Hydroxycoumarin was analyzed through the linear regression method. Results show that they have good correlation, correlation coefficient values "r" equals 0. 998 5, and the theory calculation of 7-Hydroxycoumarin IR by density functional theory at the base set level is reliable.

The effects of SmCoO3 on phase structure, piezoelectricity and multiferroicity of the ceramics were studied. All the ceramics can be well sintered at a low sintering temperature of 960A degrees C. The crystalline structure of the ceramics is transformed from rhombohedral to tetragonal symmetry with increasing the amount of SmCoO3. A morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at x = 0.01-0.04. A small amount of SmCoO3 is shown to improve the ferroelectric, piezoelectric and magnetoelectric properties of the ceramics. For the ceramics with x = 0.01-0.03, enhanced resistivity (R 1.2 x 10(9) Omega cm to 2.1 x 10(9) Omega cm), piezoelectricity (d (33) 65 pC/N to 106 pC/N) and ferroelectricity (P (r) 6.38 mu C/cm(2) to 22.89 mu C/cm(2)) are obtained. The ferromagnetism of the materials is greatly enhanced by the doping of SmCoO3 such that a very high magnetoelectric coefficient of 742 mV/(cm Oe) is obtained at x = 0.01, suggesting a promising potential in multiferroic devices.

In this paper, the conceptual design and performance evaluation of the SFCL for potential FRT applications are presented. To wind the three-phase noninductive bifilar pancake coils, 324-m SuperPower SF12100-type ReBCO tapes are adopted, whereas one Cryomech AL600-type Gifford-McMahon refrigerator is used to form a liquid nitrogen (LN2) circulated cooling system. Two main ac loss contributions of the hysteresis loss and the flux flow loss are calculated and discussed to achieve accurate SFCL resistance modeling. Finally, case studies with regard to a 1.5-MW DFIG-based wind turbine system are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposedSFCL-basedFRTscheme. With the designed SFCL, the fault rotor current is significantly reduced from about 4396 (4.94 p.u.) to 1406 A (1.58 p.u.) during the most severe condition. The fault grid voltage is also improved from about 89.7 (0.13 p.u.) to 103.5 V (0.15 p.u.) to comply with the international grid codes. In addition, the equivalent SFCL resistance and its corresponding ac loss contributions are discussed to evaluate the integrated performance of the designed SFCL during a grid fault.

This paper investigates the double-quantitative fusion of relative accuracy and absolute importance to provide systematic measure mining, benign integration construction, and hierarchical attribute reduction. (1) First, three-way probabilities and measures are analyzed. Thus, the accuracy and importance are systematically extracted, and both are further fused into importance-accuracy (IP-Accuracy), a synthetic causality measure. (2) By sum integration, IP-Accuracy gains a bottom-top granulation construction and granular hierarchical structure. IP-Accuracy holds benign granulation monotonicity at both the knowledge concept and classification levels. (3) IP-Accuracy attribute reduction is explored based on decision tables. A hierarchical reduct system is thereby established, including qualitative/quantitative reducts, tolerant/approximate reducts, reduct hierarchies, and heuristic algorithms. Herein, the innovative tolerant and approximate reducts quantitatively approach/expand/weaken the ideal qualitative reduct. (4) Finally, a decision table example is provided for illustration. This paper performs double-quantitative fusion of causality measures to systematically mine IP-Accuracy, and this measure benignly constructs a granular computing platform and hierarchical reduct system. By resorting to a monotonous uncertainty measure, this study provides an integration-evolution strategy of granular construction for attribute reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water-soluble metal nanoparticles stabilized by plant polyphenols for improving the catalytic properties in oxidation of alcohols	NANOSCALE			English	Article							FREE AEROBIC OXIDATION; PALLADIUM NANOPARTICLES; SELECTIVE OXIDATION; MOLECULAR-OXYGEN; BIPHASIC HYDROFORMYLATION; PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYST; CARBON NANOTUBE; COLLAGEN FIBER; BENZYL ALCOHOL	Plant polyphenols extracted from plants are one of the most abundant biomasses in nature, which are typical water soluble natural polymers. Herein, we reported a facile approach for the synthesis of platinum nanoparticle (PtNP) aqueous colloid by utilizing black wattle tannin (BWT, a typical plant polyphenol) as amphiphilic stabilizer. The phenolic hydroxyls of BWT provide the PtNPs with enough hydrophilicity, and their reduction ability could protect the PtNPs from deactivation caused by oxygen atmosphere. Additionally, the hydrophilic nature of BWT could efficiently promote the oxidation of alcohols in water, meanwhile, the hydrophobic and rigid backbones of plant polyphenols are able to suppress the PtNPs from aggregating, thus ensuring the high dispersion of the PtNPs during reactions. Under mild aerobic conditions, the as-prepared BWT-Pt colloid catalyst exhibited high activity in a series of biphasic oxidation of aromatic alcohols and aliphatic alcohols. As for the cycling stability, the BWT-Pt catalyst showed no obvious decrease during the 7 cycles, revealing superior cycling stability as compared with the counterparts using PVP or PEG as the stabilizer.

However, the immobilized NPs usually suffer from detachment or migration during the catalytic process owing to their weak interactions with the matrices. Here, we developed a facile approach for the synthesis of high active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by entrapping Pd and Ru NPs in 3D ordered hierarchically porous inverse opal carbon (IOC). For these catalysts, the 3D open-porous structure on multiple length scales provides the reactants easy access to the catalytically active NPs while the entrapment of NPs inside IOC ensures their high dispersion and stability during the catalysis. As a result, the as-prepared catalysts exhibited both high activity and stability for the oxidation of CO and electrocatalysis of VO2+/VO2+ redox couples. The conversion rate of CO over the IOC-PdNPs catalyst reached >98% at 200 degrees C, which showed no decrease after reacting for 10 h. The IOC-RuNPs-based working electrode exhibited highly reversible redox potentials at 1.25 V and 0.78 V, respectively, and no change of peak currents and peak potential separation were observed for 200 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements.

Moreover, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods thanks to the large allowable variation range of time-delays. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Fractal analysis with oe(In(r)) diagram from dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) draws a consistent microscopic picture of ion-water cooperative interactions in aqueous Na2SO4 and K2SO4 solutions. The density of the water molecules perturbed by ions in the hydration shell almost linearly increases with salt concentrations. The water molecules network perturbed by ions contributing to dielectric constant beyond the first hydration shell is obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hysteresis loops, spin distributions and energy products have been calculated with a finite hard layer thickness t(h). Both remanence and coercivity of the multilayer system decrease as beta increases, leading to a significant decrease of the maximum energy product. A 30 deviation of the easy axis could result in a drop of the maximum energy product by more than 60%, which offers a possible explanation on the large discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical energy products. The effect of the finite hard layer thickness on the demagnetization process is important, which can only be ignored when th is large enough. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wan, X.

The behavior is well described according to four Cole-Cole terms whose evolution with composition is analyzed. The static dielectric constant and relaxation times decreases with the increasing aqueous MgCl2 solution concentrations. Only one H-bonded water cluster with the aqueous MgCl2 solution relaxes is reported during the cutoff relaxation time.

It is shown that the local density of states at the interstitial Fe impurity (IFI) possesses a strong resonance inside the gap, which seems to be insensitive to the doping and the pairing symmetry in the Fe-Fe plane, while a single or two resonances appear at the nearest neighboring (NN) Fe sites. The location and height of the resonance peaks only depend on the hopping t and the pairing parameter Delta(I) between the IFI and the NN Fe sites. These in-gap resonances are originated in the Andreev's bound states due to the quasiparticle tunneling through the IFI, leading to the change of the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter. When both t and Delta(I) are small, this robust zero energy bound state near the IFI is consistent with recent scanning tunneling microscopy observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, graphene-MWCNT aerogels possess ultra-low thermal conductivities (similar to 0.056 W m(-1) K-1) and apparent density (similar to 24 kg m(-3)), thereafter the figure of merit (ZT) of similar to 0.001 is achieved. Although the ZT value is too low for practical application as a thermoelectric (TE) material, the unique structure in this project provides a potential way to overcome the challenge in bulk semiconductors that increasing electrical conductivity generally leads to decreased Seebeck coefficient and enhanced thermal conductivity.

We find that the internode process, as well as the unique three-dimensional spin-momentum locking, has significant influences on the RKKY interaction, resulting in both a Heisenberg and an Ising term, and an additional Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya term if the inversion symmetry is absent. These interactions can lead to rich spin textures and possible ferromagnetism in Dirac and time-reversal symmetry-invariant Weyl SMs. The effect of anisotropic Dirac and Weyl nodes on the RKKY interaction is also discussed. Our results provide an alternative scheme to engineer topological SMs and shed new light on the application of Dirac and Weyl SMs in spintronics.

ADMINISTRATION OF LACTOBACILLUS HELVETICUS NS8 IMPROVES BEHAVIORAL, COGNITIVE, AND BIOCHEMICAL ABERRATIONS CAUSED BY CHRONIC RESTRAINT STRESS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Lactobacillus helveticus; chronic restraint stress; depression; microbiota-gut-brain axis; BDNF; serotonin	ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; GUT-BRAIN AXIS; HUMAN MICROBIOME; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BIFIDOBACTERIUM-LONGUM; MATERNAL SEPARATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; CITROBACTER-RODENTIUM	Increasing numbers of studies have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut microbiota aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of probiotics can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. They also suggest the therapeutic potential of L. helveticus NS8 in stress-related and possibly other kinds of depression. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examines how the public's perceptions of the distributional fairness of the benefits of mining, procedural fairness in the interactions between the mining industry and society, and confidence in the governance arrangements surrounding the industry affect the public's trust in the mining industry and, in turn, their acceptance of mining activities at a national scale. The aim of this study was also to understand how the contexts in which mining companies operate influence the public's perceptions of and attitudes toward mining. To this end, large-scale national surveys were conducted in Australia (N = 5121), China (N = 5122), and Chile (N = 1598). The results reveal that the key predictors of the public's acceptance of the mining industry were found to be relatively low across all three countries. In addition, distributional fairness, procedural fairness, and confidence in governance were all found to affect acceptance of mining, both directly and indirectly, by influencing the level of public trust in the mining industry. The findings also reveal that each of these three elements predicted trust and acceptance to varying degrees across the three countries. This suggests that the different elements are variously important to the public in accepting mining activities in their own contextual landscapes, highlighting that acceptance of mining is highly context dependent. The relatively low public perceptions of the three key predictors further suggest that in order to achieve a more socially sustainable mining industry where social conflict around mining operations is minimised and the public is able to experience the benefits of resource development, both the mining industry and governments may need to review their own methods of engaging with citizens to build trust in those stakeholder relationships.

In this study, WIDE-B ARC material was investigated to confirm the reduction of the vertical standing wave which leads to defect of nanopatterns. And the critical dimension (CD) of 100 nm L/S patterns with and without the application of BARC material was fabricated by laser interference lithography technology. The compared results showed that BARC can effectively reduce CD swing and obtain more uniform nanopatterns. Meanwhile, we also verified the influence of cured temperature and film thickness of BARC on the uniformity of nanopatterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa Yi), is a staple food for the endangered giant panda, but little is known about the impact of drought on bamboo species and its recovery mechanism. This study investigated the response of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism to drought and subsequent recovery, and the relationship of their metabolites with lipid peroxidation. Photochemistry was reversibly down-regulated after drought, but a longer recovery time is needed. The accelerated degradation of starch due to a rapid increase in amylase activity resulted in higher soluble sugar only in severe drought-stressed plants after 30 days of drought. Sucrose content was not affected by drought because of the relative increases in activities of invertase, sucrose synthase, and sucrose phosphate synthase. As nitrate concentration increased in parallel with nitrate reductase activity, ammonium (NH4 (+)) production was enhanced by drought. Also, activated glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle stimulated NH4 (+) assimilation, while hydrolysis of soluble proteins was accelerated, resulting in accumulation of amino acids. After rewatering, re-balancing of C metabolism has gradually begun, but a stronger N metabolism was still observed. The notable positive correlations between MDA and the contents of starch and proline after 15 days of drought as well as between MDA and the contents of soluble sugar, NSC and proline after 30 days of drought were displayed. We conclude that dwarf bamboo may not only differently regulate its C and N metabolism to improve the capacity of osmotic adjustment but also employ its different metabolites protect against membrane lipid peroxidation under different intensities and duration of drought, thus accelerating its recovery after rewatering.

The genus Gordonia comprises metabolically diverse bacteria that can degrade a wide range of persistent compounds. This paper reports the multiplicity of genes encoding 3-ketosteroid Delta(1)-dehydrogenase (KstD) in Gordonia neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395. KstD is one of the key enzymes in microbial steroid catabolism. Five kstD homologues (kstD1-kstD5) distributed over several phylogenetic groups were investigated in G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395. Escherichia coli cells expressing kstD homologues were used to transform different steroids, including cholesterol, cholest-4-en-3-one, 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD), progesterone, and 16 alpha, 17 alpha-epoxyprogesterone. All five enzymes displayed KstD activity toward 3-ketosteroids, but none were able to transform 3-hydroxysteroid substrates such as cholesterol. KstD2, KstD3, and KstD5 catalyzed the dehydrogenation reaction of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-epoxyprogesterone, while KstD1, KstD3, and KstD4 transformed AD into androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression of kstD1, kstD3, and kstD4 was upregulated during culture in cholesterol or AD when compared with expression during culture in pyruvic acid. kstD2 and kstD5 were uniquely induced by cholesterol. Thus, the presence of multiple kstD genes in the G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 genome facilitates a dynamic and fine-tuned response to environmental changes.

Moreover, NMR spectra of curcumin analogues compounds have been studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) by GIAO method. The results show that the structure of eight compounds, a larger conjugated system, has good planarity. The effect of ortho-substituents on bond lengths and bond angles is greater than para and meta. Different substituents and different positions of substituents all have different influence on NMR of the single carbonyl curcumin analogues. In general, after the hydrogen atom on the benzene ring is substituted by other groups, the delta value of alpha-C changes significantly, the delta value of ortho-carbon atom may also have great change, but the delta value change of meta-carbon atoms is not too obvious. The effect of substituent electronegativity on alpha-C atoms presents obvious regularity, while the influence of conjugate effect on carbon atoms of benzene ring is more complex. Finally, the bigger substituted alkyl is, the more the delta value of alpha-C increases.

After introducing TiO2 nanoparticles, the thermal properties of the PVDF-HFP/PMMA/TiO2 composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) are remarkably improved: when the working temperature is up to 90 degrees C, the weight loss of CPE with 7% TiO2 is only 12.8% of that without TiO2, suggesting much higher thermal stability; the shrinkage of the CPE at 130 degrees C can also obviously decrease from 23.4% down to 14.4% after introducing TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the CPE exhibits much higher ionic conductivity and better electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the LiCoO2/Li cells with CPE exhibit good cyclic stability and C-rate performance: the capacity maintains 92.1% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles; the capacity can reach as large as similar to 80 mAhr(-1) even at 5 C. It is promising for PVDF-HFP/PMMA/TiO2 CPE to meet the practical demands of high-performance and thermal safety for lithium ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Improved Attribute Reduction Algorithm based on Granular Computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						attribute reduction; granular computing; rough set; attribute significance		Granular computing is a new intelligent computing method based on problem solving, information processing and pattern classification. Granular computing based attribute reduction method is an important application of Granular computing. These algorithms are mostly based on reduction core. However, some information systems may have no reduction core, especially in the actual application data. For this case, those algorithms are powerless. In this paper, an improved reduction algorithm based on granular computing is proposed. The algorithm is validated by the experimental result.

It is shown that for any choice of reasonably regular initial data (u(0), v(0), w(0)), there exists a constant lambda* depending on alpha, rho, mu, gamma, eta, v(0) and wo such that for any lambda > lambda*, the associated initial boundary system possesses a global classical solution which is uniformly bounded. Moreover, building on this boundedness property, it is proved that as time tends to infinity, all the solution approaches the homogeneous steady state (1, 0, 1) in an appropriate sense.

Room temperature x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that the structures of as-prepared Bi1-xLaxFe0.90Co0.05Ti0.05O3 solid solutions transformed from rhombohedral R3c to tetragonal P4mm and then to orthorhombic Pnma, with increasing La concentration from 0 to 1. In situ high-temperature XRD (HTXRD) analysis further revealed that rhombohedral structure R3c (x <= 0.16) and tetragonal structure P4mm (0.17 <= x <= 0.40) changed to orthorhombic Pnma along with increasing temperature, and the phase transition temperature decreased with the increase of La doping concentration. However, the orthorhombic structure Pnma (x >= 0.41) kept stable even when the temperature reached 850 degrees C. The phase diagram of as-prepared binary solid solutions of Bi1-xLaxFe0.90Co0.05Ti0.05O3(x = 0-1) was drawn on the basis of XRD and HTXRD analysis. Magnetic measurement revealed that the magnetic properties are greatly enhanced with the increase of La content. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deterioration of the coercivity due to the diffusion induced interface layer in hard/soft multilayers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANISOTROPIC NANOCOMPOSITE FILMS; ENERGY PRODUCT; REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; MAGNETS; BILAYERS; MEDIA; 3D	Hard/soft permanent magnets have aroused many interests in the past two decades because of their potential in achieving giant energy products as well as their rich variety of magnetic behaviors. Nevertheless, the experimental energy products are much smaller than the theoretical ones due to the much smaller coercivity measured in the experiments. In this paper, the deterioration of the coercivity due to the interface atomic diffusion is demonstrated based on a three dimensional (3D) micromagnetic software (OOMMF) and a formula derived for the pinning field in a hard/soft multilayer, which can be applied to both permanent magnets and exchange-coupled-composite (ECC) media. It is found that the formation of the interface layer can decrease the coercivity by roughly 50%, which is responsible for the observed smaller coercivity in both composite and single-phased permanent magnets. A method to enhance the coercivity in these systems is proposed based on the discussions, consistent with recent experiments where excellent magnetic properties are achieved.	[Si, Wenjing; Zhao, G.

It extracts the radial distribution function for each concentration solution, dielectric constant and other information on dielectric properties. Analysing the microscopic dielectric information of the aqueous solution under the static electric field (0-3x10(9) V/m) and microwave frequencies (2.45G, 0-3x10(9) V/m), and comparing the dielectric information between the different concentrations and different field strengths, we can get the dielectric properties of two kinds of polar aqueous solution under microwave irradiation. Thus, this project can provide the data of the sample to other correlation studies.

A transparent gap is introduced between photoresist film and polystyrene microspheres to adjust light distribution of photoresist surface. The pores size on the photoresist film varies when the gap thickness is changed. By optimization gap thickness and exposure dose, sub-100 nm surface patterning array is achieved for sphere of 2.06 mu m diameter and optical wavelength. of 400 nm theoretically and experimentally. Furthermore, when smaller polystyrene sphere (1.25 mu m diameter) is chosen, spot width of 35 nm is realized by numerical calculation.

Herein, we demonstrate the first example of regulating the redox activity of c-Cyts in a living microorganism through heme axial ligation to target high extracellular electron transfer (EET). The direct electrochemistry of Shewanella oneidensis amended with an axial ligand (imidazole) delivered a 1.5-fold increase in the biocurrent, demonstrating enhanced EET. Invivo UV/Vis and Raman spectra confirmed the axial ligation of imidazoles to the c-Cyts.

The evolution of the skyrmion spin texture under varying applied field is investigated. The skyrmion core size can be tuned by an external magnetic field. However, skyrmion spin texture will be destroyed for a large enough applied field.

It is found that the pinning fields exhibit an angular symmetry where the minimum occurs at beta = 45 degrees, similar to that according to the well-known Stoner-Wohlfarth model. For intermediate soft layer thickness, the Kondorsly-like pinning is observed, where the pinning fields increase monotonically with beta. On the other hand, the pinning field HP goes up monotonically with t(h) for all values of beta when the hard layer thickness is less than roughly three times of its domain wall width.	[Zhao, G.

In the face of climate change, maintenance and improvement in its productivity is very necessary for the management of the giant pandas' habitats. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying plant responses to water deficit are poorly known. To investigate the effects of P application on photosynthetic C and N metabolism, water use efficiency (WUE) and growth of dwarf bamboo under water deficit, a completely randomized design with two factors of two watering (well-watered and water-stressed) and two P regimes (with and without P fertilization) was arranged. P application hardly changed growth, net CO2 assimilation rate (P-n) and WUE in well-watered plants but significantly increased relative growth rate (RGR) and P-n in water-stressed plants. The effect of P application on RGR under water stress was mostly associated with physiological adjustments rather than with differences in biomass allocation. P application maintained the balance of C metabolism in well-watered plants, but altered the proportion of nitrogenous compounds in N metabolism. By contrast, P application remarkably increased sucrose-metabolizing enzymes activities with an obvious decrease in sucrose content in water-stressed plants, suggesting an accelerated sucrose metabolism. Activation of nitrogen-metabolizing enzymes in water-stressed plants was attenuated after P application, thus slowing nitrate reduction and ammonium assimilation. P application hardly enlarged the phenotypic plasticity of dwarf bamboo in response to water in the short term. Generally, these examined traits of dwarf bamboo displayed weak or negligible responses to water-P interaction. In conclusion, P application could accelerate P-n and sucrose metabolism and slow N metabolism in water-stressed dwarf bamboo, and as a result improved RGR and alleviated damage from soil water deficit.

It can be shown that two distant senders can simultaneously and deterministically exchange their states with the other senders under the control of the supervisor. In order to extend BCJRSP, we generalize this protocol from five participants to multi participants utilizing two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as channel and propose two generalized BCJRSP schemes. On the other hand, we generalize the BCJRSP to multidirectional controlled joint remote state preparation by utilizing multi GHZ-type states of multi-qubit as quantum channel. By integrating bidirectional quantum teleportation, quantum state sharing and joint remote state preparation, some modified versions are discussed. Only Pauli operations and single-qubit measurements are used in our schemes, so the scheme with five-party is easily realized in physical experiment.

In this work, the structural, thermodynamic, elastic, and electronic properties of alpha-SnS have been investigated by the plane wave pseudo-potential density functional theory with the framework of generalised gradient approximation. The calculated pressure-dependent lattice parameters agree well with the available experimental data. Our thermodynamic properties of alpha-SnS, including heat capacity C-P, entropy S, and Gibbs free energy relation of -(G(T) - H-0) curves, show similar growth trends as the experimental data. At T = 298.15 K, our C-P = 52.31 J/mol.K, S = 78.93 J/mol.K, and -(G(T) - H-0) = 12.03 J/mol all agree very well with experimental data C-P = 48.77 J/mol.K and 49.25 J/mol.K, S = 76.78 J/mol.K, and -(G(T) - H-0) = 12.38 J/mol. The elastic constants, together with other elastic properties, are also computed. The anisotropy analyses indicate obvious elastic anisotropy for alpha-SnS along different symmetry planes and axes. Moreover, calculations demonstrate that alpha-SnS is an indirect gap semiconductor, and it transforms to semimetal with pressure increasing up to 10.2 GPa. Combined with the density of states, the characters of the band structure have been analysed in detail.

The ceramics with low Dy levels (x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.015) show a pure perovskite structure, while a small amount of secondary phase DyNbO4 can be detected in the ceramics with x a parts per thousand yen 0.02. The increase in the level of Dy3+ doping leads to the shift of crystal structure of the ceramics from the coexistence of orthorhombic-tetragonal phases to pseudo-cubic phase. The addition of Dy3+ inhibits the grain growth of the ceramics and induces the diffusive phase transition in the ceramics with high levels of Dy3+ ions. The piezoelectric constant d (33) of the ceramics decreases from 198 to 52 pC/N with x increasing from 0 to 0.03 because of the shift of the crystal structure of the ceramics from the coexistence of orthorhombic-tetragonal phase to pseudo-cubic phase. The Dy-doped ceramics excited at 453 nm have excellent luminescent properties. Two strong emission spectral bands centered at 476 and 573 nm are observed, corresponding to the transition of the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) levels of Dy3+, respectively. Our study shows that the ceramic with x = 0.015 possesses simultaneously strong ferroelectricity, good piezoelectricity and excellent luminescence, suggesting that the Dy-doped ceramics may have potential application in multifunctional devices.

The transport mechanism of coupled particles in the overdamped limit is investigated as the function of the temperature of baths, coupling constant and natural length of the spring, the amplitude and frequency of driving force, and the asymmetry of ratchet potential by numerical stimulations. The results indicate that the damping force involving the information of historical velocity leads to the nonlocal memory property and blocks the traditional dissipative motion behaviors, and it even plays a cooperative role of driving force in drift motion of the coupled particles. Thus, we observe various non-monotonic resonance-like behaviors of collective directed transport in the mediums with different diffusion exponents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their structures and physical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), specific surface analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption spectra, photoluminescence spectra (PL) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS). SEM, EDS and TEM analyses verified that Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs composites have been successfully prepared. PL analysis illustrated that Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs have the lower emission peak intensities, compared with Ag3PO4 and WO3. By using simultaneous decontaminations of Cr(VI) and orange II as model reactions, the photocatalytic efficiencies of Ag3PO4, WO3 and Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs were evaluated. The reaction results showed that Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs have strong photocatalytic activities. The effect of Ag3PO4:WO3 ratio on the photocatalytic activity was systemically studied. The catalyst AWM(7/3) was found to exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability in repeated and long-term applications. The improvement of photocatalytic activity and stability was mainly attributed to the highly effective separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and special transfer pathway of electrons and holes in Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs composites.

J	Yang, T; Ji, XL; Li, XQ				Yang Ting; Ji Xiao-Ling; Li Xiao-Qing			Propagation characteristics of partially coherent decentred annular beams propagating through oceanic turbulence	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						oceanic turbulence; partially coherent decentred annular beam; position of the maximum intensity; centroid position	ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE	The analytical expressions for the average intensity and the centroid position of partially coherent decentred annular beams propagating through oceanic turbulence are derived, and the propagation equation of the position of the maximum intensity is also given. Changes of the average intensity, the centroid position and the position of the maximum intensity of partially coherent decentred annular beams during propagation are studied in detail. It is shown that both in free space and in oceanic turbulence, the position of the maximum intensity moves to the propagation z-axis with increasing the propagation distance, and is kept unchanged when the propagation distance is large enough. Furthermore, in free space the position of the maximum intensity is closer to the propagation z-axis than to the centroid position when the propagation distance is large enough. The position of the maximum intensity is closer to the propagation z-axis with increasing the correlation parameter, and far from the propagation z-axis with increasing the decentered parameter and the obscure ratio. However, in oceanic turbulence the position of the maximum intensity is close to the centroid position when the propagation distance is large enough, and the evolution is speeded with increasing the strength of oceanic turbulence. The influence of the beam coherence on propagation characteristics decreases due to oceanic turbulence. On the other hand, the centroid position is independent of the beam coherence, the propagation distance and the oceanic turbulence. The centroid position is far from the propagation z-axis with increasing the decentered parameter and the obscure ratio. In addition, the hollow core of partially coherent decentred annular beams is filled up as the propagation distance increases, and the evolution is speeded with increasing the strength of oceanic turbulence. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for applications of partially coherent decentred annular beams in oceanic turbulence.

Essential oil; 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene; alpha-Terpinene; Breast cancer MCF-7 cells; Antitumor activity	LEAF ESSENTIAL OIL; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY	Purpose: To investigate the most effective compound of C. ambrosioides essential oil for the induction of cell death in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and the mechanism of induction. Methods: MCF-7 cells were treated with essential oil and its two main components, 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene and alpha-terpinene, respectively, for 24 and 48 h in vitro. To determine their cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells, in vitro cytotoxicity, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthaizol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and live/dead cell fluorescent staining were used. MCF-7 cellular superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) vitality and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were also evaluated. Results: MTT results showed that essential oil and its two main compositions significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells in 24 h (p < 0.05), which was consistent with the Live/dead cell fluorescent staining results. After 24 h incubation the average inhibition rate is 58.98 % for essential oil, 37.8 % for 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene and 32.09 % for alpha-terpinene. With increase in the concentration of essential oil and the two main components, the relative activity of SOD significantly decreased (p < 0.05), while the relative activity of CAT was gradually increased (p < 0.05), compared with control. MDA relative content significantly increased (p < 0.05) until the concentration was 1.25, 0.21 and 0.17 mu g/ml for essential oil, 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene and alpha-terpinene, and thereafter significantly decreased (p < 0.05), compared to control. Conclusion: The data suggest that the essential oil of C. ambrosioides and its two main components inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferation cell death by inducing oxidative damage. However, the two main components are less effective in their anticancer activity than the essential oil	[Wang Ya-Nan; Wu Jia-Liang; Ma Dan-Wei; Li Jiao; Zhang Du-Yu] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China	Wang, YN (reprint author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China.	yanan.w@163.com	-8587465870508711355, User/C-1780-2016		National Fund Nature Science of China [31370549]; Education Office of Sichuan Province and cell Institute Sichuan Normal University in China	This work was financially supported by the National Fund Nature Science of China (No. 31370549), the Education Office of Sichuan Province and cell Institute Sichuan Normal University in China.		27	0	0	4	15	PHARMACOTHERAPY GROUP	BENIN CITY	UNIV BENIN, FACULTY PHARMACY, BENIN CITY, 00000, NIGERIA	1596-5996			TROP J PHARM RES	Trop.

Results showed that elevated concentrations of TAN caused decreased growth, carbon fixation, and energy production rates, particularly just after the first rise in two types of swine wastewater. Also, OSW was more suitable for S. polyrhiza cultivation than ADE. Maximum carbon and energy fixation were achieved at OSW-TAN concentrations of 12.08 and 13.07 mg L-1, respectively.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure with rhombohedral symmetry. The addition of a small amount of Co2O3 enhances the ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, piezoelectricity and temperature stability of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 1.0 possesses enhanced piezoelectricity (d(33) = 134pC/N), good ferroelectricity (P-r = 19.9 mu C/cm(2)) and increased high depolarization temperature (T-d = 475 degrees C). The 1 mol% Co2O3 doping greatly improves the ferromagnetic property of the ceramics and the optimum remnant magnetization M-r of 0.191 emu/g of the ceramic is obtained at x = 1.0. These results show that the ceramic with x = 1.0 is a promising candidate for lead-free high-temperature piezoelectric and room-temperature multiferrioc materials.

Saturated polarization hysteresis loops were observed for all the ceramics, and the remanent polarization P (r) decreased with Eu doping. The Eu-doped ceramics had a sharp excitation band centered at 465 nm due to the f-f transition from the F-7(0) ground state to the D-5(2) excited state of Eu3+. Under the excitation by 465 nm light, the main emission peaks located at 595 nm and 616 nm were obtained, which corresponds to the transition of D-5(0)-F-7(1), 5D(0)-F-7(2) levels in Eu3+, respectively. Our study shows that CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics may be a promising multifunctional material for potential applications in optical-electro integration devices.

The lattice parameters (a, c and u) are directly calculated and agree well with previous experimental and theoretical results. The obtained negative formation enthalpy shows that ZnGeP2 crystal has strong structural stability. We have also calculated the bulk modulus B and the elastic parameters (C-11, C-12, C-13, C-33, C-44, and C-65) which have not been measured yet. The accuracy and reliability of the calculated elastic constants of ZnGeP2 crystal are discussed. In addition, the pressure and temperature dependencies of the lattice parameters, bulk modulus, Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, entropy, volume thermal expansion coefficient, and specific heat capacity are obtained in the ranges of 0-20 GPa and 0-1200 K using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. To our knowledge this is the first quantitative theoretical prediction of the thermodynamic properties for ZnGeP2 compound and still awaits experimental confirmations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Once an operating component breaks down, it is repaired by a repair facility. Moreover, the repair facility is subject to failure during the repair period which results in repair interruptions. Failed repair facility resumes repair after a random period of time. Under such assumptions, applying the quasi-birth-and-death process and the matrix-analytical approach, the system state probabilities are derived. In addition, various steady-state system performance measures such as the availability and the rate of occurrence of failure along with some numerical illustrations are reported. Finally, under a profit structure, we use the direct search method and the parabolic method to search for the optimal system parameters.

The structural stability, thermodynamic stability together with mechanical stability show that Re2N-Os2C, OsB2-OsC2, trigonal P (3) over bar m1 OsC2, trigonal P (3) over bar m1 OsC3, orthorhombic Cmmm OsC4 and Ru2Ge3-Os2C3 are the most stable structure for each kind of compounds. But, OsB2-OsC2 and Ru2Ge3-Os2C3 are dynamically unstable based on the calculation of phonon dispersion. The formation enthalpies under high pressure indicate that the Re2N-Os2C, P (3) over bar m1 OsC3, Cmmm OsC4 and Os2Si3-O2C3 (P4c2) have structural stabilities in the entire range of pressure. While for OsC2, there is a high pressure phase transition exists above 40 GPa. In addition, all the studied osmium carbides exhibit metallic behavior and strong covalent bonding. According to the calculated Vicker hardness based on a semiempirical method, we found that the OsC4 with Cmmm space group has the largest hardness value (28.4 GPa). Combined with its largest shear modulus and Yong's modulus, smallest Poission's ratio and low B/G ratio, we predict it is a potential superhard material. By the comparison between the crystal structure of OsC2 and OsC3, it is found that the increased C-C bonds in a cell increase their hardness, whereas the ionicity Os-Os bonds are unfavorable.

Optomechanically induced transparency and absorption in hybridized optomechanical systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; QUANTUM GROUND-STATE; SLOW LIGHT	We present the normal-mode splitting and optomechanically induced transparency or absorption phenomena in the strongly tunnel-coupled optomechanical cavities. In the probe output spectrum, there appear central transparency windows or absorption peaks around which two broad sidebands are symmetrically located. It has been confirmed by the quantitative findings that two broad sidebands, which include the distorted absorption peaks, indicate the normal-mode splitting of the two hybridized cavities, and central transparency windows or absorption peaks character the interference induced by the optomechanical interactions. Additionally, the switching from absorption to amplification can be realized by only adjusting the tunnel interaction. These spectrum properties can be used for the coherent control of light pulses via microfabricated optomechanical arrays.	[Hou, B.

A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way of improving accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, as delivered by trained village doctors, to treat late-life depression in rural China. Methods We conducted one focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The topic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of the village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The village doctors stressed the importance of role-playing and using instructive manuals in the training. Proper supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive such that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived policy consideration) facilitated the elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included a lack of real therapy (in contrast to role-playing) demonstrated in the training and lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of village doctors and the presence of other people when conducting the intervention. Conclusions The present study has demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if several challenges are appropriately addressed.

The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, while with less attention given to urban centers in the west. Chengdu, western China, however is undergoing significant urban growth due to rapid economic development and demographic growth. This research examines urban expansion in Chengdu based on remotely sensed data, urban expansion model, buffer analysis of geographic information system (GIS) and quadrant orientation analysis. Driving forces of urban expansion are also examined based on principle component analysis (PCA). Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 17 times, up to 1910.2 km(2) from 1978 to 2010, the urban expansion rate and intensity increased significantly and exhibited the spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We found that urban expansion patterns changed from patch infilling to patch margin expansion, and the expansion direction is primarily toward the northwest, west and southwest. The results suggest an obvious trend of urban expansion in Chengdu witnessed in coastal cities of China. The information provided by this research ultimately helped impact on future policies and plans for better land management and urban sustainability. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spin-polarized Wannier functions for the two-dimensional topological insulators	EPL			English	Article							ENERGY-BANDS; SYSTEMS; SOLIDS	We propose that the topological properties of the two-dimensional topological insulators can be classified by the evolution of the centers of the spin-polarized Wannier functions. Numerical results are obtained based upon a modified Kane-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and a uniform exchange field. The centers of the spin-polarized Wannier functions are shown to display different spectral flow patterns in different quantum phases, characterizing the topological structures of the bulk energy bands.

These interactions create a steady environment for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Thus understanding these interactions between ATP and F-1-ATPase is essential for understanding ATP synthesis/hydrolysis mechanism. We performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate these interactions and attempted to identify key residues which play important roles in stabilizing and positioning ATP. By examining the non-bonded energies between ATP and residues of beta(TP) subunit in F-1-ATPase, it is found that residues 158-164, R189, Y345 have significant interactions with ATP. The loop segment (residues 158-164) and R189 surround ATP by a half and they interact with beta and gamma phosphates through forming a network of hydrogen bonds to constraint the motion of ATP triphosphate. The interaction network seals off the conformation of the catalytic site, creating a steady environment for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Additionally, ATP base is positioned by the pi-pi stacking interaction from Y345. However, ATP base can slide and move paralleling to the aromatic group of Y345. It is deduced that this motion may facilitate ATP hydrolysis.

By defining some suitable functionals and a constrained variational problem, we first establish the existence of standing waves, which relys on the inner structure of the equations under consideration to overcome the drawback that nonlocal terms violate the space-scale invariance. We then show the orbital instability of standing waves. The arguments depend upon the conservation laws of the mass and of the energy.

By using formic acid, mercury vapor was generated under the irradiation of UV light, and then the vapor was introduced into the corona discharge area with the carrier gas flow of argon. The optical signals were captured and analyzed by the charge-coupled device detector at 253.7 nm. Under the optimized conditions of 4% formic acid, discharge voltage of 90 V, and at carrier gas flow rate of 200 mL min(-1), the stable detection signals were obtained (RSD - 2.5%). The calibration curve was plotted with the concentration of mercury ranging from 0.5 ng mL(-1) to 1000 ng mL(-1), with a correlation coefficient > 0.99 and the limit of detection of 0.03 ng mL(-1). Two certified reference materials were analyzed, and a t-test demonstrated that the determined results by the proposed method had no significant difference with the certified values at the confidence level of 95%. Water samples collected from both Funan River in Chengdu and Lotus Pond on campus of Sichuan University were analyzed as well, with the recoveries of standard addition between 93.8% and 103%. The miniaturized instrumentation demonstrated several advantages such as easy construction, low power consumption, high sensitivity, and portability for field analysis.

In this letter, we propose an incentive framework within which the macrocell base station (MBS) provides profit to femtocells by pricing accessed MUEs' transmission rates guaranteed by FAPs. A Stackelberg game is formulated to maximize the utility functions of both the MBS and FAPs. The Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the proposed game is investigated and the best strategies for both tiers are obtained. Numerical results show that utility functions of FAPs can be improved significantly, which provides strong motivation for FAPs to adopt hybrid access and implement the proposed framework.

This particular population has received increasing attention from researchers. The goals of the present study are to describe longitudinally the prevalence and the severity of PTSD in adolescent survivors of the Yushu earthquake in China and to explore the risk factors which lead to psychiatric disorders. The PTSD Check List (Civilian Version) was used to assess the PTSD symptoms in participants. The rates of PTSD were found to be 10.9% after 6 months and 5.8% after 24 months. Bereavement, being buried in the ruins, and personal injury were found to be significant risk factors for the development of PTSD. We suggest that intervention strategies should be addressed and more attention should be paid to adolescents.

An optimization model based on the maximizing deviation method, by which the attribute weights can be determined, is established. For the special situations where the information about attribute weights is completely unknown, we establish another optimization model. By solving this model, we get a simple and exact formula, which can be used to determine the attribute weights. We utilize the interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy weighted averaging operator to aggregate the interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy information corresponding to each alternative, and then rank the alternatives and select the most desirable one(s) according to the score function and accuracy function. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

The calculated equilibrium lattice and the normalized crystal parameters as a function of pressure are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data. Elastic constants C-ij are calculated in the pressure range of 0-50GPa, and the bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, and Young's modulus E are also obtained according to the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) approximation. Anisotropic indexes are employed to characterize the mechanical anisotropy. The bulk modulus and Young's modulus as a function of crystal orientations are also investigated. The obtained results suggest that CrB4 exhibits a pronounced elastic anisotropy. It is strongest along the b-axis in response to compression loading, and the {100} and {001} shear planes might be the cleavage planes. The elastic anisotropy of CrB4 may possibly limit its applications. Using the quasiharmonic Debye model, thermodynamic properties like Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, heat capacity, and expansion coefficient are also systematically explored under extreme P-T conditions.

After the partial substitution of Ho3+ for Bi3+, a new Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based solid solution with a pure perovskite structure is formed. The doping of Ho3+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure of the ceramics. After the addition of a small amount of Ho3+ (x = 0.015), the piezoelectricity (d (33) = 187 pC/N, k (p) = 41.1 %, respectively) and ferroelectricity (P (r) = 25.2 mu C/cm(2)) of ceramics are enhanced. The down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence of the ceramics are observed. A green down-conversion emission band at 548 nm is observed which is from the S-5(2) -> I-5(8) transition of Ho3+; the main down-conversion excitation bands located at 410-500 nm is due to the I-5(8) -> (5)G(5, 6) transitions, and the maximum brightness of down-conversion photoluminescence are obtained at x = 0.015. The ceramic with x = 0.01 exhibits the maximum value of the up-conversion emission at 475 nm, which is attributed to the F-5(3) -> I-5(8) transition. Our study shows that the ceramics with x = 0.01-0.02 exhibit simultaneously good piezoelectricity, strong ferroelectricity and excellent photoluminescence, suggesting a potential application in the electro-optic devices.

J	Zhou, LG; Lu, D; Fujita, H				Zhou, Ligang; Lu, Dong; Fujita, Hamido			The performance of corporate financial distress prediction models with features selection guided by domain knowledge and data mining approaches	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Financial distress prediction; Features selection; Domain knowledge; Data mining	BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; HYBRID	Experts in finance and accounting select feature subset for corporate financial distress prediction according to their professional understanding of the characteristics of the features, while researchers in data mining often believe that data alone can tell everything and they use various mining techniques to search the feature subset without considering the financial and accounting meanings of the features. This paper investigates the performance of different financial distress prediction models with features selection approaches based on domain knowledge or data mining techniques. The empirical results show that there is no significant difference between the best classification performance of models with features selection guided by data mining techniques and that by domain knowledge. However, the combination of domain knowledge and genetic algorithm based features selection method can outperform unique domain knowledge and unique data mining based features selection method on AUC performance.

Its structure and physical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption spectra, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and photocurrent techniques. SEM, TEM and EDS analyses verified that Agl-Ag3PO4 is successfully loaded on MWCNTs. Agl-ABsPati MWCNTs possess the absorption edge of red shift and small band gap energy, and could absorb more photons in the visible region. PL and photocurrent analyses illustrated that Agl-Ag3PO4/MWCNTs have the lowest emission peak intensity and the highest photoelectric current, compared with Ag3PO4, AgI and AgI-Ag3PO4. By using the photocatalytic degradation of mixed dyes wastewater of Orange II and ponceau 4R as a model reaction, the photocatalytic efficiencies of Ag3PO4, AgI, Agl-Ag3PO4 and AgI-Ag3PO4/MWCNT5 were evaluated. The reaction results showed that AgI-Ag3PO4/MWCNTs have strong photocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability in repeated and long-term applications. Therefore, the prepared AgI-Ag3PO4/MWCNTs could act as a high-performance catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of mixed dyes wastewater and also suggested the promising applications.

The catalytic properties of CA and platinum (Pt) counter electrodes are analyzed and compared by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements. The devices applying CA counter electrode exhibit a lower charge-transfer resistance (1.60 Omega cm(2)) and larger diffusion coefficient (3.39 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1)) compared to the devices with conventional Pt counter electrode. As a new kind of porous carbon materials, CA counter electrode has high active surface area and conductance. These factors improve the power conversion efficiency (eta) up to 8.04%, which is better than that of the reference Pt based DSSC (6.79%). This paper indicates that carbon aerogel with good catalytic activity can potentially be used as a promising alternative to the expensive Pt counter electrode in a high-performance DSSC device design.

METHODS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups: a trial group with 35 patients and a control group with 32 patients. The trial group was given TCCT for 3 months, then administered IVF-ET or awaited natural pregnancy. The control group was administered IVF-ET without TCCT 3 months after the previous IVF-ET or natural pregnancy attempt. The patterns of KLB were observed both before and after treatment. The natural pregnancy rate of the two groups was calculated after treatment. Differences between the two groups were compared after using IVF-ET treatment again in fertilized egg number and fertilization rate were evaluated. RESULTS: After treatment with TCM comprehensive therapy, seven patients in the treatment group became pregnant, while there were no successful conceptions in the control group. The difference in clinical pregnancy rate in the initial cycle and transfer cycle of IVF were significantly different (P < 0.05). The trial group had a significantly higher conception rate than that of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TCCT can promote the natural pregnancy rate in patients with previously failed IVF-ET. TCCT could increase patients' fertilized egg number, fertilization rate, pregnancy rate, and clinical pregnancy rate after another IVF-ET treatment. TCCT can also relieve the symptoms of KLB.

It is found that for the small orbital mirror size, a Gaussian beam with negative spherical aberration might be more strongly compressed without filamentation than that without spherical aberration, and its spot size on the ground can be reduced well below the diffraction limit. However, for the large orbital mirror size, spherical aberration will result in an increase of receiver size on the ground.

Herein, we report a study on 2D self-assembly of two kinds of triphenylene-submitted discotic mesogenic species, which have similar four TP moieties with alkyne spacer but different rigid aromatic cores pyrene and carbazole. Two types of stable periodic long-ranged supramolecular networks on the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface have been visualized via high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy technique. A comparative study reveals how the aromatic core of molecular building blocks affects achiral and chiral arrangement of discotic molecule on surface. The asymmetry backbone results in molecular orientation and varied van der Waals forces between molecule molecule and molecule substrate. Our results demonstrate that design of functional molecules plays an important role in the construction of 2D supramolecular assembly possessing desirable structure for the specific applications.

It is found that, when the zenith angle is not large enough, the saturation phenomenon of the scintillation index never appears even if the propagation distance is large enough, which is quite different from the behavior for the horizontal propagation case. However, under the same condition (i. e. the zenith angle is not large enough), the on-axis scintillation index still approaches an asymptotical value, which increases as the zenith angle increases, and depends on the obscure ratio of annular beams. Furthermore, the relation of the on-axis scintillation index between annular beams and flat-topped beams is also examined in this paper. It is shown that their relation will change as the zenith angle changes.

However, despite several interesting applications, only little quantitative research has been conducted on the temperature uniformity of the heating load. With water as a common inorganic solvent, a novel MCFR type based on a special ridged waveguide for heating water is studied by optimizing some parameters of micropipes in order to achieve better temperature uniformity. Compared to the original reactor, the standard deviation of the electric field decreased significantly when using the optimized reactor under the same heating conditions while the average electric field density increased. The optimized results were verified by experiments.

As Ts increases from 880 degrees C to 1040 degrees C, the ceramics are transformed from rhombohedral to tetragonal structure and a MPB is formed at T-s =1000 degrees C and t(s) = 2 h. The increase in T-s greatly improves the densification, electric insulation, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of the ceramics, while relatively weak dependences on t(s) are observed. As T-s increases from 880 degrees C to 1000 degrees C, the magnetism of the ceramics is significantly enhanced and the values of M-r are increased by similar to 400%. The optimum sintering conditions of the ceramic is 1000 degrees C/2 h, in which high density, good electric insulation and enhanced ferroelectricity (P-r= 18.4 mu C/cm(2)), piezoelectricity (d(33) = 140 pC/N, k(p) = 31.4%) and ferromagnetism (M-r = 0.099 emu/g) are simultaneously obtained.

The relative mean-squared beam width wR, the beta parameter and the energy Strehl ratio (SRE) are adopted to characterize the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability which defined by a certain energy and the energy within a given bucket radius, respectively. It is shown that, in general, the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability is large for thick annular beams, and is small for thin annular beams. However, it is found out that the laws of w(R), beta parameter and SRE versus the obscure ratio beta of annular beams are quite different, i.e., w(R) decreases monotonically as epsilon increases, while changes of beta parameter and SRE versus epsilon are not monotonic. There exists a maximum of beta for thick annular beams, and there exists a minimum of beta for thin annular beams. But there only exists a maximum of SRE for thin annular beams. The values of epsilon at which beta reaches its maximum or minimum and SRE reaches its maximum are nearly independent of the zenith angle of the slanted path. In practice, the minimum of beta and the maximum of SRE may be used, but the maximum of beta should be avoided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This family of triads consists of two side-on pending triphenylene mesogens, acting as the electron-donating groups (D), laterally connected through short lipophilic spacers to a central perylenediimide (PI), benzo[ghi]perylenediimide (BI), or coronenediimide (CI) molecular unit, respectively, playing the role of the electron acceptor (A). All D-A-D triads self-organize to form a lamello-columnar oblique mesophase, with a highly segregated donor-acceptor (D-A) heterojunction organization, consequent to efficient molecular self-sorting. The structure consists in the regular alternation of two disrupted rows of triphenylene columns and a continuous row of diimine species. High-resolution STM images demonstrate that PI-TP2 forms stable 2D self-assembly nanostructures with some various degrees of regularity, whereas the other triads do not self-organize into ordered architectures. The electron-transport mobility of CI-TP2, measured by time-of-flight at 200 degrees C in the mesophase, is one order of magnitude higher than the hole mobility. By means of this specific molecular designing idea, we realized and demonstrated for the first time the so-called p-n heterojunction at the molecular level in which the electron-rich triphenylene columns act as the hole transient pathways, and the coronenediimide stacks form the electron-transport channels.

In this paper, a study is begun to extend these properties to commutative rings with zero divisors. A Q(0)-SM ring is defined to be a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on semiregular w-ideals and satisfies the descending chain condition on those chains of semiregular v-ideals whose intersection is semiregular.

We also show that there is a large class of domains in which Hilbert's syzygy Theorem for the w-weak global dimension does not hold.

Even when running under a reputation mechanism, such a node can still behave maliciously now and then so long as its reputation is within the acceptable level. To address this inconsistent behavior issue, a combined approach of statistic reputation and time series is proposed in this study, in which the negative binomial reputation is applied to rate the nodes' reputation and concept of time series is borrowed to analyze the reputation results. Simulations show that the proposed method can effectively counter inconsistent behavior nodes and thus improves the overall system performance.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure with the coexistence of the rhombohedral and tetragonal phase. The partial substitution of Dy3+ for Bi3+ enhanced effectively the piezoelectricity of the materials. The optimum piezoelectricity is obtained at x = 0.025, giving d(33) = 190 pC/N and k(P) = 37.2 %, respectively. After the addition of Dy3+, excellent photoluminescence of the ceramics is induced. The Dy-doped ceramics exhibit strong emissions at similar to 478 nm (blue) and similar to 575 nm (yellow), corresponding to F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) of Dy3+ transitions, respectively. The optimum photoluminescence of the ceramics is reached at x = 0.025. The ceramics with the doping of 2.5 mol% Dy3+ exhibit simultaneously good piezoelectricity, strong ferroelectricity and excellent photoluminescence, suggesting a promising application in the electro-optic devices.

Correlation of grain size, phase transition and piezoelectric properties in Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							LEAD-FREE CERAMICS; BARIUM-TITANATE CERAMICS; SINTERING TEMPERATURE; FREE PIEZOCERAMICS; COEFFICIENT; BOUNDARY; MICROSTRUCTURE; TIME; MNO2	Pb-free ceramics Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 inspired by the excellent piezoelectricity of morphotropic phase boundary deriving from a tricritical point have been prepared by a solid state reaction route and the effects of grain size and room-temperature phases of the ceramics have been studied in detail. When sintering temperature rises from 1320 to 1560 degrees C with controlling the dwell time for 2 h, the ceramic sintered at 1480 degrees C possesses the optimum piezoelectricity. We choose 1360 and 1480 degrees C as two distinctive sintering temperatures to further study the effect of dwell time on the electrical properties of the ceramics. The results show that the improved piezoelectric behavior (d(33) similar to 416 pC/N and k(p) similar to 55.8 %) is demonstrated for the Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 ceramic at an optimal sintering temperature of 1480 degrees C and dwell time of 2 h, which is attributed to the largest grain size together with more noticeable rhombohedral-tetragonal phase transition near room-temperature.

By using elementary methods, we give two equivalent conditions of all even near-perfect numbers in the form 2 alpha p(1)p(2) and 2(alpha)p(1)(2)p(2), and obtain a lot of new near-perfect numbers which involve some special kinds of prime number pairs. One kind is exactly the new Mersenne conjecture's prime number pair. Another kind has the form p(1) = 2(alpha+1) - 1 and p(2) = p(2)(1)+p(1)+1/3, where the former is a Mersenne prime and the latter's behavior is very much like a Fermat number.

Applying the semi-Markov process theory, the Cramer's rule and the Laplace (Laplace-Stieltjes) transform, several important performance measures including the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, the mean up time and the mean time between failures of the system are derived. Moreover, numerical inversion of Laplace transform is carried out to discuss the time-dependent behavior of system performance measures. In addition, a special case (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system is presented to verify the correctness of the analytical results.

A novel coordinative stochastic resonance (CSR) filtering method, which is described by an overdamped bistable dynamical system, is proposed to improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which is defined to characterize CSR in optimal FrFT domain. Simulation results show that the output SINR is effectively improved by the use of CSR filter, which is based on the underlying mechanism that interfering LFM signals cooperate with noise in part to promote particles motion periodically with larger amplitude in a symmetric double well.

Five types of WB4 are considered i.e., orthorhombic Immm, Pnnm, Pmmn, monoclinic C2/m and hexagonal P6(3)/mmc structure. Our calculations indicate that the P6(3)/mmc-4u structure of WB4 is unstable at both ambient and pressure conditions, but the other four types of WB4 are stable, in agreement with recent theoretical results. By eliminating mechanical calculations, we find that the four types (C2/m, Immm, Pnnm and Pmmn) of WB4 are potential candidates to be ultra-incompressible and hard materials. Moreover, the WB4 in C2/m type is the most ultra-incompressible among the considered structures due to its superior mechanical properties, and the P6(3)/mmc-2u structure of WB4 is not considered to be hard material because of its low hardness. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio exhibits the positive pressure dependence, and four types show brittle nature within 100 GPa.

With careful characterization of crystal structures of the as-prepared products and the phase transition as a function of temperature, the phase diagram of (1 - x) BiFeO3-xLaMnO(3) solid solution has been determined. With the increasing of x value, the crystal structure of the samples transforms from rhombohedral R3c (x <= 0.13) to tetragonal P4mm (0.14 <= x <= 0.25), cubic Pm (3) over barm (0.26 <= x <= 0.78), and finally to rhombohedral R (3) over barc (0.80 <= x <= 1.00). In situ high temperature X-ray powder diffraction (HTXRD) studies reveal that the phase transformations of rhombohedral R3c to orthorhombic Pbnm and tetragonal P4mm to orthorhombic Pbnm occur at 600-750 degrees C and 580-700 degrees C, respectively. The phase structures of cubic Pm (3) over barm and rhombohedral R (3) over barc keep unchanged at temperature below 880 degrees C. However, a second-order-like phase transition was observed at higher temperature because of the change of thermo expansion coefficient. The complete phase diagram was then drawn based on those experimental results. It can be found clearly from the phase diagram that the as-prepared (1 - x)BiFeO3-xLaMnO(3) (x = 0-1) solid solutions provided more options to tune the magnetism and multiferroism, as the crystal structures possess polarity feature at a wide doping concentration of LaMnO3 (x <= 0.25). We then selectively studied the magnetic properties of possible multiferroic phases, i.e. R3c and P4mm phases. The results revealed that the magnetic property can be greatly enhanced when doping fraction of LaMnO3 is more than 0.08 (x > 0.08). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optical-absorption data show that the perfect-crystal results are similar to the predictions from the crystal-field theory: the pressure-induced spin transition of iron in ferropericlase causes a large blue-shift in its optical-absorption spectrum, leaving the near-infrared region transparent. However, when there are point defects in ferropericlase, the calculated optical-absorption results are completely inconsistent with predictions from the crystal-field theory, the spin transition causes the enhancement in the optical absorption in the near-infrared region. Refractive-index data of defect crystal indicate that the effects of pressure, wavenumber, and spin-transition on the high-pressure refractive-index of (Mg-0.97, Fe-0.03)O ferropericlase are obvious, but perfect-crystal results show that those effects should be relatively weak. The similar to 15%-20% iron-bearing ferropericlase is currently considered as an important mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. Due to similar characteristics of the observed high-pressure optical-absorption spectrum in ferropericlase with different iron content, we suggest that: (1) the above-mentioned calculated results is conducive to the understanding of high-pressure optical properties of lower-mantle ferropericlase and the exploring of the origin of discrepancies in its high-pressure optical-absorption spectrum between experiment and crystal-field theory; (2) the high-pressure optical-absorption spectrum measurements may be a good approach for probing iron spin state.

Here, we investigate the dynamics of a skyrmion driven by a spin wave in a magnetic nanowire. It is found that (i) the skyrmion is first accelerated and then decelerated exponentially; (ii) it can turn L-corners with both right and left turns; and (iii) it always turns left (right) when the skyrmion number is positive (negative) in the T-and Y-junctions. Our results will be the basis of skyrmionic devices driven by a spin wave.

The effects of the nonlinear media on the entanglement have been analyzed. It is shown that the Kerr nonlinear medium makes the perfect entanglement in some discrete frequency regions. Furthermore, when the input vacuum field is squeezed, the frequency range for producing the entanglement can be effectively extended and the reachable maximal entanglement can be enhanced by the Kerr nonlinear medium, while the OPA medium reduces the degree of the entanglement and necks the frequency range for generating the entanglement. These results suggest that nonlinear media could serve as a new handle to coherently control the entanglement between the vibrational modes of the micromirrors in the optomechanical cavity system.

As a "smart" ecosystem, smart cities focus on sustainable growth, efficiency, productivity and environmentally friendly development. By comparing with the European Union, North America and other countries, smart cities in China are still in the preliminary stage. This study offers a comparative analysis of ten smart cities in China on the basis of an extensive database covering two time periods: 2005-2007 and 2008-2010. The unsupervised computational neural network self-organizing map (SOM) analysis is adopted to map out the various cities based on their performance. The demonstration effect and mutual influences between these ten smart cities are also discussed by using social network analysis. Based on the smart city performance and cluster network, current problems for smart city development in China were pointed out. Future research directions for smart city research are discussed at the end this paper.

The ceramics possess a single phase perovskite structure. The grain growth of the ceramics is prohibited and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition at T-C becomes more diffusive after the addition of Dy2O3. Dy2O3 doping improves the piezoelectricity of the ceramics and the optimal piezoelectric properties d(33) = 335 pC/N is obtained at x = 0.5. The addition of 2 mol% Dy enhances the photoluminescent properties of the ceramics and strong emissions at similar to 478 nm and similar to 575 nm are observed. Our study shows that the ceramics with low Dy2O3 levels exhibit simultaneously the strong piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity and photoluminescence and may have a potential application in mechano-electro-optic integration and coupling device.

High power density NaNbO3-LiTaO3 lead-free piezoelectric transformer in radial vibration modes	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						NN-based; ceramic; transformer; lead-free; disk-shaped; high power density	SINTERING TEMPERATURE; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; FREE CERAMICS; GRAIN-GROWTH; MICROSTRUCTURE; TITANATE; LIQUID; RATIO	In the present work, the sintering temperature was able to substantially influence the microstructure and electrical properties of the lead-free ceramic 0.88NaNbO(3)-0.12LiTaO(3). This composition without any acceptor doping presents a high mechanical quality factor, Q(m), value of 1469 and a high Curie temperature of 305 degrees C by optimizing the sintering temperature at 1330 degrees C. We applied this material to make a device of disk-shaped piezoelectric transformers with a ring-dot structure and further focused on investigating the characteristics of the piezoelectric transformers. With matching load, a maximum efficiency of 92% occurs in the fundamental mode, and the maximum voltage gains are 5.5 and 3.7 for the fundamental and third radial vibration modes, respectively. The experimental results show a maximum output power of 10.5 W with a temperature rise of 27 degrees C. It is noteworthy that a high output power density (as high as 32.8 W cm(-3)) was obtained under a maximum input voltage of 180 V, which is comparable to the performance of PZT in a piezoelectric ceramic transformer device.

The objective power system problems to be solved, e.g., power and load fluctuations, are transformed into equivalent energy exchange demanding values for the superconducting coil used in a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device. With the model, the buffering effects for the external power and load fluctuations and the superconducting properties of the superconducting coil itself can be obtained equivalently for optimizing and evaluating the designed SMES device. Four coil-current-dependent formulas are derived to estimate the hysteresis loss, coupling current loss, eddy current loss, and flux flow loss of the superconducting coil under different energy exchange operation conditions. A case study has been carried out using a Bi-2223 coil. The obtained results verify the effectiveness of the SMEE model and its feasibility for practical applications.

J	Wang, FG; Kim, H				Wang, Fanggui; Kim, Hwankoo			Two generalizations of projective modules and their applications	JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED ALGEBRA			English	Article							STRONG MORI DOMAINS; MULTIPLICATION DOMAINS; INJECTIVE-MODULES; INTEGRAL-DOMAINS; FINITE FRACTIONS; W-MODULES; RINGS; IDEAL	Let R be a commutative ring, M be an R-module, and w be the so-called w-operation on R. Set G(w) = {f is an element of R[X] vertical bar c(f)(w) = R}, where c(f) denotes the content of f. Let R{X} = R[X]G(w) and M{X} = M[X]G(w) be the w-Nagata ring of R and the w-Nagata module of M respectively. Then we introduce and study two concepts of w-projective modules and w-invertible modules, which both generalize projective modules. To do so, we use two main methods of which one is to localize at maximal w-ideals of R and the other is to utilize w-Nagata modules over w-Nagata rings. In particular, it is shown that an R-module M is w-projective of finite type if and only if M{X} is finitely generated projective over R{X}; M is w-invertible if and only if M{X} is invertible over R{X}. As applications, it is shown that R is semisimple if and only if every R-module is w-projective and that, in a Q(0)-PVMR, every finite type semi-regular module is w-projective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The role of the unusually ordered hydrogen ions are carefully analyzed. The hydrogen ions break the crystal symmetry to change the degeneracy of the V t(2g) orbit, thus inducing magnetic transitions from the paramagnetism of parent oxides to the antiferromagnetism of oxyhydride. The low dimension behaviors would been expected because of the nonbonding nature between the V t(2g) and H s orbitals due to symmetry. Moreover, our results indicate that the direct hoppings of the nearest neighboring two V t(2g) orbitals and the indirect hoppings mediated by Sr ions should be essential to understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of the perovskite oxyhydride.

Structural, elastic, and thermodynamic properties of hexagonal molybdenum nitrides under high pressure from first principles	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Elastic constants; Debye temperature; Expansion coefficients; delta-MoN	TRANSITION-METAL NITRIDES; DELTA-MON; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURES; CONSTANTS; FILMS; NITRIDATION; CRYSTALS; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; MONONITRIDES	The structural and elastic properties of hexagonal molybdenum nitrides (delta-MoN) at high pressure were investigated through the first-principles calculation using local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation within the plane-wave pseudopotential density functional theory. The obtained equilibrium structure and mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with other experimental and theoretical results. Then we compared the elastic modulus of delta-MoN. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that delta-MoN is stable in our calculations (0-100 GPa). The calculated B/G ratios indicate that delta(1)-MoN (space group of P-6m2, No. 187) possesses brittle nature within 100 GPa, but delta(3)-MoN (space group of P63mc, No. 186) possesses brittle nature below 46.7 GPa and it begins to prone to ductility when the pressure increases to 46.7 GPa. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of delta-MoN. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, K.; Dong, B.; Zhou, X.

J	Wu, SQ; Fang, DK; Zhao, GP				Wu Shao-Quan; Fang Dong-Kai; Zhao Guo-Ping			Effect of electronic correlations on magnetotransport through a parallel double quantum dot	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						parallel double quantum dot; electronic correlations; master equation method; negative differential conductance and negative tunnel magetoresistance	SCATTERING-THEORY; KONDO; CONDUCTORS; NOISE	We theoretically investigate the effects of electronic correlations (including spin and Coulomb correlations) on the magnetotransport through a parallel double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Two dots couple coherently through electron correlations, rather than tunneling directly between two dots, and each dot is coupled to two semi-infinite ferromagnetic leads. We assume that the intradot Coulomb repulsion is much larger than the interdot Coulomb repulsion U. Thus, only the zero, one and two-particle DQD states are relevant to transport. Because of interdot electron correlation, the I-V characteristics of each dot is sensitive to the change in the state of the other dot. This work focuses on the effects of electron spin correlation and electron Coulomb correlation on magnetotransport through this system. In order to determine the transport properties of the system, we use the generalized master equation method. This method is based on the reduced density operator defined by averaging the statistical operator of the total system over the states of all leads. With the framework of the generalized master equation and the sequential tunneling approximation, we calculate the current, differential conductance and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) in the dot 1 as a function of bias for different spin correlations and Coulomb correlations. Our results reveal that the magnetotransport through this system is more sensitive to Coulomb correlation than to spin correlation; when Coulomb correlation equals zero, the spin correlation can induce a giant tunnel magnetoresistance, which is further larger than the Julliere's value of TMR; when Coulomb correlation occurs, the giant tunnel magnetoresistance disappears; when Coulomb correlation is equal to or larger than spin correlation, Coulomb correlation can suppress spin correlation; while the coexistence of Coulomb correlation and asymmetry of the DQD system can result in dynamical channel blockade, which can lead to the occurrence of negative tunnel magetoresistance and negative differential conductance. These novel properties lead to the potential applications in nanoelectronics, and relevant underlying physics of this problem is discussed.

All the reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were optimized with B3LYP method at 6-311+G (d, p) basis set (the LanL2DZ basis set was used for Ag atom). Transition states and intermediates have been confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reactions coordinate (IRC). In addition, nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analyze orbital interactions and bond natures. Consistent with the conclusions reported in the literature, the core of obtaining the production of azobenzene according to the coupling reaction of PATP absorbed on Ag-5 clusters is the elimination of two H atoms. Meanwhile, we find that the effect of illumination in that reaction matters a lot. We also found in PATP molecular that the synergistic catalytic effect of S end absorbed on the catalyzer draws dramatically evident under no illumination conditions, while it draws less obvious under light. According to the paper's conclusion, PATP absorbed on the surface of Ag-5 tends to generate azobenzene easily.

Although temporal adjustment of multiple audiovisual stimuli has been recently demonstrated to be spatially specific, perceptual grouping processes that organize separate audiovisual stimuli into distinctive "objects" may play a more important role in forming the basis for subsequent multiple temporal recalibrations. We investigated whether apparent physical differences between audiovisual pairs that make them distinct from each other can independently drive multiple concurrent temporal recalibrations regardless of spatial overlap. Experiment 1 verified that reducing the physical difference between two audiovisual pairs diminishes the multiple temporal recalibrations by exposing observers to two utterances with opposing temporal relationships spoken by one single speaker rather than two distinct speakers at the same location. Experiment 2 found that increasing the physical difference between two stimuli pairs can promote multiple temporal recalibrations by complicating their non-temporal dimensions (e.g., disks composed of two rather than one attribute and tones generated by multiplying two frequencies); however, these recalibration aftereffects were subtle. Experiment 3 further revealed that making the two audiovisual pairs differ in temporal structures (one transient and one gradual) was sufficient to drive concurrent temporal recalibration. These results confirm that the more audiovisual pairs physically differ, especially in temporal profile, the more likely multiple temporal perception adjustments will be content-constrained regardless of spatial overlap. These results indicate that multiple temporal recalibrations are based secondarily on the outcome of perceptual grouping processes.

Excluding the five species, three cryptic species (U. sp. 1, U. sp. 2 and U. sp. 3) and two putative species, U.nivatus and U.atronates, are recognized. The phylogenetic relationships among the species remain unclear and these preclude investigations of their potential adaptations for living in high altitudes. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNA genomes of three species of Asiatic shrewlike moles (U.aequodonenia, U.andersoni and U.nivatus). Phylogenetic analyses of 16 published and our de novo mitogenomes yield single, robust trees with the relationships being (U.soricipes (U. sp. 1 (U.nivatus (U.andersoni, U.aequodonenia)))). Further, the tree verifies the validity of recently described U.aequodonenia. Analyses of selection pressure suggest that the 13 mtDNA-encoding genes of species in the genus Uropsilus all have experienced strong purifying selection, although ATP8 accumulated a higher ratio of non-synonymous substitutions than the other loci, which might reflect adaptation of the genus Uropsilus to different environments/elevations.

By means of the slave-boson mean-held approximation, we calculate the linear conductance and the transmission in the Rondo regime at zero temperature. The obtained results show that both the linear conductance and transmission probability are quite sensitive to the spin-flip strength when the DQD structure is changed among the serial, parallel and T-shaped. It is suggested that such a theoretical model can be used to study the physical phenomenon related to the spin manipulation transport. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Org. Chem. 2001, 66, 1163) found that the reaction depends strongly on the medium; and the fastest rate constant was observed in pure acetone. The present work tries to explore why acetone can enhance the reactivity of the title reactions. Accordingly we make a mechanistic study on the reactions of sodium p-nitrophenoxide with halomethanes (CH3X, X = Cl, Br, I) in acetone by using a supramolecular/continuum model at the PCM-MP2/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311-04+G(d,p) level, in which the ion pair nucleophile is microsolvated by one to three acetone molecules. We compared the reactivity of the microsolvated ion pair nucleophiles with solvent-free ion pair and anionic ones Our results clearly reveal that the microsolvated ion pair nucleophile is favorable for the S(N)2 reactions; meanwhile, the origin of the enhanced reactivity induced by microsolvation of the nucleophile is discussed in terms of the geometries of transition state (TS) structures and activation Strain model, suggesting that lower deformation energies and stronger interaction energies between the deformed reactants in the TS lead to the lower overall reaction barriers for the S(N)2 reaction of microsolvated sodium p-nitrophenoxide toward halomethanes in acetone.

Using a full quantum theory of photon transport in real space, it is shown that the Rabi splittings of the photonic transmission spectra can be controlled by the cavity-mirror couplings; the splittings could still be observed even when the cavity-atom system works in the weak coupling regime, and the transmission probability of the resonant photon can be modulated from 0 to 100%. Additionally, our numerical results show that the appearance of Fano resonance is related to the strengths of the cavity-mirror coupling and the dissipations of the system. An experimental demonstration of the proposal with the current photonic crystal waveguide technique is suggested.

However, little is known about the influence of individual alerting efficiency on perceived duration. In this study, we explored this question by running two experiments. The Attentional Networks Test was used to evaluate individual differences in alerting efficiency in each experiment. Temporal bisection (Experiment 1) and time generalization task (Experiment 2) were used to explore the participants' perception of duration. The results indicated that subjects in the high alerting efficiency group overestimated interval durations and estimated durations more accurately compared with subjects in the low alerting efficiency group. The two experiments showed that the sensitivity of time was not influenced by individual alerting efficiency. Based on previous studies and current findings, we infer that individual differences in alerting efficiency may influence time perception through modulating the latency of the attention controlled switch and the speed of the peacemaker within the framework of the internal clock model.

The S-ONUs are primarily selected to communicate with the M-ONU and, second, with the remote node (RN), which can reduce the usage of high-power ports at the RN and subsequently decrease energy consumption. It is demonstrated that obvious energy-saving effects can be achieved, and moreover, the energy-saving efficiency can be further improved by expanding the capacity of the links between RN and M-ONUs and properly selecting the scale of the ONU group.

Our result shows that the value of the solution can be determined uniquely by means of its value on an arbitrary open subdomain of G at any given positive time constant. Further, when G is convex and bounded, we also give a quantitative version of the unique continuation property. As applications, we get an observability estimate for stochastic heat equations, an approximate result and a null controllability result for a backward stochastic heat equation.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			An expanded double-quantitative model regarding probabilities and grades and its hierarchical double-quantitative attribute reduction	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Decision-theoretic rough set; Graded rough set; Double quantification; Granular computing; Attribute reduction	ROUGH SET MODEL; PRECISION; CLASSIFICATION; DECISIONS	Probabilities and grades serve as relative and absolute measures, respectively. They are used to establish the decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) and graded rough set (GRS) two basic quantitative models. The double-quantification of probabilities and grades exhibits systematicness and completeness in view of the two-dimensional feature of the approximate space; however, double-quantitative construction becomes a problem, and double-quantitative reduction is rarely reported. Thus, this paper mainly constructs an expanded double-quantitative model by logically integrating probabilities and grades; it further studies relevant double-quantitative reduction by hierarchically preserving specific regions. (1) First, a novel model is established via the logic integration and expansion requirement, and its regional system and granular hierarchy are studied via granular computing. Thus, regional semantics is extracted via basic semantics granules. Regional calculation is realized by two algorithms, and the algorithm regarding calculation granules exhibits optimization according to algorithm analyses. (2) Second, three types of model-regional preservation reducts and their hierarchy are discussed in the two-category case. Thus, SRP-Reduct, CRP-Reduct, and APP-Reduct are studied by exploring four-region preservation properties, constructing two-region classification regions, and preserving four original approximations, respectively. Furthermore, a relevant reduction hierarchy is thoroughly achieved. (3) Moreover, the model and its reduction are illustrated by two examples of decision tables. The constructional model conducts double-quantification regarding probabilities and grades; thus, it exhibits double-quantitative semantics and benignly expands DTRS-Model, GRS-Model, and Pawlak-Model. Furthermore, its hierarchical reduction reflects some double-quantitative reduction essence; thus, its reduction expands qualitative Pawlak-Reduction while guides quantitative DTRS-Reduction and GRS-Reduction.

These hybrid composites models were characterized by mean square displacement, radial distribution function, temperature-volume behavior and Xray diffraction at molecular level. The result shows: as TSP-PUSS loading is lower than 12. 11 wt%, the mobility of the polymer chains is enhanced apparently due to the humping open cage structure of TSP-PUSS which increases the average distance between the polymer chains; as TSP-PUSS loading is higher than 12. 11 wt%, TSP-POSS self-reunites and crystalline clusters are formed which lead to restricting the motion of the polymer chains. According to temperature-volume behavior analysis, the introduction of TSP-PUSS can significantly increase the glass transition temperature of polyurethane hybrid composites and thus, the introduction of TSP-PUSS is supposed to improve the hybrid composite' s thermal stability with reasonable concentration in application.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article							ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES; ESSENTIAL OILS; FRUIT JUICES; IN-VITRO; PLANTS	Urena lobata has been used as a traditional medicinal plant in India and China. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity and isolated the active compound from the leaves of U. lobata. The 80% ethanol extract from U. lobata leaves showed an effective anti-yeast activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) strains. Using a combination of chromatographic methods, (-)-trachelogenin (1) and clematoside-S (2) were isolated from this plant for the first time, and their chemical structure was identified by mass spectrometry (MS) and extensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data analysis. In addition, 1 was found to be inactive against all of the test microorganisms in the antimicrobial assay, whereas 2 exhibits a specific anti-yeast activity against S. cerevisiae strains with diameter of inhibition zones in the range from 11 to 20 mm. Furthermore, the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) values of 2 against S. cerevisiae strains were detected to be in the ranges of 0.61 to 9.8 mu g/mL and 2.42 to 9.8 mu g/mL, respectively. This is the first report of 2 with a specific anti-yeast activity. The above result suggests the potential application of U. lobata to be used as a natural anti-yeast agent in food preservation.

Hysteresis Loops, Critical Fields and Energy Products for Exchange-spring Hard/soft/hard Trilayers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETICS			English	Article						hard/soft trilayers; hysteresis loops; energy products; micromagnetic calculation	MAGNETS; NUCLEATION; COERCIVITY; FILMS	Macroscopic hysteresis loops and microscopic magnetic moment distributions have been determined by a three-dimensional (3D) model for exchange-coupled Sm-Co/alpha-Fe/Sm-Co trilayers with in-plane collinear easy axes. These results are carefully compared with the popular one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic models and recent experimental data. It is found that the results obtained from the two methods match very well, especially for the remanence and coercivity, justifying the calculations. Both nucleation and coercive fields decrease monotonically as the soft layer thickness L-S increases while the largest maximum energy product (roughly 50 MGOe) occurs when the thicknesses of hard and soft layers are 5 nm and 15 nm, respectively. Moreover, the calculated angular distributions in the thickness direction for the magnetic moments are similar. Nevertheless, the calculated nucleation and pinning fields as well as the energy products by 3D OOMMF are systematically smaller than those given by the 1D model, due mainly to the stray fields at the corners of the films. These demagnetization fields help the magnetic moments at the corners to deviate from the previous saturation state and facilitate the nucleation. Such an effect enhances as LS increases. When the thicknesses of hard and soft layers are 10 nm and 20 nm, respectively, the pinning field difference is as large as 30%, while the nucleation fields have opposite signs,	[Chen, B.

However, the way topography shapes genetic structures and demographic histories of endemic species has not been well studied. We examined the phylogeo-graphic pattern and demographic histories of Sorex bedfordiae, a dispersal-limited small mammal, using three nuclear genes [1977 bp] and two mitochondrial genes [1794 bp] with comprehensive molecular approaches. We recovered five well-supported clades whose distributions are along mountain ridges and roughly subdivided by large rivers. Demographic expansions in the middle Pleistocene were strongly supported by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Our results support the hypothesis that sky island topography and river systems strongly affect the genetic structure of non-aquatic terrestrial species. We further clarify that S. bedfordiae and S. cylindricauda are valid sibling species, whereas S. excelsus is most likely a geographic subspecies of S. bedfordiae. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of Al doping and sintering temperature on microstructure, piezoelectricity and magnetism of the ceramics were studied. The crystalline structures of BFO-BT-BA-x ceramics sintered at 970 degrees C for 2 h evolve from rhombohedral structure at x = 0 to the coexistence of rhombohedral structure and orthorhombic phases at x = 0.01-0.03 and finally to orthorhombic phases at x> 0.03. The critical sintering temperature is 970 degrees C. For the ceramics with x = 0.01 sintered at/above 970 degrees C, large grains, good densification, high resistivity, and enhanced ferromagnetic properties are obtained. The ceramic with x = 0.01 sintered at 970 8C possesses high resistivity (similar to 10(9) Omega cm) and good piezoelectric properties (d(33) = 138 pCN(-1), k(p) = 32.7%). Al doping decreases the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics, while the increase in the sintering temperature enhances the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics.

Each leader has a constrained correspondence. By using a collective fixed point theorem in locally FC-uniform spaces due to author, some existence theorems of equilibrium points for the multi-leader-follower generalized constrained multiobjective games are established under nonconvex settings. These results generalize some corresponding results in recent literature.

The configurations of the best sites, the adsorption energies in the best sites and the electronic structures of stable adsorption models, including DOS, PDOS, electron density map, mulliken charge properties of DNA bases and B atom before and after adsorption on pristine and B-doped SWCNTs have been investigated. And the frontier orbital energy gap and charge transfer of DNA bases adsorption on pristine and B-doped SWCNTs have been also investigated. The results indicated that the best adsorption site of DNA base adsorption on pristine and B-doped SWCNTs was on the top of carbon and B atoms. The bases A, G were adsorbed on pure SWCNT by weak interaction, the bases T, C were adsorbed on pure SWCNT by strong chemical interaction. The bases A, T, C, G were adsorbed on B-doped SWCNT by chemical interaction. After B doping, the structure of the SWCNT was not distorted, however, the local electronic structure was modified. The frontier orbital energy gap of SWCNT could be effectively reduced by B doping. Moreover, the electronic reactivity with the DNA bases of SWCNT were enhanced by B doping. The DNA bases on the surface of B-doped SWCNT could be modified by Chemical adsorption. This method for the modification of DNA bases on B-doped SWCNT surface has great potential for the construction of DNA bio-sensors of biorecognition interfaces.

The tunability is controlled by the thickness ratio of MoS2 versus WSe2 of the superlattice. When this ratio goes from 152 to 551, the dominant K-K direct bandgap is continuously tuned from 0.14 eV to 0.5 eV. The gap stays direct against -0.6% to 2% in-layer strain and up to -4.3% normal-layer compressive strain. The valance and conduction bands are spatially separated. These robust properties suggest that MoS2 and WSe2 multilayer superlattice should be a promising material for infrared optoelectronics.

The magnetic hyperthermia properties of the nanodisc and isotropic nanoparticles are investigated systematically. The results suggest that the nanodisc shows much higher specific absorption rate (SAR) than isotropic nanoparticles. This is attributed to the parallel alignment of nanodisc with respect to the alternating current magnetic field, which is confirmed by good agreement between experimental results and micromagnetic simulation. It is found that such parallel alignment could enhance the SAR value by a factor of approximate to 2 with respect to the randomly oriented case. The above results indicate that the nanodisc provides an excellent thermal seed for magnetic hyperthermia. This study sheds the light on the magnetic hyperthermia mechanism of magnetic nanodisc and it also opens the window to explore high efficiency thermal seeds by controlling the orientation of magnetic nanostructures.

In this paper, a new heating model of multiple tube structure is proposed and the relevant simulations and experiments of heating water were performed based on the computational platform COMSOL Multi-physics software in order to achieve the better temperature uniformity and heating efficiency. Besides, the influence of the instability of microwave ovens on the heating performances of the optimal heating models was analyzed. The simulation results show that the heating uniformity and efficiency of water in optimal six tube structure increased by 7.1% and 68.5% (30 mL), 9.2% and 61% (60 mL) respectively compared with the optimal single tube structure. Moreover, the heating performances of the optimal heating models do not change obviously, while the working frequency and power change slightly. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experiment data.

NBO analysis was applied to investigate the atomic natural charge and stabilization interaction energies among molecules. The results showed that the reaction initially proceeds through the loss of the linearity of the azido group and the approaching of the terminal nitrogen atom of the azide group to the nitrogen atom of the ring. This is followed by an attack of the lone pairs on N atoms in the ring to the azido group, leading to the formation of the N-N bonds. Many factors, including bending of the bond angle, electrostatic attraction, orbital delocalization and the stabilization interaction give rise to a large free energy barrier for the cyclization process. The results also show that the second and third cyclization is relatively easier than the first one.

All the ceramics possess perovskite structure and exhibit good insulation and densification. A morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at x = 0.02. As the concentration of La3+ is increased, the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of the ceramics at Curie temperature becomes gradually more diffusive. A small amount of the substitution of La3+ for Bi3+ improves effectively the ferroelectricity of the ceramics and the optimum remanent polarization of 27.2 mu m/cm(2) reaches at x = 0.04. After the addition of La3+, the ferromagnetism of the ceramics is greatly enhanced and the remanent magnetization M-r monotonously increases from 0.0321 to 0.147 emu/g with x increasing from 0 to 0.10. Our results show that the ceramics possess simultaneously improved ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties and may a promising candidate for room-temperature multiferroic materials.

In contrast to the majority of Internet worms, it is by exploiting users' legitimate activities instead of vulnerabilities of networks in which P2P passive worms propagate. This feature evidently slows down their propagation, which results in them not attracting an adequate amount of attention in literature. Meanwhile, this feature visibly increases the difficulty of detecting them, which makes it very possible for them to become epidemic. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for P2P passive worm propagation by adopting epidemiological approaches so as to identify their behaviors and predict the tendency of their propagation accurately. Compared with a few existing models, dynamic characteristics of P2P networks are taken into account. Based on this proposed model, the sufficient condition for the global stability of the worm free equilibrium is derived by applying epidemiological theories. Large scale simulation experiments have validated both the proposed model and the condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This chart is an adaptive one and has a variable sampling interval, which makes it more efficient. Further, it is a self-starting scheme and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages. The choice of the chart parameters is studied, and a simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also efficiently detects various magnitudes of shifts. An illustrative example is given to introduce the implementation of this proposed control chart. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The fluorescence of BSA-AuNCs was found to be quenched effectively by the free chlorine, and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of BSA-AuNCs allowed the sensitive detection of free chlorine in the range of 0.8-800 mu M. The detection limit is 0.50 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The present fluorescent assay for free chlorine possesses low detection limit, wide linear range and good selectivity. Real tap water samples were analyzed with satisfactory results, which suggested its potential for water quality analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Boundedness; Global smoothness; Iterative root; Oscillation	EQUATION	A crisis in the smoothness of iterative roots appears at fixed points. The local C-r smoothness of iterative roots near a hyperbolic fixed point is well known, but its global C-r extension to both fixed points is generically impossible because of their violent oscillation near the next hyperbolic fixed point. In this study, we consider how violently these smooth iterative roots oscillate. We prove that their first order derivatives are bounded but their r-th (r >= 2) order derivatives are generically unbounded. In addition, we prove that the global C-1 smoothness is of vital significance for the global higher order derivatives. As a corollary, we show that iterative roots on the maximal interval oscillate with C-1 boundedness but C-r (r >= 2) unboundedness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, JH; Chang, HR; Xiao, D				Zhou, Jianhui; Chang, Hao-Ran; Xiao, Di			Plasmon mode as a detection of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article								Weyl semimetals are one kind of three-dimensional gapless semimetal with nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals manifests as a charge imbalance between the Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities induced by parallel electric and magnetic fields. We investigate the chiral anomaly effect on the plasmon mode in both intrinsic and dopedWeyl semimetals within the random phase approximation. We prove that the chiral anomaly gives rise to a different plasmon mode in intrinsic Weyl semimetals. We also find the chiral anomaly leads to some exotic properties in the plasmon dispersion in doped Weyl semimetals. Consequently, the unconventional plasmon mode acts as a signature of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals, by which the spectrum of plasmon provides a proper way to detect the Lifshitz transition.

Skyrmion-skyrmion and skyrmion-edge repulsions in skyrmion-based racetrack memory	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MAGNETIC SKYRMIONS; DOMAIN-WALLS; MOTION; DYNAMICS; LATTICE; MNSI; LITHOGRAPHY; NANOWIRES; TORQUES; STATES	Magnetic skyrmions are promising for building next-generation magnetic memories and spintronic devices due to their stability, small size and the extremely low currents needed to move them. In particular, skyrmion-based racetrack memory is attractive for information technology, where skyrmions are used to store information as data bits instead of traditional domain walls. Here we numerically demonstrate the impacts of skyrmion-skyrmion and skyrmion-edge repulsions on the feasibility of skyrmion-based racetrack memory. The reliable and practicable spacing between consecutive skyrmionic bits on the racetrack as well as the ability to adjust it are investigated. Clogging of skyrmionic bits is found at the end of the racetrack, leading to the reduction of skyrmion size. Further, we demonstrate an effective and simple method to avoid the clogging of skyrmionic bits, which ensures the elimination of skyrmionic bits beyond the reading element. Our results give guidance for the design and development of future skyrmion-based racetrack memory.	[Zhang, Xichao; Zhao, G. P.; Xia, J.; Morvan, F.

In addition, the effects of insulation location and life-cycle cost analysis (LCC) model on optimum insulation thickness are also investigated. The research is performed for four cities in hot summer and cold winter zone in China. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) is selected as the insulation material. A FORTRAN code developed by an implicit finite difference method is applied to calculate yearly cooling and heating transmission loads. A LCC method, which is according with the reality, is applied to determine optimum insulation thickness. Results show that insulation location almost has no effect on total yearly transmission load while natural ventilation plays a significant role in reducing the yearly cooling transmission load for all orientation walls. Moreover, it is found that natural ventilation results in obvious decrease of optimum insulation thickness and different LCC models lead to significant distinction in optimum insulation thickness. Research indicates that the effect of orientation on optimum insulation thickness cannot be ignored. At last, a sensitivity analysis on optimum insulation thickness is carried out and the results show that insulation price is the most sensitive factor.

These materials have been synthesized in good yields by the Cu-catalyzed coupling cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC) between 1,3,5,-tris(2-trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene and three equivalents of the appropriate discogen bearing a pending terminated-azide alkyl substituent. The molecular structures of the discotic oligomers, thereof consisting of three lateral triphenylenes linked together by various soft methylene spacers to a central 1,3,5-tris(triazolyl)benzene, have been fully characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, and their purity confirmed by elemental analysis. Their thermal and liquid crystalline supramolecular organization behaviours have been studied by combining polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. These investigations showed that only the two oligomers with short spacers display a hexagonal columnar mesophase, while those with long spacer are not mesomorphic. Scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that one of the mesomorphic oligomer self-assembles on a solid/liquid interface into a well ordered two-dimensional architecture that closely resembles to the proposed bulk mesomorphic supramolecular organization deduced from X-ray measurements. Furthermore, columnar mesophases have been induced in the corresponding hydrogen-bonded supramolecular complexes obtained by reaction of one of the nonmesogenic oligomeric derivative with various simple acids, e.g. hexanoic, benzoic, and 4-hexyloxybenzoic acids, respectively, in molar ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The optical properties of these D-A dyads have been studied by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescent emission.

In this work, new lead-free multifunctional ceramics of Ca1-x(LiHo)(x/2)Bi4Ti4O15 were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The great multi-improvement in ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity, down/up-conversion luminescence and temperature stability of the multifunctional properties is induced by the partial substitution of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) for Ca2+ ions in CaBi4Ti4O15. All the ceramics possess a bismuth-layer structure, and the crystal structure of the ceramics is changed from a four layered bismuth-layer structure to a three-layered structure with the level of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) increasing. The ceramic with x = 0.1 exhibits simultaneously, high resistivity (R = 4.51 x 10(11) Omega cm), good piezoelectricity (d(33) = 10.2 pC N-1), high Curie temperature (T-C = 814 degrees C), strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 9.03 mu C cm(-2)) and enhanced luminescence. These behaviours are greatly associated with the contribution of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) in the ceramics. Under the excitation of 451 nm light, the ceramic with x = 0.1 exhibits a strong green emission peak centered at 545 nm, corresponding to the transition of the S-5(2) -> I-5(8) level in Ho3+ ions, while a strong red up-conversion emission band located at 660 nm is observed under the near-infrared excitation of 980 nm at room temperature, arising from the transition of F-5(5) -> I-5(8) levels in Ho3+ ions. Surprisingly, the excellent temperature stability of ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity/luminescence and superior water-resistance behaviors of piezoelectricity/luminescence are also obtained in the ceramic with x = 0.1. Our study suggests that the present ceramics may have potential applications in advanced multifunctional devices at high temperature.

It was found that among the three polysaccharides, Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) exhibits the best scavenging activity. Polysaccharide loaded collagen membranes were prepared by mixing LBP with collagen, starch, glycerol, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and glutaraldehyde. In vitro drug release from membranes was evaluated. With increasing the immersion time, the release rate first increases and then slows down. Meanwhile, the scavenging activity to DPPH radicals exhibits similar variation, in agreement with a good release effect of the membrane. The optimal formulation of collagen membrane and preparation parameters were obtained considering the overall properties and the scavenging activity to radicals.

The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with rGO-coated separator exhibits much smaller impedance and much better electrochemical performance. After coated rGO, the initial discharge capacity can be as large as 1067 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C which can retain 878 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, and the discharge capacity can reach 710 mAh g-1 even at 2 C. The significant performance enhancement can be attributed to the bi-functionality of rGO; the rGO coating layer has unique porous structure, high conductivity and various kinds of functional groups, which can not only effectively prevent the diffusion of polysulfide through the separator, but also significantly increase the conducting surface between cathode and separator. It is promising to use rGO-based slurry to continuously produce large-scale, low-cost, and bi-functional rGO coated separator for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The evolutionary mechanisms of the micro-topography and microstructure of the samples have been proposed, and the fluorescence and decay properties of the samples have been investigated. It was found that the fluorescence intensity of the sample has been greatly enhanced after addition of an opportune amount of Bi3+. The optimum concentrations of Eu3+ and Bi3+ for fluorescence are x = 0.125 and y = 0.5%, respectively.

Using supplementary variable technique and embedded Markov chain method, the queue-length distribution solution in the form of formula at arbitrary epoch is obtained. Some performance measures associated with operating cost are also discussed based on the obtained queue-length distribution. Then, several numerical experiments follow to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained formulae. Finally, a state-dependent operating cost function is constructed to model an express logistics service center. Regarding the service rate during working vacation as a control variable, the optimization analysis on the cost function is carried out by using parabolic method.

Photophysical and magneto-electroluminescence (MEL) characterization results revealed that NA-TNA could harvest triplet excitons via a triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) process in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to the presence of a lower-lying triplet excited state with (3)pi pi* character. Consequently, using NA-TNA as a guest compound and CzPhONI, another ICT-featured naphthalimide derivative with triplet fusion delayed fluorescence (TFDF) character as host material, a high-performance orange OLED with 6 wt% NA-TNA doped CzPhONI film as the emitting layer was acquired. The maximum current efficiency (LEmax), brightness (L-max), and external quantum yield (EQE(max)) of this OLED is 7.73 cd A(-1), 31940 cd m(-2) and 5.83%, respectively, while the theoretical EQE(max) of this device should not exceed 3.34%. On the contrary, the reference device with a NA-TNA doping level of 1.4 wt% showed much inferior performance, with a LEmax, a L-max, and an EQE(max) of 3.19 cd A(-1), 24 900 cd m(-2) and 2.49%, respectively. The high performance of the 6 wt% NA-TNA doped device was attributed to the efficient harvesting of triplet excitons by both the guest and host materials.

A left R-module M (resp., right R-module N) is called weak injective (resp., weak flat) if Ext(R)(1) (F,M) = 0 (resp., Tor(1)(R) (N,F) = 0) for every super finitely presented left R-module F. By replacing finitely presented modules by super finitely presented modules, we may generalize many results of a homological nature from coherent rings to arbitrary rings. Some examples are given to show that weak injective (resp., weak flat) modules need not be FP-injective (resp., not flat) in general. In addition, we introduce and study the super finitely presented dimension (denote by l.sp.gldim(R)) of R that are defined in terms of only super finitely presented left R-modules. Some known results are extended.

Despite this, the use of scales without reference to "local" psychometric data is still widespread. In this study we examined the factor structure of the short 21-item form of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21), when it was applied to adolescent samples recruited from high schools in Australia (N = 371), Chile (N = 448), China (N = 558), and Malaysia (N = 388). Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the purported three-factor structure of the DASS-21 was supported in each location with structural invariance across locations. While convergent and divergent validity studies are required to support this finding, the DASS-21 appears to be suitable for use with adolescents in these locations.

In this work, the critical roles of Mn-ions in tailoring the electrical and magnetic properties of BiFeO3-based materials are revealed: the introduction of MnO2 into BiFe0.96Sc0.04O3-BaTiO3 induces a dramatic improvement in insulation, piezoelectricity and multiferroicity. New compositions of BiFe0.96Sc0.04O3-BaTiO3 + x mol% MnO2 were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. All the ceramics possess a perovskite structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and monoclinic phases is formed at x = 0.5-1.0. The formation of Fe-Fe3+(2+) and V-O2-(center dot center dot) is noticeably suppressed and the resistivity of the ceramics is increased by similar to 100 times after the addition of 0.5-1.0 mol% MnO2, which make the ceramic polarizable and thus give strong ferroelectricity and considerable piezoelectricity. The ceramics with the MPB composition exhibit high electrical insulation (R = 1.2-1.7 x 10(10) Omega cm), good piezoelectricity (d(33) = 123-143 pC N-1, k(p) = 0.34-0.35), strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 13.1-17.6 mu C cm(-2)), high Curie temperature (590-596 degrees C) and excellent temperature stability of piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. These improvements are greatly associated with the contribution of Mn-ions in the ceramics. Surprisingly, sharply enhanced ferromagnetism with M-r = 0.4946 emu g(-1) and M-s = 1.0298 emu g(-1) is obtained in the ceramic with x = 7.0, almost one thousand times larger than that of an un-doped ceramic. The origin of unusual ferromagnetism is associated with significant changes in magnetic ordering caused by Mn doping. The high magnetoelectric effect (alpha(33) = 429.6 mV cm(-1) Oe(-1)) is obtained after the addition of 2.0 mol% Mn ions. Our study suggests that the present ceramics may have potential applications in advanced memory devices as promising lead-free high temperature piezoelectric and multiferroic materials.

It is shown that, when the collection is illuminated with two correlated light waves, the far-zone scattered spectrum may be shifted to a longer or a smaller wavelength, depending on the angle of scattering. It is also shown that the magnitude of the spectral shift is affected by the properties of the pair-structure factor, including the angular width and the angular correlation width. This phenomenon may have potential applications in the determination of the structure information from the measurements of the scattered field. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

When there is no failed component in the system, the repairmen leave for a vacation, the duration of which follows a phase type distribution. Upon returning from vacation, they should take another vacation if there are less than.. failed components waiting in the system. This pattern continues until at least.. failed components are waiting. Moreover, the redundant dependency which is a special kind of failure dependency is taken into account in the multicomponent system. Under such assumptions, the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, and the reliability of the system are derived in transient regime by applying the quasi-birth-and-death process. Furthermore, the Runge-Kutta method is carried out to numerically discuss the time-dependent behavior of the system reliability measures. Finally, a special case of the system is presented to show the validity of our model.

The dielectric constant obtained using GROMOS with TIP3P matches with the experimental results from dielectric spectroscopy (DRS) with minimum error. The structural information of MSG aqueous solution was also investigated. It was found that the hydration shells of water around charged particles (Na+ and Glu(-)) highly influence the dielectric constant of the solution. In addition to the first hydration shell, the second shell also affects the dielectric constant. Glu(-) weakened the hydrogen bond (HB) lifetime between water molecules in MSG aqueous solution compared to the water-water HB lifetime in pure water. It seems that a 10 ns simulation is not long enough to accurately determine the dielectric constant using the GROMOS force field with the TIP3P model of water.

The well-distributed GO was remarkably effective in improving the tensile strength and storage modulus of NR at very low filler contents, without sacrificing the ultimate strength. The percolation point of GO in the nanocomposites took place at a content of less than 0.1 parts by weight per hundred parts of rubber.

The results showed that the perylene and its four derivatives belonged to the semiconductor molecules, which released energy when electron was injected. Therefore, they were suitable to be used as the electron injection material. The introduction of OH group can improve the electron transfer rate significantly. The formations of intramolecular hydrogen bonds were unfavorable to the hole transfer, but conducive to the electron transfer.

To prepare the GHCAs, graphene is introduced into the pyrolyzed resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogel, which significantly improves the electrical conductivity. At the same time, large interfaces between graphene sheets and pyrolyzed RF resin generate an energy filtering effect, which increases the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy promises a power factor which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of pure pyrolyzed RF aerogel. Moreover, the tenuous solid skeleton and highly open-cell foam structure of the GHCAs lead to ultra low thermal conductivity (0.06 W m(-1) K-1) and apparent density (31 kg m(-3)). This may enable the development of a novel category of ultra-lightweight energy-conversion materials with thermal insulation capability.

Herein, a series of Co20Ni80 hierarchical structures with different surface morphologies, including flower-, urchin-, ball-, and chain-like morphologies, were obtained using structure-directing templates via a facile one-step solvothermal treatment. The microwave reflection loss (RL) of urchin-like Co20Ni80 hierarchical structures reaches as high as -33.5 dB at 3 GHz, with almost twice the RL intensity of the ball-and chain-like structures, and the absorption bandwidth (<-10 dB) is about 5.5 GHz for the flower-like morphology, indicating that the surface nanospikes and nanoflakes on the Co20Ni80 microsphere surfaces have great influences on their magnetic microwave absorption properties. Electron holography analysis reveals that the surface nanospikes and nanoflakes could generate a high density of stray magnetic flux lines and contribute a large saturation magnetization (105.62 emu g(-1) for urchin-like and 96.41 emu g(-1) for flower-like morphology), leading the urchin-like and flower-like Co20Ni80 to possess stronger microwave RL compared with the ball-like and chain-like Co20Ni80 alloys. The eddy-current absorption mechanism mu ''(mu')(-2)(f)(-1) is dominant in the frequency region above 8 GHz, implying that eddy-current loss is a vital factor for microwave RL in the high frequency range. It can be supposed from our findings that different surface morphologies of magnetic hierarchical structures might become an effective path to achieve high-performance microwave absorption for electromagnetic shielding and stealth camouflage applications.

Under heterogeneous light conditions, photosynthates supplied by exposed ramets may promote N assimilation in the rhizosphere of shaded, connected ramets. This study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Methods Clonal fragments of the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba with two successive ramets were selected. Mother ramets were subjected to full sunlight and offspring ramets were subjected to 80 % shading, and the stolon between the two successive ramets was either severed or left intact. Measurements were taken of photosynthetic and growth parameters. The turnover of available soil N was determined together with the compostion of the rhizosphere microbial community. Key Results The microbial community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets was significantly altered by clonal integration. Positive effects of clonal integration were observed on NAGase activity, net soil N mineralization rate and net soil N nitrification rate. Increased leaf N and chlorophyll content as well as leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic machinery improved the photosynthetic capability of shaded offspring ramets when the stolon was left intact. Clonal integration improved the growth performance of shaded, connected offspring ramets and whole clonal fragments without any cost to the exposed mother ramets. Conclusions Considerable differences in microbial community composition caused by clonal integration may facilitate N assimilation in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. Increased N content in the photosynthetic machinery may allow pre-acclimation to high light conditions for shaded offspring ramets, thus promoting opportunistic light capture. In accordance with the theory of the division of labour, it is suggested that clonal integration may ameliorate the carbon assimilation capacity of clonal plants, thus improving their fitness in temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats.

Unfortunately, the fertilizers used to promote the growth of tea trees inevitably cause significant fluoride accumulation in tea leaves. Here, we disclose that the use of plant polyphenol-Ce hybrid materials as chelating adsorbents effectively suppressed the accumulation of fluoride in tea leaves when compound fertilizers were applied during the growing period of tea plants. The adjacent phenolic hydroxyls of plant polyphenols were able to chelate with the Al3+ in the soil and prevent the formation and absorption of AlFx complexes in tea trees. The adsorbents can effectively absorb F- via positively charged Ce4+ based on electrostatic attraction. In field plot experiments, the fluoride accumulation in tea leaves was substantially reduced up to 74.75% when the compound fertilizers were used accompanied by the polyphenol- Ce adsorbents.

This article develops a new robust and self-starting multivariate procedure based on multivariate Smirnov test (MST), which integrates a multivariate two-sample goodness-of-fit (GOF) test based on multivariate empirical distribution function (MEDF) and the change-point model. As expected, simulation results show that our proposed control chart is robust to nonnormally distributed data, and moreover, it is efficient in detecting process shifts, especially large shifts, which is one of the main draw-backs of most robust control charts in the literature. As it avoids the need for a lengthy data-gathering step, the proposed chart is particularly useful in start-up or short-run situations. Comparison results and a real data example show that our proposed chart has great potential for application.

The working time of each component is an exponentially distributed random variable and the repair time of each failed component is governed by an arbitrary distribution. Moreover, we assume that every component is "as good as new" after being repaired. Under these assumptions, several important reliability measures such as the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, and the mean time to first failure of the system are derived by employing the supplementary variable technique and the Laplace transform. Meanwhile, their recursive expressions are obtained. Furthermore, through numerical examples, we study the influence of various parameters on the system reliability measures. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation and two special cases of the system which are (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system and 1-out-of-n:G repairable system are presented to illustrate the correctness of the analytical results.

Filling the distributional gap by discovery of a new population or a species has significant bio-geographic implications, because it suggests a much wider past distribution and provides evidence for the route of range expansion/contraction. The salamandrid genus Echinotriton (commonly known as spiny salamanders, spiny newts, or crocodile newts) has two species that are restricted to two widely separated areas, one in eastern Zhejiang province, China and the other in the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan. It has been hypothesized that Echinotriton was once continuously distributed between the two areas through a historical land bridge that connected mainland China, Taiwan, and the archipelago. Finding fossils or relic populations along the postulated distribution are strong evidence for the hypothesis. Hundred-twenty-two years after the description of E. andersoni and eight-one years after that of E. chinhaiensis, we discover a third species of Echinotriton in southern China, which fills the distributional gap of the former two species. Species status of the new species is confirmed through molecular phylogenetic analysis and morphological comparison. Mitochondrial DNA indicates that the new species is sister to E. chinhaiensis, while nuclear DNA does not support this relationship. The new species has a very large quadrate projection, a single line of lateral warts pierced by distal rib extremities, normally developed 5th toes, and conical skin tubercles. Our discovery supports the hypothesis that there was a continuous distribution of Echinotriton from eastern coastal China to the Ryukyu Archipelago. We suggest that other species of this genus may also be found in Taiwan. Due to the rarity of this new species, we urge all hobbyists to refrain themselves from collecting this salamander or leaking locality information if encountered, and boycott any trading.

It is shown that spectral shifts and spectral switches are affected both by the polarization of the incident light wave and by the characters of the scattering medium. Moreover, numerical results show that the direction at which the spectral switch occurs is governed by the characters of the scattering medium, whereas the magnitude of the spectral switch is affected by the polarization of the incident light wave.

To address this issue, a statistics-based reputation method for reliable data fusion is proposed in this study. Different from traditional reputation methods that only compute the general reputation of a node, the proposed method modeled by negative binomial reputation consists of two separated reputation metrics: fusion reputation and sensing reputation. Fusion reputation aims to select data fusion points and sensing reputation is used to weigh the data reported by sensor nodes to the fusion point. So, this method can prevent a compromised node from covering its misbehavior in the process of sensing or fusion by behaving well in the fusion or sensing. To tackle the unexpected facts such as packet loss, a discounting factor is introduced into the proposed method. Additionally, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) based outlier detection is applied to evaluate the behavior result of sensor nodes. Simulations show that the proposed method can enhance the reliability of data fusion and is more accurate than the general reputation method when applied in reputation evaluation.

Then, in the fully observable case, we first consider the joining strategy in a decentralized manner, that is, arriving customers observe the queue size and then decide whether or not to join the queue based on the net benefit they will obtain upon the completion of service. Secondly, we derive the threshold strategy that will yield the system's maximal expected profit, to reach the so-called social welfare optimization. Finally, Nash equilibrium and socially optimal mixed strategies are derived in the fully unobservable case. Moreover, some numerical examples are provided to explore the impact of system parameters on customer's joining behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detailed comparisons are made with published experimental and theoretical data and show generally good agreement. The nine independent elastic constants (c(11), c(22), c(33), c(44), c(55), c(66), c(12), c(13), and c(23)) were evaluated. Based on the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we have obtained successfully the bulk modulus B, Debye temperature Theta and Gruncisen parameter gamma, heat capacities C-v, entropy S, as well as thermal expansion coefficient alpha as a function of the pressure and temperature of CuBiS2 in the ranges of 0-10 GPa and 0-600 K for the first time.

We report theoretical analyses of the electronic properties of three-dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3 film on different energies. We choose five different energies (-123, -75, 0, 180, 350 meV) around the Dirac cone (-113 meV). When energy is close to the Dirac cone, the properties of wave function match the topological insulator's hallmark perfectly. When energy is far way from the Dirac cone, the hallmark of topological insulator is broken and the helical states disappear. The electronic properties of helical states are dug out from the calculation results. The spin-momentum locking of the helical states are confirmed. A 3-fold symmetry of the helical states in Brillouin zone is also revealed. The penetration depth of the helical states is two quintuple layers which can be identified from layer projection. The charge contribution on each quintuple layer depends on the energy, and has completely different behavior along K and M direction in Brillouin zone. From orbital projection, we can find that the maximum charge contribution of the helical states is p (z) orbit and the charge contribution on p (y) and p (x) orbits have 2-fold symmetry.

However, the biomass accumulation can be inhibited by high level of ammonium (NH4+) in non-diluted livestock wastewater and the mechanism of ammonium inhibition is not fully understood. In this study, the effect of high concentration of NH4+ on L. minor biomass accumulation was investigated using NH4+ as sole source of nitrogen (N). NH4+-induced toxicity symptoms were observed when L. minor was exposed to high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) after a 7-day cultivation. L. minor exposed to the NH4+-N concentration of 840 mg l(-1) exhibited reduced relative growth rate, contents of carbon (C) and photosynthetic pigments, and C/N ratio. Ammonium irons were inhibitory to the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and caused C/N imbalance in L. minor. These symptoms could further cause premature senescence of the fronds, and restrain their reproduction, growth and biomass accumulation. L. minor could grow at NH4+-N concentrations of 7-84 mg l(-1) and the optimal NH4+-N concentration was 28 mg l(-1).

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PTSD and PTG and also tested for the gender differences in PTSD and PTG subgroups. A stratification random sampling strategy and questionnaires were used to collect the data. The PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Check list-Civilian and the PTG was assessed using the Post traumatic growth inventory. 2,300 individuals were involved in the initial survey with 2,080 completing the final questionnaire, a response rate of 90.4 %. One-way ANOVA analyses were performed to investigate the gender differences in the PTSD and PTG subgroups. One year following the earthquake, 40.1 and 51.1 % of survivors reported PTSD and PTG, respectively. A bivariate correlation analysis indicated that there was a positive association between PTG and PTSD. The PTG and PTSD variance analysis conducted on female and male subgroups suggested that women were more affected than men. Given the relatively high PTG prevalence, it was concluded that researchers need to pay more attention to the positive outcomes of an earthquake rather than just focusing on the negative effects. The surveys and analyses indicated that psychological intervention and care for the earthquake disaster survivors should focus more on females and older people, who tend to be more adversely affected.

Our results are in agreement well with available experimental data and previous theoretical studies. The full elastic constants and bulk shear modulus of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) are obtained in the wide pressure range. Results indicated that these phases of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) are strongly pressure dependent. And the CrB4 in Immm structure is the most ultraincompressible among the considered phases at 0 GPa. By the mechanical stability criteria, it is predicted that these phases of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) compounds are stable up to 100 GPa. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio indicated that all the structures of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) possess brittle nature in the range of pressure from 0 GPa to 100 GPa except the Pnnm structure of MnB4, which is higher than 1.75, indicating that the Pnnm structure of MnB4 is prone to ductility when the pressure is above 73 GPa.

The influences of system parameters on its energy transmittance and integration error are explored in detail. The numerical analysis shows that, enhanced energy transmittance and integration time window can be simultaneously achieved by increased injected current in the vicinity of lasing threshold. We find that the range of input pulse-width with lower integration error is highly sensitive to the injected optical power, due to gain saturation and induced detuning deviation mechanism.

J	Cai, L; Long, QY; Yin, C				Cai, Li; Long, Qiyi; Yin, Chao			Synthesis and characterization of high photocatalytic activity and stable Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers for photocatalytic degradation of black liquor	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Ag-3 PO4; TiO2 fiber; Black liquor; Photocatalyst; Cotton fiber	TIO2; COMPOSITES; EFFICIENT; NANOPARTICLES; STABILITY; NANOCOMPOSITES; SEMICONDUCTOR; PERFORMANCE; LIGNIN; FILMS	The TiO2 fiber was prepared by using cotton fiber as a template, and then Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers were synthesized via in situ Ag3PO4 particles onto the surface of TiO2 fiber. Their structure and physical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specific surface analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra (PL). SEM analysis indicated that the well-defined surface morphology of natural cotton fiber was mostly preserved in TiO2 and Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers. Compared with TiO2 fiber, the absorbance wavelengths of Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers were apparently red shifted and the PL intensities revealed a significant decrease. By using the photocatalytic degradation of black liquor as a model reaction, the visible light and ultraviolet light catalytic efficiencies of TiO2, Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers were evaluated. The reaction results showed that Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers had stronger photocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability in repeated and long-term applications. Therefore, the prepared Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers could act as an efficient catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of black liquor, which suggested their promising applications. It was proposed that the center dot OH radicals played the leading role in the photocatalytic degradation of the black liquor by Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

The ceramics sintered at 890-990 degrees C possess a pure perovskite structure. A morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and monoclinic phases is formed at x = 0.05. A small amount of Nd improves the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. The ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition becomes gradually diffusive with x increasing. After the addition of Nd, the ferromagnetism of the ceramics is greatly enhanced by similar to 320%. The increase in sintering temperature improves significantly the ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics. The ceramics with x = 0.05 sintered at 950-990 degrees C possess improved ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, magnetism and insulation with P-r of 16.5-17.5 mu C/cm(2), d(33) of 113-121 pC/ N, M-r of 0.127-0.138 emu/g, R of similar to 5 x 10(9) Omega.cm and high T-C of 473-482 degrees C, indicating that the ceramic is a promising candidate for room-temperature multiferroic and high-temperature piezoelectric materials.

From the results of the probe experiment, we found that the HE-Dy(SIC) complex could compete with AO for intercalating into hsDNA. The binding constants of the HE-Dy(SIC) complex to hsDNA was obtained by the double reciprocal method and indicated that the affinity between hsDNA and the complex is weaker than that between hsDNA and classical intercalators. The thermodynamic parameters(Delta H degrees, Delta G degrees, Delta S degrees) were calculated from the UV-vis absorption data measured at two different temperatures. Further experimental results suggested that there exist groove binding and partial intercalation binding between hsDNA and HE-Dy(SIC) complex.

(3) Separability of set regions and rule consistency is verified, and the quantitative and qualitative double-preservation reduct (DP-Reduct) is established. (4) Hierarchies of CRP-Reduct, SRP-Reduct, and DP-Reduct are explored with two qualitative reducts: the Pawlalc-Reduct and knowledge-preservation reduct (KP-Reduct). (5) Finally, verification experiments are provided.

In this paper, we investigate the ergodic sum capacity of all CRUs in OFDMA-based networks and consider the constraints on the long-term transmit power of all CRUs, the long-term interference thresholds of PUs, and the statistical proportional fairness of all CRUs. In OFDMA-based CRNs, the number of available subchannels is smaller than that of CRUs in some OFDM symbol durations. To deal with this time-varying nature of available spectrum resource and achieve the ergodic sum capacity of all CRUs, we propose an optimal resource-allocation algorithm under the given constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve substantial capacity gains for CRUs over the traditional resource-allocation algorithm and maintain the statistical proportional rate constraints of all CRUs.

The microstructure, multiferroic, and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics have been studied. The ceramics sintered at 1000 degrees C for 2h possess a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at x=0.02. After the addition of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, two dielectric anomalies are observed at high temperatures (T-m similar to 510 degrees C-570 degrees C and T(2 similar to)720 degrees C). The phase transition around T-m becomes wider gradually with increasing x. The ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and ferromagnetism of the ceramics are significantly improved after the addition of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3. High resistivity (similar to 1.3x10(9)cm), strong ferroelectricity (P-r=27.4C/cm(2)), good piezoelectricity (d(33)=140pC/N, k(p)=31.4%), and weak magnetic properties (M-r=0.19emu/g) are observed.

Then equilibrium geometry of 2, 3-DCP was optimized, and based on this, the harmonic vibrational frequencies, infrared intensities and Raman activities were calculated using B3LYP method of the density function theory (DFT) in conjunction with 6-311++G(2df, 2pd) basis set, furthermore, a comprehensive anharmonic calculation was also been performed for obtaining more accurate vibrational frequencies using second-order perturbation theory treatment based on quadratic, cubic and quartic force constants. Infrared and Raman spectra were simulated corresponding to theory. Experimental FTIR and FT-Raman bands were compared with those positions of peaks obtained from anharmonic calculations and intensities or activities from harmonic carefully. Each vibrational band was assigned and interpreted in detail with help of potential energy distribution (FED) for the first time. In addition, it was shown that anharmonic results exactly reproduced to experimental data, improved the validity of prediction greatly in vibration frequencies, discrepancies between anharmonic and experimental results were limited to below 10 cm(-1) in most of vibrational bands, even if in the high energy regions, which have a poor performance for hanmonic calculation, and these differences would be decreased to lower than 19 cm(-1). It is extremely helpful for assigning and predicting vibrational spectra. Present conclusion can be expanded to others molecular systems.

In this article, we propose a new KNN-based classifier, called the local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN) rule. It is motivated by the local mean-based k-nearest neighbor (LMKNN) rule and the pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN) rule, with the aim of improving the classification performance. In the proposed LMPNN, the k nearest neighbors from each class are searched as the class prototypes, and then the local mean vectors of the neighbors are yielded. Subsequently, we attempt to find the local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor per class by employing the categorical k local mean vectors, and classify the unknown query patten according to the distances between the query and the pseudo nearest neighbors To assess the classification performance of the proposed LMPNN, it is compared with the competing classifiers, such as LMKNN and PNN, in terms of the classification error on thirty-two real UCI data sets, four artificial data sets and three image data sets. The comprehensively experimental results suggest that the proposed LMPNN classifier is a promising algorithm in pattern recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One hundred and six Malaysian Malays, 55 Malaysian Chinese, 195 Chinese from China, and 45 non-Asian Australians aged 12 to 19 years completed a questionnaire assessing dissatisfaction with their overall body and dissatisfaction with varying aspects of their body. Dissatisfaction with the face, height, and hair was positively correlated with overall body dissatisfaction among Malaysian Malays after body mass index, age and dissatisfaction with body areas typically included in measures (weight/shape, upper, middle, and lower body, and muscles) had been controlled for. Dissatisfaction with the face was positively correlated with overall body dissatisfaction among Malaysian Chinese. These findings demonstrate the differences in body focus for males from different cultures and the importance of using assessment measures that address all possible areas of body focus.

Due to strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and the atomic structure of the two-dimensional lattice, monolayer WSe2 has an electronic structure that exhibits Zeeman-like up-down spin texture near the K and K' points of the Brillouin zone. In a FET, the gate electric field induces an extra, externally tunable SOI that re-orients the spins into a Rashba-like texture thereby realizing electric control of the spin. The conductance of FET is modulated by the spin texture, namely by if the spin orientation of the carrier after the gated channel region, matches or miss-matches that of the FET drain electrode. The carrier current I-tau,I-s in the FET is labelled by both the valley index and spin index, realizing valleytronics and spintronics in the same device.

An invariant foliation decomposes the state space into geometric regions of different dynamical regimes, and thus helps understand dynamics. A slow invariant foliation is established for this system. It is shown that the slow foliation converges to a critical foliation (i.e., the scale parameter is zero) in probability distribution, as the scale parameter tends to zero. The approximation of slow foliation is also constructed with error estimate in distribution. Furthermore, the geometric structure of the slow foliation is investigated: every fiber of the slow foliation parallels each other, with the slow manifold as a special fiber. In fact, when an arbitrarily chosen point of a fiber falls in the slow manifold, the fiber must be the slow manifold itself. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Kirkwood correlation factor of CC model in adjustable infinite dielectric constant is more changeable with temperature than DC model. The Kirkwood factor with different conditions needs reinterpretation. CC model generally depicts molecular cooperative interactions with single channel and evaluates once relaxation act of DMSO cluster within a cutoff time. DC model couples multi-channels, including various relaxation modes such as monomeric, dimeric and cluster. So the relaxation time of DC model is higher than CC model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A disinfection method using CTA and APP (3% CTA + 3% APP for 20 min at 45 degrees C) was obtained. Under this set of combination, the experimental values of microbial counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, mesophilic anaerobic bacteria, and fungi were 2.31 +/- 0.4 log CFU/g, < 1.0 log CFU/g, and < 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively. Through the analysis of sensory qualities and microbial populations for MAP-or VAC-packed Chinese T. indicum, the shelf life of soaked truffles was prolonged to 45 or 40 d, respectively. The synergistic effect of CTA and APP may provide valuable insight into the reduction of microorganisms on fresh truffles.

A systematic search of databases and journals identified 21 papers that met the inclusion criteria. Two broad themes emerged from an analysis of the literatures, which included processes and outcomes of interactions with peers and intervention programs. The research indicates that children who are D/HH face great difficulties in communicating, initiating/entering, and maintaining interactions with hearing peers in inclusive settings. The co-enrollment and social skills training programs are considered to be effective interventions for their social interaction. Communication abilities and social skills of children who are D/HH, responses of children with normal hearing, and the effect of environment are highlighted as crucial aspects of social interactions. In addition, future research is needed to study the interaction between children who are D/HH and hearing peers in natural settings, at different stages of school life, as well as improving social interaction and establishing an inclusive classroom climate for children who are D/HH.

Enhancement of squeezing in an electromagnetically induced transparent system using a microwave field	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						squeezing; electromagnetically induced transparency; quantum electrodynamics; microwave field	ATOMIC SYSTEM; LIGHT; PHASE; ABSORPTION; STORAGE; CAVITY; GAS	We investigate the output squeezing of a squeezed vacuum as a probe field propagating through a collection of Lambda-type atoms by using a microwave field to drive the dipole-forbidden transition constructed by the ground states. It is found that when the microwave field is increased, the degree of the output squeezing for a squeezed vacuum can be enhanced and the squeezing regions in the frequency domain become wider. In particular, the output squeezing from a shot noise can be produced by adjusting the microwave field. Meanwhile the electromagnetically induced transparency of the quantum field is also optimized. This can be useful in controllable quantum communication.	[Chen, J.; Hou, B. P.] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Solid Phys, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Hou, B.

J	Li, JL; Wang, XY; Li, G; Zhang, FQ; Feng, D				Li, Junli; Wang, Xiuying; Li, Gang; Zhang, Fuqiang; Feng, David			Quality assessment of perceptual color video based on a top-down framework and quaternion	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Video quality assessment; Top-down framework; Cognitive analysis; Quaternion; Singular value decomposition; Edge; Chrominance; Temporal correlation	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; IMAGE QUALITY; STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY; FOURIER-TRANSFORMS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Objective video quality assessment is of great importance in a variety of video processing applications. Most existing video quality metrics either focus primarily on capturing spatial artifacts in the video signal, or are designed to assess only grayscale video thereby ignoring important chrominance information. In this paper, on the basis of the top-down visual analysis of cognitive understanding and video features, we propose and develop a novel full-reference perceptual video assessment technique that accepts visual information inputs in the form of a quaternion consisting of contour, color and temporal information. Because of the more important role of chrominance information in the "border-to-surface" mechanism at early stages of cognitive visual processing, our new metric takes into account the chrominance information rather than the luminance information utilized in conventional video quality assessment. Our perceptual quaternion model employs singular value decomposition (SVD) and utilizes the human visual psychological features for SVD block weighting to better reflect perceptual focus and interest. Our major contributions include: a new perceptual quaternion that takes chrominance as one spatial feature, and temporal information to model motion or changes across adjacent frames; a three-level video quality measure to reflect visual psychology; and the two weighting methods based on entropy and frame correlation. Our experimental validation on the video quality experts' group (VQEG) Phase I FR-TV test dataset demonstrated that our new assessment metric outperforms PSNR, SSIM, PVQM (P8) and has high correlation with perceived video quality.

From the reaction of p-tert-butylcalix[61areneH(6) with one or two equivalents of [W(eg)(3)], only the oxo-bridged complex {[W(eg)](2)(mu-O)p-tert-butylcalix[6]arene} (1) could be isolated, whereas the use of four equivalents of [W(eg)(3)], in the presence of molecular sieves, afforded {[W(eg)(2)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[6]areneH(2)}center dot 2MeCN (2); molecules of 2 pack in bi-layers. Under similar conditions, use of one or two equivalents of [W(eg)(3)] and p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(8) afforded {[W(eg)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene}center dot MeCN (3) in which each tungsten centre was bound by four calixarene oxygens. By contrast, the small orange prisms resulting from the use of four equivalents of [W(eg)(3)] and p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(8) were shown by synchrotron radiation to be a mixture of two isomers (4a/4b.3.5MeCN). In the major isomer {1,2-[W(eg)(2)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(4)} (4a), two tungsten centres bind to neighbouring sets of phenolate oxygens, whereas in the minor isomer {1,3-[W(eg)(2)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(4)} (4b), there is a protonated phenolic group between the two pairs of phenolate oxygens bound to tungsten; the major : minor ratio is about 83 : 17. Use of p-tert-butyltetrahomodioxacalix[6]areneH(6) with two equivalents of [W(eg)(3)] resulted in the isolation of {[WO(eg)](2)p-tert-butyltetrahomodioxacalix[6]areneH(2)} (5.0.83toluene. MeCN), in which each dimethyleneoxa bridge is bound to an oxotungsten(VI) centre. Complexes 1-5, together with the known complex [W(eg)p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene] (6), have been screened for their ability to ring open polymerize (ROP) epsilon-caprolactone; for 1, 2 and 5, 6 conversion rates were good (>88%) at 110 degrees C over 12 or 24 h, whereas the calix[8]arene complexes 3 and 4 under the same conditions were inactive.

Under heterogeneous light, photosynthates can be translocated or shared between exposed and shaded ramets by clonal integration. Clonal integration may enhance the rhizodeposition of the shaded ramets, which further influences nutrient recycling in their rhizosphere. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pot experiment by the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba subjected to heterogeneous light. Microbial biomass and community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets, assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis, were markedly altered by clonal integration. Clonal integration positively affected C, N availabilities, invertase and urease activities, N mineralization (N-min) and nitrification rates (N-nitri) in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, an opposite pattern was also observed in phenoloxidase (POXase) and peroxidase (PODase) activities. Our results demonstrated that clonal integration facilitated N assimilation and uptake in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. The experiment provides insights into the mechanism of nutrient recycling mediated by clonal integration.

The present study used a revised simple gambling task and manipulated the waiting time before reward presentation. Behavioral data showed that participants did not respond differently between conditions; however, they reported more negative emotion under long-waiting conditions than under short-waiting conditions. Event-related potential results showed that fERN was not significantly different between the two conditions, whereas the short-waiting feedback elicited a notably larger P300 amplitude than the long-waiting feedback, particularly in frontal-central regions. The present study shows that P300, not fERN, reflects high-level motivated evaluation of waiting cost in such a decision-making task.

The chemical structures of the resulting material are confirmed by FT-IR and H-1-NMR spectroscopy. To analyse the mechanism of the pH sensitivity of this polymer, its structural transformations under acidic and basic conditions are studied by FT-IR spectroscopy, theoretical calculations and H-1-NMR spectroscopy. We observe that the mechanism of pH responsiveness is the formation of a hydrogen bond interaction between the N atom of the pyridine ring and H-N of urethane in neutral or alkaline environments which is disrupted under acidic conditions due to the protonation of the pyridine ring. The pH-sensitivity is demonstrated by simply adjusting the pH value of the environment, which can act as a switch to control shape memory and drug release. Unlike other systems with thermally sensitive behaviour, the shape memory functionality of this material is independent of temperature, which is dependent only on the variation in the pH of the environment. This strategy provides a potent tool for the design of multifunctional materials based on the physiological environment to fulfil the complex requirements of drug delivery and tissue engineering systems.

It is found that trilayers with a perpendicular anisotropy possess considerably larger coercivities and smaller remanences and energy products compared with those with an in-plane anisotropy. Increase of beta leads to a fast decrease of the maximum energy product as well as the drop of both remanence and coercivity. Such a drop is much faster than that in the single-phased hard material, which can explain the significant discrepancy between the experiment and the theoretical energy products. Some modeling techniques have been utilized with spin check procedures performed, which yield results in good agreement with the one-dimensional (1D) analytical and experimental data, justifying our calculations. Further, the calculated nucleation fields according to the 3D calculations are larger than those based on the 1D model, whereas the corresponding coercivity is smaller, leading to more square hysteresis loops and better agreement between experimental data and the theory.

A primary process with an asymmetric shape is observed. The mixture behaviour is described according to four Cole-Davidson terms whose evolution with composition is analysed. Numbers of hydrogen bonds between water-water and DMAC-water pairs are estimated from the values of the static dielectric constant by using the Luzar model. The model provides a satisfactory explanation of the experimental results related to the static dielectric constant. The hydrogen bond binding energies for water-water and DMAC-water are estimated to be -13.5 and -16.9 kJ mol(-1); we also report a strategy to parameterise effective DMAC-water cluster interactions to provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of the relaxation acts.

As soon as an individual shock exceeds some given level the system will break down. The failed system can be repaired immediately. With the increasing number of repairs, the maximum shock level that the system can withstand will be decreasing, while the consecutive repair times after failure will become longer and longer. Undergoing a specified number of repairs, the existing system will be replaced by a new and identical one. The spare system for the replacement is available only by sending a purchase order to a supplier, and the duration of spare system procurement lead time also follows a PH distribution. Based on the number of system failures, a new order-replacement policy (also called (K, N) policy) is proposed in this paper. Using the closure property of the PH distribution, the long-run average cost rate for the system is given by the renewal reward theorem. Finally, through numerical calculation, it is determined an optimal order-replacement policy such that the long-run expected cost rate is minimum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Firstly, we show the lower blow-up rate of blow-up solutions by rescaling technique, and use it to get the rate of mass concentration of blow-up solutions. Secondly, for the minimal mass blow-up solutions, we obtain the sharp lower blow-up rate by the variational methods. Finally, we investigate the limiting profile of minimal mass blow-up solutions.

J	Pan, R; Shanks, R; Kong, I; Wang, LL				Pan, Rui; Shanks, Robert; Kong, Ing; Wang, Lingling			Trisilanolisobutyl POSS/polyurethane hybrid composites: preparation, WAXS and thermal properties	POLYMER BULLETIN			English	Article						POSS; Nanocomposite; Silicon nanoparticle; Hybrid material	POLYHEDRAL OLIGOMERIC SILSESQUIOXANES; POLYURETHANE BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; POSS; STABILITY; ADHESIVE	Trisilanolisobutyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (TSI-POSS) with three hydroxyl functional groups pendent to an open cage, was incorporated in concentrations of 7, 13 and 22 wt% into 4,4'-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) and glycerol propoxylate to prepare TSI-POSS-PU hybrid composites as a heavy linking node in polymer backbone, respectively. These composites were characterized by FTIR, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), dynamic mechanical analysis and thermogravimetry techniques. In WAXS profiles, above 22 wt% TSI-POSS concentration, the morphology of composite is significantly altered and distinct crystallite clusters are formed, which increase the volume of hard segment in polyurethane (PU) hybrid composite. As TSI-POSS concentration rises, the glass transition temperature (T (g)) of composites is increased while the decomposition temperature is slightly decreased due to the oxysensitive isobutyl groups in structure. Meanwhile, the activation energy of hybrid composites is nearly unchanged indicating that the formation of crystallite cluster, which restricts motion of surrounding chains, is the predominant effect in T (g) increasing. It can be concluded that the morphology and the thermal property of polyurethane can be tailored by TSI-POSS incorporation, whereas functional group in TSI-POSS structure is the decisive factor for the thermostability of designed composites.

The receivers can simultaneously reconstruct different qubit states containing the joint information from all senders. Compared with the protocols proposed by Su et al. (Int J Quantum Inf 10:1250006 (2012), the information of the prepared states in our schemes is distributed in a different way. Our protocols can be applied not only to states with real parameters but also ones with complex parameters. Moreover, the N-to-2 protocol is suitable for general qubit states besides equatorial states, and the receivers need not to perform any measurements and CNOT gates to reconstruct the states.

The ceramics sintered at 960 A degrees C for 2 h possess a pure perovskite structure and no second phases can be detected. After the addition of Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)TiO3, a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases is formed at x = 0.01. The addition of a small amount of Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)TiO3 can promote the grain growth, while excess Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)TiO3 causes an inhibition of grain growth. Sintering temperature has an important influence on the structure and electrical properties of the ceramics. The sintering temperature of 960 A degrees C is a critical temperature to obtain the ceramics with good piezoelectric properties. For the ceramic with x = 0.01 sintered at/above 960 A degrees C located at the morphotropic phase boundary, large grains, good densification, high resistivity and enhanced electrical properties are obtained.

We obtain the Fokker-Planck-type dynamic equations, and their stationary solutions are of the Boltzmann-Gibbs form. These processes obey a generalized Einstein-Stokes-Smoluchowski relation and the second Einstein relation. We observe that the asymptotic behavior of waiting times and subordinations are of stretched Gaussian distributions.

The principal term in the radial distribution function reveals significant differences in the structure and reorientation dynamics of DMAC-H2O interaction, indicating a substantial field-induced effect of molecular structure on the hydrogen-bond network The first hydration shell alters significantly with increasing E/M field strength. When the intensity of the E/M field is above 3 x 10(8) V/m a threshold effect is observed, and the static dielectric constants decrease with increasing E/M field strength. And the molecular polarizability gradually increases when the E/M field strength increases. The average hydrogen-bond number and hydrogen-bond lifetime decline with the E/M field strength.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Reduction target structure-based hierarchical attribute reduction for two-category decision-theoretic rough sets	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Attribute reduction; Decision-theoretic rough set; Granular computing; Consistency-preservation; Structure target	MODEL; PRECISION; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; LOGICS; GRADE	Attribute reduction is an essential subject in rough set theory, but because of quantitative extension, it becomes a problem when considering probabilistic rough set (PRS) approaches. The decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) has a threshold semantics and decision feature and thus becomes a typical and fundamental PRS. Based on reduction target structures, this paper investigates hierarchical attribute reduction for a two-category DTRS and is divided into five parts. (1) The knowledge-preservation property and reduct are explored by knowledge coarsening. (2) The consistency-preservation principle and reduct are constructed by a consistency mechanism. (3) Region preservation is analyzed, and the separability between consistency preservation and region preservation is concluded; thus, the double-preservation principle and reduct are studied. (4) Structure targets are proposed by knowledge structures, and an attribute reduction is further described and simulated; thus, general reducts are defined to preserve the structure targets or optimal measures. (5) The hierarchical relationships of the relevant four targets and reducts are analyzed, and a decision table example is provided for illustration. This study offers promotion, rationality, structure, hierarchy and generalization, and it establishes a fundamental reduction framework for two-category DTRS. The relevant results also provide some new insights into the attribute reduction problem for PRS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Xu and Chen (2008) proposed a number of linear programming models to derive interval weights, but the definitions for the additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation and the linear programming model still need to be improved. In this paper, a numerical example is given to show how these definitions and models can be improved to increase accuracy. A new additive consistency definition for interval fuzzy preference relations is proposed and novel linear programming models are established to demonstrate the generation of interval weights from an interval fuzzy preference relation.

The results show that obvious nucleation can be observed only when the angle beta between the easy axis and the applied field is equal to 0 degrees, and the nucleation field and the coercivity decrease as the thickness of the soft phase L-s increases. The remanence decreases and the squareness of the hysteresis loop weakens as beta increases, leading to the decrease of the energy product while the largest maximum energy product (561.61 kJ/m(3)) occurs at L-s = 1 nm and beta = 0 degrees. The shapes of the hysteresis loops, the remanence and the coercivity obtained from calculations and experiments are close to each other.

Mixture dielectric behavior is well described by the Cole-Cole model. We estimated H-bonds effect for molecular interactions by the excess dielectric model. The type of dipolar orders by which depends on the extent of substitution and cooperative interaction of 1-Melm-water cluster are also calculated by Luzar model and extended Froehlich theory.

It is shown that spectral changes and spectral switches can be produced in the scattered field, and the direction at which the spectral switch occurs is closely related to the boundary of the dielectric susceptibility of the scatterer.

J	Dong, B; Zhou, XL; Liu, K; Chang, J				Dong, Bing; Zhou, Xiao-Lin; Liu, Ke; Chang, Jing			Theoretical calculations for structural, elastic, and thermodynamic properties of RuN2 under high pressure	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; 1ST PRINCIPLES; NITRIDE; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; TRANSITION; STABILITY; PLATINUM; HARDNESS; SOLIDS; MGF2	The structural and elastic properties of RuN2 were investigated through the first-principles calculation using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and local density approximation (LDA) within the plane-wave pseudopotential density functional theory. The obtained equilibrium structure and mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with other theoretical results. Then we compared the elastic modulus of RuN2 with several other isomorphic noble metal nitrides. Results show that RuN2 can nearly rival with OsN2 and IrN2, which indicate RuN2 is a potentially ultra-incompressible and hard material. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that RuN2 is stable in our calculations (0-100 GPa). The calculated B/G ratios indicate that RuN2 possesses brittle nature at 0 GPa and when the pressure increases to 13.4 GPa (for LDA) or 20.8 GPa (for GGA), it begins to prone to ductility. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of RuN2. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Six new truxenone discogens 7a-f with different alkyl chain substitution patterns were synthesised and all exhibited only one three-dimensional ordered hexagonal columnar mesophase with wide temperature ranges including room temperature, which were characterised with polarising optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The self-assembly behaviours in solutions were studied by using concentration-variation H-1 NMR and scanning electron microscopy. The two-dimensional ordered self-assembly of 7c and 7f on the liquid-solid interface of highly oriented pyrolytical graphite were imaged by scanning tunnelling microscopy, and the results showed that the two-dimensional monolayer self-assembled structures on the atomically flat surfaces can be controlled by the peripheral alkyl chain substitution patterns.

All of the reactants, intermediates, transition states and product were optimized at B3LYP/6-31+ G(d) level. The single point energy and zero point energy correction were calculated for the optimized configuration of each compound at B3LYP/6-311+ +G(d,p) level. Transition states have been confirmed via vibration analysis and intrinsic reactions coordinate (MC), and nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analysis orbits interaction and bond natures. Our results showed that the activation energy of the rate-determining step was 514.32 kJ center dot mol(-1) without I-2-catalyzed, however, the activation energy of the rate-determining step was 145.94 kJ.mol(-1) with I-2-catalyzed. It indicated that I-2 catalyst promoted reaction effectively, and the C H bond of ethyl of phenylacetaldehyde was activated by I-2. In addition, polarized continuum model (PCM) method was adopted to discuss the effects of solvation. All calculations were consistent with experiments. It is predicted that the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can effectively improve the reaction yield.

Results show that the P-1-IrB structure is stable, and the incompressibility is enhanced with the increase of pressure. And the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus for P-5-IrB2 structure exhibit the regular changes under the hydrostatic pressures from 0 to 100 GPa. But when the pressure becomes 50 GPa, the Young's modulus and the lattice constant in the direction b for P-5-IrB2 structure will change exceptionally. Results show that both are not of obvious band gaps in P-1-IrB and P-5-IrB2 electronic structures under zero pressure, because of the covalent effect between Ir and B atoms. The analysis of band structure and the figure of density of states for P-1-IrB and P-5-IrB2 indicate that the two kinds of structure have metal properties.

Background and Aims Mercury (Hg) is an extremely toxic pollutant, especially in the form of methylmercury (MeHg), whereas selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in the human diet. This study aimed to ascertain whether addition of Se can produce rice with enriched Se and lowered Hg content when growing in Hg-contaminated paddy fields and, if so, to determine the possible mechanisms behind these effects. Methods Two cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa, japonica and indica) were grown in either hydroponic solutions or soil rhizobags with different Se and Hg treatments. Concentrations of total Hg, MeHg and Se were determined in the roots, shoots and brown rice, together with Hg uptake kinetics and Hg bioavailability in the soil. Root anatonmy was also studied. Key Results The high Se treatment (5 mu g g(-1)) significantly increased brown rice yield by 48% and total Se content by 2.8-fold, and decreased total Hg and MeHg by 47 and 55 %, respectively, compared with the control treatments. The high Se treatment also markedly reduced 'water-soluble' Hg and MeHg concentrations in the rhizosphere soil, decreased the uptake capacity of Hg by roots and enhanced the development of apoplastic barriers in the root endodermis. Conclusions Addition of Se to Hg-contaminated soil can help produce brown rice that is simultaneously enriched in Se and contains less total Hg and MeHg. The lowered accumulation of total Hg and MeHg appears to be the result of reduced bioavailability of Hg and production of MeHg in the rhizosphere, suppression of uptake of Hg into the root cells and an enhancement of the development of apoplastic barriers in the endodermis of the roots.

It is found that the effect of the negative spherical aberration on the on-axis scintillation index is quite different from that of the positive spherical aberration. In weak turbulence, the positive spherical aberration results in a decrease of the on-axis scintillation index on propagation, but the negative spherical aberration results in an increase of the on-axis scintillation index when the propagation distance is not large. In particular, in weak turbulence the negative spherical aberration may cause peaks of the on-axis scintillation index, and the peaks disappear in moderate and strong turbulence, which is explained in physics. The strong turbulence leads to less discrepancy among scintillations of Gaussian beams with and without spherical aberration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, ZW; Shi, DZ; Lv, HX				Xie, ZhengWei; Shi, De Zheng; Lv, HouXiang			Spin-dependent delay time in ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet heterostructures	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							TRAVERSAL TIME; FERROMAGNETIC-FILMS; DWELL TIME; BARRIER; SCATTERING	We study theoretically spin-dependent group delay and dwell time in ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet (FM/I/FM) heterostructure. The results indicate that, when the electrons with different spin orientations tunnel through the FM/I/FM junction, the spin-up process and the spin-down process are separated on the time scales. As the self-interference delay has the spin-dependent features, the variations of spin-dependent dwell-time and spin-dependent group-delay time with the structure parameters appear different features, especially, in low incident energy range. These different features show up as that the group delay times for the spin-up electrons are always longer than those for spin-down electrons when the barrier height or incident energy increase. In contrast, the dwell times for the spin-up electrons are longer (shorter) than those for spin-down electrons when the barrier heights (the incident energy) are under a certain value. When the barrier heights (the incident energy) exceed a certain value, the dwell times for the spin-up electrons turn out to be shorter (longer) than those for spin-down electrons. In addition, the group delay time and the dwell time for spin-up and down electrons also relies on the comparative direction of magnetization in two FM layers and tends to saturation with the thickness of the barrier.

It is shown that both for the positive and negative-spherical aberrated beams, the intensity distribution is multi-annular in free space, but it becomes a Gaussian-like profile in turbulence. The positive spherical aberration results in a beam spreading, while the negative spherical aberration causes a beam focusing. The larger the positive spherical aberration, the worse the power in the bucket. However, the dependence of the negative spherical aberration on the power in the bucket is non-monotonic. In particular, the effect of spherical aberration on beam spreading decreases due to turbulence.

Development of the field requires candidate systems with both a high carrier mobility and, in contrast to graphene, a sufficiently large electronic bandgap. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation of the atomic and electronic structure of few-layer black phosphorus (BP) to predict its electrical and optical properties. This system has a direct bandgap, tunable from 1.51 eV for a monolayer to 0.59 eV for a five-layer sample. We predict that the mobilities are hole-dominated, rather high and highly anisotropic. The monolayer is exceptional in having an extremely high hole mobility (of order 10,000 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)) and anomalous elastic properties which reverse the anisotropy. Light absorption spectra indicate linear dichroism between perpendicular in-plane directions, which allows optical determination of the crystalline orientation and optical activation of the anisotropic transport properties. These results make few-layer BP a promising candidate for future electronics.

Here, pelage color variants of the two sibling species (Sorex cylindricauda and Sorex bedfordiae) were uncovered in different sampling sites. Our data may initiate new interest to pelage color variants in small mammals. Furthermore, the classification of two striped shrews has been controversial for several decades. We conducted a detailed examination of the morphometric characters for the two sibling shrews. Significant differences between the two species morphologically confirmed the two-species classification status.

Removal of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in UPW by synergistic photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						isopropyl alcohol; granule activated carbon; nitrogen doped titanium dioxide; photocatalytic oxidation; adsorption	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; ACTIVATED CARBON GAC; NITROGEN-DOPED TIO2; WASTE-WATER; TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; LIGHT; DEGRADATION; SYSTEM; CONTAMINANTS; IRRADIATION	Earlier work showed that the commercial granular activated carbon (GAC) could effectively remove large non-polar molecules, but showed poor removal efficiency for small polar compounds such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) [Schmotzer et al. Clean Technol. Environ. Policy 2002;4:125; Cong et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2007;111:6976]. To achieve the goal of increasing the lifetime and removal efficiency of GAC bed for small polar organic compounds in ultrapure water (UPW), the synergistic partial photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption system using commercial GAC coated with nitrogen doped titanium dioxide as an adsorbate was proposed in this work. The influence of operating factors such as UV intensity, flow rate, feed concentration, and the sudden injection of air or inorganic acid on IPA removal efficiency was systematically investigated. Compared to the traditional GAC adsorption bed, at feed total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of 800ppb, the lifetime of GAC bed in this synergistic photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption system was extended from 348 to 600min and the outlet TOC concentration was decreased from 793 to 499ppb. The difference of the TOC outlet concentration in those two configurations was attributed to the photocatalytic effect by GAC coated with nitrogen doped titanium dioxide. The reactions between oxidation radicals and organic contaminants caused the majority of IPA to be decomposed into secondary organic compounds such as acetone and acetone had already been shown a higher affinity to GAC than that of IPA. Experiments also demonstrated the injection of air or inorganic acid in the stream would facilitate the removal of IPA in UPW.

The spreading is less affected by atmospheric turbulence (AT) when z<z(T), while the spreading is dominated by AT when z>z(TT). The dependence of z(T) and z(TT) on the turbulence parameters and the beam parameters is studied in detail. It is Found that both z(T) and z(TT) reach their minimums when the fractal constant of the atmospheric power spectrum is equal to 3.11. However, the dependence of z(TT) On turbulence parameters and beam parameters is much larger than that of zT. There exists a minimum of zT versus the waist width, but z(TT) decreases monotonically as the waist width increases. On the other hand, the relation between the turbulence distance z(T) and the Rayleigh range z(R) is investigated, It is shown that z(T)=z(R) may appear when a suitable waist width or a suitable coherent parameter is chosen. For the small free-space diffraction (FD) case z(T)<z(R) may hold, but for the large FD case it may be z(T)>z(R). Some physical explanations for the results obtained in this paper are also given.

It is well-known that there exists a self-dual normal basis of F-2(n) over F-2 if and only if 4 dagger n. In this paper, we prove that there exists a normal element alpha of F-2(n)= over F-2 corresponding to a prescribed vector a = (a(0), a(1), . . . , a(n-1)) is an element of F-2(n) such that a(i) = Tr-2(n)vertical bar 2(alpha(1+22)) for 0 <= i <= n - 1, where n is a 2-power or odd, if and only if the given vector a is symmetric (a(i) = a(n-i) for all i, 1 <= i <= n-1), and one of the following is true. [GRAPHICS] Furthermore we give an algorithm to obtain normal elements corresponding to prescribed vectors in the above two cases. For a general positive integer n with 4 vertical bar n, some necessary conditions for a vector to be the corresponding vector of a normal element of F-2(n) over F-2 are given. And for all n with 4 vertical bar n, we prove that there exists a normal element of F-2(n) over F-2 such that the Hamming weight of its corresponding vector is 3, which is the lowest possible Hamming weight.

The electromagnetic wave propagates in the z-axis direction with a frequency of 2.45 GHz, and the intensity of the E/H field is 3.4 x 10(4) V/m. The results indicate that as the concentration of the electrolyte solution increased, the electrical conductivity gradually increased, but the hydrogen bonds number and the coordination number decreased. In addition, the change of conductivity decreases with the increase of temperature when electromagnetic field is applied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AMPHIBIA URODELA SALAMANDRIDAE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; GUIZHOU PROVINCE; PACHYTRITON; MITOCHONDRIAL; GUANGXI; BIOGEOGRAPHY; LONGLIENSIS; GUANGDONG; RECORD	The matrilineal genealogy of the genus Paramesotriton is hypothesized based on DNA sequences from mitochondrial NADH subunit two (ND2) and its flanking tRNAs (tRNA(Trp) and a partial tRNA(Ala)). The genealogy identifies a highly divergent, unnamed lineage from Qixiling Nature Reserve, Jiangxi, China and places it as the sister taxon of P. chinensis. The newly discovered population differs from other congeners by several features of external morphology including having large clusters of dark brown conical warts on the dorsum of the head, lateral surface of the body and dorsolateral ridges. Its intermittent dorsal vertebral ridge is the same color as other parts of the dorsum and tail narrows gradually from the base to the tip. Further, the new population differs from all congeners by an uncorrected P-distance of more than 9.38% in ND2. Consequently, we describe the new species of Asian warty newt (Salamandridae) as Paramesotriton qixilingensis sp. nov.

The co-catalytic effect of the ligand benzotriazole (BtH) was analyzed in details based on a previous experiment reported by Verma that a general and efficient C-S coupling reaction by means of inexpensive catalysts CuI/BtH (Verma et al., 2007). In order to provide comparative data, the structures have been optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level in the gas phase and in solution, N,N-dimethyl formamide being the solvent. Our calculated results interpreted that the ligand of BtH can significantly promote the C-S coupling reaction, i.e., reduce the energy barriers in the steps of the C-S coupling and the CuBr dissociation. Furthermore, the mechanism we proposed can be extended to other C-S coupling reaction catalyzed by Cu(I) complexes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dielectric spectra of DMF-water mixture with an asymmetric shape are observed. The mixture behavior is described according to the Cole-Davidson model using four parameters (epsilon(infinity), epsilon(0), tau and beta). The number of hydrogen bonds between the water-water and DMF-water pairs is estimated from the values of the static dielectric constant by using the Luzar model. The model provides a satisfactory explanation of the experimental results related to the static dielectric constant. The hydrogen bond binding energies for water-water (pair 11) and DMF-water (pair 12) are estimated to be 13.01 and 13.10 kJ/mol, we report a new strategy to parameterize effective DMF-water cluster interactions to provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of the relaxation acts.

The transcriptome profiles of G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 grown with cholesterol, androstenedione (AD), and pyruvic acid were compared by RNA-Seq. The sterol catabolic genes are highly conserved in G. neofelifaecis, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The RNA-Seq results indicated that the genes involved in the sterol side chain cleavage were exclusively induced by cholesterol, while the genes involved in the degradation of rings A/B and C/D were up-regulated by both cholesterol and AD. It appears that the induction mechanisms for the genes responsible for side chain cleavage and those for degradation of rings are different. There are approximately 21 genes encoding transporter proteins that are differentially expressed in cholesterol or AD compared with pyruvic acid. The genes camABCD and camM encode two systems that take up cholate, and they have been shown to be cholesterol-and AD-inducible. The potential biological functions of other differentially expressed genes are also discussed. These results will promote the functional characterization of the sterol catabolic genes and also provide important clues in understanding the mechanisms of their gene expression, and they may help us understand the mechanism underlying microbial cholesterol catabolism.

The thermal properties of the AgGaSe2 are calculated using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The pressure and temperature dependences of the bulk modulus, the heat capacity, the Gruneisen parameter, the Debye temperature and the thermal expansion coefficient, as well as the entropy, are obtained in the ranges of 0-6 GPa and 0-1200 K.

For Gaussian array beams, the analytical expressions of z(c) are derived. For the coherent combination, z(c) is larger than that for the incoherent combination. However, in non-Kolmogorov turbulence, the cross point disappears, and the Gaussian array beams will have the same directionality in terms of the angular spread. Furthermore, a short propagation distance is needed to reach the same directionality when the generalized exponent is equal to 3.108. In particular, it is shown that the condition obtained in previous studies is not necessary for laser beams to have the same directionality in turbulence, which is explained physically. On the other hand, the relative average intensity distributions at the position where the Gaussian array beams have the same mean-squared beam width are also examined.

The ceramics can be well sintered at the wide low sintering temperature range 930 degrees C-990 degrees C and possess a pure perovskite structure. The ceramics with x/y=0.01-0.02/1.0 sintered at 960 degrees C possess high resistivity (similar to 2x109 center dot cm), strong ferroelectricity (Pr=19.1-20.4m/cm2), good piezoelectric properties (d33=127-128pC/N, kp=36.6%-36.9%), and very high Curie temperature (618 degrees C-636 degrees C). The increase in sintering temperature improves the densification, electric insulation, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. A small amount of Sc doping (x0.04) and the increase in the sintering temperature significantly enhance the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics. Improved ferromagnetism with remnant magnetization Mr of 0.059 and 0.10emu/g and coercive field Hc of 2.51 and 2.76kOe are obtained in the ceramics with x/y=0.04/1.0 (sintered at 960 degrees C) and 0.02/1.0 (sintered at 1050 degrees C), respectively. Because of the high TC (636 degrees C), the ceramic with x/y=0.02/1.0 shows good temperature stability of piezoelectric properties. Our results also show that the addition of MnO2 is essential to obtain the ceramics with good electrical properties and electric insulation.

The sample consisted of 51 Caucasian-Australians, 51 people of Chinese heritage living in Australia (PCHA) and 51 Mainland Chinese. Participants were required to identify the emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust displayed in photographs of Caucasian and Chinese faces. The PCHA group also responded to an acculturation measure that assessed their adoption of Australian cultural values and adherence to heritage (Chinese) cultural values. Counter to the hypotheses, the Caucasian-Australian and PCHA groups were found to be significantly more accurate at identifying both the Chinese and Caucasian facial expressions than the Mainland Chinese group. Adoption of Australian culture was found to predict greater accuracy in recognising the emotions displayed on Caucasian faces for the PCHA group.

The analytical expressions for the centroid position deviation gamma, the average intensity, the mean-squared beam width and the far-field divergence angle at the receiver plane are derived. It is found that tilted and off-axis active detection laser beams cannot be reflected back by a cat-eye optical lens in the direction of the source. The absolute deviation decreases as the beam coherence decreases. Therefore, partially coherent beams are more suitable as active detection laser beams than fully coherent ones. In addition, decreases greatly due to the aperture effect, and the influence of turbulence on is not monotonic. On the other hand, the influence of the beam coherence and the atmospheric turbulence on the average intensity, the mean-squared beam width and the far-field divergence angle at the receiver plane is also examined, and some interesting results are obtained. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for applications of the active laser detection.
