However, the geometric shape of these manifolds is largely unclear. The purpose of the present paper is to try to describe the geometric shape of invariant manifolds for a class of stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative white noises. The local geometric shape of invariant manifolds is approximated, which holds with significant likelihood. Furthermore, the result is compared with that for the corresponding deterministic partial differential equations. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Propagation properties of apertured laser beams with amplitude modulations and phase fluctuations through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Spring Meeting of the AMOP Section of the German-Physical-Society	MAR 08-12, 2010	Hannover, GERMANY				FLAT-TOPPED BEAMS; GAUSSIAN BEAMS; COHERENT; DIRECTIONALITY; INTENSITY; SYSTEM	The propagation properties of apertured laser beams with amplitude modulations (AMs) and phase fluctuations (PFs) through atmospheric turbulence are studied in detail both analytically and numerically. The analytical expressions for the average intensity, power in the bucket (PIB) and Strehl ratio (S (R) ) of apertured laser beams with AMs and PFs propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived. It is found that the worse the phase fluctuation and the higher the amplitude modulation are, the less laser beams are affected by turbulence. Furthermore, apertured Gaussian beams are more sensitive to turbulence than apertured laser beams with AMs and PFs. The average intensity of apertured laser beams with AMs and PFs may be even larger than that of apertured Gaussian beams due to turbulence. In particular, the influence of turbulence on the average maximum intensity of apertured laser beams with PFs and AMs may become serious if an unsuitable truncated parameter is chosen, which should be avoided in practice.

We present a systematic investigation of optical properties of BC5 in P3m1 and I-4m2 phases at ambient and high pressure in the framework of density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in this paper. Optical properties such as dielectric function, refractive index, absorption, reflectivity and electron energy-loss spectrum are obtained successfully. The feature in the spectra of the optical parameters is discussed. Through calculation, we find BC5 is optically anisotropic. Moreover, the dielectric function exhibits a large change at 70 GPa pressure for P3m1 BC5 phase, but I-4m2 phase not, indicating the stable electronic structure that the I-4m2 phase possesses.

Eleven stable structures of the catechin-cytosine complexes have been found respectively. The results indicate that the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. Theories of atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) have been utilized to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all the systems. The interaction energies of all the complexes which were corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), are from -17.35 to -43.27 kJ/mol. The results show that the hydrogen bonding contributes to the interaction energies dominantly. The corresponding bonds stretching motions in all the complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer, which is in good agreement with experimental results.

It is found that the nucleation field H (N) decreases uniformly as the size of the soft phase L (s) increases whereas it increases with the size of the hard phase L (h) . The analysis shows that whilst the effect of L (h) could be ignored in most cases, where the nucleation field is dominated by the L (s) and the calculation could be significantly simplified, the overly simple inverse square law between H (N) and the soft layer thickness L (s) adopted by the previous researchers is not a good approximation. While nucleation is the beginning of the magnetic reversal, pinning is the dominant coercivity mechanism in both two-phased and single-phased magnetic materials, where the crystalline defects exist. Comparison with the experimental data confirms this conclusion, indicating that Brown's paradox results from the much lower effective anisotropy in both single-phased and composite materials, as speculated in the literature.

The server in the system is assumed to provide two different types of services, namely essential and optional services, to the customer. During the operation of the system, the arrival of the catastrophe will break the system down and simultaneously induce customer to leave the system immediately. Using a new type discrete supplementary variable technique, the authors obtain some performance characteristics of the queueing system, including the steady-state availability and failure frequency of the system, the steady-state probabilities for the server being idle, busy, breakdown and the loss probability of the system etc. Finally, by the numerical examples, the authors study the influence of the system parameters on several performance measures.

Taking the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam as a typical example of partially coherent beams, the analytical formula of the M-2-factor of truncated GSM beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived. It is shown that the M-2-factor decreases as the truncation parameter delta and the coherence parameter a increase. However, the M-2-factor in turbulence is more sensitive to delta than that in free space. On the other hand, the M-2-factor of truncated partially coherent beams with smaller delta is more affected by turbulence. In addition, the effect of turbulence on the M-2-factor of truncated GSM beams is less sensitive to the coherence parameter a than that of nontruncated GSM beams.

Under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (Err), we calculate the squeezing and entanglement spectra of the output probe fields. By analyzing the output spectrum, we find that the squeezing and entanglement of the probe fields can be well-preserved after passing through the optically thick medium. Additionally, the effects of the ground state dephasing rates of the atoms on the entanglement and squeezing of the output two-mode squeezed fields are investigated. It is shown that the dephasing rates will degrade the entanglement and squeezing, and these quantum properties can be lost when the dephasing rates increase up to a certain value. This will be useful in the quantum computation and quantum communication. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ding, J. L.; Hou, B.

The influence of turbulence on the Rayleigh range of partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beams is studied. It is shown that the Rayleigh range of partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beams depends on the strength of turbulence and the beam parameters. The Rayleigh range decreases due to turbulence. The stronger the turbulence, the shorter the Rayleigh range is. In free space, the Rayleigh range increases with the increase of beam coherence parameter alpha, beam parameter beta and Gaussian waist width w(0), and the decrease of wave length lambda. However, the Rayleigh range is less sensitive to turbulence with alpha, beta and w(0) decreasing and A increasing. Furthermore, the influence of turbulence can be ignored when alpha, beta and w(0) are small enough and A is large enough.

The physical characteristics of Li4Ti5O12/C composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, particle size distribution and thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetry techniques. Their electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectra, constant current charge-discharge and rate charge-discharge. These analyses indicated that the carbon source and carbon content have a great effect on the physical and electrochemical performances of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. An ideal carbon source and appropriate carbon content effectively improved the electrical contact between the Li4Ti5O12 particles, which enhanced the discharge capacity and rate capability of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. PAA was the best carbon source for the synthesis of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. When the carbon content was 3.49 wt.% (LiOH center dot H2O/PAA molar ratio of 1), as-prepared Li4Ti5O12/C showed the maximum discharge capacity. At 0.2 C. initial capacity of the optimized sample was 168.6 mAh g(-1) with capacity loss of 2.8% after 50 cycles. At 8 and 10 C, it showed discharge capacities of 143.5 and 132.7 mAh g(-1), with capacity loss of 8.7 and 9.9% after 50 cycles, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compared with the ion-substituted hole-type LaCoO3 systems (e.g., La1-xSrxCoO3), the thermal conduction of La1-xCoO3-y is noticeably reduced by the La/O vacancies, whereas the electric transport is less influenced, which results in an efficient ZT enhancement. We demonstrate that the large thermal conductivity reduction originates from the strong point-defect scattering, and La1-xCoO3-y can be rationalized as a partially filled solid solution: La1-x square xCoO3-y square(y), where square denotes a vacancy. Such intrinsic thermal conductivity suppression provides an effective pathway for the design of better TE materials.

Effect of La doping on the electronic structure and optical properties of ZnO	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						First-principles; La-doped ZnO; Electronic structure; Optical properties	ZINC-OXIDE FILMS; THIN-FILMS; DOPED ZNO	The electronic structure and optical properties of ZnO doped with La have been investigated using density functional theory based on first-principles ultrasoft pseudopotential method. The calculated results show that the La doping increases the bandgap of ZnO, in agreement with the experimental results; while the Fermi level shifts into the conduction band, revealing the so-called Burstein-Moss effect. In comparison to pure ZnO, a new peak appears in the imaginary part of dielectric function in the system doped with La and the optical absorption edge has been obviously changed. Moreover, the covalent property of Zn(1-x)La(x)O is found to weaken with the increase of La concentration. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The calculated conductance near E-F shows a V-shaped spectrum, consistent with STM measurements. The spins in the helical states at E-F not only tilts out of the two-dimensional plane, they also oscillate with a 3-fold symmetry going around the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.

The sintering temperature of LiFePO4/C precursor is studied by thermo-gravimetric (TG)/differential thermal analysis (DTA). The physical properties of LiFePO4/C are then investigated through analysis using by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the electrochemical properties are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), cyclic voltammogram (CV) and constant current charge/discharge test. The LiFePO4/C composite with the particle size of similar to 200 nm shows better discharge capacity (156.4 mAh g(-1)) than bare LiFePO4 (52.3 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2 C due to the improved electronic conductivity which is demonstrated by EIS. The as-prepared LiFePO4/C through this method also shows excellent high-rate characteristic and cycle performance. The initial discharge capacity of the sample is 120.5 mAh g(-1) and the capacity retention rate is 100.6% after 50 cycles at 5 C rate. The results prove that the using of organic lithium salts can obtain a high performance LiFePO4/C composite. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accurate calculation of the nucleation field and hysteresis loops in hard-soft multilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MAGNETS	In this paper, the nucleation field H(N), hysteresis loops, and coercivity mechanism for hard/soft multilayers have been investigated within a self-contained micromagnetic model, which change with the strength of the interface exchange coupling J(i) as well as the thickness of the hard and soft layers L h and L(s). Analyses show that the nucleation field goes up as the interface exchange coupling increases. However, J(i) has a significant effect on HN only when L(s) is about 10% of the domain wall width of the soft phase while the thickness of the hard layer is larger than its domain wall width. The hysteresis loops of the Nd(2)Fe(14)B/alpha-Fe/Nd(2)Fe(14)B trilayers for various J(i) have been calculated. The calculated pinning field decreases when J(i) increases. It is found that, as L(s) increases, the coercivity mechanism changes from pinning to nucleation. The change of exchange coupling at the interface influences the soft layer thickness, at which the coercivity starts to deviate from pinning. The critical thickness of the soft phase, at which the behavior of the hysteresis loop changes from the single-phased one to the two-phased one, decreases as J(i) decreases, so that the "rigid composite magnet" appears only when L(s) is very small for smaller J(i).

The notion of the Yosida approximation introduced by Moudafi in Hilbert spaces is first generalized to reflexive Banach spaces. By using the notion of the Yosida approximation, a system of generalized equation problems is considered and its equivalence with the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems is also proved. By using the system of generalized equation problems, a new iterative algorithm for solving the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems is suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. These results are new and unify and generalize some recent results in this field.

I. SPECTRAL COMPONENTS AND THE POSSIBLE PHYSICAL ORIGINS OF LAT/GBM GRBs	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma-ray burst: general	HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; INVERSE COMPTON EMISSION; INTERNAL SHOCK MODEL; DELAYED GEV EMISSION; PROMPT EMISSION; AFTERGLOW EMISSION; BATSE OBSERVATIONS; THERMAL EMISSION; SPACE-TELESCOPE; EXTERNAL MATTER	We present a systematic analysis of the spectral and temporal properties of 17 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) codetected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite in 2010 May. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of all the bursts, with the finest temporal resolution allowed by statistics, to reduce temporal smearing of different spectral components. We found that the time-resolved spectra of 14 out of 17 GRBs are best modeled with the classical "Band" function over the entire Fermi spectral range, which may suggest a common origin for emissions detected by the LAT and GBM. GRB 090902B and GRB 090510 require the superposition of an MeV component and an extra power-law component, with the former having a sharp cutoff above E-p. For GRB 090902B, this MeV component becomes progressively narrower as the time bin gets smaller, and can be fit with a Planck function as the time bin becomes small enough. In general, we speculate that, phenomenologically, there may be three elemental spectral components that shape the time-resolved GRB spectra: a Band-function component (e. g., in GRB 080916C) that extends over a wide energy range and does not narrow with decreasing time bins, which may be of non-thermal origin; a quasi-thermal component (e. g., in GRB 090902B), with spectra progressively narrowing with reducing time bins; and another non-thermal power-law component extending to high energies. The spectra of different bursts may be decomposed into one or more of these elemental components. We compare this sample with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment sample and investigate some correlations among spectral parameters. We discuss the physical implications of the data analysis results for GRB prompt emission, including jet composition (matter-dominated versus Poynting-flux-dominated outflow), emission sites (internal shock, external shock, or photosphere), as well as radiation mechanisms (synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, or thermal Compton upscattering).

In this study, a hybrid of genetic algorithm and support vector machines (G-SVM) approach is presented in housing price forecasting. Support vector machine (SVM) has been proven to be a robust and competent algorithm for both classification and regression in many applications. However, how to select the most appropriate the training parameter value is the important problem in the using of SVM. Compared to Grid algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA) method consumes less time and performs well. Thus, GA is applied to optimize the parameters of SVM simultaneously. The cases in China are applied to testify the housing price forecasting ability of G-SVM method. The experimental results indicate that forecasting accuracy of this G-SVM approach is more superior than GM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intermediates were purified and characterized. Quantitative analysis of the accumulated metabolites from cholesterol side-chain cleavage was conducted during the biotransformation. The results showed that the profile of accumulated intermediates was different from those of other reported microorganisms. Among the five metabolites, androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) was the main product of the side-chain degradation, with a high conversion rate (87.2%), indicating its potential for industrial production of ADD. At the end of transformation, the substrate cholesterol was completely consumed. The effect of some factors on the bioconversion was also investigated. To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding cholesterol side-chain cleavage using bacteria belonging to Gordonia.

The blue-green algae powered MFC produced a maximum power density of 114 mW/m(2) at a current density of 0.55 mA/m(2). Coupled with the bioenergy generation, high removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen were also achieved in MFCs. Over 78.9% of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), 80.0% of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), 91.0% of total nitrogen (total-N) and 96.8% ammonium-nitrogen (NH(3)-N) were removed under closed circuit conditions in 12 days, which were much more effective than those under open circuit and anaerobic reactor conditions. Most importantly, the MFC showed great ability to remove microcystins released from blue-green algae. Over 90.7% of MC-RR and 91.1% of MC-LR were removed under closed circuit conditions (500 Omega). This study showed that the MFC could provide a potential means for electricity production from blue-green algae coupling algae toxins removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and fluorescence analysis (FA); and the effect of the doping of Dy3+ ions on the microstructures and luminescence properties of the CaMoO4:Dy-x(3+) phosphors were also investigated. Our results reveal that the obtained CaMoO4:Dy-x(3+) phosphor powders are single-phase scheelite structure with tetragonal symmetry. The doping of Dy3+ ion inhibits the grain growth, decreases the intrinsic emission of MoO42- complex ions. With regard to CaMoO4:Dy-x(3+) phosphors, a bright fluorescent yellow emission at 574 nm (F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2)) and blue emission at 487 nm (F-4(9/2) -> F-6(15/2)) have been observed. The decay time of the two emission spectra (487 nm and 574 nm) of Dy3+ ion both decrease with increasing Dy3+ concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis shows that J(1) has significant influence on the magnetic orientation, the pinning field H-p and the coercivity mechanism. When L-8: is small, H-p equals to H-N where the coercivity mechanism transforms from nucleation to pinning as J(1) decreases, whereas for large L-s this trend is reversed. The critical thickness, at which the nucleation field and pinning field detaches, decreases as J(1) decreases. When the reduced exchange coupling is considered, the rigid composite magnet appears only when L-8 is very small. The reduced exchange coupling leads to a sudden change of angle of magnetization at the interface, which results in the change of the behavior of the trilayers from the single-phase one to the two-phase one and in the decrease of H-N whereas H-p increases when L-8 is larger.

The geometries of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products have been optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The vibration analysis has been performed to demonstrate the authenticity of transition states. The reaction processes are also confirmed by the changes of charge density at bond-forming critical point which analyzed by the atoms in molecules (AIM) theory. In addition, the nature bond orbital (NBO) analysis is carried out to discuss the bond nature and orbital interactions of the species in the reactions. Compared with that of the reaction without catalyst, the activation energy of that with InCl3 decreases by 339.55 kJ mol(-1). Thus, the present computational results indicate that InCl3 is an effective catalyst. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculations of the impurity formation energies and ionization energies for these systems indicate that incorporating the reactive donor F into N doped ZnO systems, not only enhances the N acceptor solubility, but also leads to a shallower N acceptor energy level in the band gap in p-type codoped ZnO. In addition, we analyze the imaginary part of the dielectric functions, and reflectivities for pure and N-F codoped ZnO. Compared with the pure ZnO, the remarkable feature in the dielectric function for N-F codoped ZnO is that there is a sharp peak in the low-energy region.	[Wen, J.; Zuo, C.

Nucleation field, hysteresis loop, coercivity mechanism and critical thickness in composite multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Composite multilayers; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetics	MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; MEDIA; FILMS	Analytical expression for the nucleation field has been derived for a hard/soft multilayer system with anisotropy perpendicular to the film plane, which depends on the soft thickness L(s), the interface exchange coupling constant J(i) and the intrinsic material parameters. Both nucleation field and coercivity decrease as L(s) increases. For very small L(s), the coercivity mechanism is pure nucleation and the hysteresis loops are square. As L(s) rises, the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning gradually, where the hysteresis loops have to be calculated numerically. The critical thickness at which the mechanism varies has been discussed in detail on the basis of easy axis orientation and the interface exchange coupling constant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Reduced exchange coupling and hysteresis loops in two-phased magnetic nanosystem	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Composite Magnet; Multilayer; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetics	NANOLAYERS	The reduced exchange coupling has been incorporated in our micromagnetic calculations for the hysteresis loops of Nd(2)Fe(14)B/alpha-Fe and Sm(40)Fe(60)/Ni(80)Fe(20) multilayers. Analysis shows that nucleation and pinning fields are sensitive to the value of the interface coupling constant J(i) when the soft layer thickness L(s) is small. Hysteresis loops have been obtained for a trilayer system with a soft alpha-Fe sandwiched between two Nd(2)Fe(14)B layers for different values of L(s) and J(i). As J(i) decreases, nucleation field decreases while the pinning field increases. In the meantime, the squareness of the loops is deteriorated, which results in smaller energy product. For thick soft layer the coercivity mechanism transforms from pinning to nucleation as the interface coupling decreases, and vice versa. The above calculations have been extended to a Sm(40)Fe(60)/Ni(80)Fe(20) bilayer and compared with available experimental data. The theoretical loop is consistent with the experimental one when the value of J(i) is taken as 10% of the bulk one, demonstrating that the interface coupling in the experiment is far away from perfect coupling.

The structure of the LiFePO4/C composites was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The micromorphology of the precursor and LiFePO4/C powders was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the in situ coating of carbon on the particles was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and constant current charge/discharge cycling tests. The results showed that the sample synthesized at 700 degrees C had the best electrochemical performance, exhibiting initial discharge capacities of 157, 139 and 109 mAh g(-1) at rates of 0.1, 1 and 5 C, respectively. Moreover, the sample presented excellent capacity retention as there was no significant capacity fade after 50 cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Hamiltonian of our system is solved by means of the slave-boson mean-field approximation, and the variation of the density of states, the transmission probability, the occupation number, and the Rondo temperature with the interdot Coulomb repulsion are discussed in the Rondo regime. The density of states is calculated for various interdot Coulomb repulsions with both parallel and antiparallel lead-polarization alignments. Our results reveal that the interdot Coulomb repulsion greatly influences the physical property of this system, and relevant underlying physics of this system is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, the existence of the ground state for the system derives the best constant of a Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and the variational character of the ground state. Secondly, the blow-up threshold of the Davey-Stewartson system is developed in R-3. Thirdly, the mass concentration is established for all the blow-up solutions of the system in R-2. Finally, the existence of the minimal blow-up solutions in R-2 is constructed by using the pseudo-conformal invariance. The profile of the minimal blow-up solutions as t -> T (blow-up time) is in detail investigated in terms of the ground state. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fabrication of uniform Ge-nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SiO2 films using Ge-ion implantation and neutron irradiation methods	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							TRANSMUTATION-DOPED GAAS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; MISFIT DISLOCATIONS; LASERS GO; SILICON; FILMS	Uniform Ge-nanocrystals (Ge-ncs) embedded in amorphous SiO2 film were formed by using Ge-74(+) ion implantation and neutron transmutation doping (NTD) method. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the existence of As dopants transmuted from Ge-74 by NTD tunes the already stabilized (crystallized) system back to a metastable state and then activates the mass transfer processes during the transition form this metastable state back to the stable (crystallized) state, and hence the nanocrystal size uniformity and higher volume density of Ge-ncs. This method has the potential to open a route in the three-dimensional nanofabrication. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

A system of auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problems (SAGMEPs) for solving the SGMEPs is first introduced. Existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the SAGMEPs is proved under quite mild assumptions without any coercive conditions in reflexive Banach spaces. Using the auxiliary principle technique, a new iterative algorithm for solving the SGMEPs is proposed and analyzed. Strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is also proved under quite mild assumptions without any coercive conditions. These results improve, unify, and generalize some recent results in this field.

For most people, diet is the main route of exposure to potentially harmful elements, so determination of the concentrations of these elements in foodstuffs and assessment of their possible risk for humans via dietary intake is very important. This study was designed to investigate the concentrations of different elements, including Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn and Se in foodstuffs and to estimate the potential health risk of these elements via consumption of polluted foodstuffs in the Wanshan Hg mine area. Guizhou province, SW China. The multielemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) were calculated to evaluate the potential health risk from individual and combined potentially harmful elements due to dietary intake. The average contents of Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn and Se in the most frequently consumed foodstuffs were: 31, 248, 121, 1035 and 32 mu g/kg respectively. Among them, Cd and Hg were the most important contributors to potentially harmful elements contamination in Wanshan. Eight of 10 kinds of vegetables were contaminated to various levels by different elements but the samples of rice, pork, radish and potato were below the stipulated limits for toxic elements. In this study, the average dietary intakes of Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn, Se by an adult man of 60 kg living in Wanshan were: 27, 167, 86, 1061, 42 mu g/day. respectively. The HIs for multielement dietary intake was 3.11, with the relative contributions of Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn and Se being 22.3%, 24.3%, 45.0%, 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively, which indicated that consumption of food poses a potential health risk. Vegetables were found to be the main source of potentially harmful element dietary intake. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that: (1) the presence of the vacancy causes defective states within the band gap of LiF; (2) the optical absorption of LiF in the visible-light region is not influenced by the vacancy point-defect ( absorption coefficients are still zero); (3) in the ultra-violet region, the weak absorption induced by the Li-1 vacancy, appears within similar to 99-114 nm, and the relatively strong absorption induced by the F+1 vacancy exists in the range of 99-262 nm; (4) effects of the Li-1 and F+1 vacancy on reflectivity and loss-function show mainly in the ultra-violet region, which is similar to those of optical absorption.

The introduction of substituents resulted in considerable red shifts for the highest absorption wavelength of the Pt complexes. The lowest energy excitation absorption mainly consisted of d ->pi(star) and pi ->pi(star) excitations from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Metal to ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) and ligand to ligand charge-transfer (LLCT) were mainly involved. Adulteration with the transition metals Pt and Ag resulted in a significant increase in the third-order nonlinear optical coefficient gamma of 8-hydroxyquinolinolate. The introduction of -Ph, -PhOCH3, -PhF2, and -PhF5 further improved the gamma value of the 8-hydroxyquinolinolate metal complexes. The gradient of the gamma value increased with an increase in the electron-donating ability of the introduced substituent. This gradient was lower for substituent with a higher electron-accepting ability.

The adsorption property of this new adsorbent to ions of light rare earth such as La3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+ (RE3+) in aqueous solution was investigated. Results show that the optimum pH value of this adsorbent to La3+ is about 5.0, while the optimum value of Pr3+ and Nd3+ is about 5.5. The equilibrium adsorption capacity will decline significantly when the pH value of reaction system is changed from the optimum pH value. Compared with the effect of pH value, the influence of the temperature on the equilibrium adsorption capacity is weaker, and at 303 K the equilibrium adsorption capacity of this adsorbent to RE3+ is optimal. At 303 K and the optimum pH value, when the initial concentration of RE3+ solution is 5.0 mmol.L-1 and the dosage of adsorbent is 0.10 g, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of this adsorbent to La3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+ are 217.26, 228.56 and 329.76 mg.g(-1), respectively. The adsorption isotherm can be described by the Freundlich equation. This adsorption kinetics data of this adsorbent to RE3+ is fitted with the pseudo-second-order rate model well and the equilibrium adsorption capacities calculated by the model are consistent with the experimental data with the warps in 7 %.

The obtained LiCoO2 thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The influence of electrochemical reaction time, current density and concentration of LiOH solution on the crystal structure and morphology of the obtained LiCoO2 thin films was discussed emphatically. Our results show that the as-synthesized LiCoO2 films all are pure hexagonal structure. The crystallinity, densification and uniformity of the films increase with increasing electrochemical reaction time, current density as well as concentration of LiOH solution and then decrease. The preferable electrochemical reaction conditions were optimized as: electrochemical reaction time is 50 h, current density is 1 mA cm(-2) and concentration of LiOH solution is 3 mol dm(-3).

Background: Cancer chemoprevention is a proven effective strategy for oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). The present study was designed to investigate the effects of crocin, a potential chemopreventive agent, on growth and DNA and RNA content in a human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line, Tca8113. Methods: Tca8113 cells were treated with crocin for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mM. Tumor cell viability was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, Tca8113 cells were treated with 0.4 mM crocin and cytotoxic effects as an inducer of apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Furthermore, acridine orange (AO) staining and observation using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to determine the effects of the drug on nucleic acid synthesis. Results: Crocin decreased Tca8113 cell viability and growth remarkably at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05). In addition, 0.4 mM crocin significantly induced both early and late apoptosis of Tca8113 cells. Moreover, the cellular DNA and RNA content was significantly downregulated by 0.4 mM crocin compared with the negative control (P<0.01). Conclusions: Our observations support the feasibility of applying crocin as a chemoprophylactic agent and treatment for OSCCs.

The bonding processing of TiO(2)molecule on the surface of GaN( 0001 ), the adsorption energy, and the adsorption orientation are investigated. The results indicate that Ti atom is adsorbed on fcc site or on hcp site, and two O atoms are combined with two Ga atoms on the GaN surface after adsorption. The chemical bonding of Ga-O shows a covalent feature, and the chemical bonding energy is achieved to be 7. 932 7. 943 eV. The O-O line directions lie along the GaN [ 11 (2) over bar0 ] directions, in accordance with experimental reports of ( 100 ) [ 001 ] TiO2// ( 0001 ) [ 11 (2) over bar0 ] GaN. From ab initio dynamics calculation, the adsorption process can be divided into physical adsorption, chemical adsorption and superficial stable state, and the stable adsorption site is in accordance with the optimized results.

It is shown that CO molecules can be absorbed to Au atoms on the wall of Au-doped SWCNT with a bingding energy as high as 2. 1 eV, and can attract lager charge transfer 0. 23. Compared with the intrinsic SWCNT, the Au-doped SWCNT presents a high sensitivity to CO in terms of the calculated geometrical structures and electronic properties, Furthermore, the calculated electron densities of two representative adsorption positions show that Au-doped SWCNT electron clouds overlap more on the top of carbon adsorbed CO. By comparison with the oxygen absorption on SWCNT, we infer that the molecular CO absorbed on Au-doped SWCNT can induce significant change in the conductivity of SWCNT. So Au-doped SWCNT is expected to be a potential candidate for detecting the presence of CO.

Significant effect of oxygen atmosphere on the structure, optical and electrical properties of Ti-doped In2O3 transparent conductive thin films	OPTICA APPLICATA			English	Article						transparent oxide; indium oxide; thin films; electrical properties; optical properties	PULSED-LASER DEPOSITION; INDIUM OXIDE; HIGH-MOBILITY; MOLYBDENUM; DEFECTS	Titanium-doped indium oxide (In2O3) transparent conductive thin films were deposited on glass and sapphire (0001) substrates with/without oxygen atmosphere by DC magnetron sputtering at 300 degrees C. The content of titanium is estimated to be about 1.8 at.% using energy dispersive spectroscopy. The smooth surfaces were covered with more uniform octahedral grains. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that the preferential growth orientation along the (400) plane for the sample grown without oxygen atmosphere shifts to (222) for the sample grown in the oxygen atmosphere. The average optical transmittance of the sample grown with the introduction of oxygen varies from 70% to 90% in the visible region, which corresponds well to the variation of carrier and mobility. Hence, both intermediate dopant and oxygen atmosphere will provide the optimum balance between carrier concentration and mobility leading to the best transport properties of Ti-doped In2O3 films.

We investigate a general iterative algorithm, which consists of a splitting proximal point step followed by a suitable orthogonal projection onto a hyperplane. Moreover, in our splitting algorithm, we only use the individual resolvent mapping (I + mu(k)partial derivative f)(-1) and never work directly with the operator T + partial derivative f, where mu(k) is a positive real number, T is a set-valued mapping and partial derivative f is the sub-differential of function f. We also prove the convergence of the algorithm for the case that T is a pseudomonotone set-valued mapping and f is a non-smooth convex function.

The reasonability of the approximation of complex Gaussian functions expansion method is studied, and a comparison of this method with the generalised truncated second-order moments method and the asymptotic analysis method is also made. In general, an easy analytical expression for the M-2 factor of truncated laser beams can be derived by using the complex Gaussian functions expansion method. The M-2 factor obtained by using the complex Gaussian functions expansion method is more consistent with that in practice than that obtained by using two other methods. The analytical results obtained by using the complex Gaussian functions expansion method can be reduced to that for the non-truncated case when the truncation parameter is sufficiently large. Therefore, the complex Gaussian functions expansion method is a suitable approximation method for studying the M-2 factor of truncated laser beams.

We find that the oscillatory amplitude of the optical spectra, the transient absorption (gain), and the response time from the transient to the steady situation are remarkably dependent on the SV. When including the VIC, the transient and steady optical properties display a reverse variation with the SV. Additionally, it is interesting to find that the steady population distribution is kept at the same value for different initial conditions in the presence of SV. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Unlike existing methods which diffuse only among the spatial variants, the new method suggests that the diffusion should be performed both among the time variants and spatial variants, named time and space nonlinear anisotropic diffusion (TSNAD). That is, not only the differences of the spatial variants should be estimated by the nearby spatial points but also the differences of the time variants should be approximated by the weighted time differences of nearby points, according to the differences of gray levels between them and the consideration point. Since the time differences of nearby points using NAD can find more points with similar gray levels which form a curve belt for the center pixel on a curve edge, TSNAD can provide satisfied smoothing results while preserving curve edges. The experiments for digital images also show us the ability of TSNAD to preserve curve edges.

The liquid crystal properties were studied with differential scanning calorimetry and polarizing optical microscopy. The influences of amide alkyl chain lengths on the mesomorphism were discussed. Based on the results, we concluded that the triphenylene discogens with an amido-based alkyl chain could form intermolecular hydrogen bonds inside their columnar stacks, and hence, exhibit higher melting and clearing points, and wider mesophase ranges.

Yields of the chiral discotic liquid crystals were achieved up to 84%. Chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR; and mesomorphism was studied by polarized optical microscopy as well as by differential scanning calorimetry. The mesomorphic studies have shown that 1) the chiral discogens have either hexagonal columnar or plastic columnar mesophases; and 2) the introduction of chirality to triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals could widen mesophase range by lowering melting points.

J	Feng, L				Feng, Lin			An intrusion detection approach based on multiple rough classifiers integration	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						multiple rough classifiers; quantum genetic algorithm; the absolute majority voting strategy; rough set; intrusion detection techniques		The study of intrusion detection techniques has been one of the hot spot topics in the field of network security in recent years. For high-dimensional intrusion detection data sets and a single classifier's weak classification ability for data sets with many classes, a novel intrusion detection approach, termed intrusion detection based on multiple rough classifiers integration, is proposed. First, some training data sets are generated from intrusion detection data by random sampling. By combing rough sets and quantum genetic algorithm, a subset of attributes is selected. Then, each simplified data set is trained, which establishes a group of rough classifiers. Finally, the intrusion data classification result is obtained according to the absolute majority voting strategy. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.

The main problem is to compute the error distance of a received word. Using the Weil bound for character sum estimate, Li and Wan showed that the error distance can be determined when the degree of the received word as a polynomial is small. In the first part, the result of Li and Wan is improved. On the other hand, one of the important parameters of an error-correcting code is the dimension. In most cases, one can only get bounds for the dimension. In the second part, a formula for the dimension of the generalized trace Reed-Solomon codes in some cases is obtained.

On the one hand, the existence and uniqueness of the classical solution are proved for the dispersive perturbation of the quasi-linear symmetric system corresponding to the initial value problem of the above nonlinear Schrodinger equation. On the other hand, in the limit system, it is shown that the density converges to the solution of the compressible Euler equation and the validity of the WKB expansion is justified.

The cavity-induced nonlinearity is presented analytically, and its effect results in the appearance of the self-trapping for the Bose-Einstein condensates in the Josephson oscillation regime. In addition, there exists competition between the nonlinearities induced by the interatomic interaction and by the driven cavity for the emergences of self-trapping. Our results show that the driven cavity can be utilized as a possible tool to produce the self-trapping for the condensates with weak interatomic interaction.

It is shown that the M(2)-factor is not a propagation invariant in turbulence, and the turbulence results in an increase of the M(2)-factor. For the incoherent combination, the M(2)-factor of ChG array beams increases with increasing propagation distance, beam parameter, relative beam separation distance and beam number. For the coherent combination, the M(2)-factor of ChG array beams increases with oscillatory behavior as the beam parameter or the relative beam separation distance increases. For the coherent combination the M(2)-factor is always smaller than that for the incoherent combination. However, for the incoherent combination the M(2)-factor is always less sensitive to turbulence than that for the coherent combination. In particular, the influence of turbulence on the M(2)-factor can be reduced by a suitable choice of the relative beam separation distance. With increasing beam number, the M(2)-factor becomes more sensitive to turbulence for the coherent combination, while for the incoherent combination the M(2)-factor becomes less sensitive to turbulence.

It includes 17,660 base pairs, containing 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNAs and 23 tRNAs. A tandem duplication of tRNA(Met) gene was found in this mitochondrial genome, and the similarity between the two tRNA(Met) genes is 85.8%, being the highest in amphibian mitochondrial genomes sequenced thus far. Based on gene organization, 24 types were found from 145 amphibian mitochondrial genomes. Type 1 was present in 108 species, type 11 in 11 species, types 5, 16, 17, and 20 each in two species, and the others each present in one species. Fifteen types were found in Anura, being the most diversity in three orders of the Lissamphibia. Our phylogenetic results using 11 protein-coding gene sequences of 145 amphibian mitochondrial genomes strongly support the monophyly of the Lissamphibia, as well as its three orders, the Gymnophiona, Caudata, and Anura, among which the relationships were ((Gymnophiona (Caudata, Anura)). Based on the phylogenetic trees, type 1 was recognized as the ancestral type for amphibians, and type 11 was the synapomorphic type for the Neobatrachia. Gene rearrangements among lineages provide meaningful phylogenetic information. The rearrangement of the LTPF tRNA gene cluster and the translocation of the ND5 gene only found in the Neobatrachia support the monophyly of this group; similarly, the tandem duplication of the tRNA(Met) genes only found in the Dicroglossidae support the monophyly of this family [Current Zoology 57 (6): 785-805, 2011].

In particular, optimal normal bases are desirable. When no optimal normal basis exists, it is useful to have normal bases with low complexity. In this paper, we improve the upper bounds for the complexity of the trace normal bases over finite fields and prove that these upper bounds can be reached for some extension with small degree. In addition, we construct a class of normal bases with low complexity by this way. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, CL; Tian, SL; Long, B; Chen, F				Yang, Chenglin; Tian, Shulin; Long, Bing; Chen, Fang			Methods of Handling the Tolerance and Test-Point Selection Problem for Analog-Circuit Fault Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Analog fault diagnosis; fault dictionary; fault model; test-point selection; tolerance	DICTIONARY	Soft-fault diagnosis and tolerance are two challenging problems in analog-circuit fault diagnosis. Although many analog faults can be diagnosed theoretically, they cannot be accurately diagnosed due to the influence of component tolerance. This paper proposes approaches to the tolerance-handling method in soft-fault diagnosis. First, the slope fault model and its theoretical proof are presented. In linear analog circuits, the voltage equation between two nodes is linear and can be expressed by a point-slope-form equation in which the point is determined by the nominal voltage values on the two selected nodes, and the slope, which is invariant, can be used as the fault model, which is applicable to both hard (open or short) and soft (parametric) faults. Then, the parameter tolerance is taken into consideration. The point-slope-form equation is governed by a point and a slope value. The tolerance influences the fault diagnosis by shifting both the point and the nominal slope value. These influences can be mitigated in two ways: 1) The point is measured when an actual circuit is under steady state and free of fault, and 2) the maximum slope deviation is readily obtained by using optimization theory if the equation governing the voltage between two nodes is available; otherwise, a threshold proportion coefficient is used to calculate the maximum deviation. Based on these methods, a novel test-point selection approach for the fault dictionary technique is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified by both simulated and experimental results.

This article describes the estimation of tropical forest biomass by using Landsat TM and forest plot data in Xishuangbanna, PR China. The method includes several steps. First, the biomass for each forest permanent plot is calculated by using field inventory data. Second, Landsat TM images are geometrically corrected by using topographic maps. Third, a map of the tropical forest is obtained by using data from a variety of sources such as Landsat TM, digital elevation model (DEM), temperature and precipitation layers and expert knowledge. Finally, the biomass and carbon storage of each forest vegetation type in the forest map is calculated by using the tropical forest map and the forest plot biomass GIS database. In the study area, forest area accounts for 57% of the total 1.7 x 10(6) hectares. The total forest biomass is 2.0 x 10(8) tonne.

The gyrB gene sequence of strain AD-6(T) exhibited similarities of 77-91% with those of the type strains of recognized species of the genus Gordonia, being most similar to the type strains of G. sihwensis, G. hydrophobica and Gordonia hirsuta (91, 87 and 84% similarity, respectively). The results of whole-cell fatty acid analyses and DNA DNA relatedness data readily distinguished the new isolate from its nearest neighbours. Strain AD-6(T) is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia neofelifaecis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AD-6(T) (=NRRL B-59395(T) =CCTCC AB-209144(T)).

It is also the first study conducted in China on agreement between parents reporting on their child. Both parents of 380 girls and 320 boys completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Chinese version). Because reliabilities were poor, the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity/Inattention subscales were merged to form an Externalizing Problems subscale, and the Peer Problems subscale as an independent variable was omitted from analyses. Consistent with past research, moderate to strong correlations were found between mother and father reports for emotional and behavioral problems, although interparent agreement was better for externalizing problems than internalizing problems for both girls and boys. Mothers reported significantly higher scores than fathers for prosocial behaviors for their sons. Findings suggest that, in general, one parent's report will be similar to the other's when the SDQ is used in the form adapted for this study. More work on the psychometric properties of the SDQ is needed in China.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme, named Enclosed Laplacian Operator of Nonlinear Anisotropic Diffusion (ELONAD), which allows us to provide a unified framework for points in flat regions, edge points and corners, even can delete isolated points and spurs. ELONAD extends two diffusion directions of classical NAD to eight or more enclosed directions. Thus it not only performs NAD according to modules of enclosed directions which can reduce the influence of traction errors greatly, but also distinguishes isolated points and small spurs from corners which must be preserved. Smoothing results for test patterns and real images using different discretization schemes are also given to test and verify our discussions.

The compounds were characterized by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), elemental analysis, and mass. Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) showed that the FTPDLCs were thermally stable until 300 degrees C. Differential scanning calorimerty (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) investigations of the mesomorphism found that the FTPDLCs exhibited enantiotropic hexagonal columnar mesophase (Colh) and had much higher clear points than the corresponding hexaalkoxytriphenylenes, C18H6(OR)6. Noticeably, semi-quantitative studies showed that the number of fluorinated ester chains on the triphenylene core was directly proportional to FTPDLCs' clearing points and the order of hexagonal columnar mesophases. In addition, FTPDLCs' mesomorphism was found to be affected by molecular symmetry and by the relative length between the semi-fluorinated chains and the alkoxy chains. Most importantly, we further proved that the mesomorphism of TPDLCs could be better improved through introducing fluorinated ester chains than the ether chains as reported previously.

On conductivity type conversion of p-type silicon exposed to a low-frequency inductively coupled plasma of Ar + H-2	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							CZOCHRALSKI-GROWN SILICON; THERMAL DONORS; HYDROGEN DIFFUSION; OXYGEN DIFFUSION; SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATURES; CDXHG1-XTE; MICROSCOPY; HGCDTE; SI	The treatment of an Ar + H-2 plasma generated by a low-frequency inductively coupled plasma system at 500 degrees C introduces an n-type region (of average electron concentration similar to 10(15) cm(-3)) on a Czochralski p-type substrate, forming a deep p-n junction. Examination by an electron microscope shows that the plasma treatment produces uniform nanocones on the surface and some defects, such as dislocations and platelets, in the subsurface. All these observed results are hydrogen-related. The conductivity type conversion is due to the formation of hydrogen-enhanced oxygen-related thermal donors (OTDs) as well as hydrogen-incorporated shallow thermal donors. The OTD-related signals are directly observed in the infrared absorption spectra. Both donors are annihilated after annealing at 550 degrees C for 10 min, resulting in conductivity recovery from n-type to original p-type. The electrical properties of the as-formed junction are investigated using current versus voltage (I-V), capacitance versus voltage (C-V) and Hall effect measurements. On this basis, the junction depth, carrier profile and hydrogen diffusion behaviour are studied. Moreover, a clear photovoltaic effect of the junction has been observed through the Suns-Voc and illuminated I-V tests.	[Zhou, H. P.; Xu, L. X.; Xu, S.; Huang, S. Y.; Wei, D. Y.; Xiao, S. Q.; Yan, W.

Shock-induced cation disorder in magnesium aluminate spinel	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							SITU NEUTRON-DIFFRACTION; MGAL2O4 SPINEL; ORDER-DISORDER; CERAMICS; POWDER	An increase in lattice constants and an order-disorder phase transition were observed in the magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl(2)O(4)) powders after shock compression. Theoretical calculations on the basis of density functional theory confirm that the remarkable volume expansion in shocked MgAl(2)O(4) powders is closely related to the substantial site disorder in the MgAl(2)O(4) lattice. The calculations also show that the partially inverse MgAl(2)O(4) spinel with an inversion index of 0.7 represents the greatest disordered metastable phase and the most unstable structure.

It is found that the optical properties of Zn1-xMgxO are caused by the codoped Al and N to vary mainly in a low energy region, whereas they remain almost unchanged in a high energy region. The detailed calculations, including the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, absorption spectrum and extinction coefficient, indicate that due to the codoped Al and N, the optical absorption of Zn1-xMgxO shifts toward lower energy and the absorption of the ultraviolet and the visible absorption increase. Study on the real part of the dielectric constant and reflection spectrum of Zn1-xMgxO shows that the codoped Al and N are responsible for the increased reflection peak intensity, and also for the static dielectric constant increasing from 2. 64 to 3. 23. In addition, the calculations from the current electron energy loss function indicate that the codoped Al and N lead to the enhanced amplitude and the blue shift of the plasma resonant frequency of Zn1-xMgxO.

Three candidate structures are chosen to investigate NbN, namely, rocksalt (NaCl), NiAs and WC types. On the basis of the third- order Birch- Murnaghan equation of states, the transition pressure Pt (Pt = 200.64GPa) between the WC phase and the NaCl phase of NbN is predicted for the first time. Elastic constants, formation enthalpies, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio of NbN are derived. The calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data and theoretical values. According to the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the Debye temperature under high pressure is derived from the average sound velocity. Moreover, the effect of metallic bonding on the hardness of NbN is investigated and the hardness shows a gradual decrease rather than increase under compression. This is a quantitative investigation on the structural and thermodynamic properties of NbN, and it still awaits experimental confirmation.

The cholesterol esterase of the strain CHE4-1 was purified by ultrafiltration followed with DEAE-Sepharose FF chromatography and Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, and then by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. Different from other known microbial cholesterol esterase, the purified CHE from CHE4-1 strain is a monomer with molecular weight of 6.5 kD and has high activity to both long-chain and short-chain cholesterol ester. Enzymatic activity was enhanced in the presence of metal ion Ca2+, Zn2+ and boracic acid, and was not significantly affected by several detergents including sodium cholate, Triton X100 and Tween-80. The enzyme was found to be stable during long-term aqueous storage at 4 degrees C, indicating its potential as a clinical diagnostic reagent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding purification and characterization of CHE from Acinetobacter sp. The results demonstrated that this particular CHE is a novel cholesterol esterase.

C-H activation has mainly been achieved through four metal-mediated pathways: oxidative addition, electrophilic substitution, sigma-bond metathesis and metal-associated carbene/nitrene/oxo insertion. However, the identification of methods that do not require transition-metal catalysts is important because methods involving such catalysts are often expensive. Another advantage would be that the requirement to remove metallic impurities from products could be avoided, an important issue in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Here, we describe the identification of a cross-coupling between aryl iodides/bromides and the C-H bonds of arenes that is mediated solely by the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu as a base. This apparently transition-metal-free process provides a new strategy with which to achieve direct C-H functionalization.

Squeezing survival and transfer in single and double electromagnetically induced transparency	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LIGHT; STATES; STORAGE; SYSTEM	We investigate the propagation and storage of a squeezed vacuum as the probe light in a collection of N four-level tripod configuration atoms under the condition of single or double electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The squeezing of the probe light is well preserved in both the single transparency channel and the double transparency one. On the other hand, the effects of the ground state dephasing rates on the propagation and storage of the squeezed vacuum are investigated. It is found that the maximum squeezing at the transparency points is suppressed by the dephasing rates in single or double EIT. Meanwhile, the mapping of the squeezing of the probe light onto the atomic ground coherences or onto the two atomic dark-state polaritons is also studied. In the absence of the Langevin atomic noise, the quasi-ideal squeezing transfer between the squeezed vacuum and the atomic ground coherences or the dark-state polaritons can be realized in such a system. When considering the Langevin atomic noise, the quantum characteristics of the atomic coherences at resonance are submerged by the Langevin noise, while in the scenario of the dark-state polariton, it is found that squeezing transfer onto one polariton is damaged, but the squeezing transfer onto the other polariton survives even in the presence of the Langevin noise.

The agreement between the experimental data and simulation result reveals that due to the predominant interchain interaction, each three backbones stack together to form a distinct lamellar cluster with side chains packed inside dispersedly. The thickness of the lamellar cluster is about 16.0A degrees, corresponding to a strong peak at 5.5 degrees in SAXS pattern. As the backbone is not perfectly parallel to each other in each lamellar cluster, the distance between each backbone ranges from 5.8 to 8.8 A degrees possibly relating to the weak peak at 9.8 degrees in WAXS pattern. Meanwhile, no birefringence or apparent phase texture has been observed by PLM indicating an amorphous nature in this film. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The optimized structure parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data. The mechanical stability of AgGaS2 is confirmed by calculations of the elastic constants. The band structure and density of states were calculated and it is shown that the crystal is a semiconductor with a direct energy band gap of about 1.005 eV for AgGaS2. Calculations of the optical properties, namely the dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient, optical reflectivity and electron energy loss spectrum, were performed for the energy range 0-25 eV. The results indicate that AgGaS2 is a promising mid-IR crystal material.

Effective Rayleigh range of partially coherent beams propagating through the turbulent atmosphere	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							ANGULAR SPREAD; QUALITY; DEGRADATION	The concept of the Rayleigh range of partially coherent beams is extended from free space to the turbulent atmosphere. The general analytical expression for the effective Rayleigh range of partially coherent beams propagating through the turbulent atmosphere is derived. It is shown that the longer the free-space Rayleigh range is, the more the effective Rayleigh range is affected by turbulence, which is illustrated by numerical calculation examples.

Fourteen stable structures for the catechin-guanine complexes have been found which form two hydrogen bonds at least. The results indicate that the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. At the same time, the number and strength of hydrogen bond play a co-determinant parts in the stability of the complexes which can form two or more hydrogen bonds. Theories of atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) have been adopted to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all systems. The interaction energies of all complexes have been corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), ranging from -38.86 to -14.56 kJ/mol. The results showed that the hydrogen bonding contributes to the interaction energies dominantly. The corresponding bonds stretching motions in all complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer, which is in agreement with experimental results.

Thickness dependent magnetic reversal process and hysteresis loops in exchange-coupled hard-soft trilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article								The demagnetization process of a hard/soft/hard sandwich has been investigated systematically within a self-contained micromagnetic model, with particular attention on the cases with small hard layer thickness. The microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis loops, as well as the angular distributions of the magnetization between nucleation and pinning have been obtained numerically, with the formula for the nucleation field derived. It is found that both nucleation and pinning fields, as well as the gap in between decrease as the hard layer thickness reduces. The hard layer thickness has great effect on the hysteresis loops only when the thickness is very small, where the hysteresis loop is nearly square and the dominant coercivity mechanism is the nucleation. The thickness regions at which the theoretical and practical giant energy products can be achieved have been discussed. In most cases, the hard layer can be taken as sufficiently thick so that the magnetization at its surface obeys a simple coherent rotation model. In these cases, the calculation can be simplified significantly, with only the influence of the soft layer thickness accounted. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Based on the topological degree theory of set-valued mappings, an alternative theorem is obtained which says that the generalized variational inequality has either a solution or an exceptional family of elements. As an application, we present a sufficient condition to ensure the existence of a solution to the variational inequality. The set-valued mapping is assumed to be upper semicontinuous with nonempty compact convex values.

X-ray diffraction shows that Ba2+ and Yb3+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 < x < 0.10. The partial substitutions of Ba2+ and Yb3+ for A-site ions of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 decrease effectively the coercive field E (c) and improve significantly the remanent polarization P (r). The ceramics with x = 0.06 and y = 0-0.02 situate within the MPB and possess the lower E (c) and larger P (r), and thus exhibit optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 155-171 pC/N and k (p) = 29.2-36.7%. The temperature dependences of the dielectric and ferroelectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions at temperatures near/above T (d).

The bulk and shear module, Young's module and Poisson's ratio for ideal polycrystalline Ti2AlN and Cr2AlC aggregates were derived in this paper.

It is shown that z(R) of Gaussian array beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence depends on the strength of turbulence, the array beam parameters and the type of beam combination. For the coherent combination z(R) decreases due to turbulence. However, for the incoherent combination there exists a maximum of z(R) as the strength of turbulence varies. The z(R) of coherently combined Gaussian array beams is larger than that of incoherently combined Gaussian array beams, but for the coherent combination case z(R) is more sensitive to turbulence than that for the incoherent combination case. The larger the beam number is, the longer z(R) is, and the more z(R) is affected by turbulence. For the coherent combination z(R) is not monotonic versus the relative beam separation distance, and the effect of turbulence on z(R) is appreciable within a certain range of the relative beam separation distance.

An analysis on radius of curvature aspects of hyperbolic and sinusoidal Gaussian beams	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; PROPAGATION	The effective radius of curvature of hyperbolic and sinusoidal Gaussian beams in free space and turbulent atmosphere is studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that the radius of curvature rises with growing source size, and changes slowly with wavelength. In general, given the same source and propagation settings, the beams can be listed in descending order of radius of curvature magnitudes as sinh Gaussian, cosh Gaussian, sine Gaussian, pure Gaussian and cos Gaussian beams. However, the radius of curvature and the difference of the radius of curvature between the different beams reduce with growing strength of turbulence because the beam's spatial phase distribution is destroyed by turbulence.

To this end, we use a generalized gradient approximation within density functional theory (DFT) at the PW91/DNP level to investigate the reaction processes of Sr, Ti, and O, the formation of SrO and TiO(2), and the microscopic reaction mechanism underlying the formation of STO. We calculate the reaction intermediates, transition states (TSs), and activation energy and explore the STO formation mechanisms using highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital theory. In addition, several possible conformations of STO molecules are comparatively investigated. We find that in steady-state conformations of STO, the geometry eigenvalue is similar to the STO unit cell, which indicates that SrO, TiO(2), and STO are the primary particle states during the early growth of STO thin films. Because it acts as a combining center, TiO(2) is preferentially formed and, subsequently. SrO combines with these centers to form STO, which is stable and somewhat similar to the STO crystal cell. These mechanisms lead to the formation of perovskite-structured STO thin films. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the accuracy of these algorithms is closely related to the accuracy of the ICT technique. Unfortunately, this technique is not accurate, especially when the size of fault dictionary is large. This paper proposes an accurate fault-pair Boolean table technique for the test point selection problem. First, the approach to transform the fault dictionary into a fault-pair Boolean table is introduced. Then, a test point selection algorithm based on the fault-pair Boolean table is proposed. Thirdly, several example circuits are used to illustrate the proposed algorithm. Simulated results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate than the other methods. Therefore, it is a good solution for minimizing the size of the test point set.

Ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of new NaNbO3-Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; PHASE-TRANSITION; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; SYSTEM	New lead-free ceramics (1-x)NaNbO3-xBi(0.5)K(0.5)TiO(3) have been fabricated by the conventional ceramic sintering technique, and their ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties have been studied. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 diffuses into the NaNbO3 lattices to form a new perovskite-type solid solution with orthorhombic symmetry. The addition of a small amount of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 (x a parts per thousand yen 0.025) transforms the ceramics from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric. The ceramic with x = 0.10 possesses the largest remanent polarization P (r) and thus exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d (33) = 71 pC/N, k (p) = 16.6% and k (t) = 39.7%. The ceramics with low doping level of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 are normal ferroelectrics and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition becomes diffusive gradually with the doping level x of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 increasing.

The analytical formula of the nucleation field has been derived. It is found that the nucleation field increases as the interface coupling constant rises. Especially when the thickness of the soft layer is small, the influence of the exchange coupling on the nucleation field is significant. The angular distributions of the magnetization for various exchange coupling constants have been obtained by numerical calculation. It is found that the angular distribution of the magnetization is discontinuous at the interface of the hard and soft layers. In the meantime, the pinning field decreases with the increase of the thickness of the soft layer and the exchange coupling constant.

In this model, several point type sources were uniformly distributed around a circle and evaporated simultaneously to form a surface-like source. Based on the Monte Carlo method, the evaporation process was simulated, and the effect of the number of point type sources, circle radius and source-substrate distance on the uniformity was analyzed. Based on the method proposed in this paper, the uniformity of the thickness in the organic layer was successfully controlled in 5%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerical results show that, without Klein tunneling, the time-oscillating behaviors of the transported currents depend on the incident angles of the electrons. How the transmission probabilities related to these transports are influenced by the static potentials, phases, and driven frequencies, etc. are discussed in detail. The essential reasons for these phenomena is the superposition of two equivalent triangular sublattices existing in graphene. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The characteristics of Li4Ti5O12/C composites were determined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis methods. Their electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammograms, constant current charge-discharge and rate charge-discharge. It was found that molecular weight of polyacrylic acid (PAA), heating rate and sintering duration directly affected the physical and electrochemical performances of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. The Li4Ti5O12/C composites with the optimized electrochemical performances were obtained in the following conditions, i.e., PAA with the molecular weight of 10,000, heating rate of 20 degrees C min(-1) and sintering duration of 8 h. At charge-discharge rate of 4 C and 8 C, the optimized sample showed discharge capacities of 148.4 and 142.4 mAh g(-1), with capacity retention of 94.48 and 90.53% after 50 cycles, respectively.

The calculated results such as lattice constants are in good agreement with experimental data and indicate that the system behaves like metal, while the electrons with up spins occupy the Fermi energy. The influence of quantum size effect is remarkable in the system of small size. It is also found that the sp(2) hybridization and nonbonding electrons play an important part in the single-layer trigonal graphene quantum dots, just like in graphene. The spin multiplicity and magnetic moment of the system increase with the increase of the system size. Based on our calculation, the total magnetic moment of the system mainly comes from the nonbonding electrons on the 2p orbital of the zigzag boundary. Our calculation may be helpful in designing devices based on trigonal graphene quantum dots.

The calculation results indicate that the O defects induced by thermal annealing cannot compensate for the defects caused by neutron irradiation in Ge nanocrystals, while the introduction of As produced by neutron transmutation doping (NTD) will do the jop. We also show that the strong attraction between O and Ge atoms inhibits the formation of vacant defects in Ge nanocrystals, and further improve the luminescent property of Ge-SiO2 system. This suggests that it is necessary to perform thermal annealing for Ge-ncs structures before NTD. Our calculations well support our previous experimental results.

We first generalize the notion of the Yosida approximation in Hilbert spaces introduced by Moudafi to reflexive Banach spaces. Further, by using the notion of the Yosida approximation, we consider a system of parametric generalized Wiener-Hopf equation problems and show its equivalence to the system of parametric generalized mixed implicit equilibrium problems. By using a fixed point formulation of the system of parametric generalized Wiener-Hopf equation problems, we study the behavior and sensitivity analysis of a solution set of the system of parametric generalized mixed implicit equilibrium problems. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the solution set of the system of parametric generalized mixed implicit equilibrium problems is nonempty, closed and Lipschitz continuous with respect to the parameters.

It is shown that for the two types of beam combination a minimum of the effective radius of curvature, R(min), appears as the propagation distance z increases. For the coherent combination, R is larger than that for the incoherent combination. The position z(min) where the effective radius of curvature reaches its minimum is further away from the source plane for the coherent combination than that for the incoherent combination. For the two types of beam combination, R and z(min) increase with increasing beam number, increasing beam separation distance, increasing waist width, and decreasing beam order and wavelength. In particular, the R of single H-G beams is always smaller than that of H-G array beams; the R of Gaussian array beams is always larger than that of H-G array beams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Half-metallic (HM) ferromagnetism is observed in these binary compounds with cell volume optimization. They have a total magnetic moment of 1.000 mu B per formula unit, which is one of the important properties of HM ferromagnets. The ferromagnetic (FM) state is stable forZBScC, ScSi, ScGe and ScSn against the non-magnetic (NM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Calculations show that half metallicity can be kept for a wide range of lattice constants in these binary compounds. The absolute values of cohesive energies of these ZB compounds are larger than that of ZB CrSb, which has been fabricated experimentally. These compounds are compatible with the traditional semiconductors, and could be useful in spin-electronics and other applications. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Compared with the parent molecules unsubstituted, derivatives substituted by CN and NH(2) groups result in higher bond dissociation energies, whereas the other lead to lower ones. The studies indicated that the higher heats of formation of compounds of substituent groups possess, the higher ones of derivatives. The normalized heats of formation of these derivatives substituted by N(4)H(3), NO(2), H, N(2)H, N(4)H, N(3) and CN are 72.6 similar to 108.9 kJ, which is higher than that of triazido-s-triazine (70.2 kJ) reported. For derivatives substituted by N(4)H, N(3)) N(4)H(3), N(2)H and CN groups, heats of formation calculated lie in the range of 871.4 similar to 1159.3 kJ.mo1(-1), but derivatives substituted by N(4)H and N(4)H(3) show low dissociation energies and relatively low stabilities. So derivatives substituted by N(3), N(2)H and CN groups should be applicable as potential of high nitrogen content high energy materials (HNC-HEMs).

For a fixed doping level, with the reduction in R3+ radius, thermopower is found to gradually increase despite the carrier concentration remains unchanged. The scaling behavior between thermopower and electron specific heat coefficient reveals that the additional increase in thermopower originates from enhanced electron correlation which may be attributed to doping-induced chemical pressure.

Spin Hamiltonian parameters (g factors g(parallel to) g(perpendicular to) and hyperfine structure constants A(parallel to) A(perpendicular to)) of the tetragonal V-4 center in Zn(antipyrine)(2)(NO3)(2) are calculated from the complete energy matrix diagonalization method and the perturbation theory method. The calculated results from both methods are not only close to each other but also in good agreement with the experimental values.

Micromagnetic calculation of hysteresis loops in exchange-coupled nanolayers	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Composite magnets; Multilayers; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetics	POTTS SPIN-LATTICE; REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; PERMANENT-MAGNETS; REVERSAL	In this study, hysteresis loops have been investigated based on a self-contained micromagnetic model for various exchange-coupled layer systems, including oriented hard/soft multilayers and double-layer systems with perpendicular easy axes. In the former case, the soft layer acts as the nucleation center while the hard layer plays the role of pinning. Both the nucleation field and coercivity decrease with the thickness of the soft layer L(s) while they are not sensitive to that of the hard one, L(h). The reduction of the remanence due to the deterioration of the squareness of the hysteresis loop accompanying the increase of L(s) could be compensated by the improvement of the saturation magnetization contributed by the soft layer. The optimum thickness at which the largest energy product could be achieved is given. In the latter case, the misaligned layer acts in a similar role to that of the soft layer in hard/soft multilayers considering that it nucleates the reversed domain walls and decreases the coercivity significantly. As the thickness of the misaligned layer increases, both the remanence and the coercivity decrease and the loop loses its rectangularity. As a result, the energy product shrinks, suggesting that the misaligned grains affect the energy product greatly. In the case where the thicknesses of the aligned and misaligned layers are equal and increase simultaneously, the coercivity increases while the remanence decreases. Thus an optimum thickness for largest energy product also exists. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, G. P.; Guo, N.

In this paper, we investigate these effects on the persistent currents (PCs) in a closed graphene ring with broken time-reversal symmetry. A hard boundary condition is introduced to describe the Dirac electrons moving along such a ring-shaped configuration, and then the induced persistent currents are numerically calculated. Differing from the properties of PCs revealed in the metal AB rings, we show that the present PCs neither show the regular saw-tooth-like features nor present the odd-even symmetry of the electron number. More interestingly, we show that the energy difference between the two valleys and the amplitude of the oscillating PCs increase with the decrease (increase) of the radius (width) of the graphene ring. Our results imply that the AB effect and size-dependent PCs in ring-shaped microstructures could be tested at room temperature.

The results reveal that both resistivity and thermopower increase monotonously with Ti doping. When the relative Ti content is not more than x=0.2, the substitution takes place in Ca2CoO3 sublayer; in contrast, if the relative Ti content reaches x=0.3, the doped Ti ions may exist in both Ca2CoO3 and CoO2 sublayers. As the Co ions in CoO2 layer are substituted, the transport mechanism of the system varies, and the electronic correlation is pronounced enhanced. These changes induce a noticeable increase in thermopower. The figure of merit ZT value of Ca3Co3.7Ti0.3O9 is close to 0.3 at 1000 K, suggesting that Ti doped Ca3Co4O9 series are promising thermoelectric oxides for high-temperature applications.

The notions of C(i)(x)-PC-partially diagonally quasiconvex, C(i)(x)-FC-quasiconvex, and C(i)(x)- FC-quasiconvex-like for set-valued mappings are also introduced in FC-spaces. By applying these notions and a maximal element theorem, the nonemptyness and compactness of solution sets for four classes of systems of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium problems are proved in noncompact FC-spaces. As applications, some new existence theorems of solutions for mathematical programs with system of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium constraints are obtained in PC-spaces. These results improve and generalize some recent known results in literature.

We analyse the density of states of this system, and our results reveal that the density of states show some noticeable characteristics depending on the relative angle theta of magnetic moment M. and the spin-polarised strength P in ferromagnetic leads, and also the magnetic flux Phi and the number of lattice sites N-R in the mesoscopic ring.

Effect of Li-substitution on piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of (Bi0.92Na0.92-xLix)(0.5)Ba0.06Sr0.02TiO3 lead-free ceramics	CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						Lead-free; Piezoelectric; Ferroelectric; Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3	ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; DEPOLARIZATION TEMPERATURE; A-SITE; TRANSITION	New lead-free ceramics (Bi0.92Na0.92-xLix)(0.5)Ba0.06Sr0.02TiO3 have been fabricated by a conventional ceramic technique and their electrical properties have been studied. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that Li+, Ba2+ and Sr2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. The partial substitution of Li+ for Na+ increases the remanent polarization P-r of the ceramics. Because of the large P-r and low coercive field E-c, the ceramics with x = 0.075-0.125 exhibit excellent piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 189-235 pC/N, k(p) = 33.6-36.3% and k(t) = 51.6-54.3%. The ceramics exhibit relaxor behaviors after the substitution of Li+ for Na+. Our results also suggest that polar and non-polar phases may coexist in the ceramics at temperatures above the depolarization temperature T-d. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our results show that a small amount of MnO2 (0.5-1.0 mol%) is enough to improve the densification of the ceramics and decrease the sintering temperature of the ceramics. The co-effects of MnO2 doping and Sb-substitution lead to significant improvements in the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. The K0.5Na0.5Nb0.92Sb0.08O3 ceramic with 0.5 mol%MnO2 doping possesses optimum propeties: d (33) = 187 pC/N, k (P) = 47.2%, epsilon (r) = 980, tan delta = 2.71% and T (c) = 287 A degrees C. Due to high tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition temperature (T (O-T) similar to 150 A degrees C), the K0.5Na0.5Nb0.92Sb0.08O3 ceramic with 0.5 mol%MnO2 doping exhibits a good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties.

Our results at zero pressure are in good agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical data. The analyses of the structural parameters and elastic constants of VB2 versus pressure suggest that this compound is a very stable material under high pressure and the anisotropies of VB2 will gradually weaken with pressure. Also we present the variation of density of the states (DOS) with applied pressure, and it is found that the density of the states near the Fermi level decreases with pressure, indicating the reduction in the hybridization energy under high pressure. Based on the Mulliken population analysis, we find the charge transferred from V to B increases with pressure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated lattice constant shows good agreement with the experimental value. It is interestingly found that the band gap energy E-g at the P or X point remarkably increases with increasing pressure, but E-g at the P point does not increase obviously. The pressure coefficient of E-g is calculated to be 44 meV/GPa at the T point.

It is shown that R decreases due to turbulence. However, position z(min) where R reaches its minimum will change due to the turbulence when the strength of turbulence is strong enough. The effective radius of curvature R increases with the increase of beam coherence parameter beta when the strength of turbulence is weak, while R decreases with beta increasing when the strength of turbulence is strong. The R decreases slowly with the increase of beam order M(N) The R of partially coherent flat-topped beam with larger beta and smaller M ( N) is more sensitive to turbulence. In addition, in free space the wavefront of partially coherent flat-topped beam can be regarded as a spherical surface in the far-field, which is independent of the beam parameters However, in turbulence the effective radius of curvature depends on the beam parameters in the near field and also in the far field.

Our results show that for collimated beams, when examined against propagation length, the dark hollow, flat topped and annular Gaussian beams behave nearly the same as the Gaussian beam, but have larger radius of curvature values. Increased partial coherence and turbulence levels tend to lower the radius of curvature. Bigger source sizes on the other hand give rise to larger radius of curvature. Dark hollow and flat topped beams have reduced radius of curvature at longer wavelengths, whereas the annular Gaussian beam seems to be unaffected by wavelength changes; the radius of curvature of the Gaussian beam meanwhile rises with increasing wavelength.

Theoretical investigation on the detected probe waveshape has been performed by using the probe-pump coupled equations combined with Raman amplification. The experimental characterization has been demonstrated to validate the theoretical prediction. The results show that, the 75 Km sensing distance can be achieved by utilizing the bi-directional Raman amplification with measurement accuracy of +/- 0.6 degrees C over the whole sensing fiber. The larger Raman power and Brillouin pump power are helpful to improve the sensing signal-noise ratio (SNR). There exists an optimum range for the input probe power and the extinction ratio (ER) of input Brillouin pump pulse.

The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that LiSbO3 and CaTiO3 diffuse into the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a perovskite structure. After the addition of LiSbO3 and CaTiO3, the cubic-tetragonal and tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transitions shift to lower temperatures. Coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is hence formed in the ceramics with 0.03 < x < 0.07 at room temperature, leading to a significant enhancement of the piezoelectric properties. For the ceramics with x = 0.04-0.06, the piezoelectric properties become optimum: d (33) = 172-253 pC/N, k (P) = 49.9-55.5%, k (t) = 49.2-52.1% and T (C) = 348-373 A degrees C. The ceramic with x = 0.04 also exhibits a good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties.

FTIR and Raman spectra suggest that the >NH lone pair in PUDS can interact with the Pr(3+) centers. DSC results show that the coordination effect causes a significant increase of the phase transition temperature. The emission spectrum of Pr-PUDS indicates an efficient energy transfer from the macromolecular ligand to the coordinated Pr(3+) ion. The magnetic behavior as function of applied magnetic field or temperature (50-450 degrees C) and some unusual transitions in the M versus T plots are reported and discussed, which demonstrate that the magnetic properties of the Pr-PUDS strongly depend on the phase transition.

J	Li, XQ; Ji, XL; Yang, F				Li, Xiaoqing; Ji, Xiaoling; Yang, Fan			Beam quality of radial Gaussian Schell-model array beams	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Radial Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beam; Rayleigh range; M(2)-factor	PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; LASER ARRAY; RAYLEIGH RANGE; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; PROPAGATION; COMBINATIONS	Taking the Rayleigh range Z(R) and the M(2)-factor as the characteristic parameters of beam quality, the beam quality of radial Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beams is studied. The analytical expressions for the Z(R) and the M(2)-factor of radial GSM array beams are derived. It is shown that for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function Z(R) is longer and the M(2)-factor is lower than that for the superposition of the intensity. For the two types of superposition, Z(R) increases and the M(2)-factor decreases with increase in beam coherence parameter, and both Z(R) and the M(2)-factor increase with increase in inverse radial fill-factor. For the superposition of the cross-spectral density function, Z(R) increases and the M(2)-factor decreases with increase in beam number, while for the superposition of the intensity both the Z(R) and M(2)-factor are independent of the beam number.

How thick SiO2 cap layer is needed to achieve strong visible photoluminescence from SiO2-buffered SiNx films?	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						SiNx film; SiO2; Annealing; Photoluminescence	SILICON OXYNITRIDE; SI0.7GE0.3 LAYERS; DEFECT SPECTRUM; NANOSTRUCTURES; LUMINESCENCE; MORPHOLOGY; DEVICES; ORIGIN; GROWTH	The effect of a SiO2 nanolayer and annealing temperature on the UV/visible room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) from SiNx films synthesized by rf magnetron sputtering is studied. The PL intensity can be maximized when the SiO2 layer is 5-10 nm thick at 800 degrees C annealing temperature and only 2 nm at 1000 degrees C. A composition-structure-property analysis reveals that the PL intensity is directly related to both the surface chemical states and the content of the Si-0 and Si-N bonds in the SiNx, films. These results are relevant for the development of advanced optoelectronic and photonic emitters and sensors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Xu, M.; Chen, Q.

The effects of the thickness of the semiconductor layers and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the spin-dependent tunneling transmission coefficient and the properties of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) are studied. It is found that the variations of tunneling transmission coefficients and the tunnel magnetoresistance TMR with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the thickness of semiconductor layer, show typical resonant properties and the TMR can be enhanced and its sign can switch from positive to negative by increasing the ratio of Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength between two semiconductor layers.

Here, by using quantum waveguide theory and the Floquet theorem we investigate the quantum transport of electrons along an open mesoscopic ring threaded by a time-periodic magnetic flux. We predicate that current density waves could be excited along such an open ring. As a consequence, a net current could be generated along the lead with only one reservoir, if the lead additionally connects to such a normal-metal loop driven by the time-dependent flux. These phenomena could be explained by photon-assisted processes, due to the interaction between the transported electrons and the applied oscillating external fields. We also discuss how the time-average currents (along the ring and the lead) depend on the amplitude and frequency of the applied oscillating fluxes.

Here, we introduce a time-evolution operator method to investigate such a problem by numerically solving the induced algebraic equations (by Runge-Kutta method). Based on these calculations, transitions between two levels driven by various time-dependent external fields can be simulated in detail, typically near the so-called avoided crossing points.

In this paper, the problem of near optimum test points set selection for analog fault dictionary is considered. This problem is formulated as a depth-first graph search problem. So the test points selection progress is transformed to a graph node expanding progress. The graph node construction method and node expanding procedure are given also. The proposed graph search method guarantee a maximum information increase of S (opt) by adding a test point to S (opt) each time, where S (opt) is the desired test points set used on the path from current node to root node. So a global minimum test points set can be more likely achieved than other methods. The results of statistical experiments indicate that the proposed method more accurately finds the global minimum set of test points without increasing time complexity; therefore, it is a good solution to minimize the size of test points set.

The vibrational frequencies have been studied at the same level to analyze these complexes. Six and eleven stable structures for the catechin-H2O and catechin-(H2O)(2) have been found, respectively. Theories of atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) have been utilized to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all the systems. The interaction energies of all the complexes corrected by basis set superposition error, are from -13.27 to -83.56 kJ/mol. All calculations also indicate that there are strong hydrogen-bonding interactions in catechin-water complexes. The strong hydrogen-bonding contributes to the interaction energies dominantly. The O-H stretching motions in all the complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer.

In this paper, we study how to extract knowledge from vague objective information systems (VOISs) based on rough sets theory. We first introduce the basic notion termed rough vague sets by combining rough sets theory and vague sets theory. By using the rough vague lower approximation distribution in the VOIS, the concept of attribute reduction is introduced. Then, we develop an algorithm based on a discernibility matrix to compute all the attribute reductions. Finally, a viable approach for extracting decision rules from the VOIS is proposed. An example is also presented to illustrate the application of the proposed theories and approaches in handling medical diagnosis problems.

J	Zhou, ZR; Feng, G; Zhang, YD; Li, LM				Zhou, Zhaorong; Feng, Gang; Zhang, Yide; Li, Lemin			On feasibility examination of DS-CDMA systems with imperfect successive interference cancellation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						DS-CDMA; successive interference cancellation (SIC); decoding order; computational complexity	POWER-CONTROL; CHANNEL ESTIMATION; RECEIVERS; NETWORKS	In DS-CDMA systems with the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique, there are K! possible decoding orders for K active users and the decoding order has considerable impact on system performance. Once the constraints on the received powers of mobile stations and the bit-energy-to-interference-power-spectral-density ratio requirements are satisfied under some decoding order of SIC, the system is feasible. Otherwise, if the constraints are violated under all possible decoding orders, the system is infeasible. It is highly time-consuming to examine the system feasibility directly by using the usual exhaustive search method (ESM) for a system with even moderate number of users. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for examining the feasibility of DS-CDMA systems with imperfect SIC. The proposed approach has significantly lower computational complexity than that of ESM and thus benefits the quick decisions of admission control and/or scheduling, which are essential for Quality of Service provisioning in DS-CDMA systems. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the system under the resultant decoding order obtained by the proposed approach is able to achieve the lowest outage probability among all possible decoding orders. We conduct extensive simulation experiments, and the numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Spin Hamiltonian parameters (g factors and hyperfine structure constants) of the tetragonal V4+ center in zinc phosphate glass are calculated from the complete energy matrix diagonalization method and the perturbation theory method. The calculated results from both methods are not only close to each other but also in good agreement with the experimental values.

The trimers were characterized by using (1)H NMR, IR, and high resolution mass spectrometry. The mesomorphic properties were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the trimers exhibited rectangular columnar mesophase (Col(r)). The length of the flexible spacer connecting the three segments has prominent influence on the phase transition temperatures of the trimers.

The influence of the types of initiator, reation time and reaction temperature on the yield of DAPAs were investigated. The products were characterized by NMR and MS. By using DHPA, DTMPPA and DDPA (10% in kerosene) as extractants, the extraction of Co(2+) and Ni(2+) in sulphate medium at different equilibrium pH values were measured. The results show that the maximum yield of DHPA, DTMPPA and DDPA can all be achieved at about 130 degrees C under the initiation of di- tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP). All the extraction of cobalt with respect to DHPA, DDPA and DTMPPA precedes that of nickel. The difference in pH(1/2) value (defined as the pH at which 50% metal extraction occurs) between cobalt and nickel increases in the following sequence from large to small: DHPA, DDPA and DTMPPA, which indicates that the separation ability for cobalt and nickel ascends from DHPA, DDPA to DTMPPA.

The geometries of the reactants, transition states, intermediates and products were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G* level. Vibration analysis was carried out to confirm the transition state structure, and the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method was performed to search the reaction path. In addition, atoms in molecules (AIM) theories were used to discuss bond natures. The reaction in water solution was investigated at the same level with SCRF(PCM) method. Reaction pathways were investigated in this study. The result indicates that the reaction Re -> TS1 -> IM1 -> TS2 -> IM2 -> TS3 -> IM3 -> TS4 -> IM5 -> TS7 -> IM9 -> TS13 -> IM10 -> TS14 -> P3 is the main pathway, the activation energy of which is the lowest.

Demagnetization process and hysteresis loops in perpendicularly oriented hard/soft trilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MAGNETIZATION REVERSAL; DOMAIN-WALLS; MAGNETS; NANOLAYERS	Nucleation and evolution of domain walls as well as the magnetic reversal process in perpendicularly oriented hard/soft trilayers have been investigated within a micromagnetic approach, concentrated on the situation with very thin hard layer. The formula for the nucleation field has been derived, which falls as the soft layer thickness rises. Negative nucleation field occurs at thick soft layer when the shape anisotropy surpasses the crystalline one, where the magnetization in the center of the soft layer obeys the coherent rotation model. The microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis loops have been calculated numerically, with the angular distribution of the magnetization between the nucleation and pinning fields obtained. The area of the hysteresis loop decreases while the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning as the soft layer thickness increases. The effect of the hard layer thickness is contrary to that of the soft layer, however, the former affects the demagnetization process and hysteresis loops significantly only when the layers are thin enough.

All the stationary points on the doublet, quartet, and sextet potential energy surfaces (PES) have been fully optimized. The reaction undergoes preferentially on the quartet PES. The whole reaction can be divided into two stages. In the stage 1, the complex is oxidized by H2O2 through an O-O bond homolytic cleavage pathway and the intermediate IM6 and the first H2O molecule are formed. In the stage 2, the IM6 is reduced by the second H2O2 molecule via two hydrogen abstraction steps and O-2 and the second H2O are formed. The rate-determining step was found to be the O-O bond breaking step with a barrier of 63.9 kJ.mol(-1). The calculated barrier for the O-O homolytic cleavage in dismutation of free H2O2 is 226.7 kJ.mol(-1). The results indicate that the [Fe(III)TMTAA] complex can decrease energy barrier of the titled reaction and it may be a potential candidate for catalase mimic.

These results show that this system is provided with an excellent spin filtering property, and that a large tunnelling magnetoresistance and a negative tunnelling magnetoresistance can arise by adjusting relative parameters; these facts indicate that this system is a possible candidate for spin valve transistors, and has important applications in spintronics.

The present author holds that this text has both self-reference of metafiction and the reference to exterior hisrory and reality, and that the former has not not only weakened but also strengthened the latter. Employing the metafiction technique of exposing its own fictionality, the novel gives prominence to the fictionality and narrativity of history in the process of telling history as a story, and discloses the narrative logic and ideology in the "objective", "real" history text; furthermore, it reveals how the history and the real world are fictionalized according to discourse hegemony. As a historiographic metafiction, the novel no longer self-refers, self-indulges or disengages itself from history and reality as radical metafiction. It refers to the operation of the discourse of social power and the ideological dialogue under the cover of self-consciousness.

The auxiliary principle technique is applied to study the existence and an iterative algorithm of solutions for the system of generalized set-valued mixed variational-like inequality problems. At first, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the auxiliary problems for (SGSMVLIP) is shown. Next, an iterative algorithm for solving (SGSMVLIP) is constructed by using the existence and uniqueness result. Finally, we prove the existence of solutions of (SGSMVLIP) and discuss the convergence analysis of the algorithm. These results improve, unify and generalize many corresponding known results given in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dielectric parameters were derived using mixture formulae, and the values of excess permittivity and excess inverse relaxation time were determined using these parameters. By comparing the calculated results to the experiment values it was found that the classical Debye equation needs to be modified to calculate the complex permittivity.

The physical characteristics of the Li4Ti5O12/C composite were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The particle size of Li4Ti5O12 in the composite was about 200 nm. The electrochemical properties were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectra and constant current charge/discharge cycling. It was demonstrated that the as-prepared Li4Ti5O12/C composite presented excellent high-rate characteristics and cycleabilities. The initial specific capacity of the composite was 130.0 mA h g(-1) at 8.60 mA cm(-2), and excellent cycle performance was still maintained with the current density increase. Moreover, it was proved that the electric conductivity and cycle performance of Li4Ti5O12 were effectively enhanced due to the uniformly dispersed pyrolytic carbon in the Li4Ti5O12 particles.

It is shown that the M(2)-factor of GSM array beams depends on the beam number, the relative beam separation distance, the beam coherence parameter, the type of beam superposition, and the strength of turbulence. The turbulence results in an increase of the M(2)-factor. However, for the superposition of the intensity the M(2)-factor is less sensitive to turbulence than that for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function. The M(2)-factor of GSM array beams is larger than that of the corresponding Gaussian array beams. However, the M(2)-factor of GSM array beams is less affected by turbulence than that of the corresponding Gaussian array beams. For the superposition of the cross-spectral density function a minimum of the M(2)-factor of GSM array beams may appear in turbulence, which is even smaller than that of the corresponding single GSM beams.

Hack in Southwest China revealed by ISSR	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						P. paniceum (Lam.) Hack.; ISSR; genetic diversity; southwest China	MARKERS; POPULATIONS	Inter-simple sequence repeats markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity of Pogonatherum paniceum (Lam.) Hack. from Sichuan Province, Yunnan Province, Chongqing City and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China. 100 primers were carried out on 22 wild populations, 14 could produce highly reproducible inter-simple sequence repeats markers bands. Out of the 239 discernable DNA fragments, 227 were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands was 94.98% at the species level. Nei's gene diversity and Shannon information index were 0.312 and 0.471, respectively. This indicated that the genetic diversity of P. paniceum (Lam.) Hack. was low. The values of genetic identity ranged from 0.548 to 0.820 with a mean of 0.673. Nei's genetic distance between 22 populations ranged from 0.198 to 0.601. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distance showed that most populations were positioned into the relevant areas. Significant correlation between genetic and geographic altitude distances among populations was found by Mantel test. The high score of percentage of polymorphic bands might be caused by low frequent polymorphism distributed in different populations.

The curve of volume dependence of energy indicates the energy of ST(AA)structure is lower than that of pyrite structure. According to our result and the experimental criterion raised by Pugh, we come to the conclusion that the PtN2 is a very hard and fragile material. But when the pressure increases, the PtN2 becomes malleable gradually. It is revealed that the pyrite structure of the PtN2 is a semiconductor and the STAA structure of the PtN2 is a conductor by analyzing their density of states and band structure.

Our results indicate that at on-axis positions, Laguerre Gaussian beams with zero angular mode number will have less scintillations than fundamental Gaussian beams, where the amount of scintillations will further decrease with rising radial mode number. When off-axis positions are considered, this situation reverses however, and the scintillations of Laguerre Gaussian beams become generally higher than the fundamental Gaussian beam. Plotted against the source size, the on-axis scintillations of Laguerre Gaussian beams fall below the fundamental Gaussian beam, following the same trend as the fundamental Gaussian beam all throughout the source size range examined.

The current study investigated body dissatisfaction, engagement in body change behaviors, and sociocultural pressures on body image, and the relationships between these variables among 517 adolescent males (N = 219) and females (N = 298) in China. Females reported greater body dissatisfaction than males, and males reported using strategies to increase their muscle bulk more often than females. Males reported pressure from a variety of sociocultural sources to increase their muscles or weight, while females reported pressure from the media to lose weight. For males body dissatisfaction was predicted by pressure from peers to increase their muscle bulk, while for females pressure to lose weight from peers, adult relatives, and the media was likely to increase body dissatisfaction. Pressure from the media and adult relatives was also predictive of body change behaviors in both males and females. The findings are discussed in relation to previous research in both Western and non-Western contexts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the one hand, by proving a compactness lemma and solving a variational problem, the existence of the standing wave with ground state for the aforementioned equation is proved. On the other hand, the authors derive the instability of the standing wave by applying the potential well argument, the concavity method and an invariant region under the solution flow of the Cauchy problem for the equation under study, and the invariance of the region aforementioned can be shown by introducing an auxiliary functional and a supplementary constrained variational problem.

We prove that the dead core rate is faster than the one given by the corresponding ODE, which is contrary to the known results for the related extinction, quenching and blow up problems. Moreover, we find the dead core rate is quite unstable: the ODE rate can be recovered if the absorption term is replaced by -a(t, x)u(p) for a suitable bounded, uniformly positive function a(t, x). As an application of the above results, some new and relatively simple examples of fast blow up are provided, and a phenomenon of strong sensitivity to gradient perturbations is exhibited. Furthermore, the blow up rate is found to depend on a constant in the perturbation term, and sharp estimates are also obtained for the profile of dead core and blow up.

X-ray diffraction studies reveal that Nd3+ and Ba2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 < y < 0.10. The partial substitutions of Nd3+ and Ba2+ decrease effectively the coercive field E-c and increase significantly the remanent polarization P-r. Because of lower E-c, larger P-r and the formation of the MPB, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are significantly enhanced at x/y = 0.02/0.06: d(33) = 150 pC/N and k(p) = 30.5%. The ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which is probably resulted from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The depolarization temperature T-d shows a strong compositional dependence and reaches a minimum value at the MPB. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions near the depolarization temperature T-d, which cause the polarization hysteresis loop become deformed near/above T-d.

X-ray diffraction patterns show that Ba2+, Li+ and Sr2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 <= x <= 0.08 and z < 0.06. The content of Li+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure of the ceramics. The ceramics situated within the MPB exhibit a lower coercive field E-c and a larger remanent polarization P-r. Because of the formation of the MPB, lower E-c and larger P-r, the ceramics with x = 0.06, y = 0.075-0.125 and z = 0-0.02 possess improved piezoelectric properties. The optimum d(33) (235 pC/N) and k(p) (36.3%) are reached at x/y/z = 0.06/0.125/0.02 and 0.06/0.075/0.02, respectively. The deformed P-E loop is also observed near or above T-d.

Local clustering feature refers to the phenomenon whereby one group of data is separated from another, and the data from these different groups are clustered locally. A compact class is defined as one cluster in which all similar elements cluster tightly within the cluster. Herein, the essence of the local clustering feature, revealed by mathematical manipulation, results in a novel clustering algorithm termed as the special local clustering (SLC) algorithm that was used to process gene microarray data related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). SLC algorithm was able to group together genes with similar expression patterns and identify significantly varied gene expression values as isolated points. If a gene belongs to a compact class in control data and appears as an isolated point in incipient, moderate and/or severe AD gene microarray data, this gene is possibly associated with AD. Application of a clustering algorithm in disease-associated gene identification such as in AD is rarely reported.

A morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 < y < 0.10. As compared to pure Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 ceramic, the partial substitutions of Y3+ for Bi3+ and Ba2+ for (Bi0.5Na0.5)(2+) in the A-sites of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lower effectively the coercive field E (c) and increase the remanent polarization P (r) of the ceramics. Because of low E (c), large P (r) and the MPB, the ceramics with x = 0-0.02 and y = 0.06 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 155-159 pC/N and k (p) = 28.8-36.7%. The temperature dependences of dielectric properties of the ceramics show relaxor-like behaviors. The ferroelectric properties at different temperature suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions near/above T (d).

It is shown that turbulence results in a decrease of the effective radius of curvature. However, the effective radius of curvature of partially coherent HG beams with smaller beam coherence parameters and larger beam order is less sensitive to turbulence. In addition, when the beam coherence parameter increases, the effective radius of curvature increases or decreases, depending on the strength of turbulence.

J	Pan, R; Zhao, W; Zhou, T; Zhang, AM				Pan, Rui; Zhao, Wei; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Aiming			Effect of Alkyl Side Chain Length on the Properties of Polyetherimides from Molecular Simulation Combined with Experimental Results	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART B-POLYMER PHYSICS			English	Article						molecular modeling; polyimide; structure-property relationship	FORCE-FIELD; POLYIMIDE; POLYMERS; POLYMERIZATION	Three polyetherimides (PEIs) with the same backbone of Ultem 100 but different lengths of the alkyl side chains were simulated by using molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics techniques to investigate the effect of side chain length on their properties and physical mechanism behind. Simulation results, which are consistent to the experimental data, show that PEI-5 with four methylene units in each alkyl side chain has higher T(g) (glass transition temperature) and higher tensile strength, but lower tensile elongation at break than those of PEI-6 with five and PEI-8 with seven methylene units in each alkyl side chain. However, unlike the traditional phenomena, conformational analysis provides that PEI-5 with the highest T(g) gives the highest flexibility to the polymer chain, whereas PEI-8 with the lowest T(g) imparts the lowest flexibility resulting from attachment of longer alkyl side chain increase the rigidity of backbone. From the calculated ratio of the accessible volume to the total volume for each system, the highest ratio of PEI-8 indicates that long alkyl side chains generate more free volume than short side chains, acting as an internal plasticizer in bulk structure. It is the internal plasticizing effect that is predominantly responsible for the abnormal properties, instead of the rigidity from side chains. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.10 < x < 0.20, 0 < y < 0.04, and 0.01 < z < 0.03. After the partial substitutions of (Bi0.5K0.5)2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ for the A site (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ ions of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, the coercive field E-c decreases greatly and the remnent polarization P-r increases significantly. Because of the MPB, lower E-c and higher P-r, the piezoelectricity of the ceramics is greatly improved. For the ceramics with x=0.15, y=0.02, and z=0.015, the piezoelectric properties become optimum, giving d(33)=203 pC/N, k(p)=31.4%, and k(t)=46.7%. The depolarization temperature T-d reaches a minimum value at the MPB. Our results also suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and nonpolar regions near T-d, which causes the polarization hysteresis loop to become deformed and the ceramics to become depolarized.

In this work, we propose two extensions of DS-FP to minimize the on-line scheduling overhead. The proposed algorithms produce a hyperperiod from DS-FP so that the schedule generated by repeating the hyperperiod infinitely satisfies the temporal validity constraint of the real-time data. The first algorithm, named DEferrable Scheduling with Hyperperiod by Schedule Construction (DESH-SC), searches the DS-FP schedule for a hyperperiod. The second algorithm, named DEferrable Scheduling with Hyperperiod by Schedule Adjustment (DESH-SA), adjusts the DS-FP schedule in an interval to form a hyperperiod. Our experimental results demonstrate that while both DESH-SC and DESH-SA can reduce the scheduling overhead of DS-FP, DESH-SA outperforms DESH-SC by accommodating significantly more update transactions in the system. Moreover, DESH-SA can also achieve near-optimal update workload.

Turbulence distance of radial Gaussian Schell-model array beams	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS; LASER	The effect of turbulence on the spreading of radial Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beams is studied quantitatively by examining the mean-squared beam width. The analytical expression for the turbulence distance z (T) of radial GSM array beams is derived by using the integral transform technique, which indicates within what ranges radial GSM array beams will be less affected by turbulence. It is shown that the effect of turbulence on the spreading of radial GSM array beams can be reduced by choosing the suitable array beam parameters and the type of the beam superposition. In addition, a comparison with the previous work is also made.	[Li, X.; Ji, X.] Sichuan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Eyyuboglu, H.

It finds that under a certain condition different types of partially coherent beams may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in atmospheric turbulence if the angular spread is chosen as the characteristic parameter of beam directionality. On the other hand, it shows that generally, the directionality of partially coherent beams expressed in terms of the angular spread is not consistent with that in terms of the normalized far-field average intensity distribution in free space, but the consistency can be achieved due to turbulence.

The electromagnetic Gaussian Schell-model beam is taken as a typical example of partially coherent electromagnetic beams, and the closed-form expressions for the degree of polarization, the degree of coherence and the spectrum of electromagnetic Gaussian Schell-model beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived in the quadratic approximation of Rytov's phase structure function. Some interesting results are obtained, which are illustrated by numerical examples and are explained in physics.

We analyze the transmission probabilty of this system in both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases, and our results reveal that the transport properties show some noticeable characteristics depending upon the spin-polarized strength p, the magnetic flux Phi and the number of lattice sites N(R) in the mesoscopic ring.

In this study, we performed quantitative analysis by confocal microscopy assay for evaluation of HER2 expression in individual tumor cells. HER2 testing by confocal microscopy assay exhibited high concordance with results of real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and FISH analysis. We found that there was a significant positive correlation between HER2 overexpression and gene amplification in individual CTCs, which provided validation of confocal microscopy assay for HER2 expression in CTCs. By using subsets of 10 consecutive cells (bins), we conclude that HER2 expression (3+) in CTCs predicts HER2 overexpression of tumor with high probability in breast cancer patients. These results may provide interpretive guidelines for HER2 status assay in CTCs and raise great opportunities for using CTCs as non-invasive and 'real-time' biopsy to examine and monitor the status of tumor markers.

The influences of synthetic conditions such as polymerization temperature, the amount of initiator (AIBN) and the property of template on the morphologies and diameter sizes of MIPMs were investigated in details. The results indicated that the morphologies of MIPMs were evidently affected by the polymerization temperature and the amount of AIBN. The diameters of MIPMs were decreased with increasing the polymerization temperature but increased with increasing the amount of AIBN, while the influences of template on the diameters of microspheres are not visible. The resultant MIPMs was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), IR analysis, BET adsorption test and Scatchard analysis as well as the controlled release test in mimetic gastric juice (pH = 1). The IR analyses proved that the polymerization effects really occurred. The BET adsorption test indicated that the adsorption amount of MIPMs to LMD was as three times as that of non-imprinted microspheres (NIPMs). The controlled release test indicated that the release ratio of LMD on NIPMs was linearly increased with increasing time, which suggests that the release process is completely controlled by diffusion. Meanwhile, the release ratio of LMD on MIPMs was curvedly increased with increasing time, which indicates that the release process is controlled by both diffusion and the imprinting effect. And the release time was prolonged. The results indicate that the MIPMs released the LMD for 10 h while the NIPMs for only 5 h in the mimetic gastric juice. Therefore, the resultant MIPMs of LMD looks forward to being used as the materials for DDS.

The influence of turbulence on the spreading and directionality is studied in detail. It is shown that for the coherent combination, the radial Gaussian array beams with smaller beam number N and larger radial radius r(0) are less affected by the turbulence. The spreading of radial Gaussian array beams for the coherent combination is smaller than that for the incoherent case. However, the spreading of radial Gaussian array beams for the coherent combination is more affected by turbulence than that for the incoherent case. Specially, the mean-squared beam width in the far-field for the coherent combination is the same as that for the incoherent case when N is small enough or r(0) is large enough. On the other hand, the condition under which radial Gaussian array beams for both coherent and incoherent combinations have the same farfield divergence angle as a single Gaussian beam is also given. The main results are interpreted physically.

Here, we investigated the antitumor activity of periplocin against lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and explored its anti-cancer mechanism. Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time-and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human (A549) and mouse (LL/2) lung cancer xenograft models. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed. Furthermore, anti-cancer activity mediated by periplocin was associated with decreased level of phosphorylated AKT and ERK both in vitro and in vivo, which were important for cell growth and survival. Moreover, periplocin induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax, leading to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. These findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo, which could be attributed to the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis signaling pathway, such as AKT and ERK. These observations provide further evidence on the anti-tumor effect of periplocin, and it may be of importance to further explore its potential role as a therapeutic agent for cancer.

The adsorption energies, equilibrium geometries and vibration frequencies of CH(3)OH on nine types of sites on the Pt-Mo(111)/C surface were predicted and the favorite adsorption site for methanol is the top-Pt site. Both sites of valence and conduction bands of doped system have been broadened, which are favorable for electrons to transfer to the cavity. The possible decomposition pathway was investigated with transition state searching and the calculation results indicate that the O-H bond is first broken, and then the methanol decomposes into methoxy. The activation barrier of O-H bond breaking with Pt Mo catalyst is only 104.8 kJ mol(-1), showing that carbon supported Pt Mo alloys have promoted the decomposition of methanol. Comparing with the adsorption energies of CH(3)OH on the Pt(111)/C surface and that of CO, the adsorption energies of CO are higher, and Pt(111)/C is liable to be oxidized and loses the activity, which suggests that the catalyst Pt Mo(111)/C is in favor of decomposing methanol and has better anti-poisoning ability than Pt(111)/C.

Selenium (Se)-enriched yeast has probably been the most widely investigated food supplement and the literature on Se speciation in the Se-enriched yeast is fairly abundant, however, the strategy for Se speciation commonly requires complicated pretreatment procedures such as digestion and stepwise extraction. The present study was carried out to apply X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for the direct speciation of Se species with minimal pretreatment steps. By comparison of the XAS spectra of Se-enriched yeast samples with that of the standard Se species, organic R-Se-R (represented by selenomethionine) was found to be the main chemical form of Se. Quantitative speciation through principal component analysis (PCA) and least-squares linear combination (LC) fitting the Se-enriched yeast samples found 83%, 85% and 81% of R-Se-R (probably selenomethionine which is known to exist in yeast) for SelenoPrecise (R) yeast, SelenoPrecise (R) tablets, and Xiweir (R) tablets, respectively, which is in agreement with those from HPLC-ICP-MS analysis. More broadly, XAS can also be applied to other Se-enriched products with the merit of minimal pretreatment. However since XAS, specifically XANES, can only identify the chemical type rather than specific molecules, other methods like HPLC-ICP-MS are necessary to give not only the coordination environment of Se but also the identity of the Se species.

The supramolecular network of asym-TTT facilitates the formation of the directional-oriented molecular arrays of zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPc). The high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopic (STM) images as well as the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferential adsorption of ZnPc dimers in the anisotropic rearrangement of an asym-TTT supramolecular network. The self-repairing process of the molecular arrays after sweeping ZnPc dimers further confirms the anisotropic reconstruction of the asym-TTT network. The controlled experiments on the symmetrically substituted compound indicate the impact of the asymmetrically substituted carboxyl groups on the supramolecular networks.

Hybrid battery capacitors LAC/Li4Ti5O12 and DMLAC/Li4Ti5O12 were then assembled. The effects of the content of LiFePO4 and the preparation method on the cyclic voltammograms, the rate of charge discharge and the cycle performance of the hybrid battery capacitors were investigated. The results showed the overall electrochemical performance of the hybrid battery capacitors was the best when the content of LiFePO4 in the composite cathode materials was in the range from 11.8 to 28.5 wt. %, while the preparation method had almost no impact on the electrochemical performance of the composite cathodes and hybrid battery-capacitors. Moreover, the hybrid battery capacitor devices had a good cycle life performance at high rates. After 1000 cycles, the capacity loss of the DMLAC/Li4Ti5O12 hybrid battery capacitor device at 4C was no more than 4.8 %.

We developed an efficient synthetic method for C3-symmetrical truxene derivative 2,7,12-trihydroxy-3,8,13-trimethoxytruxene 5, and further a series of ether-ester mixed tail truxene discogens HTn, TR(OMe)3[OOCC6H2(OCnH2n+1)3]3 were prepared. The truxene discogens HTn (n = 4-8, 10, 12) were characterised by using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Their thermal stability was studied with thermal gravimetric analysis and their liquid crystal properties were investigated by using polarising optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. They exhibit a hexagonal columnar (Colh) mesophase in fairly wide temperature ranges.

The neighborhood is named stationary neighborhood (SN). In this method, the noisy image is considered as an observation of a nonlinear time series (NTS). Image denoising must recover the true state of the NTS from the observation. At first, the false neighbors (FNs) in a neighborhood for each pixel are removed according to the context. After moving the FNs, we obtain an SN, where the NTS is stationary and the real state can be estimated using the theory of stationary time series (STS). Since each SN of an image pixel consists of elements with similar context and nearby locations, the method proposed in this paper can not only adaptively find neighbors and determine size of the SN according to the characteristics of a pixel, but also be able to denoise while effectively preserving edges. Finally, in order to show the superiority of this algorithm, we compare this method with the existing universal denoising algorithms. Copyright (C) 2010 Zhiwu Liao et al.

The positive charge mobility was observed to be in the order of 10(-5) similar to 10(-4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). Though the thermal stability of Colh mesophase is higher than that of 2, the carrier mobility of 1 is smaller by one order of magnitude probably due to the presence of an electrical dipole of the carbonyl group. Also the temperature dependence of mobility in 1 exhabits a thermally activation behavior in a stronger way than in 2, indicating the hydrogen bond interaction affect the thermal behavior of charge hopping by a modification of molecular dynamics.

Here, we consider the quantum transport along the one-dimensional electron structures driven by time-dependent external fields, typical the open mesoscopic rings threaded by time-periodic magnetic fluxes. Based on the well-known Floquet theorem we effectively separate the time and space variables in the transport equations. As a consequence, the time-dependence behaviors can be characterized by the so-called Floquet energies and the usual quantum waveguide theory (only involving with elastic scatterings) could be generalized to treat the situations with various inelastic scatterings between different Floquet energy sidebands. Our numerical results show clearly that, due to the interaction between the electrons and the applied oscillating fields (i.e., time-dependent fluxes), transmission resonances can be induced by means of photon emissions and absorptions. The influence of the amplitude of the additional static magnetic flux on these photon-assisted tunnelings are also investigated. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The lattice constants and electronic band structure are found consistent with the available experimental and theoretical values. The pressure of the wurtzite-to-rocksalt structural transition is 13.4 GPa, which is in an excellent agreement with the most recent experimental values. The optical characteristics reproduce the experimental data thus justifying the feasibility of our theoretical predictions of the optical properties of InN at high pressures.

The complexes have the general formula ppyPt(O boolean AND O), where ppy is 2-phenylpyridyl, and O boolean AND O is beta-diketonate ancillary ligands with the acyl substituent group in position 3 of (D)-(+)-camphor. Although, like the many Pt(II) complexes with square-planar geometry, these complexes have plane stacking modes in crystal structure, the sterically bulky camphor-derived groups compel extensive slipping of the molecular stacking planes, resulting in the negligible overlapping of the aromatic ring fragments between molecules and the considerable Pt-Pt distance. The resolved spectra and a little shifted emission in solid state of complexes show that there is significant reduction of pi-pi interactions and Pt-Pt interactions, and suggest these complexes may be good candidates for doped phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) and even for nondoped PhOLEDs.

The influence of thickness of insulator layer and magnetic semiconductor layer on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and conductance are studied for different Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength and the different angle theta between the two magnetic moments of the left and right magnetic semiconductor layer. The results indicate that: in the presence of the spin-filter effect and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling interaction in the magnetic semiconductor layer, large TMR can be obtained in this double spin-filter junction. With the strength of Rashba spin-orbit coupling increasing, the tunnel magnetoresistance and conductance exhibit rapidly oscillating behavior and the oscillation period decreases gradually.

J	Ji, XL				Ji Xiao-Ling			Rayleigh Range of Hermite-Gaussian Array Beams	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							SCHELL-MODEL BEAMS; PROPAGATION; COMBINATION; ATMOSPHERE	An analytical expression for the Rayleigh range of Hermite-Gaussian (H-G) array beams is derived. It is shown that under the non-phase-locked case the Rayleigh range z(R) increases monotonously with the increasing beam number M, the beam separation distance x(d) and the beam waist widthw(0), and with decreasing the beam order m. However, under the phase-locked case there exists oscillatory behavior of z(R) versus and x(d). For Gaussian array beams, under the phase-locked case, z(R) is always larger than that under the non-phase-locked case. However, it holds true only when x(d) is small enough or w(0) is large enough for H-G array beams. In addition, z(R) of Gaussian array beams is always larger than that of H-G array beams.

Furthermore, the cytotoxicity results showed that the PECE hydrogel could be regarded as a safe carrier, and bFGF could be released from the hydrogel system in an extended period in vitro. Otherwise, the immunogenicity of bFGF was improved significantly after encapsulated into the hydrogel. Strong humoral immunity created by bFGF-hydrogel was maintained for more than 14 weeks. Therefore, the prepared bFGF loaded PECE hydrogel might have great potential as a novel vaccine adjuvant for protein antigen.

By using an existence theorem of maximal elements for a family of set-valued mappings in FC-spaces due to the author, an existence theorem of solutions for a system of generalized vector quasivariational inclusions is first proved in general FC-spaces. By applying the existence result of solutions of the system of generalized vector quasivariational inclusions, some existence theorems of (weak) Pareto equilibria for the generalized constrained multiobjective games are established in noncompact product FC-spaces. Some special cases of our results are also discussed. Our results are new and different from the corresponding known results in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The relative stability of the zinc-blende phase with respect to the NiAs one and the ferromagnetism to the antiferromagnetism are confirmed by comparing total energy of various structures. Full optimization for all these structures is performed, including the cell volume, c/a for tetrahedral cells and internal parameters. Our calculation shows that when the Cr composition is less than 30%, the zinc-blende phase is more stable, whereas the NiAs one is more stable for more Cr composition. Therefore, bulk Al1-xCrxAs with zinc-blende structure can be obtained when x is smaller than 0.3, whereas only epitaxial films can exist for larger x. For all these compounds with x ranging from 0.125 to 1.0, robust half-metallic ferromagnetism is found in the zinc-blende phase. In addition, the effects of the spin-orbital interaction are considered and the total magnetic moments including both the spin and orbital contributions are presented. The spin-orbital interaction will destroy the perfect half-metallic ferromagnetism by reflecting some majority-spin states into the minority-spin gap, however, the decrease of the spin-polarization is only about 0.2% for all substitutional cases. At last, we give the exchange parameters and consecutively the Curie temperature within the mean-field approximation. Our systematical calculation for Al1-xCrxAs is useful to elucidate the half-metallic ferromagnetism in Al1-xCrxAs and to explore high-performance spintronic devices based on Al1-xCrxAs in future information technologies.

High-resolution electron microscopy reveals that the sizes of the Si NDs range from 9 to 30 nm. Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicate that the energy peak shifts from 738 to 778 nm with increasing the ND size. In this system, the quantum confinement effect is fairly strong even for relatively large (up to 25 nm in diameter) NDs, which is promising for the development of the next-generation all-Si tandem solar cells capable of effectively capturing sunlight photons with the energies between 1.7 (infrared: large NDs) and 3.4 eV (ultraviolet: small NDs). The strength of the resulting electron confinement in the Si/AlN ND system is evaluated and justified by analyzing the measured PL spectra using the ionization energy theory approximation.	[Huang, S.

These complexes display good nonlinear optical properties. The predominant for second-order nonlinear optical properties is the charge transfer with pi-pi* character occurring between the left ligands. The third-order nonlinear optical properties is main determind by the charge transfer with d-pi* character from metal Pt atom to beta-Diketonate ancillary ligands, in addition, the transition between the left ligands is also play an important role.

The SAW amplitude at the entrance of the quantum point contact (QPC) is obtained by using coupling-of-modes theory and p-matrix method. The calculated results indicate that a device with an IDT with a relatively small aperture, large pairs of IDT fingers, and short distance between the active IDT and the QPC, the SAW amplitude is typically enhanced under the same radio frequency (rf) power. Based on these results, we design the corresponding SAW devices, and good agreement is achieved between the experimental data and the numerical results. In experiment, for the devices with optimal IDTs, the rf powers required to observe the quantized acoustoelectric current are reduced; correspondingly, the rf heating effect is reduced. Most importantly, the improvement of the accuracy of the quantized plateau is achieved. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Our results reveal that the reaction temperature plays an important role in the formation of LiNiO2 film by hydrothermal method. When the reaction temperature is lower (under 140 degrees C), the pure LiNiO2 film cannot be obtained since the insufficient oxidative dissolution of Ni substrate; the crystallinity of LiNiO2 films increases with the increasing reaction temperature; and when the temperature reaches 200 degrees C, the pure, dense and uniform LiNiO2 film has been synthesized.

Structure, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of (Bi1-x-yNa0.925-x-yLi0.075)(0.5)BaxSryTiO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics	CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						Lead-free; Piezoelectric; Ferroelectric; Dielectric; Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3	ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; DEPOLARIZATION TEMPERATURE; PHASE-TRANSITION	Lead-free multi-component ceramics (Bi1-x-yNa0.925-x-yLi0.075)(0.5)BaxSryTiO3 have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique and their structure and electrical properties have been Studied. All the ceramics can be well-sintered at 1100 degrees C. X-ray diffraction patterns shows that Li+, Ba2+ and Sr2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite Structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is formed at 0.04 < x < 0.08. As compared to pure Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 ceramic, the coercive field E-C of the ceramics decreases greatly and the remanent polarization P, of the ceramics increases significantly after the formation of the multi-component solid solution. Due to the MPB, lower E-C and higher P-r the piezoelectricity of the ceramics is greatly improved. For the ceramics with the compositions near the MPB (x = 0.04-0.08 and y = 0.02-0.04), piezoelectric coefficient d(33) = 133-193 pC/N and planar electromechanical Coupling factor k(P) = 16.2-32.1%. The depolarization temperature T-d reaches a minimum value near the MPB. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions at temperatures near/above T-d.

The orientational energy of a molecule may be postulated as u(theta, S)=-aSg(theta), where theta is the angle which the molecular axis makes with the preferred axis, and S is the order parameter. The Gay-Berne potential was proved to be of considerable value in computer simulation studies of liquid crystals. The potential function g(theta) was tried to form by using the Gay-Berne functional. According to our experimental studies for the triphenylene derivatives with vinyloxy peripheral chains, which are abbreviated as C(18)H(6)(OC(5)H(11))(6-n)(OC(2)H(4)OCH=CH(2))(n) (n=0 similar to 3), the more unsaturated chain the molecule contains, the higher the clear point is. These molecules have been studied with an ONIOM(MP2/6-31G*(0.25):UFF) method. The interaction energies between two molecules in four configurations have been evaluated. Then the parameters in. the Gay-Berne potential have been determined by comparison with these interaction energies. The clear point data obtained from the mean field approximation are in agreement with the experimental results.

We show that proximal and Frechet subdifferentials of a minimal time function are representable by virtue of corresponding normal cones of sublevel sets of the function and level or suplevel sets of the support function of U. The known results in the literature require the set U to have the origin as an interior point or U be compact.

The interaction energies of all the complexes corrected by basis set superposition error, are within -13.7 to -82.5 kJ/mol. The strong hydrogen bonding mainly contribute to the interaction energies, Natural bond orbital analysis is performed to reveal the origin of the interaction.

ANALYTICAL DETERMINATION OF NUCLEATION FIELD AND MAGNETIC REVERSAL MODES IN EXCHANGE-COUPLED NANOLAYERS	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Nucleation modes; nanolayers; reversal mechanism	HYSTERESIS LOOP; COERCIVITY	General formulae for coherent/incoherent nucleation fields have been obtained as functions of the thickness of the hard and soft layers within a self-contained micromagnetic model for a hard/soft trilayer. The nucleation modes are determined reliably by direct comparison of the nucleation fields for different modes. It is shown that coherent nucleation cannot take place no matter how small the layer thickness. For small soft layer thickness, the magnetic reversal mode is an incoherent nucleation. As the soft layer thickness increases, the dominant magnetic reversal process is domain-wall motion/pinning. Analyses demonstrate that negative nucleation field and very small coercivity occur when the easy axes of neighboring layers are perpendicular. The results could shade light on Brown's coercivity paradox (where the measured coercivity is much smaller than the one given by the previous theories).

The influence of Co and Cu doping on the surface morphologies of ZnO films was investigated. X-ray diffraction shows that all the ZnO thin film samples are well oriented and the grain size of Cu-doped ZnO film is the largest. Strong blue double emission and weak green emission Were observed in the photoluminescence spectra of all samples at room temperature and both long wavelength blue peak and green peak could be modulated by doping. The blue double peaks are caused by transition of electrons from the bottom of the conduction band to zinc vacancy or from the zinc interstitial to the top of the valence band. However, the green peak is highly relevant to the oxygen slip formed by doping.

We optimized the geometric configurations of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products. A vibrational analysis and an energy calculation proved the authenticities of the intermediates and the transition states. Nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories were used to discuss the bond nature and orbital interactions at the same levels. At the same time, we compared the influence of two different copper catalysts on the catalytic activity. Computation results indicate that they have the same reaction path and that the activation energy with CuBr catalysis is smaller than the activation energy with CuI catalysis. CuBr, therefore, promotes the higher catalytic activity, which is in good agreement with experimental results.

Structure, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of (Bi0.98-x La0.02Na1-x )(0.5)Ba (x) TiO3 lead-free ceramics	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; TRANSITION; BEHAVIOR	Lead-free (Bi0.98-x La0.02Na1-x )(0.5)Ba (x) TiO3 ceramics have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique and their structure, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties have been studied. The results of X-ray diffraction show that La2+ and Ba2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) exists at 0.04 < x < 0.10. Compared with pure Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 ceramics, the (Bi0.98-x La0.02Na1-x )(0.5)Ba (x) TiO3 ceramics possess much smaller coercive field E (c) and larger remanent polarization P (r). Because of the low E (c) (3.38 kV/mm), large P (r) (46.2 mu C/cm(2)) and the formation of the MPB of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are significantly enhanced at x=0.06: d (33)=181 pC/N and k (p)=36.3%. The depolarization temperature T (d) reaches a minimum value near the MPB. The ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which is probably a result from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both polar and non-polar regions at the temperatures above T (d).

It is shown that for the superposition of the intensity the M(2)-factor increases monotonically with increasing the beam order, the beam number and the relative beam separation distance, and decreasing the beam coherence parameter. However, for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function there may appear a minimum of the M(2)-factor as the beam number or the beam coherence parameter changes. On the other hand, a comparison of the M(2)-factor between the two types of superposition is also given. It is found that the M(2)-factor for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function may be smaller or larger than that for the superposition of the intensity depending on the beam order and the relative beam separation distance. However, the M(2)-factor for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function is always smaller than that for the superposition of the intensity when the beam order is equal to zero or the relative beam separation distance is small enough. In particular, the M(2)-factor is nearly the same for the two types of superposition when the beam coherence parameter is small enough or the relative beam separation distance is large enough.

J	Yang, DH				Yang DingHua			The fundamental theory of abstract majorization inequalities	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES A-MATHEMATICS			English	Article						abstract mean; abstract convex function; abstract majorization; abstract majorization inequality		Using the axiomatic method, abstract concepts such as abstract mean, abstract convex function and abstract majorization are proposed. They are the generalizations of concepts of mean, convex function and majorization, respectively. Through the logical deduction, the fundamental theorems about abstract majorization inequalities are established as follows: for arbitrary abstract mean Sigma and Sigma', and abstract Sigma -> Sigma' strict convex function f(x) on the interval I, if x(i), y(i) is an element of I (i = 1, 2,..., n) satisfy that (x(1), x(2),...,x(n)) <(Sigma)(n) (y(1), y(2),...,y(n)), then Sigma{f(x(1)), f(x(2)),...f(x(n)) >= Sigma'{f(y(1)), f(y(2)),...f(y(n))}. This class of inequalities extends and generalizes the fundamental theorem of majorization inequalities. Moreover, concepts such as abstract vector mean are proposed, the fundamental theorems about abstract majorization inequalities are generalized to n-dimensional vector space. The fundamental theorem of majorization inequalities about the abstract vector inean are established as follows: for arbitrary symmetrical convex set S subset of R(n), and n-variable abstract symmetrical (Sigma) over bar -> Sigma' strict convex function phi((x) over bar) on S, if (x) over bar, (y) over bar is an element of S satisfy (x) over bar <(Sigma)(n) (y) over bar, then phi((x) over bar) >= phi((y) over bar); if vector group (x) over bar (i), (y) over bar (i) is an element of S (i = 1, 2,..., m) satisfy {(x) over bar (1), (x) over bar (2),...,(x) over bar}, <((Sigma) over bar)(n) {(y) over bar (1), (y) over bar (2),..., (y) over bar (m)}, then Sigma'{phi((x) over bar (1)), phi(x) over bar (2),..., phi((x) over bar (m))} >= Sigma'{phi((y) over bar (1)), phi((y) over bar (2)),..., phi((y) over bar (m))}.

By applying an existence theorem of maximal elements of a family of set-valued mappings involving condensing mapping due to author, we prove some new existence theorems of solutions for the systems of generalized quasi-variational inclusion problems. As applications, some existence results of solutions of the mathematical programs with systems of generalized vector quasi-variational inclusion constraints are established in noncompact locally FC-uniform spaces.

The transition states were determined using complete linear synchronous transit and quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) methods. All the species involved in this process had four possible adsorption sites (top, fcc, hcp, and bridge) on the Ni(111) surface and all these were fully optimized to obtain their equilibrium geometries and electronic structures. The corresponding adsorption energies and Mulliken charge analyses of these species were predicted and compared. Favorable adsorption sites on the Ni(111) surface for these species were found. In the C-C bond activation pathway, the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step was 257.9 kJ . mol(-1). However, the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step was only 159.8 kJ . mol(-1) for the C-H bond activation pathway, which suggested that the C-H bond activation pathway would be preferred. As a result, the main products are C2H4 and H-2.

The interaction energies are -45.783 and -89.998 kJ.mol(-1) for the most stable dimer and trimer, respectively, after the basis set superposition error and zero-point corrections. The formation of O-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonds makes O-H symmetric stretching modes in the dimer and trimer red-shifted relative to those of the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid monomer. The natural bond orbit analysis shows that the inter-molecular charge transfers are 0.60475e and 1.20225e for the dimer and trimer, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the formation of trimer is an exothermic and spontaneous process at low and room temperature. A supramolecule can be constructed through the strong N center dot center dot center dot H-O intermolecular hydrogen bonds between bipyridine and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.

By constructing a type of cross-constrained variational problem and establishing so-called cross-invariant manifolds of the evolution flow, we first derive a sharp threshold for global existence and blow-up of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the equations under study.

Ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of [(Bi0.98La0.02Na1-x Li (x) )(0.5)](0.94)Ba0.06TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; SYSTEM	Lead-free ceramics [(Bi0.98La0.02Na1-x Li (x) )(0.5)](0.94)Ba0.06TiO3 have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique and their ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties have been studied. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that Li+, Ba2+, and La3+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. The partial substitution of Li+ lowers the coercive field E (c) and improves the remanent polarization P (r). Because of the larger P (r) and lower E (c), the ceramic with x = 0.10 exhibits optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 212 pC/N and k (P) = 36.1%. The partial substitution of Li+ for Na+ shifts the depolarization temperature T (d) toward low temperature. The ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which is probably resulted from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics contain both the polar and non-polar regions near/above T (d), which cause the polarization hysteresis loop become deformed and the ceramics become depolarized.

J	Yang, AL; Zhang, ET; Ji, XL; Lu, BD				Yang, Ailin; Zhang, Entao; Ji, Xiaoling; Lue, Baida			Propagation properties of partially coherent Hermite-cosh-Gaussian beams through atmospheric turbulence	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Propagation property; Partially coherent Hermite-cosh-Gaussian (HChG) beam; Atmospheric turbulence	LASER-BEAMS; GENERAL BEAMS; AVERAGE INTENSITY; DIRECTIONALITY	The analytical expression of partially coherent Hermite-cosh-Gaussian (HChG) beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived and used to study their propagation properties through atmospheric turbulence. It is shown that partially coherent HChG beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence undergo several stages of evolution and a decrease of the spatial correlation length speeds up the evolution process. The smaller the spatial correlation length and the larger the beam orders are, the less the beam-width spreading of partially coherent HChG beams is affected by turbulence.

Based on the stability theory of fixed points of dynamical systems, we show theoretically and numerically that an appropriate coupling scheme allows us to find the synchronization functional relationship between the states of coupled time-delay chaotic systems. On the other hand, given a synchronization function, this approach may help us to design the coupling scheme. To demonstrate the proposed method, Ikeda system is presented as an example.

The precedence reaction processes of Ba, Ti, and 0 atoms, the formation of BaO and TiO2 molecules, and the microcosmic reaction mechanism underlying the formation of BTO have been investigated using a generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory (DFT) at the PW91/DNP level. The reaction intermediates, transition states (TS), and activation energy have been calculated. The mechanisms of formation of BTO molecules have been explored using the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital theory. The reasons of formation of perovskite-structured BTO thin films have been investigated comparing with the formation of STO thin films. It was found that BaO, TiO2 and BTO molecules are the primary particle states in the early growth of BTO thin films. As it acts as a combining center, the TiO2 molecule is preferentially formed. Subsequently, BaO molecules combine with this center and BTO molecule, which is stable and somewhat similar to the BTO unit cell, is constructed. Due to the mechanisms, BTO thin films have been formed.

The results indicate that the introduction of conjugated substituting groups of electron-donor and conjugated substituting groups of strong electron-accepter makes maximal absorption wavelength red-shifted and blue-shifted, respectively. The introduction of conjugated substituting groups resultes in obvious increase of Second nonlinear optical properties for IrQ(3) complexes. The electronic transfer belongs to intra-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) for AgQ complexes, and LLCT mixed with partially metal-to-ligand charge transfer for PtQ(2) and IrQ(3) complexes. There is no effect of substituting groups on transition properties for AgQ, PtQ(2) and IrQ(3) complexes.

J	Li, XQ; Ji, XL				Li, Xiaoqing; Ji, Xiaoling			Angular spread and directionality of the Hermite-Gaussian array beam propagating through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; LASER ARRAY	Using the integral transform technique, the analytical expressions for the mean-squared beam width and the angular spread of the Hermite-Gaussian (H-G) array beam in turbulence are derived for the case of both coherent and incoherent combinations. It is shown that the angular spread of the H-G array beam for the coherent combination may be more or less affected by turbulence than that for the incoherent combination (or a single H-G beam) depending on the beam parameters. For the coherent combination, there exists the oscillatory behavior of the angular spread, and the influence of turbulence on the angular spread is not monotonic versus the beam parameters. In addition, for the coherent combination case, the angular spread of the H-G array beam is less affected by turbulence than that of the Gaussian array beam. On the other hand, it is found that under a certain condition, the H-G array beam may have the same directionality as a single Gaussian beam both in free space and in turbulence if the angular spread is chosen as the characteristic parameter of the beam directionality. The main results are explained physically.

The crystal quality Of CoSi2 film is found to be significantly dependent on the Si cap thickness. In our work, a good-quality CoSi2 film with a minimum of chi(min)similar to 11.6% and 3.3 Omega/square was obtained as a 15 nm Co with a subsequent 15 nm Si cap layer is deposited on an oxide-mediated CoSi2 template and followed by an anneal at 1050 degrees C under N-2 protection: whereas too thin or thick Si cap layer will deteriorate the crystalline quality Of CoSi2.

The nucleation field, coercivity and angular distribution of the magnetization, have been obtained as functions of the thickness L of the misaligned layer, the layer with the easy axis perpendicular to the applied field. It is found that the coercivity is identical to the nucleation field only for very small L. For larger L (larger than a quarter of its Bloch wall width), the nucleation field is negative while the coercivity saturates at 0.414H(K), where H(K) is the anisotropy field. Thus for larger L, the coercivity mechanism is self-pinning rather than pure nucleation. This self-pinning has both attributes of traditional nucleation and pinning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Low symmetric discogens exhibit decreased melting points and wide mesophase ranges. A series of triphenylene derivatives 1, C(18)H(6)(OC (n) H(2n+1))(4)(OMe)(O(2)CC(2)H(4)C(6)F(13)), and their hydrocarbon analogues 2, C(18)H(6)(OC (n) H(2n+1))(4)(OMe)(O(2)CC(8)H(17)), n = 4-8, were synthesized for the investigation of the influence of semi-fluorinated peripheral chain and molecular symmetry on mesomorphism. The structures were characterized with 1H NMR and MS. The mesomorphism was studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM). The results showed that all triphenylene derivatives exhibited enantiotropic columnar mesophase.

The effect of metastable states of the impurities on quantized acoustoelectric current	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Semiconductors; Impurities in semiconductors; Electronic transport	SURFACE ACOUSTIC-WAVES; SINGLE-ELECTRON TRANSPORT; ONE-DIMENSIONAL CHANNEL; NOISE	We report a detailed experimental study of the fluctuations of acoustoelectric (AE) current induced by surface acoustic waves in a shallow-etched quantum point contact defined in a GaAs/Al(x)Ga(1-x)As heterostructure at 1.7 K. We observe that current fluctuations between two AE current plateaus are more obvious than those at the plateaus. Switching the metastable states of the impurities is considered as the physical origin of the current fluctuations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, C. Y.; Guo, H.

Ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-SrTiO3-Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Ceramics; Ferroelectrics; Sintering; Piezoelectricity	B-SITE SUBSTITUTION; DEPOLARIZATION TEMPERATURE; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES	New lead-free ternary ceramics (1 - x - y)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xSrTiO(3)-yBi(0.5)Li(0.5)TiO(3) have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique and their ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties have been studied. All the ceramics can be well-sintered at 1100 degrees C. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that Li+ and Sr2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a single-phase rhombohedral perovskite structure. After the substitutions of Li+ and Sr2+, the coercive field E-C decreases, the remanent polarization P-r increases, and hence the piezoelectric coefficient d(33) and planar electromechanical coupling factor k(P) increase. For the ceramics with x = 0.13-0.15 and y = 0.10-0.15, the piezoelectric properties become optimum, giving d(33) = 127-146 pC/N and k(P) = 0.24-0.30. Our results also suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions near the depolarization temperature T-d, which cause the polarization hysteresis loop become deformed and the ceramics become depolarized.

The closed-form expressions for the spectral degree of coherence and the spectral intensity of focused GSM array beams are derived. It is shown that the spectral degree of coherence of focused GSM array beams is the same as that of focused GSM beams in the focal plane. on the other hand, it is found that, in the focal plane the spectral intensity distribution of focused GSM array beams is the fringe pattern when the value of the coherence length is small. However, it becomes one peak located at the center as the value of the coherence length is large enough. In the focal plane, the spectral intensity maximum increases and the width of the normalized spectral intensity distribution decreases as the beam number increases. In general, for GSM array beams, the width of the modulus of the spectral degree of coherence in the focal plane always exceeds that of the normalized spectral intensity distribution, which is different from the behavior of focused GSM beams. In addition, the power in the bucket (PIB) and the beam propagation factor (M(2) factor) are also discussed. The main results are explained physically. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A maximum power efficiency eta(p) of 6.62 lm/W and current efficiency of 14.78 cd/A at 745 cd/m(2) are obtained from the device. The roll-off percentage of eta(p) of the pure phosphorescent phosphor layer device is reduced to 5% at a current density of 20 mA/cm(2), which is about 11% for conventional phosphorescent devices. The low roll-off efficiency is attributed to the phosphorescent material, which has the molecular structure of a strong steric hindrance effect.

Using the theorem, we consider a class of periodic Ito stochastic functional differential equations, and some sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic solution of the equations are given. To overcome the difficulties created by the special features possessed by the periodic stochastic differential equations with delays, as one will see, several lemmas are introduced. These existence theorems are rather general and therefore have great power in applications. Especially, our results are natural generalization of some classical periodic theorems on the model without stochastic perturbation. An example is worked out to demonstrate the advantages of our results.

The experimental results are used to validate the theoretical model. The influences of pump configuration and fiber length on dynamic range, noise performance, and nonlinear impairment are discussed in detail. The result shows that an ultralong transmission of up to similar to 155 km by using a total of 1.38 W Raman pump power accompanied by gain clamping can be achieved; a backward pump is helpful to obtain a wider dynamic range and to avoid nonlinear impairment, but it is harmful to noise performance; and shorter fiber length is helpful to obtain both optimized gain clamping and weakened nonlinear impairment. Such an UL-FRL has considerable potential to realize both ultralong signal transmission and gain clamping to overcome signal distortion and interchannel cross talk in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) networks.

Here, we report the synthesis of eight diacetylene-bridged triphenylene discotic liquid crystal dimers, [C(18)H(6)(OC (n) H(2n+1))(4)(OMe)O(2)C-C(8)H(16)-Ca parts per thousand C-](2), 3(n), (n = 4-8), [C(18)H(6)(OC(6)H(13))(5)O(2)C-C(8)H(16)-Ca parts per thousand C-](2), 6 and [C(18)H(6)(OC(6)H(13))(5)O-(CH(2))(m)-Ca parts per thousand C-](2), 8(m), (m = 1, 3) by Eglinton coupling reaction. The thermotropic liquid crystal properties were studied by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy. The results are showed as follows: the length of peripheral alkyl chains of triphenylene influenced properties of liquid crystal dimers; dimers 3(n) (n = 5-8) and 6 had glass columnar phase, and no crystallization was observed above -50A degrees C for all the triphenylene dimers; compared with 3(6), 6 showed higher molecular symmetry, more stable columnar mesophase and wider mesophase range. The connecting group, length and rigidity of spacer had important influence on the mesomorphism of diacetylene-bridged triphenylene discotic liquid crystal dimers.

The results showed that ring-torsion angles and the energy gap reduced with decreasing V(2.0). We estimated pressure perpendicular to nitrogen plane of a chain in the polymer by the ring-torsion angles. While V(2.0) decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 eV, our estimated pressure increased from 0 to 9.03 GPa. The results agree with the experimental observations that electrical conductivity is increasing with applied pressure until a saturated value. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The morphology and structure analysis revealed that the AlxIn1-xN films grown on Si(1 1 1) and sapphire are of high orientation and good crystallinity with a bandgap energy (E-g) of less than 2.41 eV. The sheet resistance of AlxIn1-xN film grown on Si(1 1 1) and sapphire is approximately 40 Omega/square. These results are highly relevant to the development of effective nitride photovoltaic materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Dong, C. J.; Xu, M.; Chen, Q. Y.; Zhou, H.

Blank or honokiol loaded PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticles were prepared in moderate condition by solvent diffusion method without using any surfactants. The prepared blank PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticles are mono-dispersed and smaller than 200 nm. The particle size increased with increase in polymer concentration and oil-water (O/W) ratio. The prepared PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticles (40 mg/mL, ca. 106 nm) did not induce hemolysis in vitro. And the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) of it (48 h) on HEK293 cells was higher than 5 mg/mL Honokiol could be efficiently loaded into PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticles and released from these nanoparticles in an extended period in vitro. After honokiol (HK) was entrapped into PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticles, the particle size increased with the increase in HK/PCEC mass ratio in feed, and the encapsulated honokiol retained potent anticancer activity in vitro. The PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticle was suitable for honokiol delivery, and such honokiol loaded PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticle was a novel honokiol formulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that the absorption on the outside nanotube is energetically preferred to that on the inside nanotube, Morever, the adsorbed copper atom on the top of carbon is more stable than that on the other outside sites. At the same time, the characteristic of the forming bond on the top of carbon between copper and SWNT is detailed. The absorption behavior belongs to chemical absorption, and based on the analysis of frontier orbital, it is shown that the new a bond is mainly due to the interaction of 4s valence state of copper and coupling sigma-pi bond of SWNT. Furthermore, the calculated electron densities of two representative adsorption positions show that electron clouds overlap more on the top of carbon adsorbed copper atom, which further confirms that copper and carbon atoms can form chemical bond in a sense.

With the Fano factor, We analyse the effect of the Fano and the Kondo resonance on the conductance and the variation of the conductance with the spin-polarization strength and the magnetic flux in both the parallel and the antiparallel lead-polarization alignments. Our results show that the conductance can be controlled effectively by the spin-polarization strength and the magnetic flux, while the line shapes of the conductance depend mainly on the magnetic flux and that a large tunneling magnetoresistance and a negative tunneling magnetoresistance can arise by adjusting the relative parameters. This system is a possible candidate for spin valve transistors and is of potential applications in the spintronics.

Some new results about the recursive expression of the transient queue size distribution at any epoch n (+) and the recursive formulae of the equilibrium distribution are obtained. Furthermore, the recursive formulae of the equilibrium queue size distribution at epoch n (-), and n are obtained, too. The important relations between stationary queue size distributions at different epochs are discovered (being different from the relations given in M / G / 1 queueing system).

Firstly, we prove the existence of standing wave with ground state by applying an intricate variational argument. Next, by introducing all auxiliary functional and an equivalent minimization problem, we obtain two invariant manifolds under the Solution flow generated by the Cauchy problem to the aforementioned Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system. Furthermore, by constructing a type of constrained variational problem, utilizing the above two invariant manifolds as well as applying potential well argument and concavity method, we derive a sharp threshold for global existence and blowup. Then, combining the above results, we obtain two conclusions of how small the initial data are for the solution to exist globally by using dilation transformation. Finally, we prove a modified instability of standing wave to the system under study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Both nucleation and pinning fields as well as hysteresis loops have been calculated reliably as functions of L-s(soft layer thickness). In addition, detailed comparison between our results and experimental data has been done. With the demagnetization energy considered, the nucleation field of perpendicular by orientated case is lower than the parallel one and the nucleation occus before the reversal of the applied field. For small L-s, the theoretical coercivity equals to the nucleation field (it equals to pinning filed also). As the thickness of the soft phase increases, the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning. For large L-s, however, the coercivity is slightly smaller than the pinning field.,	[Xian Cheng-Wei; Zhao Guo-Ping; Zhang Qing-Xiang; Xu Jin-Song] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Solid State Phys, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Xian Cheng-Wei; Zhao Guo-Ping; Zhang Qing-Xiang; Xu Jin-Song] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Zhao Guo-Ping] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, State Key Lab Elect Thin Films & Integrated Devic, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China	Xian, CW (reprint author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Solid State Phys, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China.	zhaogp@uestc.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [10747007]	Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 10747007).		23	9	13	1	2	CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC	BEIJING	P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA	1000-3290			ACTA PHYS SIN-CH ED	Acta Phys.

Using the ab initio molecular dynamics method based on the first principles, the adsorption process, system energy, dynamic track and the diffusion coefficient are calculated at temperatures from 300 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The results indicate that the adsorption process can be divided into three stages, the physical adsorption, the chemical adsorption and the stable surface growth state. With the temperature increasing, the average diffusivity of the particles at alpha-Al2O3 (0001) surface is enhanced in the bonding process. The diffusion coefficient of N atom is higher than that of the Al atom, especially in the physical adsorption stage. At higher temperatures (over 700 degrees C), the role of desorption of the N atom is markedly strengthened, so it is unfavorable to the stable absorption of AlN. The temperature between 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C is beneficial to the stable adsorption and the growth of the AlN on alpha-Al2O3 (0001) surface.

This sensitizer possesses a very small HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital)-LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy gap and this allows for easy electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO. As the nanocrystalline TiO2 adsorbs the sensitizer, the energy of the HOMO level, the LUMO and Fermi level increase. These changes lead to an enhancement of the open-circuit photovoltage (V-oc) in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells. In addition, we theoretically determined the sensitization mechanism of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline-5-carboxylic acid)iron (III) dyes that are attached by carboxylic acid anchor groups to TiO2 anatase (101) surface.

X-ray diffraction studies reveal that Li+ diffuses into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. The addition of Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 effectively lowers the sintering temperature of the ceramics and greatly assists in the densification of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 0.075 possesses the optimum piezoelectric properties: piezoelectric coefficient d (33) = 121 pC/N and planar electromechanical coupling factor k (P) = 18.3%. After the partial substitution of Li+ for Na+ in the A-sites of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, the ceramics exhibit more relaxor characteristic, which is probably resulted from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The depolarization temperature T (d) shifts to low temperature with the substitution level x of Li+ for Na+ increasing.

Their structures were investigated with nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy and their thermotropic properties were studied with polarized optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that no liquid crystalline properties were found for 3a and 3b. Complexes of 4-n-alkoxybenzoic acid with 3a and 3b displayed nematic phase and smectic C phase, while complexes of 4-perfluorohexylbenzoic acid with 3a and 3b exhibited multiple smectic phases. 4a-n had both higher melting and clear points than 4b-n, while 4b-n exhibited odd-even effect. The infrared spectra demonstrated the hydrogen bonds existed between the benzoic acid and pyridine moieties in the supramolecular systems.

Hack. in Southwest China revealed by AFLP markers	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						AFLP marker; differentiation; genetic diversity; Pogonatherum paniceum (Lam.) Hack.; Southwest China	POPULATION	Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity of Pogonatherum paniceum (Lam.) Hack. from Sichuan Province, Yunnan Province, Chongqing City and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous Region in China. 10 primer combinations were carried out on 180 different individuals sampled from 22 wild populations. Out of the 485 discernable DNA fragments generated, 441 were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 90.93% at the species level. Observed number of alleles was 1.9093 +/- 0.2875 and effective number of alleles was 1.4048 +/- 0.3342. Nei's gene diversity and Shannon's Information index were 0.2494 +/- 0.1657 and 0.3903 +/- 0.2186, respectively. Nei's genetic distance among 22 populations ranged from 0.0996 to 0.6952. Genetic identity among populations ranged from 0.4990 to 0.9052, averaging 0.7387. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distance indicated that most populations were positioned into the relevant area. The above-mentioned results suggested the level of genetic variation of P. paniceum paniceum (Lam.) Hack. was low. The high score of PPB might be caused by low frequent polymorphism distributed in different populations. A significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances of populations was revealed based on Mantel test.

By constructing a type of cross-constrained variational problem and establishing so-called cross-invariant manifolds of the evolution flow, we establish a sharp threshold of global existence and blowup of it.

The influence of turbulence on the spreading of annular beams is studied. On the other hand, the range of turbulence-independent propagation is obtained by examining the mean squared beam width, which indicates under what circumstances annular beams will be less affected by turbulence. It is shown that annular beams with larger obscure ratio epsilon, larger beam order M (N), larger wave length lambda, and smaller outer radius w(0) are less sensitive to the turbulence than those with smaller epsilon, M(N), lambda and larger w(0). The main results obtained in this paper are explained physically.

The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, The vibration analysis and the IRC analysis demonstrated the authenticity of transition states, and the reaction processes were confirmed by the changes of charge density at bond-forming critical point. The results indicated that magnesium ethoxide is an effective catalyst in the synthesis of 2-dicyanomethylene-4,5,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-carbonitrile from malononitrile and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone. The activation energy of reaction with magnesium ethoxide decreased by 102.37 kJ mol(-1) compared with that of the reaction without it. The mechanism of reaction with catalyst magnesium ethoxide differs from that of reaction without it. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The closed-form expression for the degree of polarization of apertured EGSM beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived. It is shown that on propagation over sufficient long distances the degree of polarization of apertured EGSM beams with different values of beam truncation parameter and beam coherence parameter tends to the same value at the source plane and becomes uniform due to turbulence, which is quite different from the behavior in free space. The smaller the beam truncation parameter is, the less the degree of polarization is affected by turbulence. In particular, the degree of polarization of apertured EGSM beams is less sensitive to the effects of turbulence than that of unapertured EGSM beams.

A modified scaling law was proposed between the domain period and the film thickness for ferroelectric and ferromagnetic thin films. Both the slope and intercept of this scaling line can be used to get domain wall thickness in a consistent manner, which enriches the understanding of domain walls.

Further, the studies indicate that the normalized intensity distributions on FRFT plane depend on the fractional order, truncation parameter and initial beam parameter Omega. Variations of normalized intensity distributions with FRFT order are periodic: when the impact of aperture cannot be ignored, the variation period is 4; and when the impact of aperture can be ignored, the variation period is 2.

The amplification product lengths detected ranged from 95 to 170 bp. A total of 395 haplotypes, 303 of them unique, were found. The haplotype diversity of the Han was 0.9980 and of the Zhuang 0.9965, indicating a high discriminating power of these six miniY-STR loci in these two populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Glutamine Nitrogen and Ammonium Nitrogen Supplied as a Nitrogen Source Is Not Converted into Nitrate Nitrogen of Plant Tissues of Hydroponically Grown Pak-Choi (Brassica chinensis L.)	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE			English	Article						ammonium; glutamine; nitrate accumulation; nitrate concentration; pak-choi (Brassica chinensis L.)	YIELD; ACID; FORM	Many vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, accumulate NO(3)(-)-N in their edible portions. High nitrate levels in vegetables constitute a health hazard, such as cancers and blue baby syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine if (1) ammonium nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) and glutamine-nitrogen (Gln-N) absorbed by plant roots is converted into nitrate-nitrogen of pak-choi (Brassica chinensis L.) tissues, and (2) if nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N) accumulation and concentration of pak-choi tissues linearly increase with increasing NO(3)(-)-N supply when grown in nutrient solution. In experiment 1, 4 different nitrogen treatments (no nitrogen, NH(4)(+)-N, Gln-N, and NO(3)(-)-N) with equal total N concentrations in treatments with added N were applied under sterile nutrient medium culture conditions. In experiment 2, 5 concentrations of N (from 0 to 48 mM), supplied as NO(3)(-)-N in the nutrient solution, were tested. The results showed that Gln-N and NH(4)(+)-N added to the nutrient media were not converted into nitrate-nitrogen of plant tissues. Also, NO(3)(-)-N accumulation in the pak-choi tissues was the highest when plants were supplied 24 mM NO(3)(-)-N in the media. The NO(3)(-)-N concentration in plant tissues was quadratically correlated to the NO(3)(-)-N concentration supplied in the nutrient solution.

One significant feature of the theory immunology is the ability to adapt to changing environments and dynamically learning continuously. Inspired by the theory of artificial immune systems, a novel model of Agents of Network Danger Evaluation is presented. The concepts and formal definitions of immune cells are given, and dynamically evaluative equations for self, antigen, immune tolerance, mature-lymphocyte lifecycle and immune memory are presented, and the hierarchical and distributed management framework of the proposed model are built. Furthermore, the idea of dynamic immunological surveillance period is applied for enhancing the self-learning ability to adapt continuously variety environments. The experimental results show that the proposed model has the features of real-time processing that provide a good solution for network surveillance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle, the 2 x 2 electric cross-spectral density matrix of partially coherent EHG beams in turbulence is expressed analytically by using a quadratic approximation of Rytov's phase structure function. The analytical expressions for the degree of polarization, the degree of coherence and the spectrum of partially coherent EHG beams in turbulence are derived, and the corresponding analytical results of electromagnetic Gaussian Schell-model (EGSM) beams can be obtained when the order number of the Hermite polynomial is zero. Some interesting results are obtained, which are illustrated by using numerical examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Large cross-phase-modulation between two slow pulses by coupled double dark resonances	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article						atom-photon collisions; Doppler broadening; multiphoton processes; nonlinear optical susceptibility; optical double resonance; optical pumping; optical switches; Q-switching; quantum optics; Raman lasers; self-induced transparency; self-phase modulation; slow light	ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; QUANTUM INTERFERENCE; ATOMS; COHERENCE; PHOTONS	We present a scheme to realize a large cross-phase-modulation between two slow optical pulses by using the atomic configurations of coupled double dark resonances. In this scheme slow group velocities for these optical pulses can be automatically equalized in terms of the inherent symmetric atomic configuration, and the various absorptions can be overcome by using three-photon hyper-Raman amplification. Additionally, the switching between cross-type nonlinear amplification and absorption could be realized by just changing the sign of the difference between two pump detunings. This is useful for the implementations of all-optical switches. The linearity and cross nonlinearity in the Doppler-broadened medium with different laser propagating configurations have also been investigated.	[Hou, B.

The simulations are based upon the Perdew-Burke-Enzerh generalized gradient approximation on the density functional theory. It is revealed that the electrons with energies close to the Fermi level effectively transfer only between Cu and Co ions which substitute Zn atoms, and are located in the neighbor sites connected by an O ion. The simulation results are consistent with the experimental observations that addition of Cu helps achieve stable ferromagnetism of Co-doped ZnO. It is shown that simultaneous insertion of Co and Cu atoms leads to smaller energy band gap, redshift of the optical absorption edge, as well as significant changes in the reflectivity, dielectric function, refractive index, and electron energy loss function of ZnO as compared to the doping with either Co or Cu atoms. These highly unusual optical properties are explained in terms of the computed electronic structure and are promising for the development of the next-generation room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors for future spintronic devices on the existing semiconductor micromanufacturing platform.

The calculated results show that the density of states near Fermi level is derived from Fe 3d and Ni 3d states. A new peak appears at 0.46 eV in the imaginary part of dielectric function of doped ZnO.

Results showed that thiazole chromophore molecules with active hydroxy-ethyl, alkoxy-ethyl, fluoro-ethyl, and amino-ethyl groups have high beta values of about 1.6x10(-28) esu which are in good agreement with the available experimental results. Maximum absorption wavelengths lambda(max) of the compounds in the gas phase ranged from 480 to 488 nm. The lambda(max) was red-shifted as the solvent polarity increased for the thiazole chromophore molecules with an active hydroxy-ethyl group.

The analytical expressions for the intensity, the beam width and the PIB are derived, and illustrative examples are given numerically. It is shown that the maximum intensity I(max) and the PIB decrease and w(z) increases as the refraction index structure constant C(n)(2) increases. Therefore, the turbulence results in a degradation of the beam quality. However, the resulting partially coherent beam with a smaller value of spatial correlation parameter gamma and larger values of separate distance x(d) and beam number M is less affected by the turbulence than that with a larger value of gamma and smaller values of x(d) and M. The main results obtained in this paper are explained physically.

Auxiliary Principle and Iterative Algorithms for Lions-Stampacchia Variational Inequalities	JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Lions-Stampacchia variational inequalities; Iterative schemes; Auxiliary principle technique; Stopping criterion; Strongly convex functions		In this paper, we extend the auxiliary principle (Cohen in J. Optim. Theory Appl. 49:325-333, 1988) to study a class of Lions-Stampacchia variational inequalities in Hilbert spaces. Our method consists in approximating, in the subproblems, the nonsmooth convex function by a sequence of piecewise linear and convex functions, as in the bundle method for nonsmooth optimization. This makes the subproblems more tractable. We show the existence of a solution for this Lions-Stampacchia variational inequality and explain how to build a new iterative scheme and a new stopping criterion. This iterative scheme and criterion are different from those commonly used in the special case of nonsmooth optimization. We study also the convergence of iterative sequences generated by the algorithm.	[Huang, N. J.] Sichuan Univ, Dept Math, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Xia, F.

The consistency of the directionality of Gaussian array beams expressed in terms of the angular spread and the normalized far-field average intensity distribution is also examined. Closed-form expressions for the mean-squared beam width and angular spread of Gaussian array beams propagating in atmospheric turbulence are derived. It is found that for the case of coherent combination, under a certain condition array beams exist that may have the same directionality (i.e., the same angular spread) as a fully coherent Gaussian laser beam in free space and also in turbulence. However, the directionality of Gaussian array beams in terms of the angular spread is not consistent with that in terms of the normalized far-field average intensity distribution in free space, whereas they may be consistent as a result of turbulence. 2009 Optical Society of America	[Ji, Xiaoling; Li, Xiaoqing] Sichuan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China	Ji, XL (reprint author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China.	jiXL100@163.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [60778048]	The authors are very thankful to the reviewers for valuable comments.

The geometries of the reactants, transition states, intermediates and products were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Vibrational analysis was carried out to confirm the transition state structure, and the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method was used to search the reaction path. In addition, atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to discuss bond natures. Feasible reaction pathways were investigated, indicating that the reaction Re -> TS1 -> IM1 -> TS2 -> IM2 -> TS3 -> IM3 -> TS4 -> IM7 -> TS11 -> IM9 -> TS12 -> IM10 -> TS13 -> IM11 -> TS14 -> P1 is the main pathway, the activation energy of which is the lowest. The dominant product predicted theoretically is in agreement with the results from the experiment. The reaction in ethanol solution has been investigated at the same level with polarizable continuum models (PCM) method, and the results show that the energy of each compound is lower than that in the gas phase. The solvent effects enhance the energy barrier to some extent.

By using the resolvent operator technique of H-eta-monotone operators, a new iterative algorithm for finding approximate solutions to SSMQVLI is proposed. It is shown that the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm converge strongly to the exact solution of SSMQVLI under appropriate assumptions. These obtained new results have extended and improved previous results.

It has been identified that a variety of guest molecules (such as C(60), phthalocyanine and substituted phthalocyanine) can be dispersed in this template to form supramolecular architectures, which were also studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). It is interesting to observe that this template has elastic boundaries and rigid structures, which can accommodate different amounts of guest species by interacting with them, while keeping the size of cavities invariable.

The geometries of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products have been optimized and verified by means of vibration frequency calculations. According to our assumption, this reaction can be divided into two stages. The rate-determining step is found to be the 3 -> 4-TS procedure, which is the first procedure of stage 1. The low energy barrier of 39.85 kcal/mol indicates that this reaction can be carried out, which is in accordance with the experimental facts. For comparison, we have investigated the reaction mechanism of the same chemical reaction without CuI catalyst, whose energy barrier of rate-determining step is 212.76 kcal/mol higher than that with CuI catalyst. This fact suggests that CuI catalyst accelerates the reaction by remarkably lowering the energy barrier. The solvation effects on the barriers of the reaction are important. But the energetic order in DMSO solvent seems to be almost the same as that in gas-phase, which indicates that our conclusion achieved in gas-phase is believable. Our findings reveal the microscopic catalytic mechanism of CuI and are in agreement with the experimental facts.

In this report, a series of peripheral functionalized triphenylene derivatives, C(18)H(6)(OC(6)H(13))(4)(OCH(2)CONHR)(2), which contains amide groups at the 2,7-positions, have been synthesized. The polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that these compounds exhibit hexagonal columnar mesophases. The triphenylene derivatives gelate in the solution of octane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane and p-xylene and form stable organic gels. The xerogels formed from organic solvents were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and showed fiber-like or sponge-like morphology. It is demonstrated that intermolecular hydrogen bonds stabilize the columnar molecular organization and assembly in mesomorphic state and organic gel.	[Bai, Y. F.; Zhao, K. Q.; Hu, P.; Wang, B.

In this report, triphenylenes containing terminal alkynes and azides were prepared, and the cycloaddition reaction (click chemistry) between them catalyzed by CuI-Et(3)N in toluene produced discotic liquid crystal dimers in high yield and good selectivity. The dimers and intermediates have been fully characterized by (1)H NMR and high resolution MS. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results show the dimers possess columnar mesophase in wide temperature range from very low temperature. The triazole moiety in the dimer can act as electron and hydrogen bond acceptor, and ionic forming part, rich chemical and physical properties can be expected from these new structure discotic dimers.

The variations of cell volume, lattice constants and molecular geometry of solid -HMX are presented and discussed at different pressure and temperature. It was found that the N-N bond is significantly lengthened with increasing temperature, which suggests that it is relevant to the initial decomposition. An abrupt change at 27 Gpa for the volume and internal geometrical parameters was observed. This is in good accord with the experimental observation that there is a phase transition at 27 GPa, which is clearly due to conformational change, not chemical reaction. The vibrational frequencies at ambient conditions agree well with experimental results, and the pressure/temperature-induced frequency shifts of these modes are discussed. Frequency discontinuity was also observed at pressure when the phase transition occurred. The Gruneisen parameter was obtained using the vibrational frequency.

J	Li, XQ; Chen, XW; Ji, XL				Li, Xiaoqing; Chen, Xiaowen; Ji, Xiaoling			Influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of superimposed partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams	OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Superimposed partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams; Atmospheric turbulence; Propagation; Beam power focusability; Maximum intensity	QUALITY; POWER	The influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of superimposed partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian (H-G) beams is studied in detail. The closed-form propagation equation of superimposed partially coherent H-G beams through atmospheric turbulence is derived. It is shown that the turbulence accelerates the evolution of three stages which superimposed partially coherent H-G beams undergo. The turbulence results in a beam spreading and a decrease of the maximum intensity. However, the larger the beam number M, the beam order m, the separate distance x(d), and the smaller the beam correlation length sigma(0) are, the less the power focusability, of superimposed partially coherent H-G beams is affected by the turbulence. Specialty, superimposed partially coherent H-G beams are less sensitive to turbulence than superimposed fully ones, and than partially coherent H-G beams if the beam power focusability and the maximum intensity are taken as beam criterions. However, the maximum intensity of superimposed partially coherent H-G beams is less sensitive or more sensitive to turbulence than that of superimposed Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beams depending on sigma(0).

J	Dong, YM; Lu, T				Dong, Yun-Ming; Lu, Tan			The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for three redshift distributions of long gamma-ray bursts in the Swift Era	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gamma rays: bursts; redshifts; distributions: statistical; KS test	VARIABILITY/PEAK LUMINOSITY CORRELATION; 28 FEBRUARY 1997; PEAK LUMINOSITY; BATSE; EMISSION; SAMPLE; ENERGY; LAGS	We investigate redshift distributions of three long burst samples, with the first sample containing 131 long bursts with observed redshifts, the second including 220 long bursts with pseudo-redshifts calculated by the variability-luminosity relation, and the third including 1194 long bursts with pseudo-redshifts calculated by the lag-luminosity relation, respectively. In the redshift range 0-1 the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability of the observed redshift distribution and that of the variability-luminosity relation is large. In the redshift ranges 1-2, 2-3, 3-6.3 and 0-37, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probabilities of the redshift distribution from lag-luminosity relation and the observed redshift distribution are also large. For the GRBs, which appear both in the two pseudo-redshift burst samples, the KS probability of the pseudo-redshift distribution from the lag-luminosity relation and the observed reshift distribution is 0.447, which is very large. Based on these results, some conclusions are drawn: i) the V-L(iso) relation might be more believable than the tau-L(iso) relation in low redshift ranges and the tau-L(iso) relation might be more real than the V-L(iso) relation in high redshift ranges; ii) if we do not consider the redshift ranges, the tau-L(iso) relation might be more physical and intrinsical than the V-L(iso) relation.

The geometries of these compounds were fully optimized by density function theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31+G level. The three compounds under study were confirmed as true minima on the potential energy surface in the presence of only real frequencies by the vibrational analysis. The fluorescence spectra were calculated by configuration interaction (CI) method with PCM model, and the results match with the experimental values. The results of calculation suggest that the three compounds with planar structures are hyperconjugation systems. By the addition of the donor-electron groups, the wavelengths of the fluorescence spectra increased, and the frequencies underwent red-shift. In addition, the substitute alkyl has no more influence on the fluorescence spectra, but the addition of amido groups has more influence on the fluorescence spectra.

To keep the free growth of CaMoO4 crystals in solutions, an oxidizing agent (H2O2) with lower concentration plays an important role in the formation of desired film, XRD and Raman results indicate that the film has single phase and SEM result shows uniform surfaces. The film shows a broad emission centered at 500 nm with the excitation light of 230 nm at room temperature.

ELIMINATION OF IR/UV VIA GRAVITY IN NONCOMMUTATIVE FIELD THEORY	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Noncommutative geometry; IR/UV; cosmology		Models of particle physics with Noncommutative Geometry (NCG) generally suffer from a manifestly non-Wilsonian coupling of infrared and ultraviolet degrees of freedom known as the "IR/UV Problem" which would tend to compromise their phenomenological relevance. In this letter we explicitly show how one may remedy this by coupling NCG to gravity. In the simplest scenario, the Lagrangian gets multiplied by a nonconstant background metric in phi - 4 theory the theorem that integral d(4)x phi*phi = integral d(4)x phi(2) is no longer true and the field propagator gets modified by a factor which depends on both NCG and the variation of the metric. A suitable limit to this factor as the propagating momentum gets asymptotically large then eradicates the IR/UV problem. Wit gravity and NCG couple to each other, one might expectant antisymmetric components to arise in the metric. Cosmological implications of such are subsequently discussed.

The natural bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis are carried out to study the bonding nature and relative stabilities of these conformers. G3MP2 method is applied to calculate energies and heats of formation. The results indicate that the hyperconjugation effect from lone pairs of nitrogen atoms to germinal C-N bonds is the major factor which caused the change of the C-N bond length. With the more replacement of nitrogen atoms by CH groups, the heats of formation of the isomers of N-n(CH)(8-n)H-8 (n = 0-7) decrease gradually, but the energies increase linearly.

The analytical propagation equation of the resulting beam in turbulence for the incoherent combination is derived. The mean-squared beam width, the power in the bucket and the beta parameter are taken as the characteristic parameters of beam quality to compare the results of coherent and incoherent combinations of off-axis Gaussian beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence, and the reasonable physical explanations are, also given. It is shown that, on one hand, both for the incoherent and coherent combinations the. turbulence results in a beam spreading and a degradation of the maximum intensity, and the larger the individual beam numbers is, the less sensitive is the resulting beam to the effect of turbulence. On the. other hand, the resulting beam for the incoherent combination is less affected by turbulence than that for the coherent combination.

Angular spread of Gaussian Schell-model array beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article						42; 25; Dd; 42; 25; Kb; 42; 25; Fx	PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; SPATIAL-COHERENCE; LIGHT-BEAMS; LASER; DIRECTIONALITY; GENERATION; INTENSITY; MEDIA	The closed-form expression for the angular spread of Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived. It is shown that the angular spread theta (sp) of GSM array beams for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function is smaller than of those for the superposition of the intensity. However, the theta (sp) of GSM array beams for the superposition of the intensity is less sensitive to turbulence than that for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function. For the superposition of the cross-spectral density function, theta (sp) of GSM array beams with smaller coherence length sigma (0), smaller waist width w (0), smaller beam number N, and larger separation distance x (d) are less affected by turbulence than of those with larger sigma (0),w (0),N, and smaller x (d) ; while, for the superposition of the intensity, the effect of turbulence on theta (sp) is independent of N and x (d) . In addition, the angular spread is nearly the same for the two types of superposition when sigma (0) or w (0) is small enough, or x (d) is large enough. On the other hand, it is found that there exist equivalent GSM array beams for the two types of superposition which may have the same directionality as the corresponding fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in turbulence.

The temporal and spatial fluctuations of the groundwater level were analyzed based on the groundwater level measurements, hydrologic data, the groundwater/surface water interconversion theory and the groundwater dynamics. The spatial distribution of groundwater is mostly affected by sand dune height and landform variation. The four primary temporal influence factors of groundwater level can be ordered in decreasing significance as: shelterbelt pumping > vertical leakage > river flow change > runoff replenishment. The runoff replenishment has the biggest influence range, and the shelterbelt pumping has the smallest influence range. The groundwater level fluctuates annually in a natural pattern.

The only difference in chemical structure of these samples is the bridging group in backbone. Molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics were adopted to generate the reasonable molecular models to evaluate the chain regularity and mobility, thus to explain the interesting experimental results and to establish the relationship of the chemical structure and order aggregation ability. For the chain regularity, it is PI-P > PI-M > PI-O from the chain geometry and simulation aggregation. For the chain mobility, it is PI-M > PI-O > PI-P from the rotation barrier energy plots. The simulation result is in accordance with experimental data. It indicates that the effect of the chain regularity and chain mobility on the order aggregation ability can be modulated to some extent by the solvent dosage regulation in experiment. More important, PI-M with special helical geometry and the most mobility of chain showing to display the distinct banded spherulite morphology in solvent limitation is still in researching.

The calculated pressure dependence of the normalized volume is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The elastic constants and anisotropy as a function of applied pressure, the ratio of the normalized volume VIVO with the applied pressure are presented. The variations of bulk modulus, anisotropy and the brittleness with the pressure are investigated. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also study the thermodynamic properties of NiAl. The thermal expansion versus temperature and pressure, the thermodynamic parameters (Debye temperature and specific heat) with pressure P, and the heat capacity of NiAl at various pressures and temperatures are estimated.

The growing characteristics of the films were Studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDRX) techniques, respectively. The SEM images show that the morphology of the Ba1-xCaxMoO4 film is affected significantly by the composition of the films when the process parameters are preset. The XRD and EDRX analyses reveal that the compositions of the films are strongly controlled by the capability of bond between cation and anion, besides the cation concentration, temperature, and current density, in such situation.

It is shown that the new time/frequency hopping sequences have at most one hit in their autocorrelation functions and at most two hits in their crosscorrelation functions except for a special case, and their family size is much larger than the conventional quadratic hopping sequences. The percentage of full collisions for the new quadratic hopping sequences is discussed.

The optical absorption spectra of V2+ ions in ZnSe are studied. Moreover, the various additional levels found close to 5680 cm(-1) are considered. These levels are assumed to result from the dynamic Jahn-Teller splitting within the excitation levels T-2(2) and T-2(1) in ZnSe:V2+. The good agreement between the present results and the experimental observations indicates that the contribution of the covalence reduction factors N-E and N-T2 and of the Racah parameter A to the optical absorption spectra of V2+ ions in ZnSe is important. However, most of the previous theoretical studies of these spectra in ZnSe:V2+ have neglected the Racah parameter A, based on the classical crystal-field model. A significant charge-transfer effect found in recent works is confirmed in ZnSe:V2+.

The adsorption energy, equilibrium geometry and vibrational frequency of CH(3)OH at four sites (top, fee, hcp and bridge) on the Pt-Fe(111)/C surface were predicted and the favorite adsorption site for methanol should be the bridge site. The Fermi level of the cluster model moved to right in catalyst Pt-Fe/C compared with catalyst Pt/C. Both the sites of the valence band and conduction band of the doped system have been broadened, which is favorable for electrons to transfer to cavity. Compared with the adsorption energy of CH(3)OH on Pt(111)/C surface, the adsorption energy of CO is high, and the Pt(111)/C is favorable to be oxidized to lose the activity.

Based on the partial-coherence theory, the analytical expressions for the mean-squared width and the angular spread of general beams are derived by using the integral transform technique. It is shown that the mean-squared width and the angular spread depend not only on the weighting factors of all basis modes but also on the weighting factors of the corresponding mode coherence coefficients of the ith and the (i+2)th if the Hermite-Gaussian modes are adopted. It is found that under a certain condition there exist the equivalent general beams which may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in atmospheric turbulence. The result holds true, irrespective of the model of turbulence used.

The adsorption energy, equilibrium geometry and vibrational frequency of CH3OH oil four sites (top, fee, hep and bridge) and nine types of models on Pt-Mo(111)/C surface were predicted and the favorite adsorption site for methanol is top-Pt site. After Mo is doped, the valence hand and the conduction band position are depressed, and the change of the electronic structure enables the doped PtMo(111)/C to have a higher catalytic activity. Compared with the adsorption energy of CH3OH on Pt(111)/C surface. the adsorption energy of CO is higher. and Pt(111)/C is favorable to be oxidized and lose the activity. It indicates that the adsorption of CO oil Pt(111)/C Surface counteracts the adsorption of CH3OH, which is disadvantageous for the process of catalysis. The catalyst Pt-Mo(111)/C which is in favor of decomposing methanol is of better antipoisoning ability than that of Pt(111)/C.

Structure, electrical properties and temperature characteristics of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							MORPHOTROPIC PHASE-BOUNDARY; FERROELECTRIC PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; TITANATE	(1-x-y)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xBi(0.5)K(0.5)TiO(3)- yBi(0.5)Li(0.5)TiO(3) lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique, and their structure, electrical properties, and temperature characteristics have been studied systematically. The ceramics can be well-sintered at 1050-1150 degrees C. The increase in K+ concentration decreases the grain-growth rate and promotes the formation of grains with a cubic shape, while the addition of Li+ decreases greatly the sintering temperature and assists in the densification of BNT-based ceramics. The results of XRD diffraction show that K+ and Li+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. As x increases from 0.05 to 0.50, the ceramics transform gradually from rhombohedral phase to tetragonal phase and consequently a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is formed at 0.15 <= x <= 0.25. The concentration y of Li+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure of the ceramics. Compared with pure Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, the partial substitution of K+ and Li+ for Na+ lowers greatly the coercive field E-c and increases the remanent polarization P-r of the ceramics. Because of the MPB, lower E-c and large P-r, the piezoelectricity of the ceramics is improved significantly. For the ceramics with the compositions near the MPB (x=0.15-0.25 and y=0.05-0.10), the piezoelectric properties become optimum: piezoelectric coefficient d(33)=147-231 pC/N and planar electromechanical coupling factor k(P)=20.2-41.0%. In addition, the ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which probably results from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The depolarization temperature T-d shows a strong dependence on the concentration x of K+ and reaches the lowest values at the MPB. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties at high temperatures may imply that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions at temperatures above T-d.

The plasma protein was precipitated by acetonitrile, followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation. The supernatant was divided into the organic layer and aqueous layer by adding sodium chloride, and then the aqueous layer was derivatized with AQC in 0.2 m borate buffer of pH 8.8 before the HPLC analysis. An amino acid analysis column (3.9 x 150 mm, 4 gm) was applied, with 140 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH = 5.25) and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A linear correlation coefficient of 0.9987 was calculated within the range of 0.1-30 mu g/mL of the standard curve for glucosamine. The limit of detection was 30 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions (as RSD) were less than 7.38 and 12.72%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged from 91.8 to 110.0%. Extraction recoveries of glucosamine in plasma were more than 90%. The validated method was successfully applied for the quantitative determination of glucosamine in rat plasma and evaluation for pharmacokinetic study of glucosamine. It was also possible to be applied for the quantitative determination of other compounds containing amino group in biological samples. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Angular dependence of magnetic reversal in two-phased nanolayers	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Frontiers in Computational Materials Science	JUL 01-06, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE	NovaGlobal Pte Ltd		Micromagnetics; Permanent magnets; Exchange-coupling; Coercivity mechanism; Angular dependence	REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; NANOCOMPOSITE MAGNETS; PERMANENT-MAGNETS; COERCIVE FORCE; SPRING MAGNET; EXCHANGE; ANISOTROPY; FILMS; HARD; MULTILAYERS	The reversal process of hard/soft/hard multilayer systems as functions of easy axis beta and thickness L(s) of the soft layer has been investigated within a micromagnetic approach. The nucleation field could be obtained for beta = 0 and beta = pi/2 which decreases as L(s) increases. The coercivity, on the other hand, decrease smoothly with the soft layer thickness disregarding to the value of beta. The coercivity becomes the largest when beta = pi/2, while the corresponding nucleation field becomes negative for larger Ls. Thus the change of the magnetization proceeds slower for beta - pi/2, giving rise to an oblique hysteresis loop. In addition, the critical thickness for the soft layer is rather small, where the dominant coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning, suggesting that pinning is the main coercivity mechanism in the material. When beta is an angle between 0 and pi/2, a fully saturated state can never be reached. Thus the pure nucleation becomes meaningless and pinning is the dominant coercivity mechanism.

Nucleation or pinning: Dominant coercivity mechanism in exchange-coupled permanent/composite magnets	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Frontiers in Computational Materials Science	JUL 01-06, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE	NovaGlobal Pte Ltd		Micromagnetics; Permanent magnets; Exchange-coupling; Coercivity mechanism; Nucleation; Pinning	PERMANENT-MAGNETS; REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; MICROMAGNETIC ANALYSIS; NANOCOMPOSITE MAGNETS; SPRING MAGNET; ANISOTROPY; FILMS; HARD; MULTILAYERS; REVERSAL	The thickness dependent nucleation and pinning fields have been obtained for an exchange-coupled hard/soft/hard magnetic layered system based on a micromagnetic calculation. The calculation reveals that the coercivity mechanism is nucleation for small soft layer thickness while it is pinning for large one. The critical thickness at which the coercivity mechanism changes is generally very small. Thus the dominant coercivity mechanism in such a magnetic system is pinning rather than nucleation. Such a pinning, however, is attributed to the change of the intrinsic parameters associated with the phase change at the interface and has both attributes of the traditional nucleation and pinning. Analysis shows that this pinning mechanism is the dominant coercivity mechanism in most exchange-coupled permanent and composite magnetic materials, which is called as self-pinning in this paper. From this self-pinning some specific formulae pinning field can be derived. In particular, for sufficiently large soft grains/defects, the pinning field can be expressed as H(p)-alpha H(k), where H(k) = 2k/M(s) is the anisotropy field and a depends on the material parameters and micromagnetic structures. These results are consistent with available experimental data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, G. P.; Huang, C.

Electrical properties of (K0.5Na0.5)(1-x) AgxNbO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							POTASSIUM-SODIUM NIOBATE	(K0.5Na0.5)(1-x)AgxNbO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have been fabricated by an ordinary ceramic technique. The results of XRD reveal that Ag+ diffuses into the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with an orthorhombic perovskite structure and the solubility of Ag+ into A-sites of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 is about 0.20. The ceramics can be well-sintered at 1,100-1,110 degrees C. The partial substitution of Ag+ for A-site ion (K0.5Na0.5)(+) decreases slightly both paraelectric cubic-ferroelectric tetragonal (T-C) and ferroelectric tetragonal-ferroelectric orthorhombic phase transition temperatures (TO-T). The ferroelectricity of the ceramics becomes weak at high Ag+ concentration. The ceramic with x = 0.10 possesses optimum electrical properties: d(33) = 135 pC/N, k(P) = 0.43, k(t) = 0.46, epsilon(r) = 470, tan delta = 3.39%, and T-C = 394 degrees C.	[Lin, Dunmin; Kwok, K.

By using a concise decomposition method, the transient and steady-state distributions of the queue length are studied, and the stochastic decomposition property of steady-state queue length has been proved. Several common vacation policies are special cases of the vacation policy presented in this study. The relationship between the generating functions of steady-state queue length at departure epoch and arbitrary epoch is obtained. Finally, we give some numerical examples to illustrate the effect of the parameters on several performance characteristics. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated results show that there is a significant difference in electronic structures between the cases of C substituting O and C substituting Zn in ZnO Which is caused by both the electronic structure of C atom and its interaction with the neighboring atoms. We also find that the optical properties are charged in the low-energy region after doping, while in the high-energy region the optical properties are almost not influenced by doping with C.

Firstly, by constructing a type of cross-constrained variational problem and establishing so-called cross-invariant manifolds of the evolution flow, we derive a sharp threshold for global existence and blowup of the solution to the Cauchy problem for (DS) provided 1 + 4/N <= p < N+2/(N-2)(+). Secondly, by using the scaling argument, we show how small the initial data are for the global solutions to exist. Finally, we prove the strong instability of the standing waves with finite time blow up for any omega > 0 by combining the former results.

Incomplete and complete "S-shaped" thermal dependence of E-g are observed in Mg0.77Zn0.23O and Mg0.55Zn0.45O, respectively. This behavior is caused by carrier localization induced by potential fluctuation or possible other disorder mechanisms, such as phase separation and phase transition. Also, the broadening factor and refractive index exhibit similar anomalous temperature dependence, supporting the occurrence of carrier localization. Furthermore, the magnitude of carrier localization was estimated by simulating the anomalous behaviors of E-g with different models. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhou, H.

COX from strain COX8-9 was purified from the culture supernatant by ultrafiltration followed with two consecutive Q-Sepharose chromatographies at different pH values, and then by Superdex-75 gel filtration. The purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular weight of 58 kDa, and exhibited maximum absorption at 280 nm. The K (m) value for oxidation of cholesterol by this enzyme was 1.2 x 10(-4) M, with optimum activity at pH 7.0. Enzymatic activity of COX was enhanced 3-fold in the presence of metal ion Cu(2+), and the enzyme was stable during long-term aqueous storage under various temperatures, indicating its potential as a clinical diagnostic reagent. Preparation and characterization of cholesterol oxidases from the other selected strains are under way.

It is noteworthy that the driving force of galvanic cell method is adjustable by adding different concentrations of oxidant. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results reveal that the crystallized films have a scheelite-type tetragonal structure and homogeneous surface. The film showed single blue emissions at 447 nm with excitation lights of 220, 230, 250, 260 and 270 nm at room temperature, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, we establish stochastic versions of the well-known Picard local existence-uniqueness theorem given by Driver and continuation theorems given by Hale and Driver for functional differential equations (FDEs). Then, we extend the global existence-uniqueness theorems of Wintner for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), Driver for FDEs and Taniguchi for stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) to SFDEs.

In comparison with previous work, the results obtained in this paper are more general. It is shown that, except for equivalent Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beams as pointed out in Ref. [T. Shirai, A. Dogariu, E. Wolf, Opt. Lett. 28 (2003) 610], there also exist equivalent annular and non-annular beams which may generate the same directionality as the corresponding fully coherent Gaussian beam both in free space and in turbulence.

On the basis of the most stable geometries, the relationships of the total energy with rotation degrees between the dimers were studied, and the lowest energy point was obtained. Based on the semi-classical model of the charge transport, our results predict that hexaazatriphenylene molecules have the largest positive charge transport rate and the smallest negative charge transport rate. Introduction of SH, OH, OR and F groups make the positive charge transport to increase, and the negative charge transport to decrease. The length of alkoxy group has little effect on charge transport properties.

This structure could be used to implement single-electron transport driven by surface acoustic waves. Based on structures of conduction band and distribution of electrons in the fabricated quantum wires, the influence of quantum-wire widths on the confining potential of the electrons is also discussed. Espeeially,we numerically study how the linear electron concentration depends on the applied split-gate voltage. For the quantum wires fabricated, we find that the calculated pinch-off voltages agree well with the relevant experimental values measured at 0.3 K.

Since 1965, there has been no more essential breakthrough for the design of fast DFT algorithm. DFT has two properties. One property is that DFT is energy conservation transform. The other property is that many DFT coefficients are close to zero. The basic idea of this paper is that the generalized Grover's iteration can perform the computation of DFT which acts on the entangled states to search the big DFT coefficients until these big cofficients contain nearly all energy. One-dimensional quantum DFT (1D QDFT) and two-dimensional quantum DFT (2D QDFT) are presented in this paper. The quantum algorithm for convolution estimation is also presented in this paper. Compared with FFT, 1D and 2D QDFT have time complexity O(root N) and O(N) respectively. QDFT and quantum convolution demonstrate that quantum computation to process classical signal is possible.

The single amino acid substitution of serine (Ser) for asparagine (Asn)-130 of the A1501 EPSPS enhanced resistance to 200 mM glyphosate. The mutated EPSPS had a 2.5-fold increase for IC(50) [glyphosate] value, a 2-fold increase for K(i) [glyphosate] value, but a K(m) [PEP] value similar to that of wild type. The effect of the single residue mutation on glyphosate resistance was also analyzed using a computer-based three-dimensional model.

It is shown that the Kondo resonance and Fano interference coexist, and in this system the Fano -Kondo effect shows dip behaviours richer than that in the T-shaped QDs. The interdot coupling, the energy level of the side coupled QDs and the spin polarization strength greatly influence the DOS of the central quantum dot QD(0). Either the increase of the coupling strength between the two QDs or that of the energy levels of the side coupled QDs enhances the Kondo resonance. Especially, the Kondo resonance is strengthened greatly when the side dot energy is fixed at the Fermi energy. Meanwhile, the Kondo resonance splits for the spin-up and spin-down configurations due to the polarization: the down-spin resonance is enhanced, and the up-spin resonance is suppressed.

J	Ji, M				Ji Min			Call-and-response in Beloved and black aesthetic	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						call-and-response; improvisation; Beloved; Toni Morrison		Call-and-response is widely used by black people in work songs, blues, spirituals, sermons and oral tales, showing the important value of black esthetic. As a narrative technique, call-and-response focuses on the potential relationship that is based on multi-channelled interaction and participation among the writer, reader and text. Unlike Western hegemony's Suppression of the multi-sided voice in the text, Beloved emphasizes pluralistic perspective. The narrative in its way up sends a call to readers that careful and full-scaled thinking is needed before he makes his value Judgment. The narrative voice symbolizes collective power, reflecting the social function of black art. In Beloved, the typical example of call-and-response in which one make a leading call and others response in chorus catches up with what might disappear quickly. Therefore it represents the essence of black art. Moreover, call-and-response is often used in sermon as shown at "The Clearing" which responses to the meaning of the novel. Besides sermon, work songs that serve as the agent of black art show improvisation. Baby Suggs' call, others' response and Paul D's work songs all share improvisational commonness. The concept of voice tells the difference between European tradition and black tradition. In Beloved, Morrison puts the power of black people into an artistic system in order to call the wholeness of the self and existence.

Our results are consistent with the experimental and previous theoretical data. Comparing it with other hard materials, we conclude that ReB2 is a sort of low-compressible material. The parameters of anisotropy are all larger than 1, which indicates that the hexagonal ReB2 is anisotropic. the elastic constant c(33) is larger than c(11) at all pressure points, which shows that the compressibility of ReB2 in the z direction is larger than that in the x and y directions.

The results reveal that the total energy linearly decreases along with the replacement of CH groups by nitrogen atoms for the three systems. To estimate the potential of high nitrogen content high energy materials (HNC-HEMs), heats of formation are calculated by G3 method. With the increase of the number of nitrogen atoms in ring, heats of formation increase substantially. The four-membered ring system is found to have the greatest heat of formations, followed by the six-membered ring system, and then by the five-membered ring system. Especially, hexazine and tetraazacyclobutadiene have great heats of formation relative to the other compounds, which implies that they should be applicable as HNC-HEMS. In addition, our studies indicate that the relationship between the total energy or heats of formation of isomers and the position of nitrogen atoms is.(ortho) meta < (ortho) para < ortho. NBO analysis shows that it is hyperconjugation, not steric repulsion that plays a key role in the relative stability of isomers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that a large conjugated system was formed by Pt atom, benzene, pyridine and,beta-diketonate ancillary ligands, which makes the electronic transition from the ground state to the first excited state (pi ->pi* and n-pi*) with MLCT transition. The maximal absorption wavelength was obtained at around 406 nm, belonging to near UV. The structure and electronic spectra were little influenced by the length of beta-diketonate ancillary alkyl, which is in good agreement with experimental results. The cyclometalated platinum complexes with long chain beta-diketonate ancillary ligand molecules display good nonlinear optical properties.

Spatial correlation properties of apertured partially coherent beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							ELLIPTIC GAUSSIAN-BEAM; SCHELL-MODEL BEAMS; CIRCULAR APERTURE; SCINTILLATION INDEX; AVERAGE INTENSITY; OPTICAL-SYSTEM; GENERAL BEAMS; POLARIZATION; SPECTRUM; MEDIA	The spatial correlation properties of apertured partially coherent beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are studied in detail. By using the quadratic approximation of the Rytov's phase structure function and the finite complex Gaussian expansion of the aperture function, the closed-form expression for the spectral degree of coherence of apertured partially coherent beams in turbulence is derived. It is shown that the larger the aperture width h is, and the smaller the spatial correlation length sigma(0) of the source is, the less the spatial correlation is affected by turbulence. Specially, the influence of turbulence on the spatial correlation for unapertured partially coherent beams is less than that for apertured ones. The spectral degree of coherence is shown to possess phase singularities for apertured partially coherent beams, but the phase singularities behavior disappears when the turbulence is strong enough, which is very different from the behavior of unapertured partially coherent beams. In addition, a comparison between the width of the spectral degree of coherence and that of the spectral intensity of apertured partially coherent beams in turbulence is also given, and some interesting results are obtained. The results are interpreted physically.

In terms of travelling wave solutions, the partial differential equations are transformed to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Exact solutions are then derived for various cases to describe the different physical structures such as compactons, solitons, solitary patterns and periodic solutions. The exponent of the wave function u and the ratio of the two coefficients a and b in the Boussinesq equation are shown to qualitatively determine the physical structures of the solutions.

All individuals have a diploid number of 56 chromosomes, which is consistent with karyotypes of the pond-type Hynobius group that lives in the lowlands and spawns in small ponds. Several differences distinguish H. maoershanensis from other Hynobius karyotypes: chromosome no. 13 is subtelocentric while in others it is metacentric; there is a prominent and unique dark C-banding pattern encompassing the whole short arm of chromosome no. 13, which can be used as a marker to distinguish this species from other species of Hynobius; multiple C-bands are found only in chromosomes 4, 9 and 13 in this species, much fewer than in other species; NORs are rarely located at the terminal position on the short arm of a large biarmed chromosome (no. 8) in H. maoershanensis, but are commonly observed on the small telocentric microchromosomes (nos. 20, 21 or 23) in other species with 2n=56. All five species from Six Populations of Hynobius from mainland China can be ecologically attributed to the pond-type group and have 2n=56. Karyologically, they form two Subgroups. One subgroup has ten while the other has only nine pairs of telocentric microchromosomes.

By using the quadratic approximation of the Rytov's phase structure function and the finite expansion of the aperture function, the analytical expression for the spectrum of diffracted chirped Gaussian pulsed beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived. It is shown that in free space there exist the on-axis and off-axis multi-spectral switch for diffracted chirped Gaussian pulsed beams. However, the turbulence results in a decrease of the spectral transition height, and the spectral switch even disappears when the turbulence is strong enough, which is very different from the behavior of undiffracted chirped Gaussian pulsed beams. Specially, with increasing the strength of turbulence, the higher-order spectral switch disappears firstly for on-axis case, while the lower-order spectral switch disappears firstly for off-axis case. In free space the on-axis spectrum is blue-shifted after a certain propagation distance, but the on-axis spectrum is red-shifted after a shorter propagation distance when the turbulence is strong enough. The spectral transition height increases with increasing the chirp parameter and decreasing the pulse duration, and the odd number order position without spectral shift is independent of the chirp parameter and pulse duration.

Electronic structures and optical properties of gamma-Si3N4 doped with La	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						gamma-Si3N4; doping; first-principles calculation; optical properties	SILICON-NITRIDE; HIGH-PRESSURE; PLANE-WAVE; PHASE; SI3N4	The crystal structures, electronic structures and optical properties of gamma-Si3N4 doped with La are studied using the plane-wave pseudo-potential method (PWP) based upon the density functional theory with Perdew-Wang 91 (PW91) generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The calculated band gap of doping gamma-Si3N4 was found to significantly decrease after the introduction of La. The band structures of gamma-Si3N4 behave like semiconductors for low La concentration and metal for high La concentration. The calculated optical properties showed that the static dielectric constant of gamma-Si3N4 doped with La is much higher than that of undoped gamma-Si3N4, so it may act as a new dielectric and refractive material.

Theoretical prediction of electronic structures and optical properties of Y-doped gamma-Si3N4	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						electronic structures; optical property; doping; gamma-Si3N4	SILICON-NITRIDE; PHASE	The crystal structures, electronic structures, and optical properties of Y-doped gamma-Si3N4 were studied by using first-principles calculations based upon the density functional theory with Perdew-Burke-Enzerh (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The band gap (E-g) of Y-doped gamma-Si3N4 is found to significantly decrease in comparison to that Of gamma-Si3N4. The calculated E-g suggests that gamma-Si3N4 doped with low Y content can be used in the window or absorption material of solar cell, while those doped with high Y concentrations can show metal behavior. The calculation of optical properties shows that the static dielectric constant of gamma-Si3N4 doped with Y is much higher than that of the undoped gamma-Si3N4, implying its special applications in electronics and optics.

Structure, electrical properties and depolarization temperature of (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-BaTiO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics	SOLID STATE SCIENCES			English	Article						lead-free; piezoelectric; ferroelectric; dielectric; Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3	DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; PHASE-TRANSITION	Lead-free ceramics (1 - x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xBaTiO(3) have been prepared by a conventional solid reaction method, and their structure, electrical properties and depolarization temperature have been studied. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that Ba2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5 TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) exists at 0.06 < x < 0.10. The grain size decreases with x. After the introduction of BaTiO3 into Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, the ceramics exhibit a lower coercive field E-c and a larger remanent polarization P-r. Because of the strong ferroelectricity and MPB, the ceramics with x = 0.06 exhibit optimum piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 155 pC/N and k(P) = 36.7%. The depolarization temperature T-d shows a strong compositional dependence and gives a minimum value at MPB. In addition, the ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which probably results from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The results of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties at high temperatures may suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions at temperatures above T-d.

Piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of (Bi(0.94-x)La(x)Na(0.94))(0.5)Ba(0.06)TiO(3) lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES	Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics (Bi(0.94-x)La(x)Na(0.94))(0.5)Ba(0.06)TiO(3) have been fabricated by an ordinary sintering technique, and their piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties have been studied. The results of x-ray diffraction reveal that La(3+) and Ba(2+) diffuse into the Bi(0.5)Na(0.5)TiO(3) lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. After the partial substitution of La(3+) for Bi(3+) in the (Bi(0.94-x)La(x)Na(0.94))(0.5)Ba(0.06)TiO(3) ceramics (x = 0-0.04), the ceramics exhibit a lower coercive field E(c) and a larger remanent polarization P(r). Because of the large P(r) and low E(c), the ceramics with x = 0.02-0.04 exhibit optimum piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 181-196 pCN(-1) and k(P) = 33.2-36.3%. The depolarization temperature T(d) decreases with increasing x (x = 0-0.04). At the high La(3+) level ( x = 0.06-0.12), the ceramics exhibit weak ferroelectricity and thus possess very poor piezoelectricity, and the low dielectric anomaly at T(d) disappears. In addition, the ceramics exhibit a relaxor characteristic, which probably results from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics with x = 0-0.04 may contain both polar and non-polar regions at temperatures above T(d), while for the ceramics with x = 0.06-12, the polar and non- polar regions coexist at room temperature.

After systematic optimization of solvent systems, sample concentration, sample loading volume, rotation speed and flow rate on the analytical Mini-DE centrifuge, the optimized parameters obtained were directly transferred to the preparative Midi-DE centrifuge, with nearly the same purities, resolutions and elution times but with 50 times the throughput. Amentoflavone (446.7 mg, 97.8%), robustaflavone (21.6 mg, 89.4%), bilobetin (80.7 mg, 92.7%), hinokiflavone (15.1 mg, 85.5%), isocryptomerin (34.8 mg, 89.6%) and an apigenin-diglucoside (46.3 mg, 96.4%) were obtained with amounts and purities shown in parentheses as analysed by HPLC. The process, therefore, offers an efficient and rapid method of obtaining sufficient quantities of target compounds with significantly increased throughput after a linear scale-up.

Atoms in molecules (AIM) and nature bond orbital (NBO) theories are applied to analyze the bond nature and the origin of structure and energy variations. The result indicates that the hyperconjugation from the lone pair of nitrogen to the neighboring N-N bond plays an important role in the N-N bond length variation and the relative stability of the 25 isomers can be attributed to the steric and hyperconjugative effects. G3MP2 calculations show that the heats of formation (HOFs) of all the isomers, especially those of the cyclic isomers, are positive and large, suggesting their potential to be energy molecules. Furthermore, the HOFs of the cyclic isomers decrease with increase of the number of substituents. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of MnO2 on the microstructure and electrical properties of 0.94(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-0.06Ba(Zr0.05Ti0.95)O-3 lead-free ceramics	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						ceramics; sintering; ferroelectricity; piezoelectricity	PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES; FERROELECTRIC CERAMICS	Lead-free ceramics MnO2-doped 0.94(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-0.06Ba(Zr0.05Ti0.95)O-3 have been fabricated by an ordinary sintering technique and the effects of MnO2 on the microstructure and electrical properties of the ceramics have been studied. Our results reveal that a small amount of MnO2 (0.50-1.00 mol%) can improve effectively the densification and electrical insulation of the ceramics. For 1 mol% MnO2-doped 0.94(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-0.06Ba(Zr0.05Ti0.95)O-3 ceramics, the ferroelectric tetragonal-ferroelectric orthorhombic phase transition (TO-T) resides near room temperature, indicating the coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases at room temperature. Because of high densification, good electrical insulation, the donor- and acceptor-doping effects of MnO2, and the coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the ceramics are improved considerably. The 0.94(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-0.06Ba(Zr0.05Ti0.95)O-3 ceramics with 1.00 mol% MnO2 doping possess optimum properties: d(33) =234 pC/N, k(p) = 49%, k(t) = 48%, epsilon(r) = 1191, tan delta = 1.20% and T-c =318 degrees C.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal that the crystallized film has a scheelite-type tetragonal structure, uniform and homogeneous surface. The film shows only the blue emission of 447.5 nm with the excitation light of 250 nm at room temperature. The formation mechanism of CaWO(4) film under the simple electrochemical process has been discussed. This method could resolve the repulsion of the electric field on the anode for the mass transfer. The crystal growth in the solution is freer. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, L; Li, LC; Wang, X; Tian, AM				Sun Li; Li Lai-Cai; Wang Xin; Tian An-Min			Theoretical study on the structures and stabilities of the ring isomers of N8H8	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						hydronitrogen compound; density functional theory (DFT); energy; heat of formation	NITROGEN; SPECTRA; N-2	Seventy-four possible steady isomers of ring-N8H8 have been optimized by a density function B3LYP method at 6-311+ +G** level NBO (nature bond orbital) and AIM (atoms in molecules) were used to discuss bond nature and relative stabilities of these conformers. Energies and heats of formation were calculated by a G3MP2 method. The result indicates that the hyperconjugation effect from lone pairs of the nitrogen atoms on its neighboring N-N bonds is the main factor that affects the length of N-N bond. The relative stability order of the isomers of ring-N8H8 is as follows: six-membered-ring > seven-membered-ring eight-membered-ring; five-membered-ring > three-membered-ring > four-membered-ring. Among all the conformers, six-membered-ring isomers are the most stable ones while the four-member-ring isomers are the most unstable ones. In addition, G19 has the lowest energy. M3 has the highest energy, so it is the most unstable isomer. The density of A7 is the largest.

In this paper, cholesterol-based triphenylene derivatives C18H6(OC5H11)(5)(OC(5)H(10)COOCh) (2),2,7-C18H6(OC5H11)(4)(OC(5)H(10)COOCh)(2) (4), C18H6(OR)(3)(OC(n)H(2n)COOCh)(3) (6a similar to 6f) and C18H6(OC(5)H(10)COOCh)(6) (8) (R=C5H11, C7H15, C9H19, C11H23, n=1, 5, 10, Ch= cholesteryl) were synthesized, and their thermotropic liquid crystalline properties were investigated by polarizing optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that, compounds 4 and 6a similar to 6e have glass states and chiral discotic nematic phases (N-D*), while 8 has smectic B phase and glass state. Their glass transition temperatures (T-g) and clearing points (T-c) decreased with lengthening spacer n and alkyl chain, and decreasing cholesteryl moieties.

Their mesomorphic properties were studied with polarizing optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that these compounds exhibit high clearing points, stable columnar mesophases and wide mesophase ranges. It was discovered that, as the length of soft chains increase, the melting points and clearing points of these compounds decreased, but the order of hexagonal columnar mesophases had no obvious change. The mesomorphism of compounds 3a similar to 3f was compared and contrasted with other three series of compounds, 2-benzoyloxy-3,6,7,10,11-pentaalkoxytriphenylene (4a similar to 4f), 2-ferrocenylcarbonyloxy-3,6,7,10,11-pentaalkoxytriphenylene (5a similar to 5f), and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaalkoxy-triphenylene (6a similar to 6f). The influences of ester substituent, electron deficient group, and the size of substituent on the mesomorphism were discussed. The results confirmed the notion that small change in chemical structures of discotic liquid crystals could cause a big difference in their mesomorphism.

In this paper, AlSb thin films have been fabricated by DC magnetron sputtering on glass substrates. The sputtering target consists of aluminum and antimony, and the area ratio of Al to Sb is 7:3, which is derived from research into the relationship between the deposition rates of both the metals and sputtering power. XRD and AFM measurements show that the as-deposited films are amorphous, but become polycrystalline with an average grain size of about 20 nm after annealing in an argon atmosphere. From optical absorption measurements of annealed AlSb films, a band gap of 1.56 eV has been demonstrated. Hall measurements show that the films are p-type semiconductors. The temperature dependence of dark conductivity tested in vacuum displays a linear ln sigma to 1/T curve, which indicates a conductivity activation energy of around 0.61 eV.

The analytical expression for the angular spread of partially coherent H-ChG beams in turbulence is derived. It is shown that the angular spread of partially coherent H-ChG beams with smaller spatial correlation length sigma(0), smaller waist width w(0), smaller beam parameter. 0, and larger beam orders m, n is less affected by turbulence than that of partially coherent H-ChG beams with larger sigma(0), w(0), Omega(0), and smaller m, n. Under a certain condition partially coherent H-ChG beams may generate the same angular spread as a fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in atmospheric turbulence. The angular spread of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian (HG), cosh-Gaussian (ChG), Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beams, and fully coherent H-ChG, H-G, ChG, Gaussian beams is studied and treated as special cases of partially coherent H-ChG beams.

Their-analytic potential energy functions are in good agreement with the Murrell-Sorbie function, and the ground states is X(2)Sigma and X(1)Sigma for AuZn and AuAl molecule, respectively. The adiabatic excitation energies of a a(4)Sigma for AuZn, and a(3)Sigma- for AuAl molecule is 435.29 and 199.91 kJ/mol, respectively. The electronic and vibration energy or electronic and vibration entropy of the gas molecules are assumed to be the corresponding values of their solid states. The relationships of thermodynamic properties of formation reaction and temperature have been calculated based on this approximation.

The relation of the region of MI with the on-site interaction and the site-to-site interaction induced by the dipole-dipole interaction is obtained.

The relationship between the energy and the conformation was obtained by a relaxed scan for all possible dihedral angles of triazane. By means of atoms in molecules (AIM) computation, the increase and decrease of the charge density of bond critical point and the positive and negative variation of its Laplace value induced by conformation can be obtained, which may provide clear information for the change, break, and formation of the nitrogen-nitrogen or nitrogen-hydrogen bond. Nature bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that the energy of isomer was increased by the steric effects, and it is decreased by the hyperconjugation effects. The relative stabilities of isomers can be attributed to the steric and hyperconjugation effects.

The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The vibration analysis and the IRC analysis verified the authenticity of transition states. The reaction processes were confirmed by the changes of charge density at the bond-forming critical point. The results indicated that lithium ethoxide is an effective catalyst in the synthesis of 2-dicyanomethylene-4, 5, 5-trimethyl-2, 5-dihydrofuran-3-carbonitrile from malononi-trile and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone. The activation energy of the reaction with lithium ethoxide was 115.86 kJ center dot mol(-1) less than the uncatalyzed reaction. The mechanism of the lithium ethoxide catalyzed reaction differed from the mechanism of the uncatalyzed reaction.

The effects of 4-substituting terminal groups on the spectra and nonlinear optical properties have been discussed. The results show that the introduction of 4-substituting terminal groups has little effect on the structure. The length of alkyl chains has little effect on the vibrational spectra. The introduction of CN makes C=O stretching vibration frequencies blue-shifted 9 cm(-1). The first excited state electronic transition energy has been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. The results show that the largest absorption spectra of the title compounds were obtained from the pi ->pi* electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and A,,,,x was obtained in 313 similar to 375 nm, belonging to the UV absorption area. The introduction of a strong electron-donor group results in enlarging the second-order nonlinear optical properties.

We analyse the transmission probability of this system in both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases, and our results reveal that the transport properties show some noticeable characteristics depending upon both the spin-polarized strength p and the value of the magnetic flux Phi. Moreover, in the parallel configuration, the position of the Kondo peak shifts while it remains unchanged for the antiparallel configuration.

J	Xiao, MH				Xiao Minghan			Allegorical Trap and the Uncertainty of Piers Plowman	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						William Langland; Piers Plowman; allegory; uncertainty		The allegorical mode usually implies certainty in meaning. This tendency creates a trap for the reader who reads allegorical works and regards them as merely didactic. However, the inevitable distance between the surface and deep structures of the work determines that these two meaning structures cannot match, which therefore always works to subvert the certainty of meaning in an allegorical work. Piers Plowman, the best work in this mode in medieval English literature, systematically uses the allegorical form but at the same time transcends its limitation. Langland' s dialogical imagination, which embraces contradictions and conflicts, enables him to present different views without imposing a super discourse to unify them. The work thereby reflects the richness of reality and the essential uncertainty of spiritual exploration.

The former is a marginal, centerless discourse network created through the fabrication of a virtual reality and the recovery of "memory fragments" from digitalized abstract time. The latter is internally extending and reproductive because of the "extensions" and "blanks" of time and space and the multiple combinations of time and space. The special stylistic structure of this work is formed through the two linguistic systems of "combination" and "association". In its lingual memory series, the history of a particular war becomes Malraux' s "sending source", and it gradually constructs a "lingual chain". On the other hand, the war discourse about Malraux' s own war experiences becomes the dominant discourse in his writing, thus making his writing highly unified in language and style.

Generally, HAART regimens apply multitherapy drugs that contain nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (Pls). Unlike NNRTIs and Pls, the active form of NRTIs is not the drug itself but its triphosphorylated (TP) metabolites in intracellular medium. Analysis of both the prodrugs or NRTIs and their intracellular metabolites is needed to provide overall information in pharmacokinetic and therapeutic effects to HIV-infected patients. Numerous publications have reported the assays for NRTIs and their phosphorylated metabolites in various biological matrices. The methods involved liquid chromatography (LC) with UV detection (LC-UV), LC with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), capillary electrophoresis/electrochromatography (CE/CEC) with UV detection (CE/CEC-UV) or/and MS/MS detection (CE-MS/MS). Due to the extremely low concentration of NRTIs and the phosphorylated metabolites as well as the complex biological matrices, sample pretreatment methods such as protein precipitation (PP), liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) have played important role in the successful analytical method development.

Taking the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam as a typical example of partially coherent beams, closed-form expressions for the average intensity, mean-squared beam width, power in the bucket, beta parameter, and Strehl ratio of apertured partially coherent beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived. It is shown that the smaller the beam truncation parameter is, the less affected by turbulence the apertured partially coherent beams are. Furthermore, the apertured partially coherent beams are less sensitive to the effects of turbulence than unapertured ones. The main results are interpreted physically.

The geometries of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products on both doublet and quartet potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The calculated results show that the reaction is slightly endothermic by 5.3 kJ/mol, which is in good accordance with the previous experiment. The energies and structures of the crossing points (CPs) between two PESs have been determined. The CP appears after the formation of transition states. The two theoretical models chosen to study the reaction mechanism were compared and discussed.

Lead-free piezoelectric ceramic (K0.5Na0.5) NbO3 with MnO2 and K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29 doping for piezoelectric transformer application	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article							EXTENSIONAL VIBRATION MODE; FLUORESCENT LAMP; HIGH-POWER	In this study, K0.5Na0.5NbO3 + 0.25 mol% MnO2 + 0.38 mol% K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were prepared by a conventional ceramic sintering technique and fabricated into a square-plate contour-vibration-mode piezoelectric transformer. The ceramic was well sintered to a dense structure at 1110 degrees C. Because of the pinning effects provided by the defect dipoles, the ceramic exhibited excellent 'hard' piezoelectric characteristics: d(33) = 90 pC N-1, k(p) = 0.40, epsilon(r) = 300, tan delta = 0.003 and Q(m) = 1900. The piezoelectric transformer showed a maximum power density of 10 W cm(-3) with a temperature rise of 20 degrees C. When operated with a matching load of 8 k Omega, the maximum efficiency of the transformer reached 96%. The transformer has great potential to be used in power supply units and other electronic circuits.	[Lin, Dunmin; Guo, M. S.; Lam, K. H.; kwok, K. W.; Chan, H. L.

The calculated values are in good agreement with experimental results. A comparative investigation reveals that the band gap calculated by GGA agrees better with the experimental value than by the other methods, while the calculated bulk modulus by LDA is comparable with that by the method of orthogonalized linear combinations of atomic orbitals (OLCAO). Our results indicate that a satisfactory calculation of the structures and properties of gamma-Si3N4 could be achieved by combining GGA and LDA methods.

First we construct a suitable constrained variational problem and obtain the existence of the standing waves with ground state by using variational calculus and scaling argument. Then by defining invariant sets and applying some priori estimates, we prove the orbital instability of the ground state in the following sense: in each neighborhood of it, there exists a solution whose energy diverges in finite or infinite time.

The monomers [HC C(CH2)(8)CO2C18H6 (OCnH2m+1)(5); m = 4-9] are prepared by consecutive etherization, coupling, and esterification reactions. The monomers form columnar phases at room temperature. The polymerizations of the monomers are effected by [Rh(nbd)Cl](2), producing soluble polymers in high yields (up to 84%). The structures and properties of the polymers are characterized and evaluated by IR, NMR, TGA, DSC, POM, and XRD analyses. All the polymers are thermally stable, losing little of their weights when heated to 300 degrees C. The isotropization temperature of the polymers increases initially with the length of alkyl chain but decreases on further extension. Although the polymers with shorter and longer alkyl chain lengths adopt a homogeneous hexagonal columnar structure, those with intermediate ones form mesophases with mixed structures.

The Gaussian-Schell model beam is taken as a typical example of the partially coherent beam, and analytical propagation equations for the resulting beam in turbulence are derived. The mean-squared beam width, the power in the bucket, and the beta parameter are taken as the characteristic parameters of beam quality to compare the results of the two types of superimposed partially coherent beams in turbulence. It is shown that for the two types of superposition the smaller the coherence parameter a is, the less the resulting beam is sensitive to the effects of turbulence. The resulting beam of off-axis partially coherent beams for the superposition of the intensity is less affected by the turbulence than that for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function.

The calculated lattice constants and band gap bowing parameter are in good agreement with the experimental results and/or values given by other calculation methods. It is interestingly found that the peaks of total density of states (TDOS) in the conduction band have a tendency of shifting to the lower energy as In concentration increases in InxAl1-xN; while in the deep valence band, the peak splits into three peaks. The optical properties such as the dielectric function, reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index, and electron energy-loss function are also presented. The main peak in imaginary part of dielectric function spectrum, the absorption edge and the peak in L(omega) spectrum are found to have a remarkable red-shift as In mole fraction increases.

The results showed that the asymmetrical compounds had bigger charge transfer integrals and higher charge transfer rates than symmetrical ones. The reason is that the mass center does not coincide with the geommetrical center for asymmetrical compounds. While one asymmetrical molecule rotating about an axis that goes through the molecular mass center, the geommetrical centers of two asymmetrical molecules will have relative displacement. The relative displacement can probably lead to higher orbital splittings, so leading to higher charge transfer rate. Significant increase in the charge transfer rate was predicted when going from symmetrical triphenylene to asymmetrical one.

Excited by the ultraviolet light of 250-320 nm, the sample showed a clear luminescence band of 330-500 out and an extra intensive spectral peak with good monochromaticity around 360 nm. The intensity of the peak were 5 times high as the intensity of the substrate or N+ implantation samples and 1.5 times high at the N-2(+) implantation samples, respectively.

The preferential reaction processes of Sr, Ti, O atoms were investigated by generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory at the PW91/DNP level. The reaction mechanisms of SrO, TiO2 and SrTiO3 molecules were calculated and analyzed by highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital theory, and several possible configurations of SrTiO3 molecules were calculated. We obtained stable configurations of SrTiO3 molecule, of which the geometric eigenvalue is similar with the SrTiO3 unit cell. These results indicate that the SrO, TiO2 and SrTiO3 molecules are the primary particle states in the early growth of SrTiO3 thin film.

It is shown that the oscillatory behavior and phase singularities of the degree of spectral coherence may appear when partially coherent H-G beams propagate through atmospheric turbulence, which is very different from the behavior of Gaussian-Schell-model beams. But, the oscillatory behavior becomes weaker with increasing turbulence, and even disappears when the turbulence is strong enough. The smaller the coherence parameter, the less the spatial correlation property of partially coherent H-G beams is affected by the turbulence. In addition, a comparison between the mean-squared width of the spectral degree of coherence and the mean-squared width of the spectral intensity is also given. Some interesting results are obtained, and are explained with regard to their physical nature.

Compared with the parent molecules unsubstituted, derivatives substituted by -CN and -NH2 groups result in higher bond dissociation energies, whereas the others lead to lower ones. The studies indicated that the higher formation heats of compounds substituent groups possess, the higher ones of derivatives. The normalized formation heats of these derivatives substituted by -CN, -N-3, and -N4H are 71.9, 78.7, and 82.6 0, which are higher than that of triazido-s-triazine (70.2 kJ) reported. For derivatives substituted by -N4H, -N-3, -N4H3, -N2H, and -CN groups, formation heats calculated lie in the range of 863.1 -1735.2 kJ center dot mol(-1), but derivatives substituted by -N4H and -N4H3 show low dissociation energies and relatively low stability.

Phase transition and electrical properties of (K0.5Na0.5)(Nb1-xTax)O-3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							POTASSIUM-SODIUM NIOBATE; BEHAVIOR	(K0.5Na0.5)(Nb1-xTax)O-3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that Ta5+ diffuses into the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a solid solution with an orthorhombic perovskite structure. Because of the high melting temperature of KTaO3, the (K0.5Na0.5)(Nb1-xTax)O-3 ceramics can be sintered at higher temperatures. The partial substitution of Ta5+ for the B-site ion Nb5+ decreases both paraelectric/cubic-ferroelectric/tetragonal and ferroelectric/tetragonal-ferroelectric/orthorhombic phase transition temperatures, T-C and TO-T. It also induces a relaxor phase transition and weakens the ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The ceramics become 'softened', leading to improvements in d(33), k(p), k(t) and epsilon(r) and a decease in E-c, Q(m) and N-p. The ceramics with x=0.075-0.15 become optimum, having d(33)=127-151 pC/N, k(p)=0.43-0.44, k(t)=0.43-0.44, epsilon(r)=541-712, tan delta=1.75-2.48% and T-C=378-329 degrees C.	[Lin, Dunmin; Kwok, K.

The objective of this study was to improve our understanding of eco-environmental changes so that a strategy of sustainable land use could be established. An environmental numerical model was developed using spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) model. The model contains twelve factors that include variables of land use, soil erosion, topography, climate, and vegetation. Using this model, synthetic eco-environmental vulnerability index (SEVI) was computed for 1990 and 2000 for the Yellow River Basin. The SEVI was classified into six levels, potential, slight, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy, following the natural breaks classification. The eco-environmental vulnerability distribution and its changes over the ten years from 1990 to 2000 were analyzed and the driving factors of eco-environmental changes were investigated. The results show that the eco-environmental vulnerability in the study area was at medium level, and the eco-environmental quality had been gradually improved on the whole. However, the eco-environmental quality had become worse over the ten years in some regions. In the study area, population growth, vegetation degradation, and governmental policies for eco-environmental protection were found to be the major factors that caused the eco-environmental changes over the ten years.

Single-parameter nonadiabatic quantized charge pumping	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SURFACE ACOUSTIC-WAVES; QUANTUM-DOT TURNSTILE; ELECTRON PUMP; TRANSPORT; DRIVEN	Controlled charge pumping in an AlGaAs/GaAs gated nanowire by single-parameter modulation is experimentally and theoretically studied. Transfer of integral multiples of the elementary charge per modulation cycle is clearly demonstrated. A simple theoretical model shows that such a quantized current can be generated via loading and unloading of a dynamic quasibound state. It demonstrates that nonadiabatic blockade of unwanted tunnel events can obliterate the requirement of having at least two phase-shifted periodic signals to realize quantized pumping.

For rotational partition sums Q(rot) the centrifugal distortion corrections were taken into account. The calculation method for the vibrational partition sums Q(vib) is the harmonic oscillator approximation. The line intensities of nu(2) perpendicular to band (0110-0000 transition) of (HCN)-C-12-N-14 were calculated at normal temperatures and several high temperatures by using the calculated partition functions and experimental transition moment squared and Herman-Waills factor coefficients. Results showed that our line intensities data at 296 and 3 000 K are in excellent agreement with the data in HITRAN, which provide a strong support for the calculations of partition function and line intensity at high temperature. Thereby, the line intensities and spectral simulations of nu(2) perpendicular to band at the higher temperatures 4 000 and 5 000 K were presented and the chang in line intensities with the temperature was discussed. For those transitions corresponding to rotational quantum number J >= 32 (including P, Q and R branch), the line intensities increase when temperature gradually increase from 296 K. The line intensities are up to the largest at around 1000 K and then weaken rapidly. For J < 32 (also including P, Q and R branch), the line intensities are the largest at 296 K and then weaken rapidly as temperature gradually increase.

The calculation results indicate that the carbon and oxygen (in the ester group) come into being different large pi bonds with the benzene circles because of place blocking and conjugate effect. On this basis, the first excited state electronic transition energy was calculated by time-dependent density function theory. The calculated results show that the largest absorption spectra of the title compounds were obtained from the pi ->pi* electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. And lambda(max) was obtained in 370-384 nm, belonging to the UV absorption area. The computed results show that the lateral substitutent of 1,4-bis [(p-methoxyphenoxy) carbonyl] has little effects on molecular structure. Because of place blocking, the dihedral angle between benzene (1) and benzene (2) augments 3 degrees-4 degrees. The introduction of the lateral substitutents has effects on vibrational spectra. The results showed that with the introduction of hydroxy the difference between E-HOMO and E-LUMO of the compound becomes small. While lambda(max) becomes large. Meanwhile, the difference between E-HOMO and E-LUMO reduces by 0.1209 eV with the introduction of fluorin. This causes the biggest absorption wavelength to red shift 14 nm.

The orientational energy of a molecule may be postulated as u(theta, S)= -aSg (theta) where theta is the angle which the molecular axis makes with the preferred axis, and S is the order parameter. The thermodynamic properties of an ordered system relative to those of the disordered one can be derived on the basis of above formula. According to this relation the variation of the order parameter S versus temperature may be evaluated to get the clear points of liquid crystals under mean field approximation. The Gay-Berne potential was proved to be of considerable value in computer simulation studies of liquid crystals. The potential function g(theta) was tried to form by using Gay-Berne functional. According to our experimental studies for the triphenylene derivatives containing amide groups with the structure of C(18)H(6)(OC(5)H(11))(6-n)(OCH(2)CONHC(4)H(9)), (n = 0 similar to 3), the more amide groups the molecule contains, the higher the clear point is. These molecules have been studied with an ONIOM (HF/STO-3G: UFF) method. The interaction energies between two molecules in four configurations have been evaluated. Then the parameters in the Gay-Berne potential have been determined by comparison with these interaction energies. The clear point data obtained from the mean field approximation are in agreement with the experimental results. The higher clear points for molecules containing more amide groups are due to forming more intermolecular hydrogen bonds between amide groups.

Piezoelectric properties and hardening behavior of K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							SINTERING AID; MICROSTRUCTURE; CUO	Lead- free piezoelectric ceramics K0.5Na0.5NbO3+ x mol % K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29 have been prepared by a conventional ceramic fabrication technique. All the ceramics possess a perovskite structure with orthorhombic symmetry. Our results reveal that the addition of K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29 is effective in improving the densification of the ceramics. Besides, after the addition of K5.4Cu1.3Ta10O29, the Curie temperature and the tetragonal- orthorhombic phase transition temperature decrease and the P- E loop becomes constricted, in particular, for the ceramic with x= 0.75. Based on the symmetry- conforming principle of point defects, it is suggested that defect dipoles are formed by the acceptor dopant ions Cu2+ and O2- vacancies along the polarization direction. As a result of the low migration rate of defects, the defect dipoles remain in the original orientation during the P- E loop measurement and thus provide restoring forces to reverse the switched polarizations. Similarly, the defect dipoles do not response along with the polarization in the normal piezoelectric activities and thus provide " pinning" to the deformed polarization, making the ceramics become " hardened." For the ceramic with x= 0.75, the mechanical quality factor Q(m) becomes maximum at a value of 1530, while the other piezoelectric properties remain reasonably high: piezoelectric coefficient d(33)= 90 pC/ N, planar and thickness mode electromechanical coupling factors k(P)= 41 and k(t)= 46%.

San Miguel, Q. Feng, J.V. Moloney, Phys. Rev. A. 52 (1995) 1728.], complete chaotic synchronization characteristics of linear-polarization (LP) Mode of the vertical-cavity surface-emitting semiconductor lasers (VCSELs) with isotropic optical feedback are numerically investigated. When the propagation time tau(c) f light from the transmitter to the receiver equals to the external cavity round-trip time tau, and the central frequency of the T_VCSEL matches that of the R_VCSEL, in large scale region of the feedback coefficient and the injection current where the x-polarization mode as well as the y-polarization mode obtains high synchronization quality at the same time. However, in the central frequency mismatch regions where the x- and y-polarization mode can obtain inferior synchronization quality at same time. But for tau(c) not equal tau, each LP mode of the mixed polarization modes achieved inferior synchronization quality at the same time. Besides, with big enough injection current, the output of the system with the same central frequency in two lasers is entirely governed by the y-polarization mode when the feedback coefficient and Delta tau(=tau(c) - tau) fixed at a certain value. So the system can realize steadily good synchronization of the completely dominant y-polarization mode. But the synchronization quality of the completely dominated y-polarization mode can be deteriorated by increasing absolute frequency detuning value. Besides, in positive frequency mismatch regions where the influence of the same frequency detuning value on the synchronization quality of the entirely governed y-polarization mode becomes smaller than in negative frequency detuning regions. At last, when tau is given and the central frequency of the T_VCSEL matches that of the R_VCSEL, the influence of the tau(c) is not a simple time-shift in the time-evolution of the receiver VCSEL, which has serious influence on the complete synchronization quality of each LP mode.

The ceramics can be well sintered at 1080 - 1110 degrees C and exhibit a dense, single-phase perovskite structure at x <= 0.06. Coexistence of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases is formed in the ceramics with 0.02 < x < 0.05, leading to a significant enhancement in piezoelectric properties. For the ceramic with x = 0.04, the piezoelectric properties become optimum: piezoelectric constant d(33) = 271 pCN(-1), electromechanical coupling coefficients k(P) = 0.53 and k(t) = 0.43. Moreover, the ceramics are non-deliquescent and exhibit excellent performance in transducer applications, indicating that the ceramics are ready for replacing lead-containing ceramics in practical applications.

Single electrons are transported through a periodically formed quantum dot without source-drain bias. Since single electron pumping in the novel semiconductor-based quantum dot device does not rely on Coulomb blockade of tunnelling,the device can not be limited to much lower frequency by the fixed tunneling time constant. Current plateaus due to single electron transport can be observed at 1.7 K with frequencies up to 3 GHz and a current level of 0.5 nA. This novel device represents another possible path in the realization of a high cur-rent high accuracy quantum standard for electrical current, and also provides another means for high speed high accuracy transport of single electrons.

Visible photoluminescence from plasma-synthesized SiO(2)-buffered SiN(x) films: Effect of film thickness and annealing temperature	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							THIN-FILMS; AIDED NANOFABRICATION; CRYSTALLINE SILICON; REACTIVE PLASMAS; PARAMETERS; OPERATION; SIO2	The effect of the film thickness and postannealing temperature on visible photoluminescence (PL) from SiN(x) films synthesized by plasma-assisted radio frequency magnetron sputtering on SiO(2) buffer layers is investigated. It is shown that strong visible PL is achieved at annealing temperatures above 650 degrees C. The optimum annealing temperature for the maximum PL yield strongly depends on the film thickness and varies from 800 to 1200 degrees C. A comparative composition-structure-property analysis reveals that the PL intensity is directly related to the content of the Si-O and Si-N bonds in the SiN(x) films. Therefore, sufficient oxidation and moderate nitridation of SiN(x)/SiO(2) films during the plasma-based growth process are crucial for a strong PL yield. Excessively high annealing temperatures lead to weakened Si-N bonds in thinner SiN(x) films, which eventually results in a lower PL intensity.	[Xu, M.; Xu, S.; Chai, J. W.; Long, J. D.; Cheng, Q.

Structure and electrical properties of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-BaTiO3-Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics	SOLID STATE IONICS			English	Article						lead-free ceramics; bismuth sodium titanate; ferroclectric properties; piezoelectric properties; dielectric properties	FERROELECTRIC PROPERTIES; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; TITANATE CERAMICS; PHASE-TRANSITION	Lead-free ceramics (1-x-y)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-BaTiO3-Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 have been prepared by a conventional ceramic technique, and their structure and electrical properties have been studied. The results of XRD measurement show that Ba2+ and Li2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. With x increasing from 0.02 to 0.12, the ceramics transform gradually from rhombohedral phase to tetragonal phase and consequently a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) exists at x= 0.06-0.10, while the concentration of Li+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure. The substitutions of Ba2+ and (Bi0.5Li0.5)(2+) for (Bi0.5Na0.5)(2+) in the A-sites of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lower greatly the coercive field E-c and increase the remanent polarization P-r of the ceramics. Because of the MPB and strong ferroelectricity (lower E-c and large P-r), the piezoelectricity of the ceramics is enhanced significantly. For the ceramics near the MPB (x=0.06 and y=0.025-0.10), piezoelectric coefficient d(33)=152-208 pC/N and planar electromechanical coupling factor k(p)=30.8-36.8%. The ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which probably results from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The depolarization temperature T-d shows a strong dependence on the concentration x of BaTiO3 and reaches the lowest values near the MPB. The temperature dependences of ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions at temperatures above Td. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The chief action mode was comfirmed to be an intercalation binding at a lower MB concentration but the mixed action modes at a higher concentration. Combining ratio of the binary complex is n(MB) : n(DNA)= 10 : 1, the binding constant of MB with DNA is K-26 degrees C(circle minus)=2.46 X 10(5) L center dot mol(-1) and the apparent molor absorptivity is epsilon = 5.70 X 10(6) L center dot mol(-1)center dot cm(-1). Meanwhile, the interaction of MB with DNA was effected by the changes of pH and temperature. The results deduce that the interaction between MB and DNA is an enthalpy driven reaction.

Piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of Cu-doped K(0.5)Na(0.5)NbO(3) lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							SINTERING TEMPERATURE; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; NIOBATE; ZNO	CuO-doped K(0.5)Na(0.5)NbO(3) (K(0.5)Na(0.5)NbO(3) + x mol% CuO) lead-free ceramics have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique. The results of x-ray diffraction patterns show that all the ceramics possess a pure pervoskite structure with orthorhombic symmetry. Based on the symmetry-conforming principle of point defects, defect dipoles are formed by the acceptor dopant ions Cu(2+) and O(2-) vacancies along the polarization direction and remain in the original orientation, providing a restoring force to reverse the switched polarization, which results in double polarization-electric hysteresis loops for the ceramics with x >= 0.50 at 100 Hz. That is, the ferroelectric dipoles are back to their original orientation on the removal of electric field due to the strong restoring force generated by defect dipoles. As a result, the ceramics (x >= 0.5) become considerably 'hardened' and possess an extraordinarily high Q(m) (825-2523) and simultaneously the other piezoelectric properties remain reasonably good (k(p) = 39%, k(t) = 47% and d(33) = 82 pCN(-1)).

The results show that heats of formation of all isomers are positive and A2-3 is the lowest and C2 is the highest. In addition, the energies and the heats of formation of the ring-shaped isomers are higher than those of the chain-shaped isomers. Among the ring-shaped isomers, the four-membered ring isomers have the highest heat of formation and the five-membered ring isomers have the lowest. For six-membered ring isomers, only the chair-shaped isomers are stable. Among all those chain-shaped isomers, the ones which have N-N bond and its length is in the range of N = N double bond can improve the stability of the compounds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xiao, X; Ji, X; Lu, B				Xiao, Xi; Ji, Xiaoling; Lue, Baida			The influence of turbulence on propagation properties of partially coherent sinh-Gaussian beams and their beam quality in the far field	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						partially coherent sinh-Gaussian (ShG) beam; turbulent atmosphere; propagation property	LASER-BEAMS; ATMOSPHERE; MEDIA	Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle, the closed-form propagation equation of partially coherent Sinh-Gaussian (ShG) beams through the turbulent atmosphere has been derived by using the quadratic approximation of the Rytov's phase structure function. The influence of turbulence on propagation properties of partially coherent ShG beams and their beam quality in the far field are studied both analytically and numerical. The fully coherent ShG beam has been treated as a special case of the partially coherent ShG beam when the degree of spatial coherence a = infinity. It is shown that in comparison with the free-space propagation the turbulence accelerates the evolution of three stages that partially coherent ShG beams undergo. The smaller alpha is, the less partially coherent ShG beams are affected by the turbulence. In particular, we find that the beta parameter decreases as the decentered parameter delta increases, but the dependence of the Strehl ratio on delta is not monotonous. There exists an optimal delta(opt,) the influence of turbulence on the maximum intensity of the corresponding partially coherent ShG beam with delta(opt) is the smallest. Therefore, a suitable choice of 6 may reduce the influence of turbulence on the beam quality in the far field in practice. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
