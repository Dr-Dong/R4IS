A metabolomic strategy using high-resolution (1)H-NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with principal component analysis was applied to examine rat biological responses to CS administration. Half of female Sprague-Dawley rats (2 groups of 6 rats) were each given doses of 150 mg CS/kg body weight intraperitoneally. Urine samples were collected twice daily (0-8 and 8-24 h) from the rats following CS administration. The identifiable biochemical effects associated with CS supplementation included decreased urinary concentrations of hippurate, succinate, citric acid, and 2-oxoglutarate, as well as increased urinary concentrations of dimethylamine, dimethylglycine, glycine, and taurine. These effects were predominately seen within the first 8 h after CS administration. Clear differences in succinate, citric acid, and 2-oxoglutarate were observed 8-24 h following CS. The results suggest that CS supplementation in the rats resulted in modulation of intestinal microbial metabolism and metabolic perturbation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

The sequences were analyzed by means of Neighbor-Joining to improve the phylogenetic resolution of these three Curcuma species. The genetic diversity of these three species is 0.009 to 0.014 (< 0.05). The results show that partial population specimens of C. sichuanensis originate from the cultivated mutation of C. longa; and retain the C. chuanhuangjiang as an individual species. The differentiation is engendered between the wildness and cultivated specimens within C. longa species.

DNA barcoding is a new technique for species identification by a standard DNA region. However, there has been no consensus emerged for plant barcoding due to the low rates of evolution in plastid DNA. In this paper, we compared the performance of four candidate DNA regions (psbA-trnH, ITS, rbcL, matK) in ten species of Epimedium. To select a suitable barcode, ranking criteria included: the success efficiency of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing; genetic divergences; the barcoding gap. The psbA-trnH represented easy amplification, high level of interspecific divergence and well-separated barcoding gap. The other three loci (ITS, rbcL, matK) was inadequate for application. We concluded that the psbA-trnH region was the better potentially DNA barcode for the genus Epimedium.

A large number of genes highly up regulated or down regulated were identified under the stresses. OsXET9 (O. sativa L. xyloglucan endotransglucosylase 9, GenBank accession: NM_001060322) was highly induced in leaf and panicle at all the developmental stages, in response to all stresses, especially in seedling and booting stage under cold stress. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the result was consensus with GeneChip Rice Genome Array, suggesting that OsXET9 is a multiple stress responsive gene in rice. In order to study its function in stress tolerance, we cloned the cDNA of the gene through amplification by PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA encodes a protein of 284 amino acid residues with M. W. approximate to 31kD and pI approximate to 5.2. The gene encodes a protein with several conserved domains. Comparison of protein sequences indicates that OsXET9 is closely related to the xyloglucan endotransglycosylase. Analysis of the putative promoter region for candidate cis-regulatory elements using Plant CARE software (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/) identified some cis-elements related to stress responses. Based on these analyses and results obtained, we propose that OsXET9 is a novel candidate gene involved in stress tolerance in rice, except the function in metabolism of cell wall.

Mutant lines were derived from the regenerated plants. The results indicate that the combination of 20 Gy of gamma-ray and 1 mmol/L of NaN(3) is the most effective for mutation inducement of maize calli. Three endosperm mutant lines with "super sweet" phenotype were derived from the mutated offspring. By complementation test and DNA sequence analysis, their mutation site was found in exon 14 of gene sh2 that encodes adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase. For their highly consistent phenotypes of agronomic characteristics and distinguished molecular mechanism to the previous mutants of gene sh2, these three mutant lines are regarded as a novel multiallelic mutant of gene sh2.

The mineral composition [nitrogen (N), P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] of roots and shoots and the rhizosphere soil were determined. To quantify the relative contribution of each component to the overall correlation, path analyses were carried out. The results indicate that the P accumulators (Polygonum hydropiper and Pilea sinofasciata) had an advantage in mineral composition. In roots, the highest concentrations of Mg, Fe and Cu were found in P. hydropiper, and the highest concentrations of Ca were found in P. sinofasciata. Moreover, P. sinofasciata demonstrated the highest concentrations of Ca and Fe in shoots, which were 2.4 and 4.4 times higher than the mean of all other species. High concentrations of Fe and Mn were also found in the shoots of P. sinofasciata. In the roots of both plants, Fe had the highest negative direct effect on P, while Ca had a higher positive direct effect on P. In shoots, N had a higher positive direct effect on P, and K had a negative direct effect on P. Interactions between nutrients are important for determining the optimum nutrition for P accumulators.

A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population with 127 recombinant inbred lines derived from a SHW-derived variety Chuanmai 42 crossing with a Chinese spring wheat variety Chuannong 16 was used to map QTLs for agronomic traits including grain yield, grains per square meter, thousand-kernel weight, spikes per square meter, grain number per spike, grains weight per spike, and biomass yield. The population was genotyped using 184 simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 34 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. Of 76 QTLs (LOD>2.5) identified, 42 were found to have a positive effect from Chuanmai 42. The QTL QGy.saas-4D.2 associated with grain yield on chromosome 4D was detected in four of the six environments and the combined analysis, and the mean yield, across six environments, of individuals carrying the Chuanmai 42 allele at this locus was 8.9% higher than that of those lines carrying the Chuannong 16 allele. Seven clusters of the yield-coincident QTLs were detected on 1A, 4A, 3B, 5B, 4D, and 7D.

Non-hydraulic root-sourced signaling and grain yield stability under shade of maize during progressive soil drying in soybean	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Soybean; drought; shade; non-hydraulic root-sourced signal; water use efficiency; yield stability	LEAF WATER STATUS; WOODY SEEDLINGS; GAS-EXCHANGE; DROUGHT; WHEAT; CONDUCTANCE; GROWTH; PLANT; L.; SYSTEM	Production practice shows shaded soybean in wheat-maize-soybean; relay strip intercropping system has better tolerance to drought as compared with sole cropping soybean. Our researches are to understand the reasons through non-hydraulic root signals (nHRS), yield and the relationships among them. Pot experiments were conducted with two soybean cultivars, under shade of maize (LI) and normal irradiance (HI). nHRS were traced during manipulative progressive soil drying period at branching stage under good soil conditions (HW), water stress treatment (LW), in 2010. Well-watered (WW), light drought (LD), moderate drought (MD) and severe drought (SD) were applied in 2009. In response to soil drying, nHRS appeared earlier in Gongxuan No. 1 (GX) than Gongqiudou 05-8 (GQ) under two irradiance treatments, but it disappeared earlier for GX than GQ under normal irradiance. GX exhibited a wider average soil water content threshold range (TR) of nHRS under low irradiance. Drought stress significantly decreased the shoot dry mass, root mass and grain yield (P< 0.05), excluding LD and nHRS treatments. Water use efficiency was significantly higher (P< 0.05) in GX than GQ under drought conditions in both irradiances. In a conclusion, soybean cultivar GX has wider TR in low irradiance condition, light drought had no significant effect on yield, nHRS maybe beneficial to maintain soybean yield under drought condition.

Chromosome numbers for five species were 2n = 2x = 12. All examined species displayed stable meiotic process and high pollen fertility (>76.67%). Meiotic abnormality partially affected pollen fertility. At metaphase I, the predominant chromosome configuration was 6II, and occasionally, 5II + 2I. A low frequency of meiotic abnormalities was recorded in five species. Chromosome bridges, laggards and micronuclei were the main abnormalities observed in Epimedium. "Diagonal bridge" was first found in E. chlorandrum due to the altered spindle axis. Polyad was only presented in E. davidii and might have resulted from abnormal cytokinesis. Pollen fertility was correlated with meiotic abnormality.

HW08, explore preliminarily metabolites and deduce the metabolic pathway. Using 1000 mg.L(-1) SW as the sole carbon source, mineral salts medium (MSM) containing five transformants at a proportion for 1:1(V:V) was incubated at 30 degrees C, 180 r.min(-1). The degradation rate of SW was 99.78% in 48 h, and SW could be completely degraded in 72 h. Compared with samples containing SW in 0 h, two special spots of metabolites were visualized with iodine vapor by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Two kinds of primary metabolites (stearic acid and palmitinic acid) and two kinds of intermediate metabolites appeared in the process of metabolism of SW by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) whose m/z was 388.2 and 314.3 amu respectively. Ultimately, four kinds of end-products appeared in the process of metabolism of SW. This work demonstrates the preliminary results on metabolites of degrading SW by five transformants from Arthrobacter sp. HW08.

J	He, J; Chen, DW; Zhang, KY; Yu, B				He, Jun; Chen, Daiwen; Zhang, Keying; Yu, Bing			A high-amylopectin diet caused hepatic steatosis associated with more lipogenic enzymes and increased serum insulin concentration	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						Starch nutrition; Energy metabolism; Lipid; Liver; Weaned pigs	ACYL-COA OXIDASE; ISOCALORIC EXCHANGE; CARBOHYDRATE SOURCE; LIPID-METABOLISM; STARCH STRUCTURE; GLUCOSE; LIVER; MICE; PURIFICATION; OXIDATION	Starch is the major energy source for monogastric mammals and humans. The present study was conducted to evaluate the liver metabolic responses of weaned pigs fed with different dietary starches. A total of sixteen weaned pigs were fed with two experimental diets containing either cassava starch (CS, 80% amylopectin and 20% amylose) or maize starch (70% amylopectin and 30% amylose). The present results showed that the growth performance was not affected by different dietary starches (P>0.05). However, ingestion of CS not only increased the lipid content in liver tissues, but also elevated the concentrations of serum cholesterol and insulin (P<0.05). The metabolic responses induced by CS were associated with more lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase in liver (P<0.05). Real-time PCR quantification for lipid metabolic genes indicated that ingestion of CS not only up-regulated the expression of these lipogenic genes, but also decreased the expression of lipolytic genes. These results suggested that the metabolic responses of weaned pigs fed with different dietary starches may vary widely depending on their composition, and ingestion of starches that are high in amylopectin may produce a stronger insulinaemic response and lead to an up-regulation of lipogenesis in the liver.

Some miRNAs have been classed as epigenetic regulators of metabolism and energy homeostasis. Previous reports indicated that the miRNAs miR-27a and miR-143 were involved in lipid metabolism in human and rodents. To determine the roles of porcine miR-27a and miR-143 in adipocyte lipid metabolism, porcine adipocytes were cultured and allowed to induce differentiation for 10 days. The lipid-filled adipocytes were then transfected with miRNA mimics and inhibitors. We measured how the indicators of adipogenesis and adipolysis in porcine adipocytes were affected by the over-expression and by the inhibition of both miR-27a and miR-143. The results indicated that the over-expression of miR-27a could accelerate adipolysis releasing significantly more glycerol and free fatty acids than the negative control (P < 0.001), while the mimic of miR-143 expression, promoted adipogenesis by accumulating more triglycerides (P < 0.001) in the adipocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that there was good correlation (r > 0.98, P < 0.001) between the indicators of adipolysis in cell lysates and in the culture medium.

Optimal selection for multiple quantitative trait loci and contributions of individuals using genetic algorithm	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Marker assisted selection; Optimization; Quantitative trait loci	MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION; IDENTIFIED MAJOR GENE; OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS; OPTIMIZING SELECTION; DYNAMIC SELECTION; PREDEFINED RATE; POTENTIAL GAIN; MATE SELECTION; INFORMATION; OPTIMIZATION	Two methods (Scheme A and Scheme B) were developed to optimize the relative weights on quantitative trait loci (QTL) and contributions of selected individuals simultaneously to maximize selection response while constraining the rate of inbreeding to the rate observed in gene assisted selection (GAS). In Scheme A, both the relative weights give to QTL and contributions of the selected individuals were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The possible solutions for relative weights of QTL and contributions of the selected individuals were encoded simultaneously. A physical selection population was used to evaluate the fitness of each encoded solution using stochastic simulation with 50 replicates. The fitness of each solution was the mean of all replicates for accumulative discounted sum of genetic means of all generations in physical selection population. In Scheme B, the optimization for relative weights on QTL was similar to Scheme A, and also was implemented based on a genetic algorithm. However, unlike Scheme A, an optimal contribution algorithm (OC) was used to optimize contributions of selection candidates. When compared with GAS, Schemes A and B resulted in up to 15.88 and 22.26% extra discounted sum of genetic value of all generations in a long planning horizon, respectively. Compared GAS + OC and Scheme B, most of the increase (about 78%) in genetic gain was produced by only optimizing contributions of selected individuals. The optimization for relative weight given to QTL just avoided the long-term loss (about 22%) observed in GAS scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To better understand the genetic differences between these animal models, we present high-quality draft genome sequences from two macaque species, the cynomolgus/crab-eating macaque and the Chinese rhesus macaque. Comparison with the previously sequenced Indian rhesus macaque reveals that all three macaques maintain abundant genetic heterogeneity, including millions of single-nucleotide substitutions and many insertions, deletions and gross chromosomal rearrangements. By assessing genetic regions with reduced variability, we identify genes in each macaque species that may have experienced positive selection. Genetic divergence patterns suggest that the cynomolgus macaque genome has been shaped by introgression after hybridization with the Chinese rhesus macaque. Macaque genes display a high degree of sequence similarity with human disease gene orthologs and drug targets. However, we identify several putatively dysfunctional genetic differences between the three macaque species, which may explain functional differences between them previously observed in clinical studies.

A new method for ultrasensitive GA detection in water samples was thus developed with fluorescent BSA-stabilized Au nanoclusters. The fluorescence quenching of BSA-stabilized Au nanoclusters in the presence of GA fitted to Stern-Volmer equation. In the GA concentration range of 0.8-6 mu M, a linear relationship of F-0/F versus GA concentration was obtained with a limit of detection (LOB) of 0.2 mu M. The relative standard deviation of 5 replicate measurements of 4 mu M GA is 1.3%. This method shows good selectivity over other organics in water samples. The feasibility of the new sensor for GA in different water samples was demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 ppm of vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate. When compared with those of the control group, the percentage of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), and CD3(+)CD8(+) of splenic T cells were decreased in the 45 and 60 ppm groups; however, the percentage of CD3(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) were increased in the 5 ppm group, and the CD (4) (+) /CD (8) (+) ratios were raised in the 5 and 15 ppm groups at 14 days of age. Meanwhile, the proliferation of splenic T cells were depressed in the 45 and 60 ppm groups but raised in the 5 and 15 ppm groups. Also, the serum interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents were decreased in the 45 and 60 ppm groups and increased in the 5 ppm group. It was concluded that dietary vanadium in excess of 30 ppm changed the percentages of splenic T cell subsets and inhibited the proliferation of splenic T cells and reduced the serum IL-2 and IL-6 contents. The cellular immune function was finally impaired in broilers.

Four hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 ppm of vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate. When compared with that of control group, the relative weight of spleen was significantly raised in 5- and 15-ppm groups, but depressed in 45- and 60-ppm groups. The gross lesions of spleen showed obvious atrophy with decreased volume and pale color in 45- and 60-ppm groups. Histopathologically, lymphocytes in splenic corpuscle and periarterial lymphatic sheath were variously decreased in number in 30-, 45-, and 60-ppm groups. The percentage of static phase (G(0)/G(1)) was significantly decreased, and the percentage of synthesis period (S) phase and the proliferating index (PI) were significantly increased in 5- and 15-ppm groups. The percentage of G(0)/G(1) phase was significantly increased, and the percentage of mitotic phase (G(2) + M), S phase, and PI significantly decreased in 45- and 60-ppm groups. These results suggested that dietary excess vanadium (45 and 60 ppm) could inhibit growth of spleen and induce lesions in spleen in chicken.

In this study, the potential adjuvant effect of APS on humoral and cellular immune responses to hepatitis B subunit vaccine was investigated. Coadministration of APS with recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen significantly increased antigen-specific antibody production, T-cell proliferation and CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) activity. Production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 in CD4(+) T cells and of IFN-gamma in CD8(+) T cells were dramatically increased. Furthermore, expression of the genes PFP, GraB, Fas L and Fas were up-regulated; interestingly, expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells) were down-regulated. Expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was significantly increased by administration of APS. Together, these results suggest that APS is a potent adjuvant for the hepatitis B subunit vaccine and can enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses via activating the TLR4 signaling pathway and inhibit the expression of TGF-beta and frequency of Treg cells.

However, there is no report about the expression profile of SLC27 member in chicken. In this study, we quantified the expression of SLC27A1 (FATP1) mRNA in a mountainous black-boned chicken breed (MB) and a commercial meat type chicken breed (S01), to discern the tissue and age-related specific expression pattern and their potential involvement in fat deposition and muscle fatty acid metabolism. Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for accurate measurement of SLC27A1 mRNA levels in different tissues from chicken with different ages (0-12 weeks). Expression of SLC27A1 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined. There was a significantly age-related change of the SLC27A1 mRNAs in heart, breast muscle (BMW), leg muscle (LMW), liver, and abdominal fat (AF) tissues (P < 0.05). The breast muscle and leg muscle tissues had the highest expression of SLC27A1 mRNA than the other tissues from the same individual at 0, 2 and 4 weeks. The overall SLC27A1 mRNA level exhibited a "rise-decline" developmental change in all tissues except for breast muscle, subcutaneous fat, and brain. The S01 chicken had a higher expression of the SLC27A1 mRNA in breast muscle, subcutaneous fat, and heart tissues than the MB chicken. Our results showed that the expression of SLC27A1 mRNA in chicken tissues exhibits specific developmental changes and age-related patterns.

This study was performed to observe the effect of Thimerosal treatment of cryopreserved mouse sperm on their hyperactivated motility and subsequent development to two-cell embryos after in vitro fertilization. Hyperactivated motility was evaluated by curvilinear velocity (VCL, the rate of travel of the sperm head) and Amplitude of Lateral Head Displacement (ALH, degree of side-to-side head movement measured as the mean width of head oscillations) of cells using Computer-assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). The fresh sperm had higher VCL and ALH than frozen-thawed sperm (p<0.05). Following In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), fertilization rate from frozen-thawed sperm was significantly lower than that from fresh sperm (71.6, 94.4%) (p<0.05). Neither VCL nor ALH differed significantly between fresh sperm and frozen-thawed sperm not treated with Thimerosal. The decreased hyperactivated motility of mouse sperm due to cryopreservation may contribute to reduced fertilization rate compared to that achieved with fresh sperm. In addition because Thimerosal treatment of sperm after cryopreservation enhances hyperactivated motility, its use may improve the development of cryopreserved mouse oocytes from cryopreserved sperm.

The drying kinetics and the effects of drying temperature on the qualities of sweet sorghum stalk were investigated in this work. The results showed that the drying process could be simulated well by Wang and Singh's model. The diffusivity constant (D-0) and active energy (E-a) were estimated as 4.4 x 10(-5) m(2)/s and 21.4 kJ/(mol K) for drying the chopped fresh stalk. According to the sugar composition, browning degree, and fermentability of the dried stalk obtained at various temperatures, the approximate drying temperature could be suggested as 50-60 degrees C for application. In this range, the moisture of the chopped fresh stalk could drop below the safe moisture for storage in 7-5.5 h with 12.1-9.7% total sugar loss during the drying process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have shown that its essential oil mainly contains two types of compounds, terpenes and aldehydes. The essential oil composition of a new accesssion from southwest China was investigated. Head-space solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses led to the identification of 13 compounds, representing 98.79% of the volatile constituents. Aliphatic aldehydes (69.64%) were quantified as the principal class of the components besides acids (22.83%). However, no terpenoids were detected. The essential oil was dominated by decanal (42.64%). Decanoic acid (18.67%) and dodecanal (15.04%) were also the major constituents. Comparison of results with previous reports classified the current accession as a new chemotype rich in aliphatic aldehydes and acids, with complete absence of regular mono-and sesquiterpenoids.

Despite its significant veterinary and public health impact, the epidemiology, molecular ecology and population genetics of this parasite remain largely unexplored. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes can provide a foundation for investigations in these areas and assist in the diagnosis and control of B. procyonis. In this study, the first complete mt genome sequence of B. procyonis was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based primer-walking strategy. Methodology/Principal Findings: The circular mt genome (14781 bp) of B. procyonis contained 12 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA and 2 ribosomal RNA genes congruent with other chromadorean nematodes. Interestingly, the B. procyonis mtDNA featured an extremely long AT-rich region (1375 bp) and a high number of intergenic spacers (17), making it unique compared with other secernentean nematodes characterized to date. Additionally, the entire genome displayed notable levels of AT skew and GC skew. Based on pairwise comparisons and sliding window analysis of mt genes among the available 11 Ascaridida mtDNAs, new primer pairs were designed to amplify specific short fragments of the genes cytb (548 bp fragment) and rrnL (200 bp fragment) in the B. procyonis mtDNA, and tested as possible alternatives to existing mt molecular beacons for Ascaridida. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of mtDNAs provided novel estimates of the interrelationships of Baylisasaris and Ascaridida. Conclusions/Significance: The complete mt genome sequence of B. procyonis sequenced here should contribute to molecular diagnostic methods, epidemiological investigations and ecological studies of B. procyonis and other related ascaridoids. The information will be important in refining the phylogenetic relationships within the order Ascaridida and enriching the resource of markers for systematic, population genetic and evolutionary biological studies of parasitic nematodes of socio-economic importance.

The results showed that fractal dimensions of mechanical composition were greater than that of micro-aggregates, and fractal dimensions of water-stable aggregates were greater than that of dry aggregates. Five land use patterns had a high proportion of aggregates measuring >2 mm after dry sieving and <0.5 mm after wet sieving. Soil dispersion was mainly reflected in aggregates that measure between 0.05 to 0.001 mm. Soil anti-erodibility in the Chinese fir plantation and Eucalyptus plantation were higher than those of the tea plantation, loquat orchard and abandoned farmland. Stability of water-stable aggregate was highest in the Chinese fir plantation, followed by the eucalyptus and tea plantations, and it was lowest in the loquat orchards and abandoned farmland. With the exception of coarse dust, changes in the composition of other soil particles of the same size varied according to different land use patterns. Changes in the status of aggregates and the degree of aggregation were inversely related to changes in the dispersive coefficient. Water stability indices and contents of soil organic matter in the Chinese fir plantation, the eucalyptus plantation and loquat orchard were higher than those of the abandoned farmland and tea plantation. From the results, it can be concluded that land use patterns of the Chinese fir and eucalyptus plantations are a reasonable manner for the increases in soil anti-erodibility and improvements in soil structure in the study area.

The genome of rotavirus comprises of 11 segments of dsRNA and encodes six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six non structural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). VP6 is a group of antigen of rotavirus (according to the disparation of VP6, rotavirus is classified into seven groups: A to G), and the major structural protein of inner capsid particles (ICP), and also specific antigen of mucosa immunization that mediate specific immunological reaction. In this report, sequence analysis of VP6 gene of giant panda rotavirus was carried out. Full-length VP6 gene encoding for ICP of giant panda rotavirus was amplified by RT-PCR and the amplicons (1356 bp) were cloned and sequenced. Comparative sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1194 nucleotides (nt) encoding a polypeptide of 397 amino acids (aa). Porcine and human rotaviruses VP6 were highly related giant panda rotavirus VP6 with sequence identity of 98.7 and 97% at the aa level, respectively. Further, they showed 62.9 to 95.1% sequence identity at the nt level with other species of rotavirus. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that giant panda rotavirus VP6 gene was closely related to porcine and human rotavirus.

The leaf's hormone concentrations, main-stem and branch yield response to the combination of shade and drought were studied in a greenhouse experiment during 2009 and 2010 seasons. Pot experiments were conducted under shade of maize (LI) and normal irradiance (HI). Shade stress was removed once maize was harvested. Manipulative progressive soil drying period at branching stages under good soil conditions (HW) and water stress treatment (LW) were applied in 2010, while well-watered (WW) and moderate drought (MD) were applied in 2009. Under shade stress, seedling height and first internode length increased, stem diameter decreased, abscisic acid (ABA) and zeatin (ZT) concentration decreased, while indole acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellins 3 (GA3) concentration increased. More also, branch numbers, pod number of branches and seed number of branches increased. Branch yield did not reduce significantly under shade stress, which was related to the decrease of ABA and IAA. Based on the results, soybean yield decreased under shade and drought stresses was mainly due to the yield reduction of the main-stem.

Barr on Castanea mollissima Blume, especially on its cell structure, was examined. Chestnut shoots of both resistant (Beiyu No. 2) and susceptible (Hongguang) cultivars were treated with Cp-toxin for 24, 36, 48 and 72 h, respectively, and then electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were measured in the leaf tissues. Also, ultrastructural changes of organelles were observed under transmission electron microscope. The results show that the EL and the MDA content increased notably when leaves were treated with Cp-toxin for 72 h, and the content of MDA and EL was 4.36 and 2.19 times that of the control samples, respectively. The damages on membrane systems of the cells were lighter and they occurred later than expected in the resistant cultivar than in the susceptible cultivar. At the treatment time of 72 h, Cp-toxin caused marked damage effects on membrane systems of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Finally, after 72 h treatment with Cp-toxin, the membrane systems were damaged, after which EL and the MDA contents increased and were significantly higher than those of the control (P<0.01), while the plasma membrane and cell wall broke into pieces. The change of cell ultrastructure in different cultivars of chestnut in response to inoculation with C. parasitica that positively correlated with the resistance to the chestnut blight can be used as a criterion to evaluate disease resistance.

Development of resistant cultivars is a cost-effective approach to controlling this disease. In this study, 127 soybean germplasm were evaluated for their responses to Phytophthora sojae strain Pm28 using the hypocotyl inoculation technique, and 49 were found resistant to the strain. The hypocotyl of P(1), P(2), F(1), and F(2:3) of two crosses of Ludou 4 (resistant)xYouchu 4 (susceptible) and Cangdou 5 (resistant)xWilliams (susceptible) were inoculated with Pm28, and were used to analyze the inheritance of resistance. The population derived from the cross of Ludou 4xYouchu 4 was used to map the resistance gene (designated as Rps9) to a linkage group. 932 pairs of SSR primers were used to detect polymorphism, and seven SSR markers were mapped near the resistance gene. The results showed that the resistance to Pm28 in Ludou 4 and Cangdou 5 was controlled by a single dominant gene Rps9, which was located on the molecular linkage group N between the SSR markers Satt631 (7.5 cM) and Sat_186 (4.3 cM).

A 2(3) factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effects of temperature, residence time and SO(2) impregnation and their interactions on enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol production. The results showed that temperature, residence time. SO(2) impregnation and the interaction of residence time and SO(2) impregnation significantly affected enzymatic hydrolysis in an order of residence time > temperature > SO(2) impregnation > the interaction of residence time and SO(2) impregnation. Both of water-soluble and water-insoluble fraction derived from steam pretreatment were used for ethanol production, respectively. The results indicated that the effects of mentioned factors and their interactions on total ethanol yield were not significant. However, 200 degrees C, 7.5 min and 2.5% SO(2) impregnation could be determined as a group of optimal pretreatment conditions, in which the highest ethanol yield of 15.3 g/100 g SSB (dry basis) could be obtained without pentose fermentation.

Rats were immunized with the Xinjiang fine wool sheep inhibin alpha subunit recombinant protein, using Freund's adjuvant as the adjuvant. Compared to the control group, the antibody titers increased steadily in the 1 mg inhibin-immunized group, and the antibody titers in 1 mg inhibin-immunized rats were highest among all groups on day 28 and day 38. Moreover, the level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and progesterone in all groups showed an impulse pattern throughout estrous cycle, and peak values of FSH and progesterone secretion in 1 or 2 mg inhibin-immunized groups were significantly higher than that in the other groups, however, the level of LH in the all inhibin-immunized groups during the estrous cycle was similar to the control group. Besides, the number of ovarian follicles (>= 0.8 mm) in 1.0 mg inhibin-immunized group was significantly higher than that in other groups. In addition, the correlation analysis showed that the level of antibody was the positive correlation with the number of ovarian follicles. Together, the data suggested that immunization with the Xinjiang fine wool sheep recombinant inhibin could facilitate the ovarian follicular development via an inhibin alpha-dose dependent way.

At the same time, it is also an important process of carbon sequestration. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effects of different land use patterns on soil aggregate stability and the distribution of organic carbon in different aggregate fractions in order to prove that the different land use patterns enhance soil aggregate stability. Five kinds of soil samples were collected from the hilly area of western Sichuan under different land use patterns, such as abandoned farmlands, eucalyptus plantations, Chinese fir plantations, tea plantations and loquat orchards. The results demonstrated that the five land use patterns had high proportions of aggregates at the size of > 2 mm after dry sieving, and had high proportions of aggregates at the size of < 0.5 mm after wet sieving. The aggregation abilities of the soils were significantly different depending on land use patterns. Water-stable aggregate stability was highest in the Chinese fir plantations, followed by eucalyptus plantations and tea plantations. Water-stable aggregate stability was the lowest in loquat orchards and abandoned farmlands. Except for coarse particle, soil particle contents of the same size were affected according to the different land use patterns. As the size of aggregates decreased, the organic carbon content of the soil aggregates in tea plantations increased after a decrease, and then reduced again. However, the organic carbon contents of soil aggregates in other land uses increased continuously with the decreasing size of aggregates. Organic carbon content of the soil aggregates was strongly increased in land areas that had been converted from abandoned farmland to Chinese fir plantations, tea plantations and loquat orchards, while it was decreased when abandoned farmland was converted to eucalyptus plantations. The results provided the basis of implementation of returning farmland to forest and the process of carbon sequestration in the study areas.

The TP mutation has normal spike morphology; however, it only produces three pistils per floret. Therefore, it has potential to increase the grain number per spike. In order to determine the underlying molecular mechanism, an annealing control primer system was used to identify the different expressed genes in three-pistil mutation. Using 120 arbitrary ACP primers, we identified three differentially expressed genes in young spikes between two near-isogenic lines (i.e.. Chuanmai 28 TP and Chinese Spring TP) and their recurrent parents. We tentatively designated the three differentially expressed genes as DETP-1, DETP-2, and DETP-3. DETP-1 showed similar function with maize cytoplasmic membrane protein, which is involved in cell division in bacteria. DETP-3 is homologous to maize endo-1, 4-beta-glucanase (EGases), which is associated with plant development, cell wall loosening, stem flowering, and root expansion. DETP-2 showed no significant hit with any sequence found in the database and translates unknown protein. These genes would likely play an important role in determining the three pistils trait in wheat. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The evaluation was based on multiple measurements of biomass taken before and after the drought stress was applied using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), along with other selection criteria including anthesis-silking interval, leaf senescence, chlorophyll content, root capacitance, final grain yield, and grain yield components. Kernel weight was the most stable trait under drought stress. Correlations between the primary trait (grain yield) and the secondary traits, except the root capacitance and ASI under water-stressed condition, were all significant. Root capacitance had relatively low heritability and low genetic correlation with other drought resistance criteria, and is not recommended as a drought resistance criterion. Significant reduction of NDVI values measured in the afternoon when the leaves became rolling, compared to those measured in the morning when the leaves were open, provides a reliable index for leaf rolling, which however was not significantly correlated with grain yield. NDVIs measured across different developmental stages were highly correlated with each other and with most of the secondary traits as well as, grain yield, indicating that NDVI can be used as a secondary trait for large-scale drought resistance screening. Regression models built based on non-yield drought criteria and yield components explained about 40% and 95% of the variation for the grain yield, respectively. Some maize lines developed in China for temperate regions showed strong drought resistance comparable to tropical maize lines when tested under tropical condition, indicating that temperate lines with a wide adaptability can be used in drought resistance breeding for both temperate and tropical environments.

In this study, 10 microsatellite DNA markers were used to assess population genetic structure of giant pandas from two critical reserves (Tangjiahe and Wanglang) in the Minshan A habitat. The results revealed high levels of genetic differentiation (F(ST) = 0.134) between the two populations. This differentiation was supported by the assignment tests using the Bayesian clustering method in STRUCTURE. The uniqueness of the populations was also supported by private alleles. This indicated a significant population fragmentation in Minshan A region. In addition, the high individual inbreeding coefficients for Wanglang indicated increased levels of homozygosity in the wild populations. Fortunately, those populations had high levels of genetic diversity. The average allelic richness (AR) and expected heterzygosity (H(E)) were 4.520 and 0.689, respectively for Tangjiahe and 4.584 and 0.648 for Wanglang. Here, we propose an effective way to restore gene flow between the two isolated populations.

Out of 64 specific amplified fragments, 32 and 9 are homologous to the sequences of the maize genome and the expression plasmid, respectively. For 26 of them, a filler sequence was found flanking the cleavage sites. These results demonstrate that cleavage occurs not only during the T-DNA borders but also inside or outside the borders. The border sequences and some inside sequences can be deleted, and filler sequences can be inserted. Illegitimate recombination is a major pattern of T-DNA integration, while some hot spots and preference are present on maize chromosomes.

It was firstly identified in fission yeast and plays a regular role during spliceosome activation and cell cycle. Plant Prp1 genes have only been identified from rice, Sorghum and Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we reported the identification and isolation of a novel Prp1 gene from barley, and further explored its expressional pattern by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, promoter prediction and analysis of microarray data. The putative barley Prp1 protein has a similar primary structure features to those of other known Prp1 protein in this family. The results of amino acid comparison indicated that Prp1 protein of barley and other plant species has a highly conserved 3' termnal region while their 5' sequences greatly varied. The results of expressional analysis revealed that the expression level of barley Prp1 gene is always stable in different vegetative tissues, except it is up-regulated at the mid- and late stages of seed development or under the condition of cold stress. This kind of expressional pattern for barley Prp1 is also supported by our results of comparison of microarray data from barley, rice and Arabidopsis. For the molecular mechanism of its expressional pattern, we conclude that the expression of Prp1 gene may be up-regulated by the increase of pre-mRNAs and not be constitutive or ubiquitous.

Our results showed 887 genes involved in a variety of biological processes were responsive to low nitrogen treatment in Mo17, out of which 384 were up-regulated and 503 were down-regulated. In Hz4 the expression of 1108 genes was changed, of which 696 were up-regulated and 412 genes were down-regulated. The gene expression profiles also revealed 1799 genes differentially expressed (910 and 889 genes with higher level of expression in Hz4 and Mo17, respectively) between the two lines under low nitrogen conditions. These results explain at the transcript level why Mo17 is more sensitive than Hz4 under low nitrogen stress. In addition to previously reported nitrogen response genes (nitrate transporter, nitrite reductase, nitrate reductase, ferredoxin) we found many new nitrogen response genes (early light-inducible protein, uroporphyrinogen methyltransferase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, tonoplast intrinsic protein, sesquiterpene cyclase). Our results not only provide new insights on the molecular mechanisms of nitrogen stress, but also serve as a valuable resource to researchers who aim to improve the efficiency of maize nitrogen use.

In pigs, neither the nucleotide sequence nor the amino acid sequence is known. Furthermore, patterns of tissue expression and regulation by dietary selenium (Se) have not been examined. We determined the full coding sequence (CDS) and the chromosomal location of the porcine gene, SELM, and described its expression profile in vivo under different dietary Se concentrations. The cDNA sequence of porcine SELM from the start codon to the poly(A) tail was cloned by reverse transcription PCR. The CDS contained 429 bases with a typical mammalian selenocysteine insertion sequence of form 2 (F2) located in the 3'-untranslated region. The gene was mapped to chromosome 14q21, where porcine SELM and its neighboring genes exhibited a similar organization to human homologues on chromosome 22q12.2. The expression pattern of SELM mRNA in muscle, thyroid, cerebral cortex, pituitary, testis, liver, and kidney was analyzed with real-time quantitative PCR in young male pigs fed a Se-deficient corn-soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 0.0, 0.3, or 3.0 mg Se/kg in the form of Se-rich yeast. Though the SELM mRNA abundance in each of the 7 tissues was not affected by the dietary Se concentrations, it was significantly higher in thyroid (P < 0.01) than in cerebral cortex, pituitary, testis, liver, and kidney at all of the 3 dietary Se concentrations.

Jian); Myo-inositol; Enterocyte; Copper; Intestine; Antioxidant	ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; RAINBOW-TROUT; GRADED-LEVELS; STRESS; DEFENSES; EXPOSURE; PROTEIN; GROWTH; CELLS; VITAMIN-B-6	Although oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be involved in copper (Cu)-induced toxicity, information regarding the effect of antioxidants on Cu toxicity is still scarce. This study assessed the possible protective effects of myo-inositol (MI) against subsequent Cu exposure in juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) in vivo and in their enterocytes in vitro. First, oxidative stress was established by exposing fish to different concentrations of Cu (0-7.2 mg Cu/L water) for 4 days. Next, the protective effects of MI (administered as a dietary supplement for 60 days) against subsequent Cu exposure (0.6 mg Cu/L water for 4 days) were studied in fish. The third trial determined the effects of Cu exposure (0-6.0 mg Cu/L of medium for 24h) on enterocytes in vitro. Finally, enterocytes were pre-incubated with graded levels of MI (0-75 mg MI/L of medium) for 72 h and exposed to 6.0 mg Cu/L of medium for 24 h. The results indicated that >= 0.6 mg Cu/L water could induce oxidative stress in fish (P < 0.05). Cu exposure significantly induced increases in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in the gill, hepatopancreas and intestine in fish. However, these oxidative effects were prevented by MI pre-supplementation. MI also prevented the toxic effects of Cu on anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and glutathione (GSH) content in these organs. In vitro, enterocytes exposed to Cu displayed a dose-dependent injury. Moreover, cell viability, protein retention (PR), alkaline phosphatase, total-SOD (T-SOD) and Cu/ZnSOD activities were all depressed by Cu (P<0.05). Interestingly, the final experiment showed that MI pre-supplementation could block the toxic effects of Cu on the antioxidant system, and thus protect enterocytes from Cu-induced oxidative damage. All of these results indicated that the induction of key antioxidant defenses by MI pre-supplementation, including SOD, CAT, GPx, GST and GSH, may play an important role in the protection of fish against oxidative stress.

This increases adipocyte number and lipid accumulation, and is thought to be the origin of intramuscular fat. In this study, the effects of myostatin and arginine on adipogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells derived from porcine muscle (pMDSCs) were investigated in vitro. Intracellular triglyceride levels were reduced by exogenous myostatin and increased by arginine supplementation or myostatin antibody (P<0.01). The inhibition of lipid accumulation by myostatin in pMDSCs was alleviated by arginine supplementation (P<0.01). Expression patterns of adipogenic transcription factors showed that exogenous myostatin suppressed PPAR gamma 2 and aP2 expression (P<0.01), while supplemental arginine or myostatin antibody promoted ADD1 expression (P<0.01). Furthermore, compared with the addition of either myostatin protein or antibody alone, ADD1 and PPAR delta expression were promoted by the combination of arginine and myostatin (P<0.01), and arginine combined with myostatin antibody promoted the expression of ADD1, PPAR delta, C/EBP alpha, PPAR gamma 2 and LPL in pMDSCs (P<0.05). These results suggest that myostatin inhibits adipogenesis in pMDSCs, and that this can be alleviated by arginine supplementation, at least in part, through promoting ADD1 and PPAR. expression.

The strains were identified by Vitek system, 16S rDNA, rpoB, pfs and luxS, genes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the broth microdilution method. The two strains were screened for the presence of beta-lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OKP), and bla(CTX-M) genes). Based on PCR amplification and 16S rDNA sequencing the analysed strains were identified as Set-matt. marcescens. In addition, morphological and biochemical identification showed that the two stains were definitely S. marcesens. Antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that both strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins while being susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, irnipenem and aztreonam. It was found that blaOKP had been identified first from the two S. marcescens strains, ch1 and ch2. The isolates were closely related as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The narrow-spectrum OKP-A beta-lactamase gene blaOKP-A-13 was found to be chromosomally located in S. marcescens. The isolates produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of approximately 8.2, which corresponds to the OKP-A family. Findings indicate that OKP enzymes are not Klebsiella pneumoniae-specific chromosomal beta-lactamases, and the first isolation of S. marcescens producing OKP-A beta-lactamase suggests that the blaOKP gene may be disseminated between different species.

It encodes a protein of 284 amino acids residues (=similar to 32.9 kDa) and theoretical pI of 7.13. The transcript of DgNAC1 was enriched in roots and flowers than in stems and leaves of the adult chrysanthemum plants. The gene expression was strongly induced by ABA, NaCl, drought and cold treatment in the seedlings. Subcellular localization revealed that DgNAC1:GFP fusion protein was preferentially distributed to nucleus. To assess whether DgNAC1 is a practically useful target gene for improving the stress tolerance of chrysanthemum, we ectopically over-expressed the full-length DgNAC1 cDNA in tobacco and found that the 35S:DgNAC1 transgenic tobacco exhibited a markedly increased tolerance to salt. Despite this increased salt stress tolerance, the transgenic tobacco showed no detectable phenotype defects under normal growth conditions. These results proposed that DgNAC1 is appropriate for application in genetic engineering strategies aimed at improving salt stress tolerance in chrysanthemum.

The segregation of heterozygous genotypes ranged from 49.13% in the F(2) population to 4.52% in the F(6) population (progression value 11.15%). The heterozygous genotypes were widely distributed in 180 F(2) plants, 330 F(6) lines, and 157 SSR markers. Homozygosity progression showed a wide distribution in plants and SSR markers but not in chromosomes. The segregation of heterozygous genotypes was not significant between populations but varied greatly in F(2) plants, F(6) lines, and SSR markers. The correlation between the progression to homozygosity and the heterozygosity of SSR markers was significant at the chromosome level. The segregation of heterozygous genotypes in plants, SSR markers, and chromosomes was not completely in accordance with Mendel's law. This information will help rice geneticists and breeders to understand heterozygous genotype segregation at the DNA level and to screen special markers for breeding.

Results showed that pretreatment conditions were robust enough to pretreat SSB with maximum of 87% glucan and 72% xylan recovery. Subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis showed that the pretreated SSB at 2% substrate consistency resulted in maximum of 70% glucan-glucose conversion. Increasing substrate consistency from 2% to 16% led to a significant reduction in glucan conversion. However, the decrease ratio of glucan-glucose conversion was the minimum when the consistency increased from 2% to 12%. When the pretreated SSB consistency of 12% was applied for hydrolysis, increase in cellulase loading from 7.5 up to 20 filter paper units (FPU)/g glucan resulted only in 14% increase in glucan-glucose conversion compared to 20% increase with cellulase loading varying from 2.5 to 7.5 FPU/g glucan. More than 10 cellobiase units (CBU)/g glucan beta-glucosidase supplementation had no noticeable improvement on glucan-glucose conversion. Additionally, supplementation of xylanase was found to significantly increase glucan-glucose conversion from 50% to 80% with the substrate consistency of 12%, when the cellulase and beta-glucosidase loadings were at relatively low enzyme loadings (7.5 FPU/g and 10 CBU/g glucan). It appeared that residual xylan played a critical role in hindering the ease of hydrolysis of SSB. A proper xylanase addition was suggested to achieve a high hydrolysis yield at relatively high substrate consistency with relatively low enzyme loadings.

The effects of several key factors, including temperature, moisture content, frequency and confining pressure on the dynamic behavior, were analyzed. It was found that a hyperbolic model could describe the dynamic behavior of the frozen clay well. The maximum dynamic shear modulus of the frozen soil decreases as the temperature rises and as the confining pressure decreases; the reference shear strain magnitude decreases as the temperature and confining pressure increase and as the moisture content decreases; the maximum damping ratio increases as the temperature, frequency and confining pressure increase and as the moisture content decreases. There exists a critical moisture content (around 18%) that maximizes the dynamic shear modulus; at the critical frequency (about 6 Hz), the dynamic shear modulus is at its maximum, and the reference shear strain magnitude and the damping ratio attenuation exponent are at their respective minima. Moreover, functions were proposed to quantitatively describe the relationship between frozen clay dynamic parameters and various influencing factors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigated the effect of supplementation of 0, 800, 1,600, 3,200 and 6,400 IU/kg of VD3 in the basal diet on the mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides (AvBD-1 and chCATH-1) in chicken by using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The supplementation of VD3 in the basal diet could significantly promote the mRNA expression of both AvBD-1 and chCATH-1 genes (P < 0.01), which showed dose-dependent response from 800 to 3,200 IU/kg supplementation dose. Compared with control group (0 IU/kg), 11-fold to 39-fold and 4.7-fold to 25-fold of mRNA expression difference in treatment groups were detected for AvBD-1 and chCATH-1 genes in bursa of Fabricius, respectively. In addition, VD3 also could significantly enhance the AvBD-1 and chCATH-1 mRNA expression in thymus (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that the VD3 supplementation of 3,200 IU/kg dose in basal diet could significantly promote the AvBD-1 and chCATH-1 mRNA expression in bursa of Fabricius, which is potential to improve the innate ability to resist diseases in chicken.

A high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map integrated with physical map and other molecular maps is very useful for characterizing genetic recombination variation. In this study, recombination frequency in maize was investigated through SNP linkage maps constructed with three recombinant inbred line populations. The integrated map consisted of 1443 molecular markers, including 1155 SNPs, spanning 1346 cM. A 100-fold difference in recombination frequency was observed between different chromosomal regions, ranging from an average of 0.09 cM/Mb for pericentromeric regions to 7.08 cM/Mb for telomeric regions. Recombination suppression in non-centromeric regions identified nine recombination-suppressed regions, one of which likely contained condensed heterochromatin (knobs). Recombination variation along chromosomes was highly predictable for pericentromeric and telomeric regions, but population-specific with 4.5-fold difference for the same marker interval across the three populations or specific chromosome regions because of the presence of knobs. As recombination variation can be identified and well characterized as shown in this study, the related information will facilitate future genetic studies, gene cloning and marker-assisted plant breeding.

Results indicated final ethanol concentration in SHF could reach 28.4 g/L (SSB) and 20.4 g/L (OF) by xylanase supplementation with the increase of 46% and 61% in comparison with controls. The delignification could significantly enhance final ethanol concentration to 31.2 g/L (SSB) and 30.2 g/L (OF) with the increase of 61% and 138%. In SSF, final ethanol concentration in the delignified SSB and OF arrived at 27.6 g/L and 34.3 g/L with the increase of 26% and 157% compared with controls. However, only 2.2 g/L (SSB) and 6.9 g/L (OF) ethanol were obtained with xylanase supplementation. According to these results, it could be concluded that delignification was beneficial to improve ethanol production of SHF and SSF. The xylanase supplementation (0.12 g protein/g glucan) was only positive to SHF while retarded SSF seriously. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 420 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet, or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 ppm vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate. When compared with that of control group, the relative weight of bursa was significantly increased in the 15 ppm group from 14 to 35 days of age and increased in the 5 ppm group at 42 days of age, and significantly decreased in the 60 ppm group from 14 to 42 days of age and decreased in 30 and 45 ppm groups from 35 to 42 days of age. Pathological lesions progressed as the dietary vanadium increased. The gross lesions of bursa showed obvious atrophy with decreased volume and pale color in 45 and 60 ppm groups. Histopathologically, widened cortex and increased number of lymphocytes appeared in 5 and 15 ppm groups, and reduced lymphocytes and connective tissue hyperplasia appeared in 45 and 60 ppm groups. The bursal cells in static phase (G(0)/G(1)) were decreased, and those in the mitotic phase (G(2) + M) and the proliferating index (PI) were increased in 5 and 15 ppm groups. However, bursal cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase were increased, and those in G(2) + M phase, synthesis phase (S) and the PI were decreased in 45 and 60 ppm groups. Also, the serum IgG and IgA contents were increased in 5 and 15 ppm groups, and the serum IgG, IgA, and IgM contents were decreased in 45 and 60 ppm groups. These results suggested that dietary excess vanadium (45 and 60 ppm) could inhibit growth of bursa of Fabricius and impair humoral immunity in chicken.

Owing to the importance of aromatase in the production of estradiol, the regulation of aromatase gene expression at the transcriptional level has been an extensive area of study for over two decades. However, its regulation at the posttranscriptional level has remained unclear. Here, we show that micro-RNA378 (miR-378) is spatiotemporally expressed in porcine granulosa cells, the cells that generate estradiol in the ovary during follicular development, in an inverse manner compared with the expression of aromatase. In vitro overexpression and inhibition experiments revealed that aromatase expression, and therefore estradiol production, by granulosa cells, is posttranscriptionally down-regulated by miR-378. Furthermore, site-directed mutation studies identified two binding sites in the 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) of the aromatase coding sequence that are critical for the action of miR-378. Interestingly, overexpression of the aromatase 3 '-UTR enhanced aromatase expression at the protein level in granulosa cells, possibly mediated by the binding of miR-378 within this region, thereby reducing the binding of this micro-RNA to the endogenous aromatase 3 '-UTR.

The experiment included seven treatments: (1) NPK, balanced application of chemical fertilizer NPK; (2) OM, application of organic manure; (3) 1/2OMN, application of half organic manure plus chemical fertilizer NPK; (4) NP, application of chemical fertilizer NP; (5) PK, application of chemical fertilizer PK; (6) NK, application of chemical fertilizer NK; and (7) CK, unfertilized control. Total organic N (TON), microbial biomass N (MBN), labile N (LN), inorganic N (ION, including ammonium (NH (4) (+) )-N and nitrate (NO (3) (-) )-N) contents, net ammonification rate (NAR), net nitrification rate (NNR), net N mineralization rate (NNMR), and NMI in the fertilized treatments were higher than in the unfertilized treatment. Application of chemical fertilizer N (NPK, NP, and NK) increased ION in soils, compared with application of organic N or control. Nitrate N prevailed over exchangeable NH (4) (+) -N in all treatments. Nitrogen storage of the OM- and 1/2OMN-treated soils increased by 50.0% and 24.3%, respectively, over the NPK-treated soil, which had 5.4-22.5% more N than NP-, PK-, and NK-treated soils. The MBN, LN, and ION accounted for 1.7-2.4%, 25.7-34.2%, and 1.4-2.9% of TON, respectively, in different fertilization treatments. The surface soils (0-20-cm layer) in all treatments mineralized 43.6-152.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for crop growth. Microbial biomass N was probably the better predictor of N mineralization, as it was correlated significantly (P < 0.01) with NNMR. The OM and 1/2OMN treatments were not an optimal option for farmers when the crop yield and labor cost were taken into consideration but an optimal option for increasing soil N supply capacity and N sequestration in soil. The NPK treatment showed the highest crop yields and increased soil N fractions through crop residues and exudates input, and thus, it may be considered as a sustainable system in the North China Plain.

The genes had 909-1,059 bp nucleotides and 301-351 amino acids. The deduced peptides shared similar structures with LMW-m proteins of wheat. The 45 genes shared 77.2-99.7% identities in peptide sequence among each other and 60.0-82.0% identities to proteins from wheat and related species. They were divided into five types according to the N-terminals, starting with METSCIP-, METSRVP-, METGRIP-, METGSIP- and VETSCIP-. The last three and some other structural domain variations were not reported previously in the Triticeae. Thirty-three genes encoded full mature proteins with intact ORFs, whereas the other 12 were pseudogenes with incomplete ORFs, in-frame stop codons or frame-shift mutations. Phylogenetic analysis showed that orthologous genes from Taeniatherum were more similar to those in the B and D genomes than in the A genome.

Jian). Seven diets (0.25, 0.48, 0.79, 1.06, 1.37, 1.63 and 2.65 mg thiamin kg(-1)) were fed to Jian carp (8.20 +/- 0.02 g). At the end of feeding trial, red blood cell counts and white blood cell counts increased with increasing dietary thiamin levels up to 0.79 and 1.06 mg kg(-1) diet, respectively (P < 0.05); Lactobacillus counts in intestine increased gradually, and maximum values obtained when the thiamin level was at 0.79 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). After the feeding trial, fish were injected with Aeromonas hydrophila only one time on the first day of the challenge trial and fed the same diets as the growth trial for 17 days. The survival rate, leucocyte phagocytic activity, lectin potency, acid phosphatase activity, lysozyme activity, total iron-binding capacity and immunoglobulin M content of fish after being injected with A. hydrophila were all improved with increasing dietary thiamin levels up to a point, respectively (P < 0.05). These results suggested that thiamin could improve immune response and the balance of intestinal microflora of juvenile Jian carp.

SelS expression is up-regulated response to the inflammatory stimulus in many mammal cells, animal models as well as patients. In order to further understand the function of SelS gene, molecular characterization and transcriptional regulation of SelS from a Bama mini-pig were analyzed in the present study. The results showed that pig SelS encoded a protein of 190 amino acid with estimated molecular weight of 21.23 kDa and pI of 9.526. The genomic structure, promoter and deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed and found to share high similarity with those of human SelS. Pig SelS fusion protein was demonstrated to localize in the cytoplasm by fluorescence microscopy. Real-time PCR revealed the ubiquitous expression pattern of pig SelS in diverse tissues, a high level expression was observed in the liver and lung, relatively low expression in other tissues, especially in muscle. Promoter deletion analysis further suggests that an NF-kappa B binding site within the SelS promoter is responsible for the up-regulation of SelS transcription.

There is available much information on the function of these key enzymes; however, little is known about their transcriptional regulation. In order to understand the transcriptional regulation of starch biosynthesis, the expression profiles of 24 starch genes were investigated in this work. The results showed major transcriptional changes for 15 of the 24 starch genes observed in maize endosperm, most of which are elevated at the early and middle stages of the developing endosperm. Sucrose, abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had a significant correlation with the expression of 15 genes, indicating that sugars and phytohormones might take part in the regulation of starch synthesis. Also, we found that there is interaction of abscisic acid and sucrose on regulation the expression of these genes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The roles of salicylic acid (SA) in monoterpene accumulation and physiological responses of H. cordata are still limited in knowledge, hampering its application in the field. After foliar application of 0.01 mM SA, monoterpene contents, antioxidative enzyme activities, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were measured. The maximum of total monoterpene concentrations was observed 8 days after treatment. A continuous increase of superoxide dismutase and peroxidases activities after 4 and 2 days, respectively, suggested the induction of plant tolerance. H2O2 content did not showed an increase in SA-treated plants at the early stage, while a significant decline in MDA content was observed as compared to the controls. Moreover, although H2O2 was markedly induced at the later stage, MDA content was not increased. These implied that SA application led to lower lipid peroxidation. The study suggested that the application of SA might have little adverse effects on growth and development, and harvest for 8 days after SA application is critical to quality assurance of monoterpenes in H. cordata.

In this study, only one clone of Hina gene was obtained from one barley accession. A total of 121 Hina gene sequences were isolated from 121 wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) accessions in Israel, Iran, and Turkey, and then their molecular characteristics were compared with 97 Hina gene sequences from 74 cultivated barley (H. vulgare) lines in Europe and 23 landrace (H. vulgare) with global distribution and other 26 Hina gene sequences from cultivated barleys (H. vulgare) with unknown global distribution. Cis-acting regulatory element (CARE) searching revealed that there were different types of regulatory element for the Nina gene in wild and landrace/cultivated barleys. There were six consistent cis-acting binding sites in wild and landrace/cultivated barleys, whereas 8 to 16 inconsistent TATA-boxes were observed. In addition, three special elements (E2Fb, Spl, and boxS) were only observed in wild barley, while one (AT1-motif) was only found in landrace/cultivated barley. Forty-four deduced amino acid sequences of HINA from wild and landrace/cultivated barleys were obtained by deleting repetitive amino acid sequences, and they were clustered into two groups on the basis of Neighbor-Joining analysis. However, there was no obvious difference in the amino acid sequences of HINA between wild and landrace/cultivated barleys. Comparing to protein secondary structure of wheat PINA, it was indicated that HINA also existed a signal peptide. In addition, HINA was a hydrophilic protein on the basis of the protein properties and composition.

Many parametric procedures are available for stability analysis, each of them allowing for different interpretations. The objective of the present study was to assess yield stability of maize hybrids evaluated in the National Maize Cultivar Regional Trials in southwestern China using 20 parametric stability statistics proposed by various authors at different times, and to investigate their interrelationships. Two yield datasets were obtained from the 2003 and 2004 national maize cultivar regional trials in southwestern China. A combined analysis of variance, stability statistics, and rank correlations among these stability statistics were determined. Effects of location, cultivar, and cultivar by location interaction were highly significant (P<0.01). Different stability statistics were used to determine the stability of the studied cultivars. Cultivar mean yield (Y) was significantly correlated to the Lin and Binns stability statistic (LP, r=0.98** and 0.97** for 2003 and 2004 trials, respectively) and desirability index (HD, r=0.38 and 0.84** for the 2003 and 2004 trials, respectively). The statistics LP and HD would be useful for simultaneously selecting for high yield and stability. Based on a principal component analysis, the parametric stability statistics grouped as four distinct classes that corresponded to different agronomic and biological concepts of stability.

The chloroform- and ethyl acetate-soluble fractions were the most active with 92.6 and 88.9% mortalities (24 h after treatment) respectively. Therefore, the two fractions were combined and four compounds, isolated from the fractions by activity-guided fractionation, were elucidated as 7-hydroxycoumarin, apigenin, eriodictyol, and quercetin by spectroscopic method and displayed excellent insecticidal activities against adults of M. domestica and 4th instar larva of Aedes albopictus. Among those, 7-hydroxycoumarin showed the strongest insecticidal activities with lethal concentrations (LC50) values of 72.13 mu g g(-1) sugar and 4.87 mu g mL(-1) (48 h after treatment) against the test insects respectively. The cytoxicities of these compounds on BTI-Tn-5B1-4 cell were also investigated for the insecticidal mechanism and found that quercetin represented superior inhibitory activity with MTT assay and reactive oxygen species (ROS) against BTI-Tn-5B1-4 cell, but slightly weaker than that of the positive control (azadirachtin) and significantly greater than the negative control (DMSO only). Meanwhile, eriodictyol demonstrated the strongest effect on the mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP). In conclusion, based on their comparative toxicities to commercial insecticides and their cytotoxic effects, some of the compounds from the F. sarmentosa have potential as botanical insecticides.

A total of 287 tropical and 160 temperate inbred lines were genotyped with 1943 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of high quality and compared for genetic diversity and LD decay using the SNPs and their haplotypes developed from genic and intergenic regions. Intronic SNPs revealed a substantial higher variation than exonic SNPs. The big window size haplotypes (3-SNP slide-window covering 2160 kb on average) revealed much higher genetic diversity than the 10 kb-window and gene-window haplotypes. The polymorphic information content values revealed by the haplotypes (0.436-0.566) were generally much higher than individual SNPs (0.247-0.259). Cluster analysis classified the 447 maize lines into two major groups, corresponding to temperate and tropical types. The level of genetic diversity and subpopulation structure were associated with the germplasm origin and post-domestication selection. Compared to temperate lines, the tropical lines had a much higher level of genetic diversity with no significant subpopulation structure identified. Significant variation in LD decay distance (2-100 kb) was found across the genome, chromosomal regions and germplasm groups. The average of LD decay distance (10-100 kb) in the temperate germplasm was two to ten times larger than that in the tropical germplasm (5-10 kb). In conclusion, tropical maize not only host high genetic diversity that can be exploited for future plant breeding, but also show rapid LD decay that provides more opportunity for selection.

The bifunctional Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EMS) were used to remove lead(II) and cadmium(II) in solution in a batch system. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of the EMS for the heavy metal ions increased with increasing solution pH, and the maximum adsorption capacity (88.16 mg/g for Pb(2+), 40.72 mg/g for Cd(2+)) at 10 degrees C was found to occur at pH 5.5 and 6.0, respectively. The adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm model. The regeneration experiments revealed that the EMS could be successfully reused. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Infected dogs are the main reservoir for Leishmania infantum, and a potential sentinel for human VL in endemic areas. In the present study we investigated the prevalence of Leishmania DNA in dogs from Wenchuan, Heishui and Jiuzhaigou County in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, which are important endemic areas of zoonotic VL, detected by real time PCR. The results will help to design control strategies against visceral leishmaniasis in dogs and humans. Results: The overall prevalence of Leishmania DNA in dogs was 24.8% (78/314) in Sichuan Province, with the positive rate of 23.5% (23/98) in Wenchuan County, 28.2% (20/71) in Heishui County, and 24.1% (35/145) in Jiuzhaigou County, and no significant difference was observed among the three counties (P > 0.05). The dogs were further allocated to different groups based on sexes, ages and external clinical symptoms. The logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher prevalence was found in older and external symptomatic dogs, compared to that of younger and asymptomatic dogs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results revealed that L. infantum infection in dogs is widespread in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, which has a public health significance, due to its contribution to the transmission of the infection to humans by sandflies. It is necessary to take measures, including treatment or eradication of infected dogs, to control canine leishmaniasis, which could be helpful to reduce human VL in this area.

Recent studies of the last several years have demonstrated that, hybridization and subsequent genome doubling ( polyploidy) often induce an array of variations that could not be explained by the conventional genetic paradigms. A large proportion of these variations are epigenetic in nature. Epigenetic can be defined as a change of the study in the regulation of gene activity and expression that are not driven by gene sequence information. However, the ramifications of epigenetic in plant biology are immense, yet unappreciated. In contrast to the ease with which the DNA sequence can be studied, studying the complex patterns inherent in epigenetic poses many problems. In this view, advances on researching epigenetic change of hybrid and polyploidy in plants will be initially set out by summarizing the latest researches and the basic studies on epigenetic variations generated by hybridization. Moreover, polyploidy may shed light on the mechanisms generating these variations. These advances will enhance our understanding on their evolutionary significances, as well as enable us to utilize these variations more effectively than before in crop breeding.

Thirty four strains of E. coli were selected by selective medium and conventional biochemical test from fresh stool samples of swines in five farms in Sichuan province. The isolates were identified by 160 kinds of E. coli O serums. The results show that 30 strains were determined among 34 E. coli isolates, 12 kinds of O serogroups were obtained on the basis of the agglutination test. The predominant types are O(23), O(113) and O(120), representing 35.4%. Furthermore, the genotypes and phylogenetic relationship of all isolates were analysed by Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) and repetitive extragenic palindrome PCR (REP-PCR), 34 E. coli isolates were clustered to 19 ERIC-PCR genotypes and 13 REP-PCR genotypes. The isolates from the same farm or sharing the same serotyping showed different genotype. And the isolates which could not be serotyped were genotyped by ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR. The analysis of genetic type and original source revealed that isolates from different farms had different genetic types. The subtypes of E. coli are also different within a single farm. Genetic variability with E. coli strains isolated from swine farms in China has been demonstrated. The presence of ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR sequences in the genome of E. coli was confirmed. ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR techniques are more rapid methods for molecular typing of E. coli strain. They are also useful methods for diversity survey of E. coli and the two methods analyzes genetic diversity of E. coli isolated in Sichuan of China.

Six cDNA sequences encoding three large subunits and three small subunits of maize AGPase from database were mined and subsequently named: agpl1, agpl2, agpl3, agps1, agps2, and agps3. To elucidate the roles of these isogenes, a comprehensive expression analysis of the gene family was conducted by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Based on the expression patterns, the six genes can be divided into three groups: (1) steady expressers (agpl1, agps1, and agpl2), which were expressed relatively constantly both in leaf and grain; (2) tissue and development-specific expressers (agpl3 and agps2), which were expressed only in grain at middle and late development phases; (3) tissue-specific expressers (agps3), whose transcripts kept constant during grain filling and were observed only in grain. In order to clarify the effects of sugar and plant hormone on maize AGPase genes expression, a serial of treatments were used. The results showed that AGPase genes significantly differed in response to sugar and hormone inductions. Enormous transcript changes of these genes could be observed in glucose and sucrose treatments. Interestingly, synergistic effect of ABA and sucrose on these genes was observed.

The effect of ethyl acetate extracts (EAE) in reducing oxidative stress in mice was evaluated. From the results of antioxidant assays in vitro, EAE was found to have the highest antioxidant activity. The antioxidant assay results showed that high doses of EAE significantly decrease the MDA level and increase the SOD activity of mice in vivo. These studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that the extract EAE from Astragalus has significant antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. In summary, the results exhibited that the Astragalus could be used as a rich source of potentially natural antioxidants.

The EDTAD-modified magnetic baker's yeast biomass (EMB) thus obtained was investigated by means of magnetic response, FTIR, potentiometric titration, zeta potential and elemental analysis. The results revealed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles were steadily cross-linked/incorporated with baker's yeast biomass and the EDTA was modified on the surface of the magnetic baker's yeast. The adsorption properties of EMB for Pb2+/Cd2+ ions were then evaluated. Various factors affecting the uptake behavior such as pH, contact time, temperature, coexisting cations, and initial concentration of the metal ions were investigated. The results showed that EMB not only possesses a good adsorption capacity for Pb2+/Cd2+ in all pH ranges studied but also can selectively adsorb lead(II)/cadmium(II) from the binary mixtures of Pb2+/Cd2+ and alkali/alkaline-earth cations. The isotherm adsorption equilibrium of EMB was well described by Langmuir isotherms and the maximum adsorption capacity (99.26 mg/g for Pb2+ at pH5.5 and 48.70 mg/g for Cd2+ at pH6.0) was observed at 30 degrees C. Moreover, the regeneration experiments revealed that the EMB could be successfully reused for three cycles and the metal recovery efficiencies were above 80% when 0.1 mol/L HCl eluent was used.

D. and Wang, Z. 2011. Optimizing a beef production system using specialized sire and dam lines. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 91: 353-361. Crossbreeding is an effective method for improving the efficiency of production in commercial cow-calf operations. It exploits available heterosis (hybrid vigour) and complementarity between different breeds or populations (lines). Before adopting a crossbreeding system, commercial cattle producers should evaluate available genetic resources and feasible crossbreeding systems, and choose one that is most beneficial for their own environment, resources, and management. This study compared profitability of alternative crossbreeding systems based on Beefbooster beef cattle breeding strains through computer simulation. Biological and economic data were collected from commercial customers of Beefbooster in Montana and western Canada, and breeding records from the database of Beefbooster, Inc. Three maternal strains (M1, M2 and M4) and two specialized paternal strains (M3 and TX), were evaluated with two simulated crossbreeding systems. System 1 uses a rotational cross between M1 and M4 with yearling crossbred heifers bred to M3 sires. System 2 is based on a three-strain rotation of Ml, M2 and M4 with yearling crossbred heifers bred to M3 to facilitate ease of calving and crossbred cows bred to a classical terminal sire strain TX. Simulated base profit from system 2 was $29.57 greater (215.21 vs. 185.64 yr(-1) per cow) than from system 1.

The MSTN genes have different genetic characteristics in vertebrates: sole gene in mammals, gene duplication in fish, and alternative splicing in birds. To investigate the alternative splicing sites and developmental expression patterns of the duck MSTN genes, the mRNA and genome sequences were cloned, and the expression patterns were detected during breast muscle and leg muscle development by real-time PCR. In our study, four alternatively spliced forms of MSTN mRNA were found in the developing skeletal muscle of Peking duck, including two novel alternatively spliced transcripts, MSTN-c and MSTN-d. As a result of alternative splicing at the common CT-AG processing sites, MSTN-b and MSTN-c retained only the N-terminal TGF beta-propeptide superfamily domains. However, MSTN-d was not missing these domains, in contrast to MSTN-a. The real-time PCR results showed that there was no significant difference between breast muscle and leg muscle in MSTN-a mRNA expression, also in MSTN-b and MSTN-c. MSTN-a and MSTN-b have significant higher expressions than MSTN-c and MSTN-d, suggesting that they play the major role during embryo muscle development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A total of 19 clones were obtained. Each of them contained an open reading frame encoding a putative 40-KDa protein of 359 amino acid residues. Twenty-one SNPs and 4 InDels were found and could divide the 19 sequences into 2 classes, designated as DvGA20ox-1 and DvGA20ox-2, respectively. Q-PCR analyses showed that both DvGA20ox-1 and DvGA20ox-2 were in leaf blade, leaf sheath, stem, eustipes, root and developing spike. Similar expression levels were found between DvGA20ox-1 and DvGA20ox-2 in three stages. The total expression levels of DvGA20ox-1 and DvGA20ox-2 presented downtrend in leaf blade and ascend in stem, eustipes and developing spike along with the development of plants, respectively. However, they were firstly increased and then decreased in root from seeding stage to heading stage. These results revealed that the gene expression profile of DvGA20ox-1 and DvGA20ox-2 closely related to the growth and development of D. villosum.	[Cai, P.; Peng, Z.

The cluster analysis separated the accessions into six groups with geographical origins. The results of principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) were almost congruent with the cluster of accessions. The molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) showed that the proportion of variance within and among the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Xinjiang regions was 68.66 and 31.34%, respectively, or 75.99 and 24.01% within and among six political provinces. The distinct geographical divergence of E. nutans was revealed between the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Xinjiang. The ecogeographical conditions such as climate and mountain ranges, genetic drift and mating system could be driving factors for genetic diversity. These results will facilitate the breeding program and germplasm collection and conservation.

The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were greatly decreased, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were markedly increased in high F groups II and III. At the same time, mitochondrial injury and expanded endocytoplasmic reticulum were obviously observed in high F groups II and III, and the fluoride contents both in spleen and serum were significantly increased in the three high F groups when compared with those of control group. The results showed that excess dietary F in the range of 800-1200 mg/kg caused obvious oxidative stress, which provided a possible pathway for the apoptosis of splenocytes in chickens.

Our objective was to determine if ED could be induced by feeding a current, practical diet and if the incidence was related to selenogenome expression in liver and muscle of chicks. Four groups of day-old broiler chicks (n= 60/group) were fed a corn-soy basal diet (BD; 14 mu g Se/kg; produced in the Se-deficient area of Sichuan, China and not supplemented with Se or vitamin E), the BD and all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate at 50 mg/kg and Se (as sodium selenite) at 0.3 mg/kg, or both of these nutrients for 6 wk. A high incidence of ED and mortality of chicks were induced by the BD. The incidences and mortality were completely prevented by supplemental dietary Se but were only partially decreased by supplemental a-tocopherol acetate. Dietary Se deficiency decreased (P < 0.05) mRNA levels of 7 common selenoprotein genes (Gpx1, Gpx4, Sepw1, Sepn1, Sepp1, Selo, and Se/k) in muscle and liver. Whereas supplementing alpha-tocopherol acetate enhanced (P < 0.05) only the muscle Sepx1 mRNA level, it actually decreased (P < 0.05) hepatic Gpx1, Seli, Txnrd1, and Txnrd2 mRNA levels. In conclusion, dietary Se protected chicks from the Se deficiency disease ED, probably by upregulating selenoprotein genes coding for oxidation- and/or lesion-protective proteins. The protection by vitamin E might be mediated via selenoproteins not assayed in this study and/or Se-independent mechanisms. The inverse relationship between hepatic expression of 4 redox-related selenoprotein genes and vitamin E status revealed a novel interaction between Se and vitamin E in vivo. J.

SEL (6 mg/kg) was administered to rabbits with a single topical application. Eighteen Angora rabbits were randomly allocated to three groups of six rabbits each. At days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 following SEL administration, rabbits were inoculated with larval, nymphal, and adult ticks and were then observed for a period of 7 days. The cumulative reduction rates at days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 for dead ticks were 100%, 100%, 100%, 95.0%, and 76.7%, respectively, for larvae; 100%, 100%, 100%, 85.0%, and 65.0%, respectively, for nymphs; and 100%, 95.0%, 85.0%, 60.0%, and 45.0%, respectively, for adults. The cumulative reduction rates for larvae in untreated Angora rabbits (controls) were 3.3%, 1.7%, 3.3%, 5.0%, and 5.0%, respectively. There was no reduction of nymphs and adults in untreated Angora rabbits (controls). The reduction rates for larvae, nymphs, and adults were significantly higher for Angora rabbits inoculated with SEL than the controls (P < 0.001).

In this study, a 489 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial control region was amplified from 230 DNA samples collected from rhesus macaques in the Sichuan province in Western China. The fragment was then sequenced and aligned with 208 sequences from wild rhesus macaques, sampled throughout the species' geographic range in China downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis of the 182 unique sequences identified among these samples divided Chinese rhesus macaques into two western haplogroups (haplogroups A and B) and three older eastern haplogroups (haplogroups C, D, and E), whose differentiation probably occurred during the penultimate glacial event. During the warming after the penultimate glacial event, haplogroups A, B, and E rapidly expanded and a relatively young subhaplogroup of haplogroup E, E', limited to Southern China but shared with Vietnamese rhesus macaques, was reintroduced from Indochina during the last glacial event. One haplotype most closely related to subhaplogroup E' probably represents the isolation of Hainan Island, to where it is restricted, from the mainland by the formation of the Qiongzhou Strait approximately 8,500 years ago. The distribution of haplogroups both informs the phylogeographic history of dispersal of Chinese rhesus macaques and has implications for their suitability as animal models in biomedical research.

Engelm, is a dioecious turfgrass native to the Great Plains of North America. Since its naturalization, it has become the most wildly cultivated warm-season turfgrass in northern China. While dioecious plants represent only a small proportion of all plant species, they are important models in the study of plant sex determination and evolution. The identification of the sexes is important in the theory and practice of breeding programs. At present, there is no effective method to determine the sex of early stage buffalograss. The objective of this study was to use sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) and integrated bulked segregant analysis (BSA) technology to find sex linked markers in B. dactyloides. A total of 228 primer combinations were screened and 2,690 SRAP bands examined. Only ME9/EM2 could generate a specific fragment (similar to 240 bp) in all the female plants, which was absent in male plants. The methods described here provide a simple and reproducible means of early sex identification in B. dactyloides.

A full-length cDNA sequence of a MYB gene, namely TaPIMP1, was isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The TaPIMP1 transcript level was significantly up-regulated by inoculation with a fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana and by drought treatment. TaPIMP1 encodes the MYB protein TaPIMP1 consisting of 323 amino acids. TaPIMP1 contains two MYB DNA binding domains (R2, R3), two putative nuclear localization sites and two putative transcription activation domains. TaPIMP1 is a new member of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor subfamily. Transient expression in onion epidermal cells of GFP fused with TaPIMP1 proved that subcellular localization of TaPIMP1 occurred in the nucleus. The TaPIMP1 gene was transferred into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cultivar W38 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. After screening through PCR and RT-PCR analyses, transgenic tobacco lines expressing TaPIMP1 were identified and evaluated for pathogen resistance, and drought and salt tolerance. Compared to untransformed tobacco host plants, TaPIMP1 expressing plants displayed significantly enhanced resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum and exhibited improved tolerances to drought and salt stresses. In these transgenic lines, the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly increased relative to wild-type tobacco plants. The results suggested that the wheat R2R3-MYB transcription factor plays an important role in modulating responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.

Twenty pigs (73.9 +/- 1.2 kg BW) were used in a single factorial experiment, and allocated by BW and ultrasound backfat thickness to the two treatments: low protein/CH(2)O ratio (LP; 11.2% CP and 68.2% CH(2)O for phase I, and 10.1% CP and 69.3% CH(2)O for phase II) diet, or high protein/CH(2)O ratio (HP; 22.7% CP and 58.3% CH(2)O) diet. Pigs were housed individually in pens, and had ad libitum access to feed and water. After 80-d feeding, 6 pigs from each treatment were selected and slaughtered. Dietary protein/CH(2)O ratio had no effect on growth performance; however, the intramuscular fat (IMF) in longissimus muscle (LM) was increased (P<0.01) when the LP diet was fed. Correspondingly, Warner-Bratzler sheer force of LM in the LP pigs was lower (P<0.05) than the HP pigs. The LP increased mRNA levels of PPAR gamma (P<0.05) and H-FABP (P=0.09) in LM but not in subcutaneous fat, although the difference of H-FABP gene expression in LM was not statistically significant. The mRNA abundance of PPAR gamma in muscle correlated positively with IMF content (P<0.05). The results indicated that an increase in IMF but not subcutaneous fat in pigs fed the LP diet is related to tissue-specific activation of PPAR gamma and H-FABP mRNA expression, especially the PPAR gamma gene.

In comparison with those of the control group, the percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) were decreased in 1,000 and 1,500 mg/kg of Mo intake groups from 14 days of age to 42 days of age. Also, the serum IL-2 contents were decreased in 1,000 and 1,500 mg/kg of Mo intake groups from 14 days of age to 42 days of age. Histopathologically, hypocellularity appeared in the thymus in 1,000 and 1,500 mg/kg of Mo intake groups. It was concluded that dietary high-Mo (1,000 mg/kg and 1,500 mg/kg) reduced the percentages of peripheral blood T-cell subsets and serum IL-2 contents and caused thymic lesions.

Three hundred 1-day-old Avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups, and fed on diets as follows: control diet (Mo 13 mg/kg) and high molybdenum diets (Mo 500 mg/kg, high molybdenum group I; Mo 1,000 mg/kg, high molybdenum group II; Mo 1,500 mg/kg, high molybdenum group III) for 6 weeks. The results showed that the relative weight of kidney were higher (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and the cellular percentages of G(0)/G(1) phase were lower, and cellular percentages of S phase and the proliferating index were higher in high molybdenum groups II and III than in control group (P < 0.01). The percentage of renal cell apoptosis was increased in high molybdenum groups II and III when compared with that of control group (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical test showed that there were increased frequencies of positive cells containing Bax protein and decreased frequencies of positive cells containing Bcl-2 protein in high molybdenum groups II and III. It was concluded that dietary high molybdenum (1,000 mg/kg and 1,500 mg/kg) impaired the progression of renal cells from S phase to G(2)M phase obviously and induced renal cell apoptosis.

Since the first observed double-muscling phenotype was reported in myostatin-null animals, a functional role of myostatin has been demonstrated in the control of skeletal muscle development. However, beyond the confines of its traditional role in muscle growth inhibition, myostatin has recently been shown to play an important role in metabolism. During the past several years, it has been well established that Smads are canonical mediators of signals for myostatin from the receptors to the nucleus. However, growing evidence supports the notion that Non-Smad signal pathways also participate in myostatin signaling. Myostatin expression is increased in muscle atrophy and metabolic disorders, suggesting that changes in endogenous expression of myostatin may provide therapeutic benefit for these diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression and recent evidence has accumulated supporting a role for miRNAs in the regulation of myostatin expression. This review highlights some of these areas in myostatin research: a novel role in metabolism, signal pathways, and miRNA-mediated expression regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Zaojia. To achieve optimal conditions for adventitious shoot induction, five explants (entire cotyledons, distal cotyledons, proximal cotyledons, cotyledonary node A and cotyledonary node B) were tested on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of growth regulators (0 to 0.2 mg/L IAA and 1.0 to 5.0 mg/L BA), the results showed that entire cotyledons cultured in MS + BA (2.0mg/L) + IAA(0.2mg/L) achieved the highest regenerated rate (89.67%) and the optimal protocol screened in this experiment had 7.69 +/- 0.10 shoots per explants. Adventitious shoots were able to elongate both on MS medium with 0.2 mg/L KT and 0.2 mg/L NAA; IBA 0.3mg/L was found to be effective in the production of root. Acclimatized plantlets transferred to pot resumed growth, and their stems and leaves elongated and expanded in one month.	[Li, J.; Li, M.; Qin, Y. G.; Tang, Y.; Wang, L.; Ma, C.; Li, H.

A total of eighty virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control diet, a high-fat diet (HF), a high-fat and high-fibre diet (HFF) or a high-fat NAG diet until clay 19,5 of gestation. Maternal HFF consumption resulted in a significantly higher mean fetal number and placental weight than in the other groups (P < 0.05). The HFF diet significantly abrogated HF-induced decreases in maternal serum and placental superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacities (P < 0.05); partially abrogated HF-induced increases in maternal serum and placental malondialdehycle (MDA) and protein carbonyl concentrations (maternal serum MDA and placental protein carbonyl, P < 0.05); resulted in significantly higher fetal liver total superoxide dismutase (SOD), Cu- and Zn-containing SOD and Mn-containing SOD (Mn-SOD) activities than in the HF group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, mRNA expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, thioredoxin 2 and Mn-SOD in fetal liver and Mn-SOD in fetal heart and placental GLUT3 in the HFF group were higher than those in the other groups (P < 0.05). The inclusion of dietary fibre in the HF diet was more effective than NAG supplementation in maintaining maternal serum and placental superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacities close to those of the control. These results suggest that maternal fibre intake during pregnancy is beneficial for fetal intrauterine development possibly through the improvement of maternal, placental and fetal antioxidant capacities and placental nutrient transfer capacity.

However, there was no report on the UL16 gene product of duck enteritis virus (DEV). In this study, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of UL16 using bioinformatics tools and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) induced by isopropy1-beta D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein was produced, purified using a Ni NTA column and used to generate the polyclonal antibody against UL16. The intracellular distribution of the DEV UL16 product was carried out using indirect immunofluorescence assay. Results: In our study, UL16 gene of DEV was composed of 1089 nucleotides, which encoded 362 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that the UL16 gene was highly conserved in herpesvirus family. The UL16 gene was cloned into a pET prokaryotic expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli Rossetta (DE3) induced by IPTG. A 60kDa fusion protein band corresponding to the predicted size was produced on the SDS PAGE, purified using a Ni-NTA column. Anti-UL16 polyclonal sera was prepared by immunizing rabbits, and reacted with a band in the IPTG induced cell lysates with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa. In vivo expression of the UL16 protein in DEV infected duck embryo fibroblast cells (DEFs) was localized mostly around perinuclear cytoplasmic area and in cytosol using indirect immunofluorescence assay. Conclusions: The UL16 gene of DEV was successfully cloned, expressed and detected in DEV infected DEFs for the first time. The UL16 protein localized mostly around perinuclear cytoplasmic area and in cytosol in DEV infected DEFs. DEV UL16 shared high similarity with UL16 family members, indicating that DEV UL16 many has similar function with its homologs. All these results may provide some insight for further research about full characterizations and functions of the DEV UL16.

Enzyme production by filamentous fungi: analysis of the secretome of Trichoderma reesei grown on unconventional carbon source	MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES			English	Article							D-XYLOSE REDUCTASE; CELLULASE GENE-EXPRESSION; HYPOCREA-JECORINA; BETA-GLUCOSIDASE; ASPERGILLUS-NIGER; XYLANASE PRODUCTION; INDUCTION; LACTOSE; HEMICELLULASES; ETHANOL	Background: Spent hydrolysates from bioethanolic fermentation processes based on agricultural residues have potential as an abundant and inexpensive source of pentose sugars and acids that could serve as nutrients for industrial enzyme-producing microorganisms, especially filamentous fungi. However, the enzyme mixtures produced in such media are poorly defined. In this study, the secretome of Trichoderma reesei Rut C 30 grown either on a spent hydrolysate model medium (SHMM) or on a lactose-based standard medium (LBSM) was explored using proteomics. Results: Our results show that both the SHMM and LBSM serve as excellent growth media for T. reesei Rut C-30. In total, 52 protein spots on 2-D gels were identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC MS/MS). As expected, a considerable number of the identified proteins were related to the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. The enzyme production profiles in the two media were similar, but beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase were only produced in LBSM. The main cellobiohydrolases (Cel7A/Cel6A) and endoglucanases (Cel7B/Cel5A) were identified in both media and the cellobiohydrolases, i.e. Cel7A and Cel6A, were the most abundant cellulolytic enzymes. Moreover, both media can also serve as a potent inducer of xylanolytic enzymes. Several key enzymes involved in sugar assimilation and regulation of cellulase formation were identified, and were found to be differentially expressed in the two growth media. Conclusions: This study not only provides a catalogue of the prevalent proteins secreted by T. reesei in the two media, but the results also suggest that production of hydrolytic enzymes using unconventional carbon sources, such as components in spent hydrolysates, deserves further attention in the future.

However, little information is available about the monoterpene composition of the flowers and bracts. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analyses led to the identification of 15 monoterpenes in the essential oils of H. cordata accessions w01-39 [chemotype decanal (D)], w01-94 [chemotype myrcene (M)] and w01-100 (chemotype M). 13 to 14 monoterpenes were detected in the flowers of the three H. cordata accessions, respectively. 10 and 11 monoterpenes were found in the bracts of w01-94 and w01-100, respectively, while only 7 monoterpenes were observed in the bracts of w01-39. The contents of total monoterpenes in the flowers and bracts of chemotype D and M were all high (33.60 to 56.15%), while it only showed little variations (52.39 to 56.15%) in the flowers either within chemotype M or between chemotype D and M. Interestingly, although the leaves of w01-39 produced very low levels of monoterpenes, the flowers and bracts were rich in monoterpenes. Like leaves, both the flowers and bracts were dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons represented mainly by beta-myrcene and beta-phellandrene. It therefore concluded that both the flowers and bracts could prove to be a useful source of monoterpenes.	[Xu, Y.

Mitochondrial (mt) genomes provide a foundation for studying epidemiology and ecology of these parasites and therefore may be used to assist in the control of Baylisascariasis. Here, we determined the complete sequences of mtDNAs for Baylisascaris schroederi, Baylisascaris ailuri and Baylisascaris transfuga, with 14,778 bp, 14,657 bp and 14,898 bp in size, respectively. Each mtDNA encodes 12 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs, typical for other chromadorean nematodes. The gene arrangements for the three Baylisascaris species are the same as those of the Ascaridata species, but radically different from those of the Spirurida species. Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes from nine nematode species indicated that the three Baylisascaris species are more closely related to Ascaris suum than to the three Toxocara species (Toxocara canis, Toxocara cad and Toxocara malaysiensis) and Anisakis simplex, and that B. ailuri is more closely related to B. transfuga than to B. schroeder. The determination of the complete mt genome sequences for these three Baylisascaris species (the first members of the genus Baylisascaris ever sequenced) is of importance in refining the phylogenetic relationships within the order Ascaridida, and provides new molecular data for population genetic, systematic, epidemiological and ecological studies of parasitic nematodes of socio-economic importance in wildlife.

Additionally, the molecular mechanisms of myostatin in myofiber hyperplasia at the fetal stage in sheep remain unknown. Using the first specialized transcriptome-wide sheep oligo DNA microarray and histological methods, we investigated the gene expression profile and histological characteristics of developing fetal ovine longissimus muscle in Texel sheep (high muscle and low fat), as a myostatin model of natural mutation, and Ujumqin sheep (low muscle and high fat). Fetal skeletal muscles were sampled at 70, 85, 100, 120, and 135 d of gestation. Results: Myofiber number increased sharply with a pulsed-wave mode at certain developmental stages but was not augmented evenly across developmental stages in fetal sheep. The surges in myofiber hyperplasia occurred at 85 and 120 d in Texel sheep, whereas a unique proliferative surge appeared at 100 d in Ujumqin sheep. Analysis of the microarray demonstrated that immune and hematological systems' development and function, lipid metabolism, and cell communication were the biological functions that were most differentially expressed between Texel and Ujumqin sheep during muscle development. Pathways associated with myogenesis and the proliferation of myoblasts, such as calcium signaling, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 signaling, and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, were affected significantly at specific fetal stages, which underpinned fetal myofiber hyperplasia and postnatal muscle hypertrophy. Moreover, we identified some differentially expressed genes between the two breeds that could be potential myostatin targets for further investigation. Conclusions: Proliferation of myofibers proceeded in a pulsed-wave mode at particular fetal stages in the sheep. The myostatin mutation changed the gene expression pattern in skeletal muscle at a transcriptome-wide level, resulting in variation in myofiber phenotype between Texel and Ujumqin sheep during the second half of gestation. Our findings provide a novel and dynamic description of the effect of myostatin on skeletal muscle development, which contributes to understanding the biology of muscle development in large mammals.

Our results showed that: (1) Roegneria magnicaespes and Roegneria alashanica are related to Pseudoroegneria. (2) Roegneria elytrigioides has StStStSt genomes and should therefore be classified as Pseudoroegneria elytrigioides. (3) Pseudoroegneria tauri and Pseudoroegneria deweyi which have StStPP genomes should be transferred to Douglasdeweya and be renamed as Douglasdeweya wangii and Douglasdeweya deweyi, respectively. (4) Pseudoroegneria geniculata ssp. scythica is related to Pseudoroegneria and Lophyrum, and hence should be identified as a species of Trichopyrum. (5) Pseudoroegneria libanotica might be a parental donor for Elytrigia caespitosa rather than Elytrigia caespitosa ssp. nodosa.

Understanding of genetic diversity within Panicum genus will facilitate switchgrass breeding. Genetic relationships of 22 Panicum species from six continents including ninety-one USDA germplasm accessions were investigated by Sequence-Related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) and Expressed Sequence Tags-Simple Sequence Repeat (EST-SSR) markers. Eight hundred and twenty-six markers from 28 pairs of SRAP and 25 pairs of EST-SSR Primers were used to differentiate between accessions of a bulk of 25 genotypes. The results showed that there was high genetic diversity found in Panicum species. Most genetic variation was present among the different species and cluster analysis indicated that all the Panicum accessions could be distinguished by SRAP or EST-SSR. Dendrogram results reflected the phylogenetic relationships between Panicum species and Panicum amarum was found to be the closest species to switchgrass. Comparison between molecular markers revealed that SRAP methods were considered more efficient than EST-SSR for screening Panicum accessions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To estimate the phylogenetic relationship of the StH genome species in Triticeae, mitochondria COXII intron and chloroplast trnL-F sequences of 16 StH genome species were analyzed with those of four Pseudoroegneria species (St) and four Hordeum species (H). Sequence diversity and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) the trnL-F and COXII sequence may evolve faster in the polyploid species than in the diploids; (2) the COXII intron has a high evolutionary rate compared to trnL-F sequence and would provide potentially useful phylogenetic analysis in the StH genome species; (3) different Pseudoroegneria species might serve as the maternal donor during the polyploid speciation of the StH genome species; (4) phylogenetic relationships of the StH genome species may be not linked with the inter-continental disjunction between Eurasian and North American.

Wheat tetrameric alpha-amylase inhibitor (WTAI) is a mixture (60 kDa) of 3 units: WTAI-CM2 plus 2 WTAI-CM3 plus WTAI-CM16, where none of the subunits is active on its own. A total of 334 gene sequences were obtained from 14 populations (131 accessions= genotypes) of wild emmer wheat. The frequencies of SNPs in WTAI-CM2, WTAI-CM3 and WTAI-CM16 were 1 out of 87.6, 101.4, and 108.0 bases, where 5, 5 and 4 SNPs were detected in the coding sequence, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of each unit of tetrameric alpha-amylase inhibitors were much more conserved than that of dimeric or monomeric inhibitors. The wild emmer wheat populations showed diversity on three WTAI loci, both between and within populations. It was revealed that WTAI were naturally selected for across populations by a ratio of dN/dS as expected. The results of purifying and positive selection hypothesis (p < 0.05) also showed that the sequences of WTAI were contributed by natural selection, which ensures the protein function conservation as well as the inhibition diversity with insects amylase enzyme. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs. Ecological factors have an important evolutionary role in gene differentiation at these loci, and tetrameric alpha-amylase inhibitors are obviously adaptively selected under different environments.

Therefore, accuracy in determining paternity is of vital importance for managing captive populations and in selecting representative individuals of known genetic characteristics for release. In this study, we established a fast and effective method to conduct paternity testing for captive giant pandas in the Wolong population. This technique uses two highly polymorphic microsatellites initially, subsequent use of five less polymorphic markers and then paternity exclusion testing carried out using the giant panda paternity exclusion program we have developed. Our results revealed that (1) both sets of markers successfully identified the real fathers in 25 cases of paternity testing and (2) the success rate of paternity exclusion varied with the degree of polymorphism of the markers used. Subsequently, we conducted correlation analysis between the success rates of paternity identification with these markers, parameters of genetic diversity and tests of neutrality. We found that the paternity exclusion power of microsatellites was significantly correlated with the number of alleles (Na), expected heterozygosity (H (E)) and observed homozygosity statistic (F (O)) (all P < 0.05). From this, we developed a new variable, NaxH (E)/F (O), showing a highly significant positive correlation with the resolution power of microsatellites (P = 0.001). Moreover, the first two highly polymorphic loci gave a 100% success rate of excluding non-paternal males because they yielded higher values of NaxH (E)/F (O) than the other five less polymorphic markers. Thus, the NaxH (E)/F (O) parameter appears suitable to serve as a criterion for selecting microsatellite markers, which could be used for high-resolution molecular techniques of paternity determination among a range of captive animals besides giant pandas.

A conservation project of gene resources for an endangered species first involves the preservation of organs, tissues, gametes, genomic DNA libraries and cell lines. The present study is the first to establish and cryopreserve cell lines of liver, heart and muscle tissues from the Chinese alligator. The study revealed that there was a large discrepancy in cell migration time in primary cultures among liver (11-12 d), heart (13-14 d) and muscle (17-18 d) tissue pieces. The differences in time in primary cell culture suggested that it was relatively easy to build visceral-derived cell lines for reptiles. Biological analysis showed that the population doubling time for thawed cells was approximately 36 h. Karyotyping revealed that the frequency of Chinese alligator cells showing chromosome number as 2n=32 was 88.6%-93.4%. Chinese alligator cell lines established here provide a vital resource for research and are likely to be useful for protection of this rare and critically endangered species. Furthermore, the establishment of these methods may supply technical and theoretical support for preserving genetic resources at the cellular level for other reptile species.

Evaluation of the Ability of GroBiotic (R)-A to Enhance Growth, Muscle Composition, Immune Responses, and Resistance Against Aeromonas hydrophila in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article							TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; DRUM SCIAENOPS-OCELLATUS; SALVELINUS-ALPINUS L.; X MORONE-SAXATILIS; YEAST-CELL-WALL; RAINBOW-TROUT; BREWERS-YEAST; GOLDEN SHINERS; ARCTIC CHARR; IMMUNOSTIMULANTS	This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of graded levels of GroBiotic (R)-A to improve performance of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, fed a 29% crude protein (CP) diet. A 29% CP diet was formulated and supplemented with 0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2% GroBiotic (R)-A and compared to performance of fish fed a 33% CP diet. Enhanced weight gain and feed efficiency were generally observed in fish fed the diets supplemented with GroBiotic (R)-A compared to the 29% CP diet. No significant differences in these responses were observed between fish fed diets supplemented with GroBiotic (R)-A compared to those fed the 33% CP diet. Supplementation of 0.8 and 1.2% GroBiotic (R)-A induced significantly lower condition factor and hepatosomatic index compared to fish fed the 29% CP diet, but those values were similar to that of fish fed the 33% CP diet. GroBiotic (R)-A supplementation and protein reduction had no effect on the viscerosomatic index of fish or moisture, lipid, and protein content of muscle samples. However, muscle ash increased significantly with protein reduction (29% CP diet), but GroBiotic (R)-A supplementation (0.8 and 1.2%) reduced muscle ash content. Activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were markedly reduced in fish fed GroBiotic (R)-A (0.8 and 1.2%) compared to those fed the control diet. GroBiotic (R)-A supplementation also induced significantly higher neutrophil oxidative radical production compared to fish fed the 29% CP diet, but no significant difference was observed in comparison with the 33% CP diet. After 8 wk of feeding, exposure to Aeromonas hydrophila for 3 wk resulted in 40% (0.4, 0.8% GroBiotic (R)-A) and 27% (1.2% GroBiotic (R)-A) mortality and reduced signs of disease, while 47% mortality was observed in fish fed the 29% CP diet. Based on the result of this study, it is concluded that 0.8 and 1.2% GroBiotic (R)-A positively influenced growth performance and feed efficiency of tilapia fed diets containing 29% crude protein to levels comparable to fish fed the 33% CP diet. GroBiotic (R)-A supplementation also significantly increased neutrophil oxidative radical production as well as resistance to Ae. hydrophila infection.	[Zheng, Z. L.; Wang, K.

G. Don is a plant species known for its production of a variety of terpenoid indole alkaloids, many of which have pharmacological activities. Production of catharanthine in cell cultures or in hairy roots established by transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes is of interest because catharanthine can be chemically coupled to the abundant leaf alkaloid vindoline to form the valuable anticancer drug vinblastine. Here, we observed a high amount of catharanthine in hairy roots of C. roseus, established by infecting leaf explants with the A. rhizogenes > agropine-type A4 strain carrying plasmid pRi. T-DNA transfer from plasmid pRi into hairy roots was confirmed by PCR for the essential T-DNA genes rolA and rolB and the agropine synthesis gene ags. The results suggest that integration of T-DNA into the plant DNA plays a positive role on the catharanthine pathway in C. roseus hairy roots. Furthermore, co-transformation with the soybean transcription factor GmMYBZ2 indicated that GmMYBZ2 reduces the catharanthine production by alteration of expression of a number of genes linked to the pathway. Transcription levels of the zinc-finger transcription factor 1 gene ZCT1 were high, and the transcription levels of the anthranilate synthase gene AS alpha, the strictosidine synthase gene STR, and the key transcription factor gene octadecanoid-responsive Catharanthus APETALA2/ethylene response factor were low. In addition, GmMYBZ2 had a negative effect on the gene expression levels of A-type cyclin CYSA and B-type cyclin CYSB, which was correlated with a reduced growth rate of the hairy roots.

External characteristics were observed by using the immunofluorescence technique, and growth curve of duck embryonic myoblasts was established after measuring with the MTT method. Moreover, mRNA expression of three marker genes, the Desmin, the muscle creatine kinase (Mck) and the troponin C (Tnnc), which could reflect the development status of myofibers, were detected each 24 h for cultured cells by using the qPCR technique. Results showed that the in vitro cultured duck myoblasts went through a series of developmental stages, including the proliferation of myoblasts, the differentiation of multi-nuclei myotubes, and the formation of myofiber. The cultured duck embryonic myoblasts entered into a logarithmic stage approximately on the fourth day after seeding. Accompanying with its progressive growth before entering into the logarithmic phase, the myoblasts also showed some differentiation phenomena, reflected by a low expression level of Desmin and high expression level of the Mck and Tnnc genes. During the rapid growth of the logarithmic phase, there was a high expression of the Desmin gene, and a low expression level of the Mck gene and the Tnnc gene in the cultured myoblasts. The expression profiles of the three marker genes for muscle development could be used for distinguishing the different developmental stages of in vitro cultured myoblasts at the molecular level, which would be more accurate and more feasible than observing the external characteristics of the cultured cells.

Evaluation of endogenous control genes for gene expression studies across multiple tissues and in the specific sets of fat- and muscle-type samples of the pig	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS			English	Article						Endogenous control gene; housekeeping gene; normalization; pig; quantitative real-time PCR	QUANTITATIVE RT-PCR; REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION PCR; INTERNAL CONTROL; VALIDATION; NORMALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; RNA; QUANTIFICATION; SELECTION	To normalize a set of quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) data, it is essential to determine an optimal number/set of housekeeping genes, as the abundance of housekeeping genes can vary across tissues or cells during different developmental stages, or even under certain environmental conditions. In this study, of the 20 commonly used endogenous control genes, 13, 18 and 17 genes exhibited credible stability in 56 different tissues, 10 types of adipose tissue and five types of muscle tissue, respectively. Our analysis clearly showed that three optimal housekeeping genes are adequate for an accurate normalization, which correlated well with the theoretical optimal number (r >= 0.94). In terms of economical and experimental feasibility, we recommend the use of the three most stable housekeeping genes for calculating the normalization factor. Based on our results, the three most stable housekeeping genes in all analysed samples (TOP2B, HSPCB and YWHAZ) are recommended for accurate normalization of q-PCR data. We also suggest that two different sets of housekeeping genes are appropriate for 10 types of adipose tissue (the HSPCB, ALDOA and GAPDH genes) and five types of muscle tissue (the TOP2B, HSPCB and YWHAZ genes), respectively. Our report will serve as a valuable reference for other studies aimed at measuring tissue-specific mRNA abundance in porcine samples.	[Gu, Y. R.; Li, M. Z.; Zhang, K.; Jiang, A. A.; Li, X.

Fine mapping of a male sterility gene, vr1, on chromosome 4 in rice	MOLECULAR BREEDING			English	Article						Male sterility; Molecular maker; Fine mapping; Rice	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; PROTEIN; MEIOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; ENCODES; FAMILY; DEFECT	xs1 is a male sterile rice mutant derived from a spontaneous mutation. Pollen development in the xs1 mutant proceeds normally until the vacuolation stage, at which time xs1 pollen fails to vacuolate and no viable pollen is produced. Genetic analysis indicates that the xs1 mutant phenotype is controlled by a single recessive gene, designated vacuolation retardation 1 (vr1), which was mapped to rice chromosome 4. In order to fine-map the vr1 locus, two large mapping populations were generated and several SSR and InDel markers were developed from publicly available rice genomic sequences. By employing a strategy of chromosome-walking, the vr1 gene was finally located within a genetic interval of 0.27 cM, flanked by the markers FID30 and FS15, with distances of 0.11 and 0.16 cM, respectively, and co-segregating with the marker FC4-2. Based on the japonica rice genome sequence, the vr1 locus is estimated to cover a 48-kb region containing eight putative genes. Our results will facilitate the cloning and functional characterization of the vr1 gene.	[Li, S. C.; Wang, S. Q.; Zheng, A. P.; Deng, Q. M.; Liu, H. N.; Wang, L.

Dietary treatments included the corn-soybean meal-based diet (control) and the basal diet supplemented with 60, 120, or 180 mg of Zn/kg as ZnSO(4), Zn amino acid A, Zn proteinate B, or Zn proteinate A. The results showed that birds fed diets supplemented with Zn had higher ADFI, ADG, and percentage of eviscerated yield than birds fed the control diet. Supplemental Zn significantly increased the redness value in breast muscle and pH values in thigh muscle, decreased shear force in thigh muscle, and decreased drip loss in breast and thigh muscle. The DM and intramuscular fat contents of the breast muscle in broilers fed diets with supplemental Zn were higher than those of the control. Results from this study indicated that Zn could promote growth and improve production performance of broilers independent of Zn source.	[Liu, Z. H.; Zhang, K.

Polymorphism of GDF9 gene and its association with litter size in goats	VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Goat; Prolificacy; Growth differentiation factor 9 gene; PCR-SSCP	GROWTH-DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR-9; SHEEP; BMP15	Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) was studied as a candidate gene for high prolificacy in goats. The polymorphism of exon 1 and flanking of GDF9 gene was detected by PCR-SSCP in five goat breeds with different prolificacy. Three genotypes (AA, AB and BB) were detected in goat breeds joined and two silent mutations (c.183A > C and c.336C > T) were identified in comparison genotype AA with genotype BB. Heterozygous genotype AB and wild type BB were detected in all five goat breeds and homozygous genotype AA was only detected in Jining Grey goats. The frequencies of genotypes AA, AB and BB were 0.18, 0.42 and 0.40 in Jining Grey goats, respectively. The genotype distribution was different (P < 0.01) between high prolificacy breed (Jining Grey goat) and low prolificacy breeds (Boer, Wendeng Dairy, Liaoning Cashmere and Beijing native goats). The Jining Grey goat does with genotype AA and AB had 0.72 (P < 0.01) and 0.56 (P < 0.01) kids more than those with genotype BB, respectively. The does with genotype AA had 0.16 (P > 0.05) kids more than those with genotype AB. These indicated that the allele A may have certain correlation with prolificacy in Jining Grey goats.	[Chu, M.

Per cent weight gain (PWG) significantly increased with increasing levels of MHA up to a point (P < 0.05), and thereafter declined. Feed efficiency was the highest when MHA level was at 5.1 g kg(-1) diet. Feed intake (FI) significantly enhanced with dietary MHA level up to a point (P < 0.05), beyond which it plateaued. Patterns of differences in protein production value, lipid production value, intestosomatic index, folds height, lipase, chymotrypsin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, creatinekinase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities were the same as that in PWG, whereas the trend of plasma ammonia content was opposite. Hepatopancreas protein content, trypsin and amylase activities followed the same trend as that of FI. The optimal supplemental level of MHA for fish meal and miscellaneous meals-based diet (6.9 g methionine kg(-1) diet) for PWG was 8.2 g kg(-1) diet by the quadratic regression analysis.

We compared species richness (S), plant diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, H'; Margalef index, R), and above- and below-ground ecosystem carbon (C) pools of six plant communities along a chronosequence of vegetation restoration, and we also examined evidence for a functional relationship between plant diversity and C storage. Our results showed that above-ground C increased significantly (over 52-fold), mainly due to the increase of C in aboveground living plants and surface litter. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased from the herb community type (dominated by Deyeuxia scabrescens, P1) to mixed forest type (dominated by Betula spp. and Abies faxoniana, P4), which constituted the main C pool of the system (63-89%), but decreased thereafter (communities P5-P6). The mean C stock in the whole ecosystem - trees, litter layer and mineral soil - ranged from 105 to 730 Mg C ha(-1) and was especially high in the spruce forest community type (dominated by Picea purpurea, P6). On the other hand, the relationships between C stocks (soil, aboveground) and mean annual temperature or altitude were generally weak (P > 0.05). Moreover, we did not detect a relationship between S and aboveground C storage, while we found a significant negative relationship between H', R and aboveground C storage. In addition, our experiment demonstrated that total root biomass and litter C/N ratio were significant functional traits influencing SOC. while S, R, and H' had little effect. Path analysis also revealed that litter C/N ratio predominantly regulated SOC through changes in the quantity of microorganisms and soil invertase enzyme activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Three Saanen first lactation dairy goats were surgically fitted with indwelling catheters in the portal vein, the mesenteric vein and carotid, and were kept in thermal-neutral and then heat stress environment, for examining the effect of heat stress on endotoxin absorption and redox status. Average net absorption of endotoxin (EU/h) across mesenteric-drained viscera (MDV) and portal-drained viscera (PDV) during the whole period of heat stress increased by 279.05% and 227.92% in relation to thermo-neutral period. Plasma concentration of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) in mesenteric and portal vein, and that of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in mesenteric vein, increased significantly during heat stress. Main conclusions were: (i) net absorption of endotoxin in portal vein is mainly from non-mesenteric tissues both in heat stress and in thermo-neutral condition; (ii) heat stress may lead to the significant decrease in plasma SOD, GSH-Px, CAT flux across PDV and MDV, and the significant increase in endotoxin flux across PDV and MDV; and (iii) the increase in gastrointestinal permeability in dairy goats during heat stress may not be induced by the increase in oxidative stress.

One hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were randomly assigned to two groups of 60 each and were fed on a low Se diet (0.0342 mg/kg Se) or a control diet (0.2 mg/kg Se), respectively. The relative weight of thymus was significantly decreased in low Se group from 21 days of age in time-dependent manner when compared with that of control group. Histopathologically, lymphopenia in the cortex and medulla of thymus was observed in low Se group. In comparison with those of control group, the percentage of Annexin-V positive cells was increased, and the percentages of CD3(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells of the peripheral blood were decreased in low Se group, as measured by flow cytometry. These data suggested that low dietary Se induced histological lesions of thymus, increased apoptosis of thymic cells, and decreased T cell subsets. The cellular immune function was finally impaired in broilers.

The cDNA of caprine CAST gene was amplified for the first time using RACE-PCR. Results showed the full-length cDNA of caprine CAST gene (Accession no. GU944861) was 2435 base pair (bp) and contained a 2187 bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 728 amino acid residues. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that caprine CAST cDNA was 89.8-95.4, 83.5-92.2, 72.8-81.8 and 69.8-73.5% identical to sheep, cattle, pig and human CAST cDNA. It was predicted that caprine CAST contained four conserved domains with 42 serine phosphorylation loci, 18 threonine phosphorylation loci, 1 tyrosine phosphorylation locus and 5 specific PKC phosphorylation loci. This work provided an important experimental basis for further research on the function of CAST in goat.

Maternal folic acid supplementation was administered in gilt diets to test whether hepatic mRNA expressions of some important genes induced by IUGR could be rescued by folic acid supplementation. Thirty-two Yorkshire gilts were allotted to two treatment groups of control (C folic acid 1.3 mg/kg) or folic acid supplementation (FS folic acid 30 mg/kg) after mating, to study the effects of maternal folic acid supplementation on the mRNA expression of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1), peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR gamma), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), obesity receptor (ob-R) and Acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) in the liver of IUGR and NBW piglets. Blood and liver samples were collected for determinations of serum folic acid and gene expressions. The total number of born piglets, number of piglets born alive, average birth weight and 21 days average weight were not affected by dietary treatment (P > 0.05), and serum folic acid concentration of piglets was greater in FS than C groups (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR indicated that gene expression of MAT1A, MAT2A and DNMT1 were lower in IUGR piglets but could be elevated by maternal folic acid supplementation. Transcript expression levels of PPAR gamma, GR and AOX were higher in IUGR piglets, but were decreased to the level of normal piglets by maternal folic acid supplementation. Our results suggested that maternal folic acid supplementation be an effective way to rescue the gene expressions negatively induced by IUGR.

In order to discover new stress-tolerance genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we analyzed a global genome expression profiling of the indica cultivar Pei'ai 64S, using Affymetrix rice expression chip, subjected to cold, drought or heat stress. A large number of genes highly up regulated or down regulated were identified under the stresses. One of these genes, O. sativa L. protein phosphatase2C-l (OsPP2C1), was highly induced in leaf and panicle at the heading and flowering stages, in response to all stresses. The expression profile of OsPP2C1 obtained by the microarray analysis was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The two sets of data matched very well, suggesting that OsPP2C1 is a multiple stresses responsive gene in rice. In order to study its function in stress tolerance, the cDNA of the gene was cloned by reverse transcription (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis showed that there is 3bp discrepancy between the cDNA of japonica and indica group. Deduced protein from OsPP2C1 cDNA has molecular weight about 37.6 kD and isoelectric points about 6.16. Analysis of the putative promoter regions showed that there were about 10 kinds of stress induced by cis-acting elements. Based on the mentioned analyses and results obtained, we propose that OsPP2C1 is a novel candidate gene involved in stress tolerance in rice.

The glutaminase activity, diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, cell peoliferation, apoptosis, and perotein metabolism were measured by the tissue culture method in vitro using jejunal tissues. The immunohistochemical method was used to study the cell proliferation and apoptosis of jejunal tissues. The results showed that compared to the blank control, the percentage and MOD value of BrdU-positicve cells incubated with glycyl-glutamine dipeptide solution were significantly (P<0.05) increased. Accordingly, the percentage and MOD value of caspase-3-positive cells from tissue incubated with glycyl-glutamine dipeptide were notably lower (P<0.05) than that from the control treatment. The glycyl-glutamine dipeptide increased the glutaminase activity, DAO activity and protein content of jejunal tissues, as the dipeptide concentration was on the rise (P<0.05). These results indicated that glycylglutamine dipeptide affected the jejunum development and adaptation of weaned piglets, and the function might be fulfilled by enhancing the glutamine-related enzyme activity, thereby increasing the consumption of glutamine, and then improving the jejunal cell proliferation and suppressing cell apoptosis. The effects of glycyl-glutamine dipeptide relied in a dose-dependent manner, and the maximum effect was achieved at 20-30 mmol L(-1) glycyl-glutamine dipeptide.

Finding diverse sources of stripe rust resistance is critical for increasing genetic diversity of resistance for wheat breeding programs. Stripe rust resistance was identified in the alien species Psathyrostachys huashanica, and a wheat- P. huashanica amphiploid line (PHWSA) with stripe rust resistance was reported previously. In this study, a P. huashanica 3Ns monosomic addition line (PW11) with superior resistance to stripe rust was developed, which was derived from the cross between PHW-SA and wheat J-11. We evaluated the alien introgressions PW11-2, PW11-5 and PW11-8 which were derived from line PW11 for reaction to new Pst race CYR32, and used molecular and cytogenetic tools to characterize these lines. The introgressions were remarkably resistant to CYR32, suggesting that the resistance to stripe rust of the introgressions thus was controlled by gene(s) located on P. huashanica chromosome 3Ns. All derived lines were cytologically stable in term of meiotic chromosome behavior. Two 3Ns chromosomes of P. huashanica were detected in the disomic addition line PW11-2. Chromosomes 1B of substitution line PW11-5 had been replaced by a pair of P. huashanica 3Ns chromosomes. In PW11-8, a small terminal segment from P. huashanica chromosome arm 3NsS was translocated to the terminal region of wheat chromosomes 3BL. Thus, this translocated chromosome is designated T3BL-3NsS. These conclusions were further confirmed by SSR analyses. Two 3Ns-specific markers Xgwm181 and Xgwm161 will be useful to rapidly identify and trace the translocated fragments. These introgressions, which had significant characteristics of resistance to stripe rust, could be utilized as novel germplasms for wheat breeding.

In the current study, morphological and molecular characteristics were studied in 18 taxa of Salvia. A coefficient of variation was based on 18 morphological traits ranging from 17.56 to 115.04%. Among 70 random primers examined, 27 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers produced 248 extending and repeatable bands, of which 207 bands (83.47%) were polymorphic. All of the data revealed abundant genetic diversity in the genus of Salvia. 18 taxa were clustered into five groups based on the morphological markers or four groups based on RAPD markers. The results showed that there was slighter genetic diversity and narrower genetic backgrounds at the intra-specific level, and that we can easily distinguish S. miltiorrhiza from the rest of Salvia species by two ways. The differences of the two dendrograms might be introduced by many reasons, such as the gene expression, environment, and gene introgressions. However, Mantel's test indicated correction (r = 0.483) of morphological traits and RAPD markers.	[Wang, M.; Li, J.; Zhang, L.; Yang, R. W.; Ding, C.

A method has been developed to determine the five fatty acid components-palmitoleic acid (I), linoleic acid(II), oleic acid(III), hexadecanoic acid (IV) and stearic acid(V) in fungus Phellinus sp. using high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode-array (HPLC-PDA) ultraviolet detection system. The information about the fatty acid constituents of Phellinus sp. is necessary for further research and development of this resource. This analysis was carried on a column of Kromasil C18 (250 mmx4.6 mm, 5 mu m) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and 5% CTAB water (95:5, v/v). The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min and the detector wavelength was set at 242 nm. Calibration curve showed good linearity with correlation coefficients (r) more than 0.9994. Average recoveries of the four compounds were more than 97% and relative standard deviations were less than 1.6%. This method appeared to be stable, sensitive and reproducible for determination of the five fatty acid compounds in fungus Phellinus sp..

HW08, explore preliminarily metabolites and deduce the metabolic pathway. Using 1000 mg.l(-1) SW as the sole carbon source, MSM containing five transformants at a proportion for 1:1(V:V) was incubated at 30 degrees C, 180 r.min(-1). The degradation rate of SW was 99.78% in 48 h, and SW could be completely degraded in 72 h. Compared with samples containing SW in 0 h, two special spots of metabolites were visualized with iodine vapor by TLC. Two kinds of primary metabolites (stearic acid and palmitinic acid) and two kinds of intermediate metabolites appeared in the process of metabolism of SW by GC and GC-MS whose m/z was 388.2 and 314.3 amu respectively. Ultimately, four kinds of end-products appeared in the process of metabolism of SW. This work demonstrates the preliminary results on metabolites of degrading SW by five transformants from Arthrobacter sp. HW08. This work also provides further information on metabolic pathway of SW from strain HW08.

Jian) were assessed. A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp with an average initial weight of 7.94 +/- 0.03 g were fed six semi-purified diets containing 165 (unsupplemented control group), 310, 607, 896, 1167 and 1820 mg choline kg(-1) diet for 65 days. Specific growth rate (SGR), feed intake, feed efficiency, protein retention value, protein content and lipid content of fish carcasses were significantly improved by dietary choline supplementation; whereas, protein efficiency ratio and body ash content were not significantly different among dietary groups. Patterns of differences in intestine length, relative gut length, intestine weight, hepatopancreas protein content, intestinal folds height in three intestinal segments, trypsin and chymotrypsin activities in intestine and hepatopancreas, alpha-amylase and creatine kinase activities in intestine, Na+/K+-ATPase activity in distal intestine and relative expression of TOR gene in distal intestine and 4E-BP2 gene in muscle responded similar to SGR; whereas, the trends of hepatosomatic index, lipase activity in intestine and hepatopancreas, Na+/K+-ATPase activity in proximal intestine and mid intestine, TOR gene expression in muscle and hepatopancreas, and 4E-BP2 gene expression in proximal intestine, mid intestine and distal intestine were opposite. Alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities in intestinal segments were not significantly different among dietary groups. These results indicated that dietary choline could improve fish growth, enhance digestive and absorptive ability and regulate TOR and 4E-BP2 gene expression in tissues. The dietary choline requirement of Jian carp estimated by the broken-line model based on SGR was 566 mg choline kg(-1) diet in the form of choline chloride. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

COLEOPTERA; HOST; IDENTIFICATION; ATTRACTANTS; COMPONENTS; ODOR	To screen the composite components of the plant volatiles that effectively attract Batocera horsfieldi (Hope) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) adults, GC-MS (Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry) was used to analyze and identify the type and relative content of the volatiles of the host plants of B. horsfieldi adults: Viburnum awabuki K., Betula luminifera H. Winkl, Juglans regia L. and Populus tomentosa Carr. We measured the EAG (Electro-antennogram) responses of the different antennal segments of unmated female and male B. horsfieldi adults to seven host plant volatiles (beta-myrcene, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, nonanal, dichloromethyl ether, salicyaldehyde, 3-methyl-butanoic acid and trichloroethylene) and to their composite components. A Y-tube olfactometer was used to test the insects' behavioral responses. The results of GC-MS showed that the four host plants of B. horsfieldi had different chemical fingerprints. The EAG test results showed that the responses in the apical part of the unmated female and male B. horsfieldi antennae were stronger than those in the middle part and basal part (P < 0.01). For the seven volatiles, with five different concentrations (of 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2 mu L/mu L), the unmated female B. horsfieldi had the strongest EAG responses to 3-methylbutyric acid of 0.0001 mu L/mu L and the unmated female and male B. horsfieldi had increasing EAG responses to salicyaldehyde after the concentration reached 0.1 mu L/mu L. Among the five composite components of plant volatiles, the one mixed according to a ratio of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol: nominal: trichloroethylene: beta-myrcene (Z:N:T:M) = 57:15:17:11 caused the strongest EAG response, and that response was distinctly higher than for the other four composite components (P < 0.01). The behavioral response results tested by Y-tube olfactometer were in accordance with the EAG response results. The composite component mixed according to the ratio of Z:N:T:M = 57:15:17:11 had a stronger attractive effect for the unmated female and male B. horsfieldi adults.

A total of 1,800 25-week-old Lohman pink-shell hens were randomly assigned to four dietary vitamin treatments as follows: NRC(1994) level, NRC (1994) level with Hy.D(R) (25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol), Local level (current average industry level in China) and OVN(R) level (optimum vitamin nutrition level), with 10 replicates per treatment and 45 layers per replicate. Hens were housed in commercial laying cages with three birds per cage and given ad libitum access to feed. Results showed the hens that received the fortified vitamin levels in the OVN(R) treatment had a significantly (p<0.05) lower number of cracked (.47%) and dirty eggs (.27%), and increased egg deposition of vitamin B(12), folic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, 25-OH-D(3), vitamin E, vitamin B,, biotin and pantothenate (p<0.05). Treatments had no significant effect on egg-shape index, egg specific gravity, Haugh units and eggshell thickness. Hens fed the NRC-Hy.D(R) combination also experienced a significant decrease in cracked and dirty eggs (.70% and .44%, respectively) and an increased deposition of 25-OH-D(3) in comparison with the NRC treatment. Results of the present study suggest that that the Local treatment was able to improve egg quality parameters of laying hens, but resulted in more cracked and dirty eggs. OVN(R) reduced the number of cracked eggs and dirty eggs, and improved the deposition of several vitamins in eggs. With the addition of Hy.D(R), eggshell strength and 25-OH-D(3) deposition in eggs were also improved, and cracked and dirty egg rates declined.

NO. 25; CHLOROPLAST DIVISION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; NUCLEAR ACCUMULATION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; CELL ELONGATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; LIGHT	FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and its homolog FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1), two transposase-derived transcription factors, are key components in phytochrome A signaling and the circadian clock. Here, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation-based sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify 1559 and 1009 FHY3 direct target genes in darkness (D) and far-red (FR) light conditions, respectively, in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. FHY3 preferentially binds to promoters through the FHY3/FAR1 binding motif (CACGCGC). Interestingly, FHY3 also binds to two motifs in the 178-bp Arabidopsis centromeric repeats. Comparison between the ChIP-seq and microarray data indicates that FHY3 quickly regulates the expression of 197 and 86 genes in D and FR, respectively. FHY3 also coregulates a number of common target genes with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE5 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5. Moreover, we uncover a role for FHY3 in controlling chloroplast development by directly activating the expression of ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS5, whose product is a structural component of the latter stages of chloroplast division in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our data suggest that FHY3 regulates multiple facets of plant development, thus providing insights into its functions beyond light and circadian pathways.

Empirical models accounting for the key influential factors were constructed. Ordinary Least Square Regression (OLS) analysis of the official data of China for the year 1985-2007 permitted the relationship between individual energy consumption components and the corresponding coefficients to be investigated. The results showed that (1) the Unit Energy Consumption by Primary Industry (UECPI), Secondary Industry (UECSI), and Tertiary Industry (UECTI) demonstrated an inverse relationship with Gross Domestic Product (GDP): (2) a linear relationship exists between the Energy Consumption by Nonmaterial Production (ECNP) and GDP; (3) the hypotheses that there is an inverse S-shaped relationship between Unit Energy Consumption by Household (UECH) and Personal Income (PI) is valid. Based on the above findings and an analysis of China's energy policies, suggestions on China's energy policy were given in the end. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M., Xiang, K., Zhu, X., Baum, B. R. and Molnar, S. J. 2011. Genetic diversity analysis of 119 Canadian maize inbred lines based on pedigree and simple sequence repeat markers. Can. J. Plant Sci. 91: 651-661. Since the early 1920s Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has been developing maize varieties and inbred lines adapted to the early maize growing regions. These inbreds represent a large group of genetically diverse genotypes; however, many of the inbreds are of unknown heterotic backgrounds. The purpose of this study was to classify 119 elite maize inbred lines released from AAFC into heterotic groups using both pedigree data and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and also to explore the consistency among different classification analyses. Pedigree analysis placed the inbred lines into eight groups, six of which corresponded to known major heterotic groups representing Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS), European flint, Lancaster, Minnesota 13, Early Butler, and Iodent; the two remaining groups consisted of germplasm derived mostly from Pioneer 3990 or Pioneer 3994 sources. Simple sequence repeat analysis of 105 loci resulted in a clustering of the inbreds into 10 groups. In comparison with the grouping based on pedigree, the SSR clustering groups had some discrepancies and groups of genetically similar germplasm, based on pedigree, could not always be confirmed with molecular markers. The results of this study will allow researchers and maize breeders to make more informed decisions on the use of these inbreds in breeding programs.	[Reid, L. M.; Zhu, X.; Baum, B. R.; Molnar, S.

Considering the fact that egg weight and egg quality were largely affected by the vitamin A levels in chicken, we investigated the genetic polymorphism of CRBP2 gene and the association with egg production traits among 349 Erlang Mountainous Chickens in this study. In the coding sequence (408 bp) of four exons, we only detected one nucleotide substitution (c.349T>C) in the third exon, which caused amino acid change (p.117Y>H). The frequencies of three genotypes were 52.43% (TT), 42.41% (TC), and 5.16% (CC), respectively. Among the six studied traits, the age at first egg (AFE), total number of eggs with 300 age (EN), and average egg-laying interval (AEI) differed significantly among genotypes. The CC genotype would be genetically advantageous to improve egg production traits in Erlang Mountainous Chicken. The evolutionary conservation analysis revealed that the p.117Y>H site was high conservative in mammals, which potentially confirm the important biological function of this mutation. To our knowledge, this is first report to study the genetic polymorphism of CRBP2 gene and association with egg production traits in chicken.

Besides its slow agamic propagation, problems of browning and non-dedifferentiation have prevented the application of micro-propagation in H. cordata. Through 4 week pre-culture in darkness and wounding after 1 week pre-culture, the browning rate of leaf explants decreased significantly and resulted in efficient regeneration (20.64 +/- 5.94 adventitious buds per explant) on the induction medium.

Traditional theory suggests that the presence of a nucleus would prevent big nucleated erythrocytes to squeeze through these small capillaries. However, nucleus is too small to hinder erythrocyte deformation. And, there is no sound reason to abandon mitochondria for the living cells. Here, we found that mammal erythrocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels kept stable under diabetes, ischemia reperfusion, and malaria conditions or in vitro sugar/heme treatments, whereas bird erythrocyte ROS levels increased dramatically in these circumstances. Nuclear and mitochondrial extrusion may help mammal erythrocytes to better adapt to high-sugar and high-heme conditions by limiting ROS generation.

This study examined the effect of three dietary Trp levels (0.25%, 0.35%, and 0.5%) on the immunity and reproduction of PRV-challenged pregnant mice. PRV challenge resulted in decreased live embryo numbers, live litter sizes, and serum progesterone and interleukin (IL)-10 concentrations, but increased the levels of serum immunoglobulins (Igs) (PRV-specific antibody [IgG, IgA, and IgM]) and IL-1 beta. Live embryo numbers, live litter sizes, serum progesterone concentration, and IgG and PRV-specific antibody levels on day 9 of pregnancy were all increased dose-dependently by Trp inclusion in the diet of PRV-challenged mice. Increased Trp levels in PRV-challenged mice promoted the up-regulation of uterine and embryonic indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression, but attenuated the up-regulation of uterine and embryonic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR9 expression and increased serum interferon-gamma concentration. Collectively, Trp supplements might improve reproductive performance of PRV-challenged pregnant mice by down-regulating TLR expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, by up-regulating PRV-specific antibody and immunoglobulin synthesis, and by elevating the concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines and progesterone.

Transcriptional analysis revealed that it is mainly expressed in endosperm and is induced by abscisic acid (ABA). The 5'-flanking region of zsS3a was isolated, and a 1772 bp zsS3a promoter (PzsS3a) was fused to a Luc reporter gene with a maize Adh1 intron. Transient expression assay by bombardment transformation showed that, although the addition of the Adh1 intron enhanced the promoter activity approx. 52-fold, it did not alter the promoter specificity. PzsS3a with the Adh1 intron drove the Luc gene preferentially and it was highly expressed in the endosperm relative to the embryo but not in the leaf or root. Furthermore, the promoter activity in the endosperm was enhanced four fold by 100 mM ABA.

First Report of a Ranavirus Associated with Morbidity and Mortality in Farmed Chinese Giant Salamanders (Andrias davidianus)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Andrias davidianus; Chinese giant salamander; iridovirus; pathology; ranavirus	MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; AMBYSTOMA-TIGRINUM; RANA-CATESBEIANA; TIGER SALAMANDER; IRIDOVIRUS; USA; TENNESSEE; INFECTION; PATHOGEN; OUTBREAK	From February to May 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders (Andrias davidianus) in lianzhong County, Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymoses and swollen areas on the head and limbs, and skin ulceration. The aim of this study was to determine the cause of this disease. Necropsy examination revealed subcutaneous and intramuscular oedema, swollen and pale livers with multifocal haemorrhage, swollen kidneys with multifocal haemorrhage and distended fluid-filled intestines with areas of haemorrhage. Light microscopy revealed intracytoplasmic inclusions suggestive of a viral infection in a variety of organs, as well as degeneration and necrosis of these organs. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of the same tissues revealed iridovirus-like particles within the inclusions. Of the six specimens tested, all were positive for ranavirus major capsid protein (MCP) gene. Sequence alignments of the ranavirus MCP gene from these specimens showed 95-98% similarity with published ranavirus data. The virus, provisionally designated as Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV), was isolated from tissue homogenates of diseased salamanders following inoculation of epithelioma papilloma cyprini cells. Sequence analysis of the MCP genes showed that the isolated virus was a ranavirus with marked sequence identity to other members of the genus Ranavirus. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by infecting healthy Chinese giant salamanders with the CGSV. These salamanders all died within 6-8 days. This is the first report of ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Geng, Y.; Wang, K. Y.; Zhou, Z. Y.; Li, C.

The breeder hens were fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 6 mg of canthaxanthin/kg for 24 wk. At the end of the 24-wk breeder experiment, all hatching eggs laid in 5 consecutive days of each group were collected and incubated. For each breeder group, 100 newly hatched chicks (5 replicates of 20) were reared under environmentally controlled conditions for 21 d. Canthaxanthin supplementation resulted in the following outcomes: an enhancement of the serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of breeder hens (P = 0.029), a significant increase in the yolk colorimetric score of Roche Yolk Color Fan (RYCF; P < 0.001), and a significant improvement of the antioxidant status of the egg yolk (P < 0.05). The chicks that hatched from eggs laid by breeder hens fed the canthaxanthin supplementation diet demonstrated a higher pigmentation colorimetric score of RYCF for their shank skin (P < 0.05), and the antioxidant capacity of the newly hatched chicks was significantly increased (P < 0.05). Both of these positive effects on shank skin pigmentation colorimetric score of RYCF and antioxidant capacity were observed for at least 7 d posthatching, and the chicks that hatched from canthaxanthin-enriched eggs showed a lower mortality (0 vs. 4%) during the first 21 d posthatching. These findings support the hypothesis that canthaxanthin supplementation of the maternal diet enhances the protective capacity of tissues against oxidative stress in vivo, which might be beneficial for poultry producers.

The growth index (GI) was obviously decreased in the three high-F groups, which indicated the inhibited development of thymus. Histopathologically, the population of thymocytes was decreased in the thymic lobule in the three high-F groups. As measured by flow cytometry, thymocytes in G(0)/G(1) phase were significantly increased while thymocytes in S phase, G(2) + M phase and proliferating index (PI) value were obviously decreased in the three high-F groups. Also, the percentage of apoptotic thymocytes was greatly increased in the three high-F groups when compared with that of control group. At the same time, the occurrence frequencies of apoptotic thymocyte were markedly increased in the three high-F groups, with the appearance of dilated endoplasmic reticulum in high-F groups II and III ultrastructurally. The results showed that excess dietary F in the range of 400-1200 mg/kg caused histological lesions, G(0)/G(1) arrest and cellular apoptosis in the thymus, which inhibited the development of thymus and finally led to impaired cellular immune function.

This method was based on the hypothesis that the ratio of the specific radioactivity (SR) of endogenous Leu in excreta (SRe) to that of free Leu in trichloroacetic acid-soluble plasma (SR) remains constant after a single subcutaneous injection of H-3-Leu into birds fed different diets. Methods: Two experiments were designed to clarify this hypothesis. In experiment 1, 40 female broilers were randomly divided into four groups and were force-fed a nitrogen-free diet (NFD), NFD plus enzyme-hydrolyzed casein (EHC), 5% crude protein (CP) and SBM (soybean meal), or 20% CP-SBM. In experiment 2, 24 broilers were randomly divided into four groups and were fasted or force-fed the NFD, 20% CP-SBM, or 20% CP and cottonseed meal (CSM) diet. After the forced feeding, broilers were administered H-3-Leu by a single subcutaneous injection at a rate of 30 mu Ci/kg of body weight. Blood samples were taken at 5 min, 30 min, 4 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h after the injection. The excreta were totally collected and pooled over the 48-h experiment. Results: The ratios of SRe to SRp remained the same for the birds force-fed the NFD, NFD + EHC, and 5% CP-SBM diets in experiment 1 and for the birds fasted and force-fed the NFD diet in experiment 2. The proportions of endogenous Leu to total Leu in excreta were 72.8%, 61.4%, and 57.5% for birds force-fed with the 20% CP-SBM diet in experiment 1 and 20% CP-SBM and 20% CP-CSM diets in experiment 2, respectively. Broilers fed the 5% CP-SBM and 20% CP-SBM diets excreted more (P < 0.05) endogenous Leu than those fed the NFD and NFD + EHC diets in experiment 1. Broilers fed the 20% CP-SBM diet excreted more (P < 0.05) endogenous Leu than those fed the NFD diet and fasted and the 20% CP-CSM diet was intermediate (P > 0.05) in experiment 2. Conclusion: The present study verified the hypothesis that the ratio of SRe to SRp remains constant after a single subcutaneous injection of H-3-Leu into broilers and proposes a new method to determine endogenous amino acid losses of broilers.

The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), an insect with worldwide distribution, is a main pest of Brassicaceae crops and causes enormous crop losses. Transfer of the anti-insect gene into the plant genome by transgenic technology and subsequent breeding of insect-resistant varieties will be an effective approach to reducing the damage caused by this pest. We have produced transgenic non-heading Chinese cabbage plants expressing the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene (pinII) and tested the pest resistance of these transgenic plants. Non-heading Chinese cabbages grown for 45 days on which buds had formed were used as experimental materials for Agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration transformation. Forty-one resistant plants were selected from 1166 g of seed harvested from the infiltrated plants based on the resistance of the young seedlings to the herbicide Basta. The transgenic traits were further confirmed by the Chlorophenol red test, PCR, and genomic Southern blotting. The results showed that the bar and pinII genes were co-integrated into the resistant plant genome. A bioassay of insect resistance in the second generation of individual lines of the transgenic plants showed that DBM larvae fed on transgenic leaves were severely stunted and had a higher mortality than those fed on the wild-type leaves.

Stems of bitter melon (Momordica charantia L.) cv. Dabai were used to establish in vitro cultures. The endogenous hormone concentrations (indoleacetic acid [IAA], abscisic acid [ABA], gibberellins 3 [GA(3)], zeatin [ZT]) of the calluses were determined by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The endogenous ZT was higher in the stem calluses that had formed buds, and there was a higher IAA/ZT ratio and GA(3)/ZT ratio in the calluses having no capacity for buds formation. The results showed that addition of plant growth regulator influences endogenous hormone status and it will be helpful for in vitro propagation of bitter melon.

Here, a pseudorabies virus (PRV) system was adopted to express the PPV VP2 gene. Methods: A recombinant PRV SA215/VP2 was obtained by homologous recombination between the vector PRV viral DNA and a transfer plasmid. Then recombinant virus was purified with plaque purification, and its identity confirmed by PCR amplification, Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) analyses. Electronic microscopy of PRV SA215/VP2 confirmed self-assembly of both pseudorabies virus and VLPs from VP2 protein. Results: Immunization of piglets with recombinant virus elicited PRV-specific and PPV-specific humoral immune responses and provided complete protection against a lethal dose of PRV challenges. Gilts immunized with recombinant viruses induced PPV-specific antibodies, and significantly reduced the mortality rate of (1 of 28) following virulent PPV challenge compared with the control (7 of 31). Furthermore, PPV virus DNA was not detected in the fetuses of recombinant virus immunized gilts. Conclusions: In this study, a recombinant PRV SA215/VP2 virus expressing PPV VP2 protein was constructed using PRV SA215 vector. The safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the recombinant virus were demonstrated in piglets and primiparous gilts. This recombinant PRV SA215/VP2 represents a suitable candidate for the development of a bivalent vaccine against both PRV and PPV infection.

The number of days from sowing to seedling emergence (NDSSE) is an important agronomic trait in a maize (Zea mays L.) breeding project which is related to yield. To determine its genetic basis, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and two nitrogen (N) regimes were used to detect the QTLs associated with NDSSE; as a result, one QTL was identified under high N regime, on chromosome 9, which could explain 6.20% of phenotypic variance and a decrease of 0.18 of NDSSE due to an additive effect. These results are beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of NDSSE in maize breeding project.

HW08 is capable of swainsonine (SW) degradation with high efficiency. The aim of this study was to screen the degradative plasmids from Arthrobacter sp. HW08 and investigate their ability of degrading SW. A genomic library of Arthrobacter sp. HW08 was successfully constructed by BamHI restriction digestion of genomic DNA and pUC19 vector, ligation and transformation into DH5 alpha. Five plasmids of different sizes were screened from 100 genomic library strains, and were named as pUCSW-1, pUCSW-2, pUCSW-3, pUCSW-4 and pUCSW-5, and their insertion elements had sizes of 6 684, 5 093, 136, 1 452 and 2 082 bp, respectively. They contained 7 major open reading frames. SW (400 mg l(-1)), as only carbon source, cultivated with the mixture of the five plasmid-transformants was degraded within 6 h. The degrading capability was equivalent to that of strain HW08. SW degradative ability of minimum combinations was pUCSW-2, 3, 5 > pUCSW-1, 2, 4 > pUCSW-1, 2, 5 > pUCSW-1, 3, 5, which were all slower than that of strain HW08. Any two or single transformant had no degradative ability. The results of this study support the search of the key genes of SW degradation and the investigating mechanism of SW biodegradation or exploration of its metabolic pathway, and even construction of transgene engineering bacteria to protect animals from lesion when locoweed is consumed.

Pigs were randomly assigned to one of four diets formulated with corn starch, wheat starch, tapioca or pea starch. The determined ratio of amylose to amylopectin for these starches was 0.21, 0.24, 0.12 and 0.52, respectively based on the 16s rRNA sequences of maximum species of Bifidobacterium from GenBank to design the primers and probe. TaqMan polymerase chain reaction was developed to quantify the number of Bifidobacterium. We used this assay to detect genomic DNA of Bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract digesta of piglets, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon. Our results indicated that, developed new real-time quantitative PCR assays can be allowed for rapid, convenient, reproducible and steady quantification of the Bifidobacterium in the intestinal content of piglets. Additionally, the present study revealed that high amylose/amylopectin ratio of starches significantly enhanced the numbers of Bifidobacterium in all segments of intestine.

Analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequences demonstrated that the strains Eri11 was most closely related to representatives of the genera Streptomyces. The total phenols and flavonoids contents in cultured broth were detected to be13.59 +/- 0.17 mg gallic acid equivalent/g and 9.93 +/- 0.83 mg rutin equivalent/g, respectively. The cultured broth showed the antioxidant activity against the ABTS (2, 2'-Azinobis-3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) free radicals and hydroxyl free radicals with IC(50) (The half-inhibitory concentration) of 223.81 +/- 24.50 mu g/ml and 582.42 +/- 83.10 mu g/ml respectively. So, it was suggested that the isolated Streptomyces strain Eri11 could be a candidate for the nature resource of the antioxidants.

All EMS treatments employed in the study resulted in lower vitality to various extents depending on the EMS concentration and duration. The death rate of loquat anther-derived embryos was over 50% while the EMS concentration ranged from 0.1 to 0.9% and the exposure time of treatment was 0.5, 1 and 2 h, respectively. Maximal survival rate (46.2%) was obtained in the treatment of 0.3% EMS for 0.5 h and minimal survival rate (2%) was obtained in the treatment of 0.7% EMS for 2 h. The induction ability of secondary embryos decreased after the EMS treatment. Both the maximal percentage (46.2%) of embryos producing new embryos and the maximal number (5.4) of newly formed embryos per embryo producing new embryos were obtained in the treatment of 0.3% EMS for 0.5 h. Minimal percentage (2.8%) of embryos producing new embryos was obtained in the treatment of 0.7% EMS for 2 h. Minimal number (2.75) of newly formed embryos per embryo producing new embryos was obtained in the treatment of 0.9% EMS for 2 h. EMS treatment caused more morphological malformations in the secondary anther-derived embryos. Changes were detected with RAPD amplification profiles in the secondary anther-derived embryos from EMS treatment. There were diversities on the RAPD profiles in the EMS treated embryos, and 0.3% EMS for 2 h was the most effective in causing changes detected by RAPD in all treatments.

A PRV SA215 strain with deleted gE, gI, and TK genes was constructed to develop a commercial attenuated live vaccine. However, the physicochemical properties, growth pattern, penetration kinetics, and morphogenesis of the PRV SA215 and its parental PRV Fa strain are unclear. Results: A series of experiments were conducted to characterize both strains and provide more information. PRV Fa and PRV SA215 were found to have similar penetration patterns, with about 5 min half-time of penetration. The SA215 strain exhibited a slight delay in entry compared with PRV Fa. In the one-step growth test, the titers of the SA215 strain were first detected at 8 h, rapidly increased, and peaked at 12 h. A plateau was formed between 1236 h of culturing. PRV SA215 showed delayed replication and approximately 10-30-fold lower titers during 0-16 h of culturing compared with the PRV-Fa strain. After 16 h, the PRV Fa titers dramatically decreased, whereas those of PRV SA215 were prolonged to 36 h and reached a titer value equal to that of PRV Fa and then decreased. Both strains were sensitive to both heat and acid-alkali treatments; however, PRV Fa was relatively more stable to heat treatment than PRV SA215. Both strains could propagate in the cultures with pH values from 5.0 to 9.0. Cultures with pH below 3.0 or above 11.0 were fatal to both strains. Both strains had considerable resistance to freeze-thawing treatments. Morphogenetic investigations showed that typical phases in the maturation pathway were observed in the PRV Fa-infected PK15 cells, whereas secondary envelopment was not observed in the PRV SA215 strain. Instead, capsid aggregations with concomitants of electrodense materials were observed. Conclusions: These results suggest that PRV SA215 is a promising strain for vaccine development	[Zhu, Ling; Yi, Yue; Xu, Zhiwen; Cheng, Lu; Guo, Wanzhu] Sichuan Agr Univ, Anim Biotechnol Ctr, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shanhu] ChengDu Univ Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Guo, WZ (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Anim Biotechnol Ctr, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	wzguo@126.com		Zhu, Ling/0000-0002-8822-5460; Xu, Zhiwen/0000-0002-9508-6593; Zhu, Ling/0000-0003-0950-5905	National Key Technology R&D Program of china (NKTRDP) [2006BAD06A18]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRTU) [IRT0848]	The research was supported by National Key Technology R&D Program in the 11th Five year Plan of china(NKTRDP, PROJECT No. 2006BAD06A18).

Owing to the crucial role played by them in plant resistance, development, and growth, extensive studies have been performed on the NBS-LRR and LRR-RLK genes. However, few studies have focused on these genes collectively; they may co-vary as all of them contain LRR motifs. To investigate their common evolutionary patterns, all major classes of LRR-encoding genes were identified in 12 plant species, and particularly compared in two pairs of close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana-A. lyrata (At-Al) and Zea mays-Sorghum bicolor. Our results showed that these genes co-vary significantly in terms of their numbers between species and that the genes with certain evolutionary parameters are most likely to have similar functions. The development-related genes have clear orthologous relationships between closely related species, as well as lower nucleotide divergence, and Ka/Ks ratio. In contrast, resistance-related genes have exactly opposite characteristics and favor 11-15 LRRs per gene. This association could be very useful in predicting the function of LRR-encoding genes. The presence of co-variation suggests that LRRs, combined with other domains, can work better in some common functions. In order to cooperate efficiently, there should be balanced gene numbers among the different gene classes.

A total of 60 BALB/c mice inoculated each with about 1,000 embryonated B. transfuga eggs were equally divided into 6 groups (A-F) randomly. Mice of groups A and B were treated with ivermectin and levamisole, respectively, on day 3 post-infection (PI). Mice of groups A-C were killed on day 13 PI. Similarly, groups D and E were treated with ivermectin and levamisole, respectively, on day 14 PI, and all mice of groups D-F were treated on day 24 PI. The groups C and F were controls. Microexamination was conducted to count the larvae recovering from each mouse. The percentages of reduction in the number of migrating larvae recovered from group A (ivermectin) and B (levamisole) were 88.3% and 81.1%, respectively. In addition, the reduction in encapsulated larvae counts achieved by ivermectin (group D) and levamisole (group E) was 75.0% and 49.2%, respectively. The results suggested that, to a certain extent, both anthelmintics appeared to be more effective against migrating larvae than encapsulated larvae. However, in the incipient stage of infection, ivermectin may be more competent than levamisole as a larvicidal drug for B. transfuga.

SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing condition showed that FtTI is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of approximately 14 kDa. The complete amino acid sequence of FtTI was established by automatic Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. It was found that the trypsin inhibitor molecule consists of 86 amino acid residues containing two disulfide bonds which connect Cys(8) to Cys(65) and Cys(49) to Cys(58). The active site of the inhibitor was found to contain an Asp(66)-Arg(67) bond. MALDI-TOF analysis showed that FtTI has two isoforms (Mr: 11.487 and 13.838 kDa). Dixon plots revealed a competitive inhibition of trypsin with inhibition constants (Ki) of 1.6 nM. Analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests that FtTI is a member of the protease inhibitor I family. What is more, FtTI exhibited strong inhibitory activity against phytopathogenic fungi.

Analysis of Heterosis, Combining Ability and Genetic Diversity in Tuber Mustard (Brassica juncea var. tumida Tsen & Lee) Inbred Lines Based on SSR Markers and Combining Ability Estimates	PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST			English	Article						combining ability; correlation analysis; genetic distance; heterosis; SSR markers; tuber mustard	MAIZE POPULATIONS; HYBRID; DISTANCE; VARIABILITY; YIELD; NAPUS; RICE; L.	Fifteen inbred lines of tuber mustard were used to determine their genetic diversity by using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and seven inbred lines (male) and eight sterile male inbred lines (female) were crossed to obtain 56 hybrids. Heterosis and combining ability were analyzed among these hybrids. We detected 80 pairs of SSR primers amplifying 637 bands among the parents, with an average of 8.0 and ranging from 3 to 13. The genetic distances between the male lines and the male sterile lines ranged from 0.25 to 0.40, with an average of 0.33. Fifteen accessions were classified into two clusters based on genetic distance. The combining ability analysis showed that five significant positive relative effects and 24 significant positive relative effects were found in general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) analyses, respectively. Thirty-six hybrids showed significant positive effects in high-parent heterosis, indicating that heterosis in stem yield among parents was evident in tuber mustard. Because heterosis of stem yield in tuber mustard among the parents was associated with GCA and SCA, attention should be paid to both GCA and SCA in breeding for tuber yield heterosis. The correlation coefficients of genetic distance between stem yield, high-parent heterosis and SCA were all small and not significant. Further study is necessary to determine whether or not genetic distance could be used to predict heterosis and SCA in stem yield of tuber mustard.	[Chen, F. B.; Yang, K. C.; Jiang, L.

In plants, most imprinted genes have been identified in Arabidopsis endosperm, a transient structure consumed by the embryo during seed formation. We identified imprinted genes in rice seed where both the endosperm and embryo are present at seed maturity. RNA was extracted from embryos and endosperm of seeds obtained from reciprocal crosses between two subspecies Nipponbare (Japonica rice) and 93-11 (Indica rice). Sequenced reads from cDNA libraries were aligned to their respective parental genomes using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Reads across SNPs enabled derivation of parental expression bias ratios. A continuum of parental expression bias states was observed. Statistical analyses indicated 262 candidate imprinted loci in the endosperm and three in the embryo (168 genic and 97 non-genic). Fifty-six of the 67 loci investigated were confirmed to be imprinted in the seed. Imprinted loci are not clustered in the rice genome as found in mammals. All of these imprinted loci were expressed in the endosperm, and one of these was also imprinted in the embryo, confirming that in both rice and Arabidopsis imprinted expression is primarily confined to the endosperm. Some rice imprinted genes were also expressed in vegetative tissues, indicating that they have additional roles in plant growth. Comparison of candidate imprinted genes found in rice with imprinted candidate loci obtained from genome-wide surveys of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis to date shows a low degree of conservation, suggesting that imprinting has evolved independently in eudicots and monocots.

All 15 partial amphiploid plants were aneuploids with either 50 (8 plants), 51 (6 plants) or 54 (1 plant) chromosomes. Some showed regular meiosis and all the P. huashanica chromosomes were included, although not in a single plant. Of 45 plants 34 showed specific bands on SDS-PAGE representing high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) and 41 had bands representing P. huashanica low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS), including two new subunits. All 45 plants were highly resistant (10) or immune (35) to stripe rust mixed races CYR-30, CYR-31, Shuiyuan 7 and Shuiyuan 14. These amphiploid plants could be useful germplasm for enhancing stripe rust resistance and might improve wheat grain quality.

NOV.; STACKEBRANDTIA; IDENTIFICATION; CHROMATOGRAPHY; SEQUENCES	A novel actinomycete strain, designated TRM 40137(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Xinjiang Province, north-west China, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. The strain was aerobic, Gram-positive and the optimum NaCl concentration for growth was 4-5% (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain TRM 40137(T) has a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 95.02% with the described species Glycomyces sambucus E71(T) and can be distinguished from all previously described representatives of the genus Glycomyces. The whole-cell sugar pattern consisted of xylose and galactose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-10(H(2)) and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The phospholipid pattern consists of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, three unknown aminophospholipids and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.8 mol%. A novel species Glycomyces halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed, with strain TRM 40137(T) (=CCTCC AA 2010013(T) = KCTC 19988(T)) as the type strain of G. halotolerans.

Architecture and resource competition have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. The aim of the present study is to assess the relative importance of resource competition and architectural effects in pollen and ovule production on racemes of Hosta ventricosa, an apomictic perennial herb. Methods Combinations of two defoliation treatments (intact and defoliated) and two fruit-set treatments (no-fruit and fruit) were created, and the roles of architecture and resource competition at each resource level were assessed. Key Results Pollen and ovule number per flower increased after defoliation, but pollen to ovule ratio per flower did not change. Pollen, ovules and the pollen to ovule ratio per flower declined distally on racemes at each resource level. In the intact treatment, fruit development of early flowers did not affect either pollen or ovule number of late flowers. In the defoliated treatment, fruit development of early flowers reduced both pollen and ovule numbers of late flowers due to over-compensation caused by defoliation. Late flowers on defoliated fruit racemes produced less pollen than intact fruit racemes but the same number of ovules; therefore, the reduction in pollen number was not caused by over-compensation. In addition, the fruit-set rate of early flowers during flowering was higher in intact racemes than in defoliated racemes. Conclusions In flowering plants, the relative importance of architecture and resource competition in allocation to pollen and ovules may vary with the resource pools or the overall resource availability of maternal plants.

Developing marker-assisted models for evaluating growth traits in Canadian beef cattle genetic improvement	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Marker-assisted selection; Beef cattle; Marker score; Selection index	LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; GENOMIC SELECTION; BREEDING VALUES; ANGUS CATTLE	The Igenity (R) genotyping panel with a total of 233 SNP markers was used to genotype 2749 animals of the Beefbooster breeding stock population. A total of 144 SNP makers were used in conducting the association of the SNP markers and the growth traits based on multiple markers regression using stepwise method. The numbers of SNP markers that significantly (p<0.05) associated with birth weight (BWT), direct genetic effect of weaning weight (WWT), maternal genetic effect of weaning weight (Milk), yearling weight (YWT), mature weight (MWT), and scrotal circumference (SC) were 139, 135, 12, 89, 129 and 105, respectively. Marker score of each individual was calculated as the linear regression on the number of copies of specific allele of all significant (p<0.05) SNP markers. Bi-variable analysis of marker scores and phenotypes for all traits were conducted using ASReml Software and the genetic parameters for each trait were estimated. The genetic correlations between phenotype and marker score for BWT,WWT, Milk, YWT, MWT and SC were 0.61 +/- 0.08, 0.39 +/- 0.10, 0.14 +/- 0.03, 0.38 +/- 0.04, 0.57 +/- 0.09 and 0.54 +/- 0.10, respectively. The developed two-trait marker-assisted evaluation (TMAE) model increased the estimation accuracy of the phenotypic EBV of the animal when the genetic correlations between phenotype and marker score were high, even with the current limited genotypic and phenotypic information. The average prediction accuracy of phenotypic EBV for BWT, WWT, Milk, YWT, MWT and SC using TMAE were increased by 0.07, 0.07, 0.001, 0.42, 0.08 and 0.22, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, methiopyrsulfuron adsorption and desorption were measured in seven soils sampled from Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Anhui, and Chongqing provinces of China using a batch equilibrium method. The Freundlich equation was used to described its adsorption and desorption. Adsorption isotherms were nonlinear with the values of K(f-ads), the Freundlich empirical constant indicative of the adsorption capacity, ranging from 0.75 to 2.46, suggesting that little of this herbicide was adsorbed by any of the seven soils. Soil pH and organic matter content (OM) were the main factors influencing adsorption; adsorption was negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with OM. Methiopyrsulfuron desorption was hysteretic on the soils with high OM content and low pH.

Four hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 ppm vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate. In comparison with those of the control group, the percentages of CD (3) (+) , CD (3) (+) CD (4) (+) , and CD (3) (+) CD (8) (+) were decreased in 45 and 60 ppm groups from 14 to 42 days of age, and the percentages of CD (3) (+) and CD (3) (+) CD (4) (+) were increased in 5 ppm group at 42 days of age. The CD (4) (+) /CD (8) (+) ratio was increased in 45 and 60 ppm groups at 28 days of age. Meanwhile, the proliferation function of peripheral blood T cell were decreased in 30, 45, and 60 ppm groups from 14 to 42 days of age. Also, the serum interleukin-2 contents were decreased in 45 and 60 ppm groups from 14 to 42 days of age and increased in 5 ppm group at 28 days of age. Histopathologically, hypocellularity appeared in the thymus in 45 and 60 ppm groups. It was concluded that dietary vanadium in excess of 30 ppm reduced the percentages of peripheral blood T-cell subsets and the proliferation function and serum interleukin-2 contents. The cellular immune function was finally impaired in broilers.

The dynamic transcription variation of duck enteritis virus UL55 gene during the life cycle of duck enteritis virus in infected cells has not been reported yet. Results: The newly identified duck enteritis virus UL55 gene was amplified and cloned into pMD18-T vector after digestion to generate a recombinant plasmid pMD18-T/UL55 for the establishment of qRT-PCR as standard DNA. The results of agarose gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis demonstrated the primers we designed for qRT-PCR were specific and available. We used beta-actin as a reference gene for normalization and established two standard curves based on pMD18-T/UL55 and pMD18-T/beta-actin successfully. Based on that, the transcriptional analysis of DEV UL55 gene was performed, and the result suggested the expression of UL55 mRNA was at a low level from 0 to 8 h post-infection(p.i.), then accumulated quickly since 12 h p.i. and peaked at 36 h p.i., it can be detected till 60 h p.i.. Nucleic acid inhibition test was carried out for analyzing a temporal regulation condition of DEV UL55 gene, result revealed that it was sensitive to ganciclovir. Synthesis procedures of DEV UL55 gene can be inhibited by ganciclovir. Conclusions: The method we established in this paper can provide quantitative values reflecting the amounts of measured mRNA in samples. It's available for detection and quantification, also can be used in DEV diagnosis. The DEV UL55 gene was produced most abundantly during the late phase of replication in DEV-infected cells and the transcription of it depended on the synthesized DNA.

Bacteria were isolated from hypersaline water, sediment and soil samples using three culture media and an incubation temperature of 37A degrees C. Of these isolates, 47 were selected and examined by phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and by tests of salt tolerance. The phylogenetic analysis placed the 47 bacterial isolates either in the phylum Firmicutes or in the class Gammaproteobacteria and showed that they were affiliated with the genera Salimicrobium, Halalkalibacillus, Virgibacillus, Alkalibacillus, Marinococcus, Halobacillus, Halomonas, Idiomarina, Chromohalobacter and Halovibrio. All tested isolates were either halophilic or halotolerant and several were capable of growth in the presence of 30% (w/v) NaCl.

However, to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis in goose primary hepatocytes is unknown. In this study, the effect of linoleate on the lipid metabolic homeostasis pathway was determined. We measured the mRNA levels of genes involved in triglyceride synthesis, lipid deposition, beta-oxidation, and assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs in goose (Anser cygnoides) primary hepatocytes. Linoleate significantly increased goose hepatocyte viability, and linoleate at 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM all showed a significant effect on TG accumulation. However, with increasing linoleate concentrations, the extracellular TG concentration and extracellular VLDL gradually decreased. DGAT1, DGAT2, PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, FoxO1, MTP, PLIN and CPT-1 mRNA was detected by real-time PCR. With increasing linoleate concentrations, the changes in DGAT1, DGAT2, PPAR alpha and CPT-1 gene expression, which regulates hepatic TG synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, first increased and then decreased. Additionally, FoxO1 and MW gene expression was reduced with increasing linoleate concentrations, and the change in PLIN gene expression was increased at all concentrations, similar to the regulation of intracellular TG accumulation. In conclusion, linoleate regulated TG accumulation and increased hepatocyte viability. The data suggest that linoleate does promote goose hepatocyte viability and steatosis, which may up-regulate TG synthesis-relevant gene expression, suppress assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs, and increase fatty acid oxidation properly to function of goose primary hepatocytes.

To further investigate the role of SCD-1 in lipid metabolism in geese, 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE were carried out in this study to obtain the complete cDNA sequence of goose SCD-1, which contained a 29-bp 5' UTR, a 1074-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 357 amino acids, and a 125-bp 3' UTR. The expression of SCD-1 was measured in several tissues, and the effects of overfeeding on the expression of SCD-1 were studied. The results of real time RT-PCR demonstrated that, compared to the brain, goose SCD-1 mRNA was more abundant in the liver. Overfeeding markedly increased the mRNA expression of SCD-1 in the liver of Sichuan White and Landes geese, and gene expression was markedly higher in the Sichuan White goose than in the landes goose. The mRNA abundance of SCD-1 in the liver had significant positive correlations with triacylglycerol (TG) content in liver lipids and in the levels of plasma insulin and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) levels in Sichuan white geese. However, the mRNA abundance of SCD-1 in the livers of Landes geese had only significant positive correlations with the TG content in liver lipids. In conclusion, SCD-1 is not only critical for hepatic steatosis in geese but is also important for the difference in lipid deposition in the livers of the two breeds.

Jian) to investigate the effects of dietary zinc on growth, body composition and intestinal enzyme activities. Diets supplemented with increasing levels (15.3, 26.9, 40.8, 58.2, 68.9 and 92.5 mg Zn kg(-1)) of zinc lactate were fed to Jian carp (mean initial weight 15.7 +/- 0.01 g). Results indicated that per cent weight gain (PWG), feed efficiency (FE), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and lipid productive value (LPV) enhanced with dietary zinc levels up to 40.8 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05), and plateaued thereafter (P > 0.05). Feed intake (FI) was similar to that observed for PWG. Intestosomatic index (ISI), relative gut length (RGL), hepatopancreas protein content (HPC), intestine protein content (IPC), trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, amylase, alkaline phosphatase (AKP), Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activities were all higher by dietary zinc supplementation than zinc un-supplementation (P < 0.05). These results suggested that zinc could promote growth and increase nutrient deposition and intestinal enzyme activities. The dietary zinc requirements (use zinc lactate as zinc source) of juvenile Jian carp (15.7-42.2 g) based on PWG and serum zinc were 48.7 and 43.2 mg Zn kg(-1) diet, respectively.

Sterile plantlets were cultured in media with different potassium levels, and parameters related to growth, foliar potassium, water and chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis, transpiration, H(2)O(2) contents and antioxidative enzyme activities were determined after a month. Results showed that 1.28 mM potassium was the optimum for H. cordata as highest values of dry weight, shoot height, root length and number were obtained at this concentration. The optimum potassium concentration resulted in the maximum net photosynthetic rate which could be associated with the highest chlorophyll content rather than limited stomatal conductance. The supply of surplus potassium resulted in higher content of foliar potassium, but negatively correlated with the biomass. Both potassium starvation (0 mM) and high potassium (>1.28 mM) could lead to water loss through high transpiration rate and low water absorption, respectively, and resulted in H(2)O(2) accumulation and increased activities of catalase and peroxidase, which suggested induction of oxidative stress. Moreover, H. cordata showed the minimum of H(2)O(2) content and the maximum of superoxide dismutase activity on 1.28 mM potassium, implying its role in inducing tolerance against oxidative stress.

To understand the molecular mechanism of the three pistils mutation in wheat, two forward subtractive cDNA libraries from two pairs of near-isogenic wheat lines, Chuanmai 28 three pistils (CMTP) and Chinese Spring three pistils (CSTP), were constructed using SSH. A total of 68 clones in CMTP lines and 197 clones in CSTP lines were identified as potentially over-expressed clones. Thirty-two out of 68 clones in CMTP lines belonged to unknown proteins; while, the remaining 30 clones shared homology to diverse classes of genes involved in protein modulation and protein synthesis, signal transduction, and ion transporters. Approximately 67% of genes in CSTP lines were either unclassified or had no matches ("no hits") in the database and about 33% of identified genes encoded polypeptides with known functions. Sequence comparisons of cDNA clones between the two forward cDNA libraries revealed that four genes, encoding thioredoxin H, ubiquitin protein ligases, MCM2, and ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase complex 14 kDa proteins, were over-expressed in both libraries. These genes would likely play an important role in determining the three pistils trait in the mutant wheat line.

Rats received biweekly intragastric administration of either CS-HCI at 250 mg/kg body weight or saline (control) for 4 weeks. The 24 h urine and blood serum samples after the last CS treatment were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics, specifically high-resolution H-1 NMR metabolic profiling combined with multivariate statistics. Metabolic effects of CS include decreased serum acetate, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and urine hippurate, together with increased urine dimethylamine, indicating modulation of intestinal microbial metabolism of the rats. A decrease in urine succinate, citric acid, and serum acetoacetate, together with an increase in serum lactate, was also observed, which suggests that CS supplementation results in perturbation of energy metabolism in rats.

This lack of knowledge is primarily because of the huge diversity in protein function and the consequent difficulty in gauging and comparing rates of protein function evolution. Nevertheless, most proteins function through interacting with other proteins, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) can be tested by standard assays. Thus, the rate of protein function evolution may be measured by the rate of PPI evolution. Here, we experimentally examine 87 potential interactions between Kluyveromyces waltii proteins, whose one to one orthologs in the related budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been reported to interact. Combining our results with available data from other eukaryotes, we estimate that the evolutionary rate of protein interaction is (2.6 +/- 1.6) x 10(-10) per PPI per year, which is three orders of magnitude lower than the rate of protein sequence evolution measured by the number of amino acid substitutions per protein per year. The extremely slow evolution of protein molecular function may account for the remarkable conservation of life at molecular and cellular levels and allow for studying the mechanistic basis of human disease in much simpler organisms.

The denatured protein about 40 KDa named pUL55 was purified by washing five times, and used to immune rabbits for preparation of polyclonal antibody. The prepared polyclonal antibody against pUL55 was detected and determined by Agar immundiffusion and Neutralization test. The results of Wstern blotting assay and intracellular analysis revealed that pUL55 was expressed most abundantly during the late phase of replication and mainly distributed in cytoplasm in duck enteritis virus infected cells. Conclusions: In this study, the duck enteritis virus UL55 protein was successfully expressed in prokaryotic expression system. Besides, we have prepared the polyclonal antibody against recombinant prtein UL55, and characterized some properties of the duck enteritis virus UL55 protein for the first time. The research will be useful for further functional analysis of this gene.

This paper reports here the development of a novel oral immunization system for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in transgenic maize with two serotypes of the structural protein VP1 of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) viz., O- and Asia 1-type, respectively. The transgenic plantlets were identified and investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot, and real-time PCR. Moreover, it was found that the VP1 genes in transgenic plants could be transmitted stably to the next generation through PCR detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report in an attempt to induce a protective systemic antibody response in animals by feeding the transgenic plants in which two scrotypes antigen protein of FMDV expressed together. Results of the experiment provide the possibility of using plant-based vaccines as feedstuff or feedstuff additives.

After PCR screening and Southern blotting, the flanking sequences of the integration sites were amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) and used for analysis of T-DNA integration patterns. The T-2 plant lines were evaluated for their MDMV resistance in field inoculation trials under two environments. Of the nineteen T-2 plant lines positive in Southern blotting, six were evaluated as resistant to MDMV, and four of them had resistance non-significantly different from the highly resistant control "H9-21", while the resistance of the other eleven was proved to be significantly improved when compared to their non-transformed parent line. These improvements in MDMV resistance were verified by the relative amount of virus CP gene expression measured by quantitative real time PCR. Comparing the results of Southern blotting and TAIL-PCR analysis, different integration patterns of one or two copies of the inverted-repeat sequences were identified from non-repetitive and repetitive sequences of the maize genome. The MDMV resistance mediated by RNA interference is relative to the length of the inverted-repeat sequence, the copy number of T-DNA integration and the repeatability of integration sites. A longer hpRNA expression construct shows more efficiency than a shorter one. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is likely that gI protein and its homolog play similar roles in virions direct cell-to-cell spread of alphaherpesviruses. But, little is known about the characteristics of DEV gI gene. In this study, we expressed and presented the basic properties of the DEV gI protein. Results: The special 1221-bp fragment containing complete open reading frame(ORF) of duck enteritis virus(DEV) gI gene was extracted from plasmid pMD18-T-gI, and then cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a(+), resulting in pET-32a(+)-gI. After being confirmed by PCR, restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing, pET-32a(+)-gI was transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) competent cells for overexpression. DEV gI gene was successfully expressed by the addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG). SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant protein His6-tagged gI molecular weight was about 61 kDa. Subsequently, the expressed product was applied to generate specific antibody against gI protein. The specificity of the rabbit immuneserum was confirmed by its ability to react with the recombinant protein His6-tagged gI. In addition, real time-PCR was used to determine the the levels of the mRNA transcripts of gI gene, the results showed that the DEV gI gene was transcribed most abundantly during the late phase of infection. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence(IIF) was established to study the gI protein expression and localization in DEV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), the results confirmed that the protein was expressed and located in the cytoplasm of the infected cells, intensively. Conclusions: The recombinant prokaryotic expression vector of DEV gI gene was constructed successfully. The gI protein was successfully expressed by E. coli BL21(DE3) and maintained its antigenicity very well. The basic information of the transcription and intracellular localization of gI gene were presented, that would be helpful to assess the possible role of DEV gI gene. The research will provide useful clues for further functional analysis of DEV gI gene.

Whilst with the development of protocols in molecular biology, nowadays more and more information about the genes of DEV was reported. But little information about DEV UL53 gene and glycoprotein K (gK) was known except our reported data. Results: In our paper, the fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR(FQ-RT-PCR) assay and nucleic acid inhibition test were used to study the transcription characteristic of the DEV UL53 gene. Except detecting the mRNA of DEV UL53 gene, the product gK encoded by UL53 gene was detected through the expression kinetics of UL53 gene by the purified rabbit anti-UL53 protein polyclonal antibodies. Western-blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to detect gK. From the results of these experiments, the UL53 gene and gK were respectively identified as a late gene and a really late protein. On the other hand, the indirect immunofluorescence assay provided another information that the intracellular localization of DEV gK was mainly distributed in cytoplasm. Conclusions: By way of conclusions, we conceded that DEV UL53 gene is a really late gene, which is coincident with properties of UL53 homologs from other herpesvirus, such as ILTV(Infectious Laryngotracheitis virus) and HSV-1(Herpes simplex virus type 1). The properties of intracellular localization about gK protein provided a foundation for further functional analysis and further studies will be focused on constructing of the UL53 gene DEV mutant.

The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between mRNA express from fatty acid synthase (FAS) with a different glucose level in primary adipocytes by real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR), which can aid in the understanding of the mechanism of obesity in vitro. By using the following formula, this study was able to quantify the mRNA expression of FAS of unknown samples: Y = -3.156X + 41.21 (Y = threshold cycle, X = log starting quantity). The high concentrations of glucose group significantly improved the mRNA expression of FAS (P < 0.01) rather than 0.25 and 0% concentrations of glucose. These results provide significant data that confirm an association between different glucose level and FAS expression in preadipocytes. The glucose concentration of the high group substantially augmented the mRNA expression of FAS.

The RcSERK1 encodes a protein of 626 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 68.79 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 5.65. The amino acid sequence of RcSERK1 shares all the characteristic features of a SERK protein, including the signal peptide (SP), the leucine zipper (LZ), the five leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), the pro-rich domain containing the so-called Ser-Pro-Pro (SPP) motif, the transmembrane domain (TM), the kinase domain and the C-terminal domain. The transcripts of RcSERK1 were more enriched in PLBs than in rhizoids and callus, but not detected in leaflets (incubated under dark and before producing callus) and the regenerated shoots. Subcellular localization indicated that the fluorescence of RcSERK1-GFP was recorded in the plasma membrane. We argue that RcSERK1 is a Leu-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) and plasma membrane localization protein.

In this investigation, 623 topsoil samples, randomly taken from the Shuangliu county, Sichuan province, China, were analyzed for the spatial variability of soil Pb and associated influencing factors by using multiple methods. The results showed that soil Pb presented a low spatial correlation in the isotropic scope, whereas relatively strong spatial correlation was observed in the directions of N65 degrees E and N80 degrees E. High risk areas with great probability of the soil Pb concentrations exceeding the baseline values (50 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) were estimated to dispersely distribute across the study area. Shortest significant range (SSR) tests indicated that the soil Pb concentrations in plain regions and hilly regions were significantly higher than those in the mountainous regions. Furthermore, soils developed from the gray alluvium and old alluvium demonstrated significantly higher Pb concentrations than those from the purplish rock saprolith. Soil Pb concentrations in the buffer zones (0800 m) of the four main highways firstly increased and then decreased with the increase in distance from these highways. The application rate of fertilizers, pesticides, and animal husbandry income was found to be responsible for the spatial variation of soil Pb. These results will be of reference values in environmental management and decision making in the agricultural sector. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The plasmid encoding gC of DPV was administered via intramuscular (IM) injection and gene gun bombardment. Results: After immunization by both routes virus-specific serum antibody and T-cell responses developed. Vaccination of ducks by IM injection induced a stronger humoral, but weaker cell-mediated immune response. In contrast, a better cell-mediated immune response was achieved by using a gene gun to deliver DNA-coated gold beads to the epidermis with as little as 6 mu g of DNA. Conclusions: This demonstrated that both routes of DNA inoculation can be used for eliciting virus-specific immune responses. Although DNA vaccine containing DPV gC is effective in both intramuscular injection and gene gun bombardment, the latter could induce significantly higher cell-mediated responses against DPV.

However, we found that mammal cell RNAs could be doubled within 24 h in response to free heme accumulalion (ischemia reperfusion and malaria infection) or a high level of glucose treatment (diabetes). Clinical investigations in rats showed that pretreatment with heme (24 h for doubling total RNAs) alleviated oxidative damages caused by diabetes, and pretreatment with glucose (24 h for trebling total RNAs) alleviated oxidative damages caused by ischemia reperfusion or malaria infection. Therefore, this rapid RNA amplification may play an important role in mammal adaptation to diabetes, ischemia reperfusion and malaria infection-derived oxidative stress. This rapid RNA amplification is derived from glucose and heme, but not from their occompanying reactive oxygen species. Hexokinases endure glucose-derived reactive oxygen species accumulation but are not related glucose-derived RNA amplification. In contrast, the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) mediates all glucose- and heme-induced RNA amplification in mammal cells.

Effects of simulated rain on pollen-stigma adhesion and fertilisation in loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.)	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SURFACE COMPONENTS; ARABIDOPSIS POLLEN; ALMOND FLOWERS; POLLINATION; BRASSICA	Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to study if rain could wash-off pollen grains from the surface of the stigma and consequently affect the efficiency of fertilisation in loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.). Flowers of the loquat cultivar, 'Dawuxing', growing in the field, were emasculated, pollinated by hand with pollen of the cultivar 'Longquan No.5', then sprayed with water to simulate the effect of rain at -8, -4, -2 h before, -0 h (immediately before hand-pollination), +0 h (immediately after hand-pollination), and 2, 4, 8, or 12 h after pollination. A control to which no water treatment was applied was also included in the assay. Meanwhile, additional assays were performed in the laboratory to improve the resolution of the field study by using earlier treatments. Here, treatments were performed by pollinating, immersing, and shaking a branch with flowers in a container of water in the laboratory -120, -60, -30, -0, +0, 30, 60, or 120 min before or after hand-pollination. One additional sample was immersed, shaken, then hand-pollinated, and immersed and shaken (ISPIS) again. The results showed that the numbers of pollen grains that germinated, and the percentages of fruit set, differed significantly between the -4, -2, -0, or +0 h treatments and the non-water-treated control in the field assays, especially in the case of the -0 h and +0 h treatments in which the stigmas were washed immediately before or after hand-pollination. However, the -8, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h treatments did not show significant differences from the non-treated control. On the other hand, the laboratory experiments showed that all washing treatments reduced the number of germinated pollen grains retained on the stigma, and the immersion treatments at -30, -0, +0, or 30 min as well as the additional ISPIS treatment, showed significant differences from the non-treated controls in the numbers of pollen grains retained on the stigmas. In conclusion, the results showed that adhesion of pollen grains to the stigmas in loquat was rapid and strong, and that the simulated rain treatment was not able to wash-off pollen grains completely from the stigma surface, except in the -0 h and +0 h treatments.

Methods: Rhesus monkeys were divided into four groups with eight animals in each group. Metacavir or blank vehicles were given for up to 6-month, and then the animals were euthanized 3 and 6 months later. Biochemical and hematological parameters, general symptoms, ECG, serum antibodies, and tissue pathology were observed and recorded. Results: No biologically meaningful influences on body weight, body temperature, ocular examination, ECG, and organ weight were observed. The main toxic effects included: obvious gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in metacavir 200 mg/kg group, in which animals experienced vomiting and decrease in food consumption. Along with the increase of dosing times, animals gradually tolerated the drug and all these effects gradually abated. Hematological damages included increased damage of red blood cells, decrease of red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. Hepatic functions were also damaged at certain levels, including the decreases in total protein, albumin, and glucose and the fatty degeneration in hepatocytes. Mild stenosis and exfoliation of gastric and duodenal mucosa was observed. The mild necrosis and exfoliation of renal tubules epithelia was found 6 months after the start of dosing. All these toxic effects were dose dependent. Conclusion: The main target organs of the toxic effects of metacavir are gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood, and kidneys. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of metacavir for rhesus monkey were considered to be 50 mg/kg/day. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Its taxonomic status was determined using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on an almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain showed that it formed a well-seperated sub-branch within the radiation of the genus Saccharopolyspora. The highest levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was found between the strain TRM 40133(T) and Saccharopolyspora qijiaojingensis YIM 91168(T) (96.5%). The chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolate are typical for the genus Saccharopolyspora. It contained meso-DAP as the diagnostic diamino acid. Whole cell hydrolysate contained arabinose, xylose, ribose and glucose. The diagnostic phospholipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and two unknown phospholipids. The main menaquinone was MK-9(H(6)) and MK-9(H(4)). No mycolic acid was detected. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(16:0) and anteiso-C(17:0). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.2 mol%. In addition, the strain TRM 40133(T) had a phenotypic profile that readily distinguished it from the recognized representatives of the genus Saccharopolyspora. The strain TRM 40133(T) therefore represents a novel species of the genus Saccharopolyspora, for which the name Saccharopolyspora lacisalsi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 40133(T) (=KCTC 19987(T) =CCTCC AA 2010012(T)).

Thirty-four PSB strains were isolated and identified under the genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Cupriavidus, Agrobacterium, Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Pantoea, and Rhodococcus through a comparison of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. All isolated PSB strains could solubilize tricalcium phosphate (TCP) in solid and liquid media. Phosphate-solubilizing activity of these strains was associated with a drop in the pH of medium. A significantly negative linear correlation was found between culture pH and phosphorus (P) solubilized from inorganic phosphate. Three isolates Pseudomonas chlororaphis (W24), Bacillus cereus (W9), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (W12) were selected for shade house assays because of their higher phosphate-solubilizing abilities. Under shade house conditions, application of W24 or W12 remarkably improved plant height, shoot and root dry weight, and P and nitrogen (N) uptake of walnut seedlings. These increases were higher on combined inoculation of PSB with TCP addition. The most pronounced beneficial effect on growth of walnut plants was observed in the co-inoculation of the three PSB strains with TCP addition. In comparison, the isolate of W9 failed to increase available soil P, nutrient levels in plants, or to promote plant growth, suggesting that more insoluble phosphate compounds than tricalcium phosphate should be used as substrates to assess the phosphate-solubilizing ability of PSB under greenhouse conditions. The present results indicated that strains P. chlororaphis or P. fluorescens could be considered for the formulation of new inoculants of walnut, even of more woody plants.

China has the largest stripe rust epidemic areas in the world and yield losses can be large. Aegilops tauschii Coss, the D-genome progenitor of common wheat, includes two subspecies, tauschii and strangulata (Eig) Tzvel. The ssp. strangulata accession AS2388 is highly resistant to the prevailing physiological races of PST in China, and possesses a single dominant gene for stripe rust resistance. In order to tag this gene, AS2388 was crossed with the highly susceptible ssp. tauschii accession AS87. The parents, F(2) plants, and F(2:3) families were tested at adult plant stage in field trials with six currently prevailing races. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. SSR markers Xwmc285 and Xwmc617 were linked to the resistance gene on chromosome arm 4DS flanking it at 1.7 and 34.6 cM, respectively. Based on the chromosomal location, this gene temporarily designated as YrAS2388 is probably novel. The resistance in Ae. tauschii AS2388 was partially expressed in two newly developed synthetic hexaploid backgrounds.

This method takes advantage of differing adsorption behaviors of pDNA and RNA onto magnetic nanoparticle surfaces at different temperatures. Pure pDNA can be isolated between 70 and 80 C without sacrificing DNA quality and quantity, as evidenced by comparison with that obtained using organic solvents or commercial kits. This RNase-free method is rapid, simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly, and it can be easily scaled up for the production of pharmacological-grade pDNA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study reports the metal-complexation behavior of nitrogen-containing rutin (RuCn) in the organized Langmuir films. Three model compounds with different lipid chain lengths (n = 8, 12 and 18) were designed and synthesized. The monolayer structures and metal-binding activities of RuCn were studied by the monolayer technology, FT-IR spectroscope and thermodynamic calculations (experimentally and theoretically). Results showed that hard Lewis acid-type metal cations, such as Na(I), K(I), Ca(II) and Fe(III), and soft metal cations, such as Cu(II), exhibited clearly different binding activities to RuCn monolayers. The sequence of the effects of metal ions on the monolayer properties and thermodynamic stability varies in the order: univalent ions < pure water < bivalent ions approximate to tervalent ions. Importantly, the typical binding mode (including the binding site and coordination number) of Cu(II) and Fe(III) with RuCn at the interface was clarified. All evidences implied that two primary molecular configurations in the form of O-M-O and O-M-N linkage (M represents Cu or Fe) could account for the unusual structure-property relationship of RuCn monolayers at the air-electrolyte interfaces. These results provided a theoretical basis for the practical applications of such metal complexes as antimicrobials or anticancer drugs in the molecular level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, this paper aims to demonstrate the beta-lactam resistance phenotypes and genotypes of K. pneumoniae isolates from swine in southwestern China, detect possible new beta-lactamase variants, and determine whether or not the variants differ in their antibiotic resistance. Isolates from 58 unrelated diseased swine were collected from 61 pig farms in southwestern China from 2007 to 2009. Among the 58 isolates, 75.8-100% were resistant to beta-lactam, 62.0-68.97% to fluoroquinolone, 44.8-46.55% to aminoglycoside, and 8.62-17.24% to beta-lactam inhibitors. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing showed that bla(TEM-1), was detected in 100% (n = 58) of the isolates, bla(SHV) in 82.76% (n = 48), bla(CTX-M) in 39.66% (n = 23), and bla(OKP) in 17.24% (n = 10). The bla(SHV) types included bla(SHV-1), bla(SHV-11), bla(SHV-12), and bla(SHV-27). None of the isolates harbored bla(KPC), bla(LEN), or bla(GES) gene. Four novel variants (bla(OKP-A-13), bla(OKP-A-14). bla(OKP-A-15), and bla(OKP-A-16)) were identified among the 10 OKP beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates resistant to ampicillin. amoxicillin, oxacillin. cefalexin. and cefadroxil. Plasmid analysis and PCR amplification indicated that bla(TEM-1) genes were detected in the total plasmid. Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of 10 distinct pulsotypes of OKP producer isolates. Plasmid DNA digested with Xbal yielded two to six bands of ca. 0.15-30 kb. Transformants of the 10 OKP producer isolates showed no differences in their antibiotic susceptibility, except for the pulsotype B transformant, which carried bla(CTX-M). In China. beta-lactam resistance appeared to be common among K. pneumoniae isolates from swine, suggesting that K. pneumoniae may be a reservoir for the dissemination of beta-lactam resistance among Chinese pig farms.

A total of 115 products were amplified by 21 primers, among which 106 products (92.17%) were found to be polymorphic. A total of 3 to 8 polymorphic bands were amplified by each polymorphic primer, with an average of 5.48 bands. The data of 115 RAPD bands were used to generate Jaccard's similarity coefficients and to construct a dendrogram by means of UPGMA. The results show that the genetic similarity coefficient of these six species is relatively large, from the cluster diagram, while the genetic relationships are not associated with their geographical distributions.

Nevertheless, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of HAV genome in the process of its evolution is available. In this study, the key genetic determinants of codon usage in HAV were examined. Results: The overall extent of codon usage bias in HAV is high in Picornaviridae. And the patterns of synonymous codon usage are quite different in HAV genomes from different location. The base composition is closely correlated with codon usage bias. Furthermore, the most important determinant that results in such a high codon bias in HAV is mutation pressure rather than natural selection. Conclusions: HAV presents a higher codon usage bias than other members of Picornaviridae. Compositional constraint is a significant element that influences the variation of synonymous codon usage in HAV genome. Besides, mutation pressure is supposed to be the major factor shaping the hyperendemic codon usage pattern of HAV.

Unlike nature enzymes, the BSA-Au clusters have strong robustness and can be used over a wide range of pH and temperature. Because of ultra-small size, good stability and high biocompatibility in water solution compare with other kinds of nanoparticles as peroxidase mimetics, such as Fe3O4, FeS or graphene oxide, it is more competent for bioanalysis. Furthermore, we make use of the novel properties of BSA-Au clusters as peroxidase mimetics to detect H2O2. The as-prepared BSA-Au clusters were used to catalyze the oxidation of a peroxidase substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 to the oxidized colored product, and which provides a colorimetric detection of H2O2. As low as 2.0 x 10(-8) M H2O2 could be detected with a linear range from 5.0 x 10(-7) to 2.0 x 10(-5) M via this method. More importantly, a sensitive and selective method for xanthine detection was developed using xanthine oxidase (XOD) and the as-prepared BSA-Au clusters. The detection limit of this assay for xanthine was 5 x 10(-7) M and the proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of xanthine in urine and human serum sample.

RAPD analysis showed that a total of 5,303 fragments were produced by 136 random decamer primers, of which 84.86% bands were polymorphic. RAPD-based UPGMA analysis demonstrated that the genus Zea can be divided into section Luxuriantes including Zea diploperennis, Zea luxurians, Zea perennis and Zea nicaraguensis, and section Zea including Zea mays ssp. mexicana, Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis and Zea mays ssp. mays. ITS sequence analysis showed the lengths of the entire ITS region of the 14 taxa in Zea varied from 597 to 605 bp. The average GC content was 67.8%. In addition to the insertion/deletions, 78 variable sites were recorded in the total ITS region with 47 in ITS1, 5 in 5.8S, and 26 in ITS2. Sequences of these taxa were analyzed with neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods to construct the phylogenetic trees, selecting Tripsacum dactyloides L. as the outgroup. The phylogenetic relationships of Zea species inferred from the ITS sequences are highly concordant with the RAPD evidence that resolved two major subgenus clades. Both RAPD and ITS sequence analyses indicate that Zea nicaraguensis is more closely related to Zea luxurians than the other teosintes and cultivated maize, which should be regarded as a section Luxuriantes species.

As (III) has a high-affinity to reduced-GSH to form As(SG)(3), and the emission of the GSH-capped CdTe QDs (lambda(em) = 612 nm) is quenched effectively. Thus, a novel fluorescence spectrometric method was developed for As (III) determination by using GSH-CdTe QDs. Under optimal conditions, the quenched fluorescence intensity (F-0/F) increased linearly with the concentration of As (III) ranging from 5.0 x 10(-6) to 25 x 10(-5) mol L-1.

Myelocytomatosis was the most common neoplasma observed in infected flocks; however, few cases of hemangioma caused by ALV-J were reported in recent year. Results: An ALV-J strain SCDY1 associated with hemangioma was isolated and its proviral genomic sequences were determined. The full proviral sequence of SCDY1 was 7489 nt long. Homology analysis of the env, pol and gag gene between SCDY1 and other strains in GenBank were 90.3-94.2%, 96.6-97.6%, and 94.3-96.5% at nucleotide level, respectively; while 85.1-90.7%, 97.4-98.7%, and 96.2-98.4% at amino acid level, respectively. Alignment analysis of the genomic sequence of ALV-J strains by using HPRS-103 as reference showed that a special 11 bp deletion was observed in U3 region of 3'UTR of SCDY1 and another ALV-J strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma, and the non-functional TM and E element were absent in the genome of SCDY1, but the transcriptional regulatory elements including C/EBP, E2BP, NFAP-1, CArG box and Y box were highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all analyzed ALV-J strains could be separated into four groups, and SCDY1 as well as another strain NHH were included in the same cluster. Conclusion: The variation in envelope glycoprotein was higher than other genes. The genome sequence of SCDY1 has a close relationship with that of another ALV-J strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma. A 11 bp deletion observed in U3 region of 3'UTR of genome of ALV-J isolated from case of hemangioma is interesting, which may be associated with the occurrence of hemangioma.

According to the results, the calcium concentration of N6 medium was increased from 1.13 to 5 mmol/l for callus induction and subculture. Uniconazole from 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l and ABT root-promoting powder of 0.5 mg/l were suggested to be supplemented to the regeneration medium and the root generation, separately. On these improved media, the frequency of callus induction, the relative proliferation rate of callus subculture, the regeneration rate and the average root biomass of the regenerated plantlets increased significantly. All these improvements facilitate the establishment of acceptor system from elite parental inbred lines of commercial hybrids and provide a solid basis for transgenic manipulation of maize.

In this study, we prepared Pseudomonas bacteria widowed raise PLGA microspheres vaccine by double emulsion evaporation maltophilia. It was prepared to support the completion of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia oligonucleotide PLGA microspheres vaccine through injection as well as oral and immersion in three ways inoculated based on body weight (100 +/- 5 g) of channel catfish, each has five immunization groups, of which three group were different doses of the immune group, the other two groups were not coated with S. maltophilia raising vaccination with inactivated Aeromonas group and the control group. During the 0, 28 and 56th day, the immunization group were processed in same way. Collection of blood and measuring of immune-related indicators at 0, 7th, 21st, 35(th) and 49(th) day were carried out. At the 63th day, 0.2 ml of each fish at the concentration of 1 x 10(9) cfu/ml of Stenotrophomonas widow raising a single cell suspension of viable bacteria was injected into the Channel catfish. Continuous observation and recording of the results of each group shows that the experimental vaccine preparation of PLGA microspheres encapsulation efficiency was 88.93%, the immunization route vaccine group versus those in saline control group significantly enhance the phagocytic activity of white blood cells, serum lysozyme, complement C3, serum protein content and antibody IgM levels. Channel catfish immunized by injection were challenged with live S. maltophilia, the relative survival rates of group 3 was 9.16% higher than group 5; however group 1 was 15% lower than group 5, group 2 was 1.67%. Another five groups immunized by oral vaccination were challenged with S. maltophilia, the relative survival rates of group 1 to group 3 were 43.33, 65 and 75%, but group 5 was only 6.68%. Conclusively, injection and oral vaccination of Stenotrophomonas widow raising Aeromonas vaccine PLGA microspheres in Channel catfish has a good immune protective effect, while the immersion of the protective effect of various immunization groups was not obvious.

In the present study, intergeneric F-1 hybrids of SHW-L1 - Aegilops peregrina AS24 were produced without embryo rescue. Among the 31 F-1 hybrid plants observed, 20 had the expected chromosome number 2n = 35 and were euploids (genome ABDUS(I)). The remainder 11 plants were aneuploids with 33, 34, 36 and 37 chromosomes, indicating that the neoallohexaploid SHW-L1 was cytologically instable and produced aneuhaploid gametes with 19, 20, 22 and 23 chromosomes, respectively. The hybrid plant lacking chromosome 5B carrying Ph1 showed a very high level of homoeologous chromosome pairing. The absence of Ph gene provides a potent cytological mechanism for DNA introgression among homoeologous chromosomes between newly synthetic wheat and wild species.

In China both spring and winter wheat regions are affected by PHS. Sichuan lies in southwest China, where the most of rainfall occurs during April to September when wheat is harvested. The present investigation was conducted to identify the allelic variability of Vp1, a gene that plays a role in maintenance and induction of dormancy, among Sichuan landraces and recent cultivars with different dormancy levels and to find potential sources of PHS resistance for breeding. Sichuan landrace and cultivar wheat accessions had a wide range of dormancy levels. The average germination index (GI) of Sichuan landrace accessions was 0.232, whereas at 0.674 it was much higher for cultivars. The different dormancy levels between landraces and cultivars indicated that pre-harvest sprouting resistance might have been neglected in recent Sichuan wheat breeding programs. The average GI of white grained accessions was higher than for red grained accessions. Particular Vp-1B gene fragments were specific in landraces or cultivars and in white or red grained accessions. The results indicated that Vp-1B markers could be used to distinguish cultivars and landraces. Significant relationships between certain Vp-1B allelesand GI of Sichuan wheat accessions were shown by Spearman's rank correlation analysis.

It was indicated that the electrophoresis mobility of gliadins from C. delileana had obvious difference with those from common wheat in alpha, gamma and omega region. Using primers designed from published sequences of alpha-gliadin genes, three alpha-gliadin genes were isolated from C. delileana, which were designated as gli-ka1, gli-ka2 and gli-ka3, respectively. Two in-frame stop codons were found in the coding sequences of gli-ka3, indicating that gli-ka3 could be a pseudogene. The gli-ka2 was a gliadin with an odd number of cysteines, resulting from a non-synonymous mutation. This change might lead to the interactive behavior of gli-ka2. Three alpha-gliadin genes of C. delileana had the similar but not identical primary structures to the corresponding gene sequences from other wheat related species. By the alignment of alpha-gliadin genes from Triticeae, phylogenetic analysis indicated that three alpha-gliadin genes of C. delileana clustered together with all alpha-gliadin genes from Ee genome of Lophopyrum elongatum by an interior paralleled branch.

These include four distinct kinds of dispersed repetitive DNA sequences named pSc20H, pSc119.1, pSaO5(411), and pSaD15(940) belonging to the Revolver family. During the evolution of the genus Secale from wild to cultivated accessions, the pSaO5(411)-like sequences became shorter mainly because of the deletion of a trinucleotide tandem repeating unit, the pSc20H-like sequences displayed apparent homogenization in cultivated rye, and the second intron of Revolver became longer. In addition, the pSc20H-, pScl19.1-, and pSaO5(411)-like sequences cloned from wild rye and cultivated rye could be divided into two large clades. No single case of the four kinds of repetitive elements has been inherited by each Secale accession from a lone ancestor. It is reasonable to consider the vertical transmission of the four repetitive elements during the evolution of the genus Secale. The pSc20H- and pSaO5(411)-like sequences showed evolutionary elimination at specific chromosomal locations from wild species to cultivated species. These cases imply that different repetitive DNA sequences have played different roles in the chromosome development and genomic evolution of rye. The present study adds important information to the investigations dealing with characterization of dispersed repetitive elements in wild and cultivated rye.

Evolutionary trends of microsatellites during the speciation process and phylogenetic relationships within the genus Secale	GENOME			English	Article						Secale; inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR); phylogenetic relationship; genetic diversity; evolution	CHLOROPLAST DNA VARIATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GENOME EVOLUTION; CULTIVATED RYE; GRASS GENOME; REPEAT; CEREALE; MARKERS; WHEAT; SEQUENCES	Eleven weedy or wild species or subspecies of the genus Secale L. were compared with a set of cultivated rye accessions, based on inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to analyze their phylogenetic relationships. A total of 846 bands were amplified from reactions using 12 screening primers, including 79 loci with a mean of 10.1 alleles per locus. The number of amplified bands for each primer ranged from 12 to 134, with a mean of 70.5 amplified bands per primer. The presence and distribution of amplified bands in different accessions demonstrate that a rapid evolutionary trend of microsatellite repeats occurred during the speciation process from the perennial wild form to annual cultivated rye. In addition, variation, amplification, and deletion of microsatellites in genomes revealed phylogenetic relationships in the genus Secale. Analysis of the presence, number, and distribution of amplified bands in genomes, as well as the comparison with genetic similarity (GS) indices based on ISSR, indicate that Secale strictum subsp. africanum (Stapf) Hammer, Secale strictum anatolicum (Boiss.) Hammer, Secale sylvestre Host, and Secale strictum subsp. strictum (C. Pres') Hammer emerged in succession from a common ancestor of Secale following geographic separation and genetic differentiation. The annual weedy rye evolved from S. strictum subs p. strictum, which was domesticated as present-day cultivated rye. Data from ISSR analyses separated all investigated accessions of the genus Secale into three distinct groups.

Merr.; reserve material; seed germination; uniconazole		For a better understanding of the effects of uniconazole on the germination of soybean seed, some germination items of seeds and the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen in the germination process of uniconazole power treated seeds on three materials Chengdou 9, Chengdou 13 and Gongxuan 1 were studied. The results showed that the germination rate, germinating potential and radicle length were increased significantly; however, uniconazole most markedly reduced hypocotyl length. Meanwhile, the contents of free amino acids, soluble protein, the total nitrogen, soluble sugar and free fatty acid were reduced, but the content of fat was increased by uniconazole treated in the earlier process of germination; however, their performance was contrary in the later process of seed germination. This suggested that the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of cotyledons were delayed initially, but they would be higher than those of the control once germination starts by uniconazole treatment during seed germination, which is beneficial to degradation of cotyledon's reserve material and seedling emergence.

The results showed that the content of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), soluble protein and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) increased compared with the control (Nd(3+)-free), and the growth of M. aeruginosa was stimulated in the treatments of initial Nd(3+) concentration <= 1 mg/L; while the treatments of initial Nd(3+) concentration was in the range of 5.00-10.00 mg/L, the content of malondiadehyde (MBA) increased immediately but the activity of CAT reduced, which resulted in weakened M. aeruginosa's ability to eliminate the active oxygen and the ruin of antioxidant defense system, and stunting the growth of M. aeruginosa. With the initial Nd(3+) concentration of 50 mg/L, the growth of M. aeniginosa was totally stunted. The ultrastructure showed that excess Nd(3+) could lead to the decrease of thylakoid and the increase of fat particle in cells of M aeruginosa, and the cell membrane became rough and even broken, causing an irreversible damage to algal cells.

The EDTAD-treated magnetic Fe3O4 baker's yeast biomass (EFB) was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), potentiometric titration, zeta potential, and magnetic response analysis. The results revealed that the EFB possessed not only the superparamagnetic characteristic of nano-Fe3O4, but its surface also had plenty of carboxyl and amino groups introduced by the EDTA molecules. The adsorption properties of EFB for Pb2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ ions were also evaluated. The results showed that the uptakes of EFB for the three metal ions were higher than that of FB, and the adsorption capability of Pb2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ ions increased with an increase in pH. The adsorption process was followed by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm equation. The maximum adsorption capacities of 99.26 mg/g for Pb2+ at pH 5.5, 48.70 mg/g for Cd2+ at pH 6.0, and 33.46 mg/g for Ca2+ at pH 6.0 were observed at 30 degrees C. The regeneration experiments showed that the EFB could be successfully reused. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the face of the declining of potato yield and quality as a result of reduction of soil K+ content, it is necessary to determine how to improve the tolerance of potatoes to low-K+ stresses. The protein kinase AtCIPK23 is essential for K+ uptake, and its overexpression significantly enhances K+ uptake and tolerance to low-K+ in Arabidopsis. In this research, AtCIPK23 was transformed into an E3 potato cultivar successfully. In low-K+ conditions, the transgenic potato lines had lower levels of leaf chlorosis, higher K+ uptake rate, increased dry weight and K+ content. The non-transgenic lines displayed reduced stature while the transgenic lines exhibited sustained growth. These results indicate that ectopic expression of AtCIPK23 increases low-K+ tolerance in potato. This study demonstrated the potential use of the transgenic approach to increase potato production in low-K+ fields.

The process is as follows: the tea shoots are photographed with a camera, color space conversion is conducted, using an improved algorithm that is based on color and regional growth to divide the tea shoots in the images, and the edges of the tea shoots extracted with the help of edge detection; after that, using the divided tea-shoot images, the three-dimensional coordinates of the tea shoots are worked out and the feature parameters extracted, matching and calculation conducted according to the model database, and finally the three-dimensional modeling of tea-shoots is completed. According to the experimental results, this method can avoid a lot of calculations and has better visual effects and, moreover, performs better in recovering the three-dimensional information of the tea shoots, thereby providing a new method for monitoring the growth of and non-destructive testing of tea shoots.

In the described studies the performance of 2 vaccines was analyzed: a vaccine containing adjuvanted inactivated NGVEV and a vaccine containing adjuvanted inactivated NGVEV and recombinant goose IL-2. Breeder geese were subcutaneously vaccinated at the beginning of the egg production period with the vaccines. Breeder geese sham vaccinated with PBS served as control. The cellular and humoral immune responses of the vaccinated breeder geese, as well as the presence of maternally derived antibody to NGVEV, were investigated by ELISA, virus neutralization test, and lymphocyte proliferation assay, respectively. A significantly higher immunogenicity (P < 0.05) was induced by the inactivated NGVEV recombinant goose IL-2 adjuvant vaccine compared with the inactivated NGVEV vaccine. The offspring of the vaccinated birds were challenged with virulent NGVEV (100 50% lethal dose) and the protective efficacy of the vaccines was determined. Furthermore, in a field trial the efficacy of the inactivated NGVEV vaccine was recorded from years 2003 to 2007. No clinical signs or abnormal health status were observed in the vaccinated breeder geese and the progeny. After a single application, > 80% protection was shown in the progeny of geese vaccinated against NGVEV challenge for approximately 5 mo. The extensive field trials further demonstrated that vaccination of breeder geese with the inactivated NGVEV vaccine could be a safe and efficacious means to control NGVE disease. Moreover, the level of maternally derived NGVEV antibody titer in the egg yolk reflected the level of NGVEV antibodies in the breeder geese, suggesting that the egg yolk could be used to monitor the vaccination efficacy in commercial goose breeder flocks.

However, to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis in goose primary hepatocytes is unknown. In this study, the effects of palmitic acid on the lipid metabolism homeostasis pathway and on apoptosis were determined. The authors measured the mRNA levels of genes involved in TG synthesis, lipid deposition, fatty acid oxidation and the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TG in goose primary hepatocytes. The results indicated that palmitic acid can significantly reduce the activity of goose hepatocytes, and that palmitic acid had a significant effect on TG accumulation; however, with increasing palmitic acid concentrations, the extracellular TG and extracellular VLDL concentration gradually decreased. With increasing palmitic acid concentrations, the gene expression levels of DGAT1, DGAT2, PPAR alpha, CPT-1, FoxO1 and MTTP (which regulate hepatic TG synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs) first increased and then decreased; the change in PLIN gene expression was palmitic acid dose-dependent, similar to the regulatory mode of intracellular TG accumulation. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that palmitic acid can promote TG accumulation and induce apoptosis in goose primary hepatocytes, and this effect may be related to the lipid metabolism pathway.

We have developed a culture model that enabled investigation of the relationship between embryogenesis and the expression of various ZmSERK genes at different developmental stages and following treatment with hormones. The results indicate that auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) enhanced transcription activity of ZmSERK and promoted somatic embryogenesis. The cytokinin 6-benzyladenine (BA) inhibited embryogenesis and reduced the expression of ZmSERK1 and ZmSERK2, but it significantly increased the expression of ZmSERK3. The application of 2, 4-D and BA promoted the transcription of ZmSERK3 and inhibited that of ZmSERK1 and ZmSERK2, suggesting a fine regulation of embryogenesis by ZmSERK. The immature embryo at 12 and 15 days after pollination (DAP) showed the highest competence for embryogenesis and displayed the strongest ZmSERK gene expression, respectively. Based on these observations, we conclude that the expression profiles of ZmSERKs are closely related to hormone signaling and the developmental stages of the embryo during embryogenesis. ZmSERK1 and ZmSERK2 appear to play an important role in maintaining embryogenesis, while ZmSERK3 appears to have a dual role in embryogenesis by modulating its expression level.

The carp were divided into seven groups and fed diets containing graded levels of PN (0.20, 1.71, 3.23, 4.96, 6.32, 8.58 and 12.39 mg kg(-1) of diet) for 80 days. Results of the study showed that content of malondialdehyde in serum, intestine and kidney tissues was the highest when fed the diet containing 1.71 mg PN kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the protein carbonyl content of intestine and kidney tissue showed a downward trend to a point (P < 0.05). Conversely, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and glutathione (GSH) content in serum, intestine and kidney tissue were generally higher in PN-supplemented diets than unsupplemented diet (P < 0.05). The present results indicated that the PN decreased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in fish, and partly because of its improved antioxidant enzymes activities and levels of GSH.

Jian); thiamin	GRADED-LEVELS; REQUIREMENT; DEFICIENCY; PROTEIN; TRYPSIN; LYSINE	A total of 1050 juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) (8.20 +/- 0.02 g) were fed diets containing seven graded levels of thiamin (0.25, 0.48, 0.79, 1.06, 1.37, 1.63 and 2.65 mg kg(-1)) for 60 days to investigate the effects of thiamin on growth, body composition and digestive enzyme activities. Percent weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency (FE) were the lowest in fish fed the basal diet (P < 0.05). Protein productive value and lipid productive value increased with increasing dietary thiamin levels up to 1.06 and 0.79 mg kg(-1) diet, respectively (P < 0.05). Body protein and lipid increased with increasing dietary thiamin levels (P < 0.05), while moisture and ash of fish carcasses decreased with the increase in dietary thiamin supplementation (P < 0.05). Intestinal folds height had a similar trend to PWG (P < 0.05). Activities of a-amylase, lipase, trypsin, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in intestine were all affected by the dietary thiamin (P < 0.05). In conclusion, thiamin could improve growth and intestinal enzyme activities of juvenile Jian carp. The dietary thiamin requirement of juvenile Jian carp (8.0-60.2 g) based on PWG was 1.02 mg kg(-1) diet.

Three hundred 1-day-old avian broilers were fed on a basic diet (0.2 mg/kg selenium) or the same diet amended to contain 1, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg selenium (Se) supplied as sodium selenite (n = 60/group). Anatomically, the spleens were shrinked in volume with pallecent color. Histopathologically, lymphopenia in splenic nodules and periarterial lymphatic sheaths and congestion of the red pulp were observed in 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg Se group. By flow cytometry method, the percentage of G(0)/G(1) phase splenocytes was significantly increased, whereas the percentages of S phase and G(2)+M phase splenocytes and the proliferation index were markedly decreased in 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg Se groups when compared with those of 0.2 mg/kg group. The results confirmed that excess dietary Se as sodium selenite in the range of 5 similar to 15 mg/kg caused growth retardation of spleen by cell cycle blockage in young chickens.

Their agronomic traits were evaluated in the field and their meiotic behaviors and chromosome composition were analyzed by cytogenetic and GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) techniques. Five lines with 2n = 44 and one line with 2n = 46 showed regular meiosis and were cytologically stable. Based on chromosome pairing, C-banding and GISH analysis, lines 156-4, 160-12, 160-13, 173-2 and 197-16 (2n = 44) were alien disomic addition lines with the addition of one pair of the P. huashanica 5Ns chromosomes. Line 165-2, which had each pair of the P. huashanica chromosomes 3Ns and 5Ns being added, was an alien double addition line. Nine lines with the P. huashanica chromosome 1Ns, 2Ns, 4Ns or 5Ns were alien monosomic addition lines. Robertsonian translocation was observed in lines 241-2 and 241-10. Some chromosomal abnormalities were observed such as telosomics, lagging of telosomics and telosomic sister chromatids that moved to one pole at anaphase I and asynchronous chromosome separation at telophase II. These results indicated that, the presence of alien chromosomes from P. huashanica had influenced the meiosis. Meanwhile, by comparing the series of wheat-P. huashanica chromosome addition lines, the gene(s) for awns were mapped on the P. huashanica 5Ns chromosome.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, one of the centres of origin of cultivated barley, is abundant in hull-less barley resources which exhibit high polymorphism in SGAPs. RESULTS: The SGAPs of hull-less barley from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were analysed by one-dimensional (1-D) SDS-PAGE, 2-D PAGE and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS. In the 1-D SDS-PAGE gel, four proteins including a 80 kDa starch synthase, actin, actin 4 and ATP synthase beta-subunit were identified as novel SGAPs. A total of six different bands were identified as starch granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) and the segregation of the novel GBSSI bands in F(1) and F(2) seeds derived from yf127 x yf70 was in accordance with Mendel's law. In the 2-D PAGE gel, 92 spots were identified as 42 protein species which could be classified into 15 functional groups. Thirteen protein species were identified as SGAPs for the first time and multiple spots were identified as GBSSI. CONCLUSION: This study revealed novel SGAPs in hull-less barley from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China and these will be significant in further studies of starch biosynthesis in barley. 2011 Society of Chemical Industry	[Wang, Chun-Ping; Pan, Zhi-Fen; Liang, Jun-Jun; Deng, Guang-Bing; Long, Hai; Yu, Mao-Qun] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chun-Ping; Liang, Jun-Jun; Deng, Guang-Bing] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Nima, Zha-Xi; Tang, Ya-Wei] Tibet Acad Agr & Anim Sci, Lhasa 850032, Peoples R China; [Cai, Peng] Sichuan Agr Univ, Triticeae Res Inst, Yaan 625014, Peoples R China	Pan, ZF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, 9 Sect 4,Renmin S Rd, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.	panzf@cib.ac.cn; Yumq@cib.ac.cn			Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2006FY110700]; National Science and Technology Supporting Programs [2006BAD13B02-13]; National 973 project [2008CB117012]; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS	This work was financially supported by the Special Basic Research Funds of Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2006FY110700), the National Science and Technology Supporting Programs (2006BAD13B02-13), the National 973 project (2008CB117012) and the frontier project of the Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS.

This disease was well controlled since the widespread use of commercial vaccines, but field MDVs have shown continuous increasing in virulence and acquired the ability to overcome the immune response induced by vaccines. Nowadays, MD continues to be a serious threat to poultry industry, isolation and characterization of MDVs are essential for monitoring changes of viruses and evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines. Results: Between 2008 and 2010, 18 field MDV strains were isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in Sichuan province, China. Three oncogenic genes including Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes of the 18 isolates were amplified and sequenced. Homology analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of these three genes exhibit 95.0-98.8%, 99.3-100% and 97.0-98.5% homology respectively with these of other reference strains published in GenBank. Alignment analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that four amino acid mutations in Meq gene and two amino acid mutations in vIL-8 gene displayed perfect regularity in MDVs circulating in China, which could be considered as features of field MDVs prevalent in recent years in China. In addition, one amino acid mutation in pp38 gene can be considered as a feature of virulent MDVs from USA, and three amino acid mutations in Meq gene were identified and unique in very virulent plus (vv+) MDVs. Phylogenetic analysis based on Meq and vIL-8 protein sequences revealed that field MDVs in China evolved independently. Virulence studies showed that CVI988 could provide efficient protection against the field MDVs epidemic recently in China. Conclusions: This study and other published data in the GenBank have demonstrated the features of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes of MDVs circulating in recent years in Sichuan, China. Mutations, deletions or insertions were observed in these three genes, and some mutations could be considered as the unique marks of the MDVs circulating presently in China. The paper supplies some valuable information concerning the evolution of MDV which is useful for the vaccine development and control of MD in China.

However, its chemistry remains unclear. In present, work, the removal reactions of ethenol by H atom are investigated. The geometries of all species involved in the reaction are optimized at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), and their single point energies are extrapolated to the infinite-basis-set limit at the level CCSD(T). Energies are also calculated at G3B3, CBS-APNO, and CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df, 2p) for comparison. A total of six elementary reactions, including four abstractions and two additions, with explicit transition states are investigated. The results show that the reactions are selective: for abstractions, the hydrogen atom, linked to the oxygen atom, is the most reactive; while for additions, the preferred carbon site is the head "CH(2)=". The rate constants are estimated in the temperature range 300-3000 K according to the conventional transition state theory with the Eckart tunneling model. The dominant channels are the two additions in the whole temperature range. The abstractions can be competitive at high temperature but still do not dominate. The calculated rate constants for the reverse reaction of (R6), syn-CH(2)=CHOH+H <-> CH(3)center dot CHOH, are consistent with the available literature values. Finally, the Fukui functions are calculated to analyze the site reactivity.

The injected mice showed different lethal rate and their typical symptoms include the demonstration of tachypnea and downcast, with mucous stool on their anuses. The tested animals showed visible lesions in livers, spleens, stomachs and intestines. They had serious gastroenteritis and flatulence. Mural stomach and intestines became thin with pallide-flavens mucus. The spleen was tumescent and hemorrhaging. The hepar was seriously tumid and had necrotic regions. The color of the kidney became light and the lung had no obvious change. The LD(50) of the ECPase was 4.33 ug/g.

The intricate networks of TIAs biosynthesis is regulated by all kinds of molecules such as plant signaling molecules (jasmonate acid, ethylene and nitric oxide), plant growth regulators, prenylated proteins and transcription factors. This fine-tuned regulation is also accompanied with compartmentalization and transportation of various alkaloids in different parts of C. roseus. In this paper, we present an analysis of the state of the art related to these molecules regulation mechanism in the TIAs pathway in C. roseus.

We found four mutations: A deletion, G insertion, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) G/A and C/A. A deletion existed in the buffalo and yak breeds. G insertion, (G/A) and (C/A) SNPs existed only in the buffalo breed. Results showed the Chinese buffalo and yak breeds had four mutations. Especially, the buffalo breed had four mutations at least, and the these probably affected the milk yields, milk fat, protein and dry matter percent. So the ABCG2 gene could be studied as a candidate gene effecting milk traits.

More specifically, they summarize the more significant policy changes occurring during the period 2000-2009 (including the rollout of major new programs and agricultural tax relief) while simultaneously tracking impressive improvements in a variety of standard indicators of agricultural performance and rural per capita incomes across China's province-level units. Among other things, the authors draw contrasts between the current (post-WTO accession) and earlier reform period (1980-1985) in agriculture in terms of level of government direction and commitment to develop the sector for its own sake, outline measures undertaken to address problems with the production of tainted and/or adulterated food products, trace significant spatial "reshufflings" of rice and corn production at the provincial level, and offer possible explanations for the outwardly confounding lack of positive relationships between aggregate value of field crops/total value of all agricultural activities and rural incomes at the provincial level. They argue that renewed (yet underpublicized) government attention to the farm sector since 2000 has helped promote social stability in China by increasing food supplies (thus reducing food price effects on inflation), encouraging more sustainable farming practices, and improving rural environmental quality in many areas.

Seven novel miRNA families with one known miRNA were isolated by constructing a small RNA library from a mixture of anther from a cytoplasmic male sterile line and its maintainer. Two miRNAs are conserved in plant species. A total of 18 potential targets were identified for the eight miRNA families, including 15 proteins annotated with function and three unknown proteins. The known proteins include several proteins relevant to cell structure and stress response, transcription factors, and enzymes associated with metabolic and signaling pathways, playing important roles in microspore development. Quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed different expression patterns of the miRNAs between the cytoplasmic male sterile line and its maintainer. Each of the miRNAs tended to be down-regulated after the tetrad stage in a fertile line. However, most of the miRNAs in the cytoplasmic male sterile line were shown to be up-regulated from the tetrad to mononuclear stage, displaying special expression patterns differing from the ones in fertile line. We conclude that additional inactive miRNA pathways are essential during pollen development for a fertile line to ensure male fertility. Contrarily, miRNAs are up-regulated during the period from the tetrad to mononuclear stage, which contributes to pollen abortion for a cytoplasmic male sterile line.

Our action is based on the rationale of monophyly, discrimination, and practicality discussed in detail. Currently Elymus contains a vast number of species with different genomes which often, but not always, can be differentiated by cytological and molecular features, but are difficult to separate by traditional morphology, although an effort to do so is detailed and discussed. This difficulty can be attributed to the dominance effect of a particular genome on the other genome(s) present. Campeiostachys, with genome constitution StStHEYY, is a recent addition to a number of genera recently segregated out of Elymus, i.e. Douglasdeweya (StStPP), Kengyilia (StStPPYY), and Roegneria (StStYY, StStStStYY). A key to Campeiostachys taxa is provided, along with taxa descriptions, distribution, nomenclature, and cytology. Nineteen nomenclatural novelties, or combinations, resulted from this work, 10 species names, and nine varietal names.

The rabbit anti-His-gE serum, raised against the recombinant His-gE fusion protein expressed in Escherichia BL21 (DE3), was prepared and purified. Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that the anti-His-gE serum had a high level of reactivity and specificity and could be used as the first antibody for further experiments to study the distribution of DPV gE protein in DPV-infected tissues. A number of DPV gE proteins were distributed in the bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen, liver, esophagus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and kidney of DPV-infected ducks and a few DPV gE were distributed in the Harders glands, myocardium, cerebrum, and lung, whereas the gE was not seen in the skin, muscle, and pancreas. Moreover, DPV gE was expressed abundantly in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes, reticulum cells, macrophages, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes. The present study may be useful not only for describing the characteristics of gE expression and distribution in infected ducks but also for understanding the pathogenesis of DPV.

The objective of this work was to construct a diploid (2n = 2x = 14) orchardgrass genetic linkage map useful as a framework for basic genetic studies and plant breeding. A combination of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) molecular markers were used for map construction. The linkage relationships among 164 SSRs and 108 SRAPs, assayed in a pseudo-testcross F(1) segregating population generated from a cross between two diploid parents, were used to construct male (01996) and female (YA02-103) parental genetic maps. The paternal genetic map contains 90 markers (57 SSRs and 33 SRAPs) over 9 linkage groups (LGs), and the maternal genetic map is composed of 87 markers (54 SSRs and 33 SRAPs) assembled over 10 LGs. The total map distance of the male map is 866.7 centimorgans (cM), representing 81% genome coverage, whereas the female map spans 772.0 cM, representing 75% coverage. The mean map distance between markers is 9.6 cM in the male map and 8.9 cM in the female map. About 14% of the markers remained unassigned. The level of segregation distortion observed in this cross was 15%. Homology between the two maps was established between five LGs of the male map and five LGs of the female map using 10 bridging markers. The information presented in this study establishes a foundation for extending genetic mapping in this species, serves as a framework for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and provides basic information for future molecular breeding studies.

Gli-cs3 and nine other sequences were much larger and smaller, respectively, than the typical alpha-gliadins. This variation was caused by insertion or deletion of the unique domain I and a polyglutamine region, possibly the result of illegitimate recombination. Consequently, Gli-cs3 contained 10 cysteine residues, whereas there were 2 cysteine residues only in the other nine sequences. Gli-ta/Gli-ta-like alpha-gliadin genes are normally expressed during the development of seeds. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that in-vitro-expressed Gli-ta could form intermolecular disulphide bonds and could be chain extenders. A protein band similar in size to Gli-ta has been observed in seed extracts, and mass spectrometry results confirm that the band contains small molecular mass alpha-gliadins, which is a characteristic of the novel alpha-gliadins. Mass spectrometry results also indicated that the two cysteine residues of Gli-ta/Gli-ta-like proteins participated in the formation of intermolecular disulphide bonds in vivo.

Diets with six levels (0.0, 21.4, 45.1, 69.5, 93.6 and 142.1 mg AA kg-1 diet) of supplemental ascorbyl polyphosphate were fed to juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) (12.63 +/- 0.02 g). The specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency and productive protein value were significantly improved with increasing AA levels up to 45.1 mg AA kg-1 diet (P < 0.05). The hepatopancreas and muscle AA concentrations were increased with increasing dietary AA levels up to 69.5 and 45.1 mg kg-1 diet respectively (P < 0.05). The activities of intestinal trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, alpha-amylase, Na+, K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatinkinase were all positively affected by the AA supplementation (P < 0.05).

To perform a systematic study of vip genes in Bt strains from different ecological regions of Sichuan Basin, 1,789 soil samples were collected from this basin, which is situated in the western region of China. The basin has a complicated geomorphology and contains mountains, forests, highlands, hursts, and plains. A total of 2,134 Bt strains have been screened from the 1,789 soil samples. According to the results, three vip-type genes were found in this basin, namely the vip1, vip2, and vip3-type genes. Strains containing vip3-type genes were the most abundant in our collection (67.4%), followed by vip2-type genes (14.6%) and vip1-type genes (8.1%). The three types of vip genes were distributed in most of the regions, but E Mei Mountain and the Ba Lang Mountains only contained vip3 genes in environments with high elevation, low temperature, insufficient oxygen, and abundant snow. Moreover, five novel vip3 genes were found, and these Vip proteins were toxic for Chilo suppressalis. All the results mentioned above suggest that Sichuan Basin is a rich resource for vip genes.

The results indicate that: (1) the additional dynamic compressive stress depend directly on axle load, the vibration energy at subgrade top surface is relatively larger when vibration frequencies range from 0.5 to 10 Hz, and the dominant frequencies at the top of the natural permafrost table are confined to be less than 3 Hz; (2) the vibration-affected subgrade area is mainly limited to the oval zone of 6 m below sleepers, stress concentration phenomena occur in the vicinity of rail-supporting zone in ballast, the maximum dynamic compressive stress at the bedding superface presents a saddle-type distribution, and certain negative exponential function can be adopted to fit the attenuation relationship of the dynamic stress vs. depth; (3) the dynamic compressive stress of subgrade top surface is the largest in winter, then followed by spring and autumn, and the least in summer, while the corresponding trend is quite the opposite in the interior of subgrade; (4) the dynamic compressive stress surrounding the wide gap decreases with the rise of train speed, however vibration response tends to be stable at certain critical speed, and the critical speed decreases with depth below subgrade surface; (5) the additional dynamic stress at the natural permafrost table can be notably reduced by appropriately increasing the embankment height. The drawn conclusions can, believed by the authors, provide certain theoretical insight for the safety evaluation of QTR operation, vibratory subsidence prediction, as well as the construction of permafrost subgrade.

Milk production and energy efficiency of Holstein and Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cows offered diets containing grass silage	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						energy use; Holstein cow; Jersey-Holstein cow; milk production	METABOLIZABLE ENERGY; NUTRIENT UTILIZATION; PURE HOLSTEINS; GENETIC MERIT; BODY TISSUE; FEED-INTAKE; CATTLE; FERTILITY; LACTATION; CONCENTRATE	Eight Holstein and 8 Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cows (all primiparous) were used in a repeated 2 (genotype) x 2 (concentrate level) factorial design study involving a total of 4 periods (each of 6-wk duration), designed to examine the effect of cross-breeding on the efficiency of milk production and energy use. The 4 periods began at 5, 11, 27, and 33 wk of lactation, respectively. Animals were offered a completely mixed diet containing grass silage and concentrates, with the level of concentrate in the diet either 30 or 70% of dry matter (DM). During the final 10 d of each period, ration digestibility and energy use was measured, the latter in indirect open-circuit respiration calorimeters. No significant interaction existed between cow genotype and dietary concentrate level for feed intake, milk production, or any of the energy use parameters measured. Across the 2 genotypes, total DM intake, milk yield, and milk protein and lactose concentrations increased with increasing dietary concentrate level. Thus, cows offered the high-concentrate diet had a higher gross energy (GE) intake, and a higher energy output in feces, urine, milk as heat, and a higher metabolizable energy (ME) intake as a proportion of GE intake and as a proportion of digestible energy intake. Across the 2 levels of concentrates, the Jersey-Holstein cows had a significantly higher total DM intake and body condition score, and produced milk with higher fat, protein, and energy concentrations, compared with those of the Holstein cows. In addition, the Jersey-Holstein cows had a significantly higher GE intake and energy output in urine, methane, and milk. However, crossbreeding had no significant effect on energy digestibility or metabolizability, energy partitioning between milk and body tissue, or the efficiency of ME use for lactation. Relating ME intake to milk energy output and heat production indicated that crossbreeding did not influence ME requirement for maintenance or energy efficiencies. The energy metabolism data were also used to compare energy efficiencies between "early" (data pooled for the first 2 periods) and "late" (data pooled for the second 2 periods) stages of lactation. Stage of lactation had no effect on energy digestibility or metabolizability, whereas increasing stage of lactation increased the rate of energy partitioning into body tissue and reduced the rate of energy partitioning into milk, irrespective of cow genotype. In conclusion, crossbreeding of Holstein dams with Jersey sires had no adverse effects on the overall production efficiency of Holstein dairy cows in terms of milk production, efficiency of ME use for lactation, and energy partitioning between milk and body tissue.

Glucagon-like peptide-2-stimulated protein synthesis through the PI 3-kinase-dependent Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 300: E554-E563, 2011. First published December 21, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00620.2010.-Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a nutrient-responsive neuropeptide that exerts diverse actions in the gastrointestinal tract, including enhancing mucosal cell survival and proliferation. GLP-2 stimulates mucosal growth in vivo with an increased rate of protein synthesis. However, it was unclear whether GLP-2 can directly stimulate protein synthesis. The objective was to test critically whether GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) activation directly stimulates protein synthesis through a PI 3-kinase-dependent Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. HEK 293 cells (transfected with human GLP-2R cDNA) were treated with human GLP-2 with/without pretreatment of PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY-294002) or mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin). Results show that 1) GLP-2 specifically bound to GLP-2R overexpressed in the HEK cells with K(a) = 0.22 nM and B(max) = 321 fmol/mu g protein; 2) GLP-2-stimulated protein synthesis was dependent on the amount of GLP-2R cDNA and the dosage of GLP-2 and reached the plateau among 0.2-2 nM GLP-2; 3) GLP-2-stimulated protein synthesis was abolished by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor; and 4) GLP-2-mediated stimulation of phosphorylation on Akt and mTOR was dependent on the amount of GLP-2R cDNA transfected and the dosage of GLP-2. In addition, GLP-2-mediated action and signaling in regulation of protein synthesis were confirmed in mouse hippocampal neurons (expressing native GLP-2R). GLP- 2 directly stimulated protein synthesis of primary cultured neurons in dosage-dependent, PI 3-kinase-dependent, and rapamycin-sensitive manners, which linked with activation of Aktm-TOR signaling pathway as well. We conclude that GLP-2R activation directly stimulates protein synthesis by activating the PI 3-kinase-dependent Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. GLP-2-stimulated protein synthesis may be physiologically relevant to maintaining neuronal long-term potentiation and providing secondary mediators (namely neuropeptides or growth factors).

Four levels of N treatments: control (no N added), low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) were set in the present study. The results showed that soil respiration followed a clear seasonal pattern, with the maximum rates in mid-summer and the minimum in late winter. The annual cumulative soil respiration was 585+/-43 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) in the control plots. Simulated N deposition significantly increased the mean annual soil respiration rate, fine root biomass, soil microbial biomass C (MBC), and N concentration in fine roots and fresh leaf litter. Soil respirations exhibited a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, and a linear relationship with MBC. The net primary production (NPP) ranged from 10.95 to 15.01 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and was higher than the annual soil respiration (5.85 to 7.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in all treatments. Simulated N deposition increased the net ecosystem production (NEP), and there was a significant difference between the control and high N treatment NEP, whereas, the difference of NEP among control, low-N, and medium-N was not significant. Results suggest that N controlled the primary production in this bamboo plantation ecosystem. Simulated N deposition increased the C sequestration of the P. amarus plantation ecosystem through increasing the plant C pool, though CO2 emission through soil respiration was also enhanced.

Much is known about the mechanisms that maintain stem cell fates or trigger their terminal differentiation. However, little is known about how developmental time impacts stem cell fates. Using Arabidopsis floral stem cells as a model, we show that stem cells can undergo precise temporal regulation governed by mechanisms that are distinct from, but integrated with, those that specify cell fates. We show that two microRNAs, miR172 and miR165/166, through targeting APETALA2 and type III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) genes, respectively, regulate the temporal program of floral stem cells. In particular, we reveal a role of the type III HD-Zip genes, previously known to specify lateral organ polarity, in stem cell termination. Both reduction in HD-Zip expression by overexpression of miR165/166 and mis-expression of HD-Zip genes by rendering them resistant to miR165/166 lead to prolonged floral stem cell activity, indicating that the expression of HD-Zip genes needs to be precisely controlled to achieve floral stem cell termination. We also show that both the ubiquitously expressed ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) gene and its homolog AGO10, which exhibits highly restricted spatial expression patterns, are required to maintain the correct temporal program of floral stem cells. We provide evidence that AGO10, like AGO1, associates with miR172 and miR165/166 in vivo and exhibits "slicer'' activity in vitro. Despite the common biological functions and similar biochemical activities, AGO1 and AGO10 exert different effects on miR165/166 in vivo. This work establishes a network of microRNAs and transcription factors governing the temporal program of floral stem cells and sheds light on the relationships among different AGO genes, which tend to exist in gene families in multicellular organisms.

However, there is no report on the VP19c protein of duck enteritis virus (DEV). In this study, we expressed the DEV VP19c protein and presented its antigenic properties. Moreover, we developed polyclonal antibody against the VP19c protein and characterized it. Methods: A recombinant VP19c (rVP19c) and N-terminal were expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. The antigenic properties of the recombinant protein were determined by Western blot and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, the polyclonal antibodies against the purified recombinant proteins were produced and the titer of polyclonal antibody was determined by ELISA analysis. Finally, the antibody was used to recognize the VP19c in the cells infected with DEV in the immunofluorescence assay. Results: The N-terminally His-tagged rVP19c and rVP19c(N) were produced as inclusion bodies in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) with molecular weight of about 66 and 46 kDa. Then the proteins were purified to reach the level of homogeneity. Western blot and ELISA analysis that the rVP19c seems to be structurally and antigenically very similar to native VP19c and the N-terminus of VP19c may contain most antigenic linear-epitopes. Furthermore, ELISA analysis demonstrated that the titer of polyclonal antibody was approximately 1:12800, and in the immunofluorescence assay, the antibody was able to recognize the VP19c in the cells infected with DEV. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first report on basic properties of DEV VP19c protein. In the present study, we obtained a high-level expression of the recombinant VP19c protein as well as high titers of rabbit polyclonal antibody against to VP19c protein. The anti-rVP19c serum was able to detect the VP19c protein in DEV infected cells and the VP19c protein targeted to the nucleus as distinct punctate speckles. This specific polyclonal antibody provides a good tool for further studying structural and functional characterization of DEV VP19c.

In a randomized block experiment, their fresh forage yield and dry matter yield were investigated on the basis of growth period, leaf stage, and effective accumulated temperature. The nutritional components were measured in a near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Referring to the concept of forage grading index, a formula was constructed to calculate the total digestible energy. The investigated characters and indexes were adapted to suitable models of growth dynamics. The results showed that these two varieties have strong heterosis in fresh forage yield, dry matter yield, and total digestible energy. Their growth dynamics were adapted to Logistic models described by general equation y=k/(1+ae(-bx)). The forage grading indexes of these two varieties were decreased linearly along with the increasing of their leaf stage. The stopping point of fast growing period of total digestible energy estimated on the basis of leaf stage was suggested to be used as optimal harvesting stage of forage maize. The optimal harvesting stage was estimated to be tasseling stage for SAUMZ 1 and 19.50-leaf stage for SAUMZ 2.

Athyrium wardii (Hook), a new plant with the potential for phytostabilization of Pb, was identified in a field survey of plant species in a lead-zinc mine tailing located in Sichuan Province, China. The growth, Pb concentration and some physiological and biochemical characteristics of mining ecotypes (ME) and non-mining ecotypes (NME) were analyzed by pot experiment employing different concentrations of Pb(NO3)(2) in tested soil during four weeks period. The results showed that the A. wardii has a higher tolerance to excessive levels of Pb soil contamination. The concentrations of Pb in the shoots and roots of the ME were 3.5 and 3.0 times higher, respectively, than those of the NME when plants were supplied with Pb at 800 mg Pb kg(-1). A. wardii of ME showed higher bio-activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) and lower concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and membrane permeability under higher Pb levels, while the opposite tendency was observed in NME. These findings demonstrated that the mining ecotype of A. wardii has the potential for phytostabilization of Pb contaminated soils. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Whole-genome transcription profiling of leaf tissues were analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip. 129 clones showed significant change and 83 clones were classed accurately. Most induced clones were largely involved in various metabolism processes including physiological process, organelle regulation of biological process, nutrient reservoir activity, transcription regulator activity and multicellular organismal process. Putative high affinity nitrate transporter (nrt2.1) showed significant up-regulation under the severe low chronic nitrogen stress condition. Analysis of genes expression revealed several previously unidentified genes, including beta-D-glucosidase precursor gene (glu2), and Cyc3 cyclin3 gene. It suggests that under the said condition, nrt2.1 plays the most important role in N absorption and most of the other genes induced expression to enable the maize to have normal growth. A better understanding of the complex regulatory network for plant N responses among these genes will help and lead to improve N use efficiency.

Kustro using wheat SSR marker Xgwm232. GenBank BLAST search revealed that the sequence of pMD232-500 was highly similar to a part of retrotransposon Nusif-1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using pMD232-500 as probe indicated that only 14 Thinopyrum intermedium chromosomes and all the chromosomes of S. cereale cv. Kustro bear FISH signals, however, no FISH signals were observed on Dasypyrum villosum chromosomes. In addition, the FISH signals were distributed on whole arms except their terminal regions. Further genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis using genomic DNA from Pseudoroegneria spicata indicated that the 14 Th. intermedium chromosomes bearing FISH signals should belong to J genome. Thereafter, the repetitive elements pMD232-500 showed the unambiguous features of genomic constitution of Th. intermedium. In addition, the results in the present study have indicated the similarity of genomes from Th. intermedium and S. cereale.	[Tang, Z. X.; Fu, S. L.; Yang, M. Y.; Zhang, H. Q.; Tan, F.

In this study, the d162(t) gene was fine mapped to a confined region about 0.82 cM by RM14641 and RM3134, and co-segregated with InDel361-2, InDel361-3, InDel361-5, RM14645, RM1022 and RM14643, where no known gene involved in plant height has been identified. Based on the annotation results of TIGR, dozens of open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in this region, among them, five ORFs were the most possible genes related to the phenotype. In these ORFs, Os03g13010, related to U-box domain containing protein, had a 62bp segment deletion in the coding region in 162d (mutant type, MT). The results of RT-PCR showed that the transcriptional level of Os03g13010 was significantly different between Shuhui162 (wild type, WT) and 162d (MT). Therefore, the gene (Os03g13010) encoding a U-box domain containing protein was considered as the candidate gene of d162(t).

Current methods of producing DHs usually need in vitro culture for extracting haploids and chemical treatment for chromosome doubling. This report describes a simple method for synthesizing DHs (SynDH) especially for allopolyploid species by utilizing meiotic restitution genes. The method involves three steps: hybridization to induce recombination, interspecific hybridization to extract haploids, and spontaneous chromosome doubling by selfing the interspecific F(1)s. DHs produced in this way contain recombinant chromosomes in the genome(s) of interest in a homogeneous background. No special equipment or treatments are involved in the DH production and it can be easily applied in any breeding and/or genetic program. Triticum turgidum L. and Aegilops tauschii Coss, the two ancestral species of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and molecular markers were used to demonstrate the SynDH method.

Impact of emissions was quantified in terms of emergy and integrated into the classic emergy-based indicators. Results show that waste exchanges improve the sustainability of the two systems, although the SAPS benefits more from the waste exchanges than the TDPS from an economic perspective however, the impact of emissions reduces their sustainability to some degree.

Morphological characters, inheritance and response to exogenous hormones of a cotton super-dwarf mutant of Gossypium hirsutum	PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						cotton; dwarf; plant height; inheritance; hormone	BRASSINOSTEROID BIOSYNTHESIS; PLANT-GROWTH; CRINKLED DWARF; RICE; ELONGATION; GIBBERELLINS; ARABIDOPSIS; DEFICIENT; INTERNODE; GENETICS	P>A novel super-dwarf mutant, named AS98, was discovered from an interspecific hybrid in 1998. Compared to the normal line LHF10W99, plant height and internode length were significantly shorter in AS98, but it had only slightly (3-5%) fewer internodes. Therefore, the shorter plant height was the result of shorter internodal length. AS98 was crossed with LHF10W99, and the F(1), F(2), BC(1), and BC(2) populations were used for genetic analysis of the dwarf trait. The results showed that the trait was controlled by a single incomplete-dominant gene. Exogenous application of gibberellin acid (GA(3)), brassinosteroid and indol acetic acid showed a significant response to GA(3), which could restore plant height in AS98. The results thus provide a basis for utilizing the dwarf trait in breeding and studying the biosynthesis of GA or signal transduction in cotton.

Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with the LXR agonist T0901317. Total triglyceride accumulation, intracellular and extracellular triglyceride concentrations, extracellular very low density lipoprotein concentration, and gene expression levels of LXR alpha, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, acyl coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1, and DGAT2 were measured in primary hepatocytes. We found a dose-dependent upregulation of total and intracellular TG accumulation when using 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mu M T0901317, but the extracellular triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein concentrations were dose dependent only when the T0901317 concentration was below 1 mu M; as compared with 1 mu M T0901317, 10 mu M T0901317 had an inhibiting effect (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of all the detected genes increased in the presence of T0901317. The change in LXRa and DGAT1 was dose dependent, and the mRNA levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and DGAT2 increased with a T0901317 concentration up to 1 mu M, but decreased when treated with 10 mu M T0901317 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the secretion of very low density lipoprotein plays a role in pharmacologically activating the LXR-induced development of hepatocellular steatosis in geese.	[Han, C. C.; Wang, J.

Compared to the wild-type plants, over-expression of AtNHX1 increased salt tolerance in the transgenic tobacco plants, allowing higher germination rates of seeds and successful seedling establishment in the presence of toxic concentrations of NaCl. More importantly, the induced Na+/H+ exchange activity in the transgenic plants was closely correlated to the enhanced activity of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) when exposed to 200 mM NaCl. In addition, inhibition of V-ATPase activity led to the malfunction of Na+/H+ exchange activity, placing V-ATPase as the dominant energy provider for the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHX1. V-ATPase and vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter thus function in an additive or synergistic way. Simultaneous overexpression of V-ATPase and vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter might be appropriate for producing plants with a higher salt tolerance ability.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can play a major role in enhancing drought tolerance. Plant growth, physiological, and photosynthetic responses of melon plants inoculated with three Glomus species under two water conditions were investigated. Results show that inoculation with Glomus improves the physiological and photosynthetic parameters of inoculated seedlings compared with non-AM seedlings. Regardless of water conditions, plant height, root length, biomass production, antioxidant enzyme activity, soluble sugar content, net photosynthetic rate, and photosynthetic water use efficiency were elevated in AM seedlings compared to non-AM seedlings. Each Glomus species manifests unique effects under the two watering conditions. We posit that AM symbiosis can protect melon plants against water deficiencies by improving their antioxidant activity, bi-directional transport of carbohydrates, and photosynthetic capacity. In addition, regardless of water conditions, the most efficient fungus for melon (Cucumis melo L.) was Glomus mosseae.

Methods available for the control of ticks are mainly based on chemotherapy. However, this approach is associated with a number of disadvantages; searching for alternative tick control measures is necessary and vaccination is one of the best control strategies. Through H. concinna Hc-23 gene PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing, sequence analysis showed that Hc-23 genes could be amplified in nymphal, larvae and adult ticks. BLAST analysis suggested that Hc-23 gene was 99.83% homology with P27/30 of Chinese strains H. longicornis, and 99.67% with Japanese strains, but 88.06% with Rhipicephalus tick troponin I gene. The recombinant Hc23 expressed in BL21 (DE3) with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) was used to immunize 6 rabbits, then another 6 were immunized with PBS and 6 with control FCA (as control) were challenge-infested with ticks at different developmental stages of the same specie. The result showed that ticks that fed on rHc23-immunized rabbits were observed to feed longer compared to the control (P <= 0.05), the engorged body weights of ticks feeding on rHc23-immunized rabbits were lighter than the control (P <= 0.05), and an apparent reduction in laying amount was observed for adult ticks fed on rHc23-immunized rabbits (P <= 0.05). These results demonstrated that the Hc-23 protein might be a useful vaccine candidate antigen for biological control of ticks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, pot culture experiment was conducted to reveal the differences in uptake and use of K among 56 barley varieties. The coefficient of variation (CV) of K uptake (Ku) and K dry matter production index (KDMPI) of these varieties were higher than other indices and both Ku and KDMPI were significantly different among the barley varieties. Furthermore, Ku and KDMPI were positively correlated with dry matter weight (DMW) during the whole growth period; K use efficiency (KUE) and K harvesting index (KHI) were significantly related to dry grain weight (DGW) at maturing stage. Through cluster of these indices, Sandrime and AC Westech were found to be the most K-efficient and K-inefficient genotypes of barley, respectively. Significant differences were observed in uptake and use capacity of K between the two genotypes. During the whole growth period, Ku, K dry matter production efficiency (KDMPE), KDMPI and DMW of the K-efficient genotype were found to be 1.5-1.8, 1.4-2.3, 2.1-3.9, and 1.7-2.1 times higher than those of the K-inefficient genotype, respectively, and at maturing stage, DWG, KUE, and KHI of efficient genotype were higher than those of the inefficient one. The results also showed that Sandrime was the most efficient candidate among the tested varieties for K efficiency and further studies should be conducted to investigate its physiological and biochemical characteristics.

In contrast to conventional approaches using specific morphological markers, this approach can be used for any population derived from diverse parental genotypes. A large-scale experiment was implemented using seven F(2) populations and four three-way cross populations, each with 534 to 1024 individuals. The frequency of HF within these populations ranged from 0.14% to 3.12%, with an average of 1.46%. The highest frequency of HF in both types of population was contributed by the pollen gametes. Using three-way crosses allowed, for the first time, detection of the HF contributed by maternal gametes, albeit at very low frequency (0.14%-0.65%). Four HF events identified from each of two F(2) populations were tested and confirmed using 1032 single nucleotide polymorphic markers. This analysis indicated that only 50% of polymorphic markers can detect a known HF event, and thus the real HF frequency can be inferred by doubling the estimate obtained from using only one polymorphic marker. As expected, 99% of the HF events can be detected by using seven independent markers in combination. Although seed DNA-based analysis may wrongly predict plant genotypes due to the mismatch of endosperm and leaf DNA caused by HF, the relatively low HF frequencies revealed with diverse germplasm in this study indicates that the effect on the accuracy of MAS is limited. In addition, comparative endosperm and leaf DNA analysis of specific genetic stocks could be useful for revealing the relationships among various aberrant fertilization phenomena including haploidy and apomixis.

Immunofluorescence analysis had been used for the detection of virus antigen, but there was no report on the use of this technique for the detection of DPV gE. In this study, we investigated the distribution of DPV gE protein on DPV infected ducks using polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant His gE fusion protein by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: The recombinant gE protein was highly immunogenicity by ELISA, and the gE was used as an antigen for the preparation of polyclonal antibody, which could be used the first antibody for further experiment to study the distribution of DPV gE protein in DPV-infected tissues by indirect immunofluorescence assay. DPV gE protein were distributed in the immune organs (thymus, bursa of fabricius (BF), Harders glands, spleen), the digestive organs (liver, duodenum, jejunum, ileum), and the other parenchymatous organs (kidney, myocardium, cerebrum, and lung) of DPV-infected ducks, but the positive immunofluorescence signal was not seen in the muscle and pancreas. The lymphocytes, reticulum cells, macrophages, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes served as the principal site for the localization of DPV gE antigen. Moreover, the intensity of fluorescence increased sharply from 12 to 216 h post-infection (p.i.). Conclusions: In this work, the immunogenicity of the recombinant gE protein was analyzed by ELISA, and we presented the distribution properties of DPV gE antigen in infected ducks for the first time, which may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of DPV. These properties of the gE protein provided the prerequisite for further functional analysis.

Consequently, it is important to exploit new adult-plant resistance genes in breeding. This study reports the transfer of stripe rust resistance from Aegilops variabilis to bread wheat resulting in resistant line, TKL2(R). Genetic analysis of the segregating populations derived from a cross between TKL2(R) and a susceptible sister line, TKL2(S), indicated that the adult-plant resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici in TKL2(R) is conferred by a single dominant gene. This gene provided resistance to physiological races currently endemic to China, thus indicating its potential usefulness in wheat breeding.

Although they are closely related genera and both of their venoms are very toxic, the compositions of their venoms are very different. To unveil their detailed venoms and their evolutionary patterns, we constructed venom gland cDNA libraries and genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra, respectively. We sequenced about 1500 cDNA clones for each of the venom cDNA libraries and screened BAC libraries of the two snakes by blot analysis using four kinds of toxin probes; i.e., three-finger toxin (3FTx), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), kunitz-type protease inhibitor (Kunitz), and natriuretic peptide (NP). Results: In total, 1092 valid expressed sequences tags (ESTs) for B. multicinctus and 1166 ESTs for N. atra were generated. About 70% of these ESTs can be annotated as snake toxin transcripts. 3FTx (64.5%) and beta bungarotoxin (25.1%) comprise the main toxin classes in B. multicinctus, while 3FTx (95.8%) is the dominant toxin in N. atra. We also observed several less abundant venom families in B. multicinctus and N. atra, such as PLA2, C-type lectins, and Kunitz. Peculiarly a cluster of NP precursors with tandem NPs was detected in B. multicinctus. A total of 71 positive toxin BAC clones in B. multicinctus and N. atra were identified using four kinds of toxin probes (3FTx, PLA2, Kunitz, and NP), among which 39 3FTx-postive BACs were sequenced to reveal gene structures of 3FTx toxin genes. Conclusions: Based on the toxin ESTs and 3FTx gene sequences, the major components of B. multicinctus venom transcriptome are neurotoxins, including long chain alpha neurotoxins (alpha-ntx) and the recently originated beta bungarotoxin, whereas the N. atra venom transcriptome mainly contains 3FTxs with cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity (short chain alpha-ntx). The data also revealed that tandem duplications contributed the most to the expansion of toxin multigene families. Analysis of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratios (dN/dS) indicates that not only multigene toxin families but also other less abundant toxins might have been under rapid diversifying evolution.

Leaf rolling occurs in some cereal genotypes in response to drought. We identified and made a phenotypic, cytological and physiological analysis of a leaf-rolling genotype (CMH83) of hexaploid triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) that exhibited reduced plant height, rolled and narrow leaves. Gliadin electrophoresis of seed protein showed that CMH83 was genetically stable. Sequential Giemsa-C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization showed that CMH83 contains 12 rye chromosomes; two pairs of these chromosomes have reduced telomeric heterochromatin bands. Tests of relative water content and water loss rate of leaves of CMH83 compared with those of wheat cultivars indicated that rapid water loss after drought stress in CMH83 is associated with the leaf rolling phenotypes. Leaf rolling in CMH83 was a dominant trait in our inheritance studies. Triticale line CMH83 could be used to study drought resistance mechanisms in triticale.	[Yang, E. N.; Ren, Z.

In this study, we prepared strips of monoclonal antibody (mAb), conjugated to colloidal gold, as a rapid diagnostic method for detecting antigens to A. caviae. BALB/c mice, an albino, laboratory-bred strain of the House Mouse from which a number of common substrains are derived, were divided into two groups. One group was immunized with 25 mu g formalin-killed Aeromonas caviae; the second group with 50 mu g. Hybridoma cell lines that consistently secrete mAbs against A. caviae were obtained by cell fusion. Two strains of hybridomas (3F3 and 2C9C3) were screened. Subtypes of the two mAbs were IgG(1) and IgM, confirmed by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Titers of 3F3 and 2C9C3 mAb in ascite fluid were 1:10(6) and 1:10(5), respectively. The strains targeted different antigen epitopes: 3F3 targeted the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of A. caviae, while 2C9C3 targeted non-LPS sites. We tested our gold colloidal strips on the hepatopancreas, kidney, and spleen of bacteria-challenged common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, and clinical tests showed the strips can effectively and rapidly identify pathogenic A. caviae in aquacultured fish.

Moribund fish were grossly characterized by cutaneous hemorrhage, fin ray hyperemia, and internal organ hemorrhage. A few affected fish showed a swollen belly with abdominal dropsy. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from cultures of brain, liver, kidney, and spleen tissues of diseased fish. After incubation, pure cultured colonies were observed and biochemically characterized with biochemical tube tests and API 20 Strep. A further phylogenetic (16S rRNA gene) characterization identified them as Streptococcus iniae, and sequence similarities were 99.4-100%. Koch's postulate was fulfilled using our strain (labeled DGX07) in healthy channel catfish. Mortality was 100% in the group challenged by injection (6 x 10(7) cfu/fish) and 43 +/- 5% in the group challenged by immersion (1 x 10(8) cfu/ml). High doses of S. iniae can cause morbidity and mortality in channel catfish.

It has also been found that these materials have the ability to adsorb phenol in wastewater. The magnetic materials were investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, vibrating sample magnetometer, and N(2) adsorption in order to elucidate the morphology, structure, and other properties. When the prepared magnetic materials were calcined at 200 degrees C, the prepared Fe(3)O(4) was oxidized to Fe(2)O(3), possessing loose-shaped holes with a high specific area of 325.2 m(2) /g, a magnetization intensity of 12.5 emu/g, and the N(2) adsorption isotherm belongs to porous adsorption type I. Moreover, the magnetic HAP can adsorb 90% phenol in wastewater. This means that it is an excellent recyclable phenol sorbent for sewage treatment. Experiments confirmed that the Freundlich adsorption isotherms model applies to lower phenol concentrations (0-50 mg/L), while for high phenol concentrations (50-500 mg/L) the Langmuir adsorption isotherms model fits. The magnetic sorbents have the capacity to regenerate after reaching adsorption saturation using ethanol as eluant and external magnetic field as separation unit. The efficiency of adsorption was reduced only by 10% over a six time use period.

The calculated soil Cu concentration that reduced plant biomass fry 50% decreased in M. hupehensis, M. prunifolia, and M. micromalus. This experiment showed that Cu tolerance of M. hupehensis was superior to the other rootstocks. Copper accumulation proportions in shoots or leaves of M. hupehensis were only 0.7-7.4%, which were the lowest among the three species in both control and Cu treatments, and especially were as low as only 40-50% of those of M. prunifolia. The results indicate that Cu-tolerant low-aboveground-Cu-accumulation rootstocks (i.e., excluder rootstocks) could be a good alternative to produce safe fruits with low Cu concentration on Cu-polluted soils without a complete ban on Cu fungicides.

It was observed that HBr-HOAc is an optimal demethylating agent for these two C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids because it could provide different O-demethylation products by using different reaction temperature and reaction time. Especially, 1-O-methyl group in 2 and 3, one of the most difficult ones to be demethylated, could be removed by the treatment with HBr-HOAc at an elevated temperature and a prolonged reaction time.

The chromosome numbers of the populations of BC1 and BC1F1 varied from 2n=42 to 52, and plants with 2n=45 accounted for the highest frequency (19.6%). The distribution of chromosome numbers in all combinations didn't fit to normal distribution, indicating that the distribution of chromosome numbers was affected by some genetic factors. There were different main ranges of chromosome numbers and reduced chromosome numbers per a hundred of plants in BC2 accessions and in BC1F1 accessions. These results indicated that the distribution of chromosome numbers was affected by the genotype of the backcross parents. The effect of CSph2b higher than CS and J-11, and the effects of CS and J-11 were similar in BC2 accessions. However, the efficiency of J-11 was higher than CS in BC1F1 accessions. And chromosome eliminated more rapidly by backcrossing than selfing, and selfing may be facilitate to the screening of partial amphiploids and the recombinant between wheat and P huashanica chromosomes.

FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						root biomass; root length; root length density; root system size; water capture	LYCOPERSICON-ESCULENTUM MILL; EARLY NITROGEN UPTAKE; BUSH PLANT-RESPONSE; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L; GRAIN-YIELD; WATER-USE; GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENTS; GREEN-REVOLUTION; SEMINAL ROOTS	There is little consensus on whether having a large root system is the best strategy in adapting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to water-limited environments. We explore the reasons for the lack of consensus and aim to answer the question of whether a large root system is useful in adapting wheat to dry environments. We used unpublished data from glasshouse and field experiments examining the relationship between root system size and their functional implication for water capture. Individual root traits for water uptake do not describe a root system as being large or small. However, the recent invigoration of the root system in wheat by indirect selection for increased leaf vigour has enlarged the root system through increases in root biomass and length and root length density. This large root system contributes to increasing the capture of water and nitrogen early in the season, and facilitates the capture of additional water for grain filling. The usefulness of a vigorous root system in increasing wheat yields under water-limited conditions maybe greater in environments where crops rely largely on seasonal rainfall, such as the Mediterranean-type environments. In environments where crops are reliant on stored soil water, a vigorous root system increases the risk of depleting soil water before completion of grain filling.

Effect of high dietary copper on the expression of hypothalamic appetite regulators in weanling pigs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						appetite; copper; hypothalamus; pigs	NERVOUS-SYSTEM CONTROL; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; FOOD-INTAKE; ARCUATE NUCLEUS; MESSENGER-RNA; LEPTIN; MELANOCORTIN; PERFORMANCE; OBESITY; WEIGHT	The current study evaluated appetite-related gene expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin, type 2 orexin receptor (OrexinR2), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2 subunit (AMPK alpha 2) and long-form leptin receptor (LeptinRb) in hypothalamus in response to copper (Cu) supplementation. One hundred crossbred pigs were assigned to four groups of 25 pigs, each comprising five replicates of 5 animals. Groups were then randomly assigned to treatments consisted of I. control (10 mg/kg CuSO(4)), 2. 100 mg/kg CuSO(4), 3. 175 mg/kg CuSO(4), 4. 250 mg/kg CuSO(4). On d 21 of the experiment 5 pigs from each group were slaughtered and the hypothalami were collected for determination of appetite-regulating genes mRNA expression level. The results showed that average daily feed intake and average daily gain were higher (P<0.05) in 250 and 175, 250 mg/kg Cu supplemented groups, respectively, than in the 10 mg/kg group. Feed:gain ratio was lower in pigs fed the diets with 250 mg/kg Cu (P<0.05) than in the 10 mg/kg group. Furthermore, the abundances of NPY mRNA in hypothalamus were higher in 250 mg/kg Cu supplemented groups (P<0.05), whereas the abundances of POMC and LeptinRb mRNA were significantly reduced (P<0.05) in 170, 250 mg/kg and 100, 175, 250 mg/kg Cu supplemented groups, respectively. No difference was found for AMPK alpha 2, MC4R, orexin, OrexinR2 mRNA expression (P>0.05). These data suggest that down-regulation of LeptinRb mRNA expression might contribute to the stimulation of feeding of high dietary Cu supplementation via regulation of NPY and POMC mRNA expression.

In this study, changes in developmental gene expression of PPARGC1A in longissimus dorsi muscles were examined in two pig breeds, Landrace (lean) and Meishan pigs (obese) at birth, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days of age using quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicated that there were distinct expression patterns of PPARGC1A in the two pig breeds. At most stages, except at 30 and 60 days, the abundance of PPARGC1A mRNA in Meishan pigs was significantly higher than that in Landrace (p<0.01). Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between the PPARGC1A expression pattern and myofibre cross-sectional area across five developmental stages which implies that PPARGC1A might have an important influence on myofibre growth.

In this study, researchers examined Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the exons of the Myf5, Myf6 and MyoG genes using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods in 360 individuals from 6 commercial pure lines of Sichuan Daheng meat type quality chickens. About 2 SNPs (87T>C and 96C>T) in exon 1 of Myf5, 1 SNP (154T>C) in exon 1 of MyoG and no variation in Myf6 were detected. The 96C>T SNP in Myf5 was a rare variant and was not analyzed further. The association analysis of genotypes with carcass traits revealed that the genotypes of SNP (87T>C) in Myf5 were significantly associated with Live Weight (LW), Carcass Weight (CW), Semi-Eviscerated Weight (SEW) and Eviscerated Weight (EW) (p<0.05). The SNP genotypes (154T>C) in MyoG were significantly associated with Live Weight (LW), Carcass Weight (CW), Eviscerated Weight (EW) and Breast Muscle Weight (BMW) (p<0.05). The results suggested that Myf5 and MyoG genes are potential major genes or are in close linkage disequilibrium with the QTL affecting carcass traits in this population of chickens. The 2 SNPs may potentially have use as markers for Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) in chicken breeding.

The glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP1) has been proposed to play an important role to inactivate toxic metabolites in human malignant tumors. In this study, researchers evaluated the effect of heat stress on GSTP1 mRNA expression in Holstein using semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. With the liver tissue exception, the GSTP1 gene showed relatively high expression level in heart, spleen and kidney tissues in cool ambient temperature. After heat stress treatment, the GSTP1 mRNA expression increased significantly in all studied tissues. We sequenced the 3705 bp fragment containing complete sequence of GSTP1 gene among 15 cows and detected 31 variations. The nonsynonymous variation of G18C (p.M6I) was further scanned in 106 Holsteins using RFLP method to analyze the association of genotypes with heat tolerance ability. However, we did not detect statistical difference of heat tolerance ability among genotypes. To the knowledge, this is the first report to study GSTP1 mRNA expression under heat stress, SNPs distribution and association of genotypes with heat tolerance ability in Holstein. The significantly elevated expression of GSTP1 would suggest the positive role to resist heat stress, especially in liver tissue.

The label introduced into the leaf sheath was distributed and redistributed to young roots, tillers, and young leaves, thus promoting these organs to grow at the initial stage after transplanting. During period from 10 to 30 days after labeling, H-3-assimilate redistribution occurred mainly from the sheath of the main stem; some radioactivity moved to tillers and roots emerged after transplanting. The activity and percentage of H-3-compounds transporting to rooting nodes and roots emerged after transplanting were higher in root-pruned plants than in control, indicating that growth of root-pruned seedlings more depended on the export of the compounds from the sheath of the main stem than growth of control seedlings.

In this study, pES cell lines were established from oocytes of hybrid offspring of Kunming and 129/Sv mice, and pluripotency of pES cells was evaluated. The pES cells maintained in the undifferentiated state for more than 50 passages had normal karyotypes with XX sex chromosomes and exhibited high activities of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and telomerase. Meanwhile, these cells expressed ES cell molecular markers SSEA-1, Oct-4, Nanog, and GDF3 but not SSEA-3 detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The pES cells could be differentiated into various types of cells from three germ layers in vitro by analysis of embryoid bodies (EBs) with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, and in vivo by observation of pES cell-derived teratoma sections. Therefore, the established pES cell lines contained all features of mouse ES cells. This work provides a new strategy for isolating pES cells from Kunming mice, and the pES cell lines could be applied as the cell model in research into genomic imprinting and epigenetic regulation of Kunming mice.

To understand the ecological linkages between the non-growing and growing seasons, soil C and nutrients were measured in the primary fir (Abies faxoniana) forest, fir and birch (Betula albosinensis) mixed forest and secondary fir forest in the subalpine/alpine regions of western China. Soils were sampled as soil thawing proceeded from 5 March, 15 March, 25 March, 5 April and 15 April to 25 April 2009, based on monitored soil temperatures. Frequencies of temperature fluctuations (below and above 0 degrees C) during the soil thawing period depended on the altitude. The soil organic layer showed higher contents and stocks of C, N and P compared with the mineral soil layer. Since the soil organic layer was more directly exposed to environmental changes, the variations of soil C and nutrients in the soil organic layer were more apparent than those in the mineral soil layer. The fluctuations of soil C and nutrients varied with the altitude during soil thawing period. Soil C and nutrient concentrations decreased sharply at the beginning of soil thawing, and thereafter increased in the mixed and secondary forest, which were different to the changes in the primary forest. Soil available nutrients, except for NH4+-N in the primary forest, showed an increasing tendency in the early stage of the thawing period, but soil available N and P decreased in the later stage of the thawing period. The increasing soil temperature had little effect on soil nutrient availability during the thawing period. The results indicated that soil carbon and nutrients were significantly affected by the length of freeze-thaw period, which is beneficial towards understanding the interactions between wintertime and the growing season.

In this study, we cloned the cDNA and promoter sequences of porcine ankyrin repeat protein (MARP) gene family. RT-PCR analysis revealed that porcine CARP gene was predominantly expressed in heart. ANKRD2 was widely expressed in many tissues, a high expression level was observed in the skeletal muscle and heart. DARP gene was expressed specifically in skeletal muscle and heart. Moreover, the expression of CARP and ANKRD2 was significantly different in porcine skeletal muscle among different developmental stages and between the two breeds. Expression analysis in porcine satellite cells showed that CARP and ANKRD2 were induced in differentiated porcine satellite cells, suggesting a role of them in myogenic differentiation. This result suggests that the MARP gene family may be important genes for skeletal muscle growth and provides useful information for further studies on their roles in porcine skeletal muscle.

According to the sequence of exon 1 and 2 of bovine INHBB gene, six pairs of primers were designed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms of exon 1 and 2 of INHBB gene in both high (Small Tail Han and Hu sheep) and low prolificacy breeds (Dorset, Texel and German Mutton Merino sheep) by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Three pairs of primers (primers 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3) were used to amplify the exon 1, and others (primers 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3) to the exon 2. Only the products amplified by primer 2-3 displayed polymorphism. For primer 2-3, three genotypes (AA, AB and BB) were detected in Hu sheep and only AA genotype in other breeds. In Hu sheep, frequency of AA, AB and BB genotypes was 0.636, 0.046 and 0.318, respectively. Sequencing revealed 276A > G mutation (based on the amplification region of primer 2-3) which did not cause any amino acid change because it lay in the 3' untranslated region. The ewes with genotype BB had 0.58 (P < 0.01) lambs more than those with AA in Hu sheep.

In this study, the expression stabilities of 13 selected porcine EC miRNA genes were compared in all 47 tissue-specific normal tissues, 10 types of adipose tissue, and four types of muscle tissue using an EvaGreen quantitative PCR approach. Seven, 12, and 11 genes exhibited credible stability in the three groups, respectively. Our analysis clearly showed that three optimal EC genes are adequate for an accurate normalization, which correlated well with the theoretical optimal number (r = 0.841). In terms of economical and experimental feasibility, we recommend the use of the three most stable EC miRNA genes for calculating the normalization factor, that is, ssc-miR17, -103 and -107 for all 47 different tissues. We also suggest that two sets of EC miRNA genes are appropriate for 10 types of adipose tissue (ssc-miR17, -107 and -24) and four types of muscle tissue (ssc-miR17, -23a and -103), respectively. We envision that these results will serve as a valuable reference for other studies aimed at measuring tissue-specific miRNA abundance in porcine samples.

Twenty-four Yorkshire gilts were randomly allotted to a Control diet (1.8 mg FA per kg) or FA supplemented diet (30.3 mg FA per kg) during pregnancy. The expression of genes encoding DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT-1), genes related to cell apoptosis (p53, Bcl-2 and Bax) and genes involved in DNA repair (Mpg, Apex1 and Tdg, firstly cloned in the present study) were investigated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in the jejunal section of the intestine. Morphological analysis of middle section of intestine revealed a decreased intestinal development in IUGR piglets characterised by mucosal atrophy and decreased villus height compared with NBW piglets regardless of FA supplementation. The expression of p53, Bax, Mpg and Apex-1 was higher, but expression of DNMT-1 and Bcl-2 was significantly lower in jejunum of IUGR piglets compared with NBW piglets. Maternal FA supplementation could dramatically increase DNMT-1 and Bcl-2 expression, and decrease p53, Bax, Mpg and Apex-1 expression in the jejunum section of IUGR piglets. IUGR impaired intestinal development and apoptosis-related gene expressions in piglets, but maternal FA supplementation could improve the apoptosis-related gene expression of jejunum section of intestine.

One hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were randomly assigned to two groups of 60 each and were fed on a low Se diet (0.0342 mg/kg Se) or a control diet (0.2 mg/kg Se), respectively. The relative weight of bursa was significantly decreased in low Se group from 28 days of age in time-dependent manner when compared with that of control group. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that low Se caused an increase in G(0)G(1) phase cells that corresponded to a decrease in S phase cells in bursa of Fabricius. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria injury and increased apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were observed. Low Se increased the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells, as measured by flow cytometry, in comparison with that of control group. These data suggested that low Se diet restrained the development of bursa of Fabricius by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

In order to describe a systematic study of the cry2-type genes resources from Bacillus thuringiensis strains of Sichuan basin, a total of 791 Bacillus thuringiensis strains have been screened from 2650 soil samples in different ecological regions. The method of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to identify the type of cry2 genes. The results showed that 322 Bacillus thuringiensis strains harbored cry2-type genes and four different RFLP patterns were found. The combination of cry2Aa/cry2Ab genes was the most frequent (90.4%), followed by cry2Aa (6.8%) and cry2Ab alone (2.5%), and only one novel type of cry2 gene was cloned from one isolate (JF19-2). The full-length of this novel gene was obtained by the method of thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (Tail-PCR), which was designated as cry2Ag1 (GenBank No. ACH91610) by the Bt Pesticide Crystal Protein Nomenclature Committee. In addition, the result of scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation showed that these strains had erose, spherical, bipyramidal, and square crystal. And the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that these strains harbored about one to three major proteins. These strains exhibited a wide range of insecticidal spectrum toxic to Aedes aegypti (Diptera) and Pieris rapae Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera). Particularly, JF19-2 contained cry2Ag gene had the highest insecticidal activity. All these researches mentioned above revealed the diversity and particularity of cry2-type gene resources from Bacillus thuringiensis strains in Sichuan basin.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of total removal of dietary inorganic phosphorus and reduced energy and protein, without and with phytase supplementation, on the performance, egg quality and bone composition of laying hens. 2. Lohmann pink-shell hens were randomly assigned at 56 weeks of age to 5 treatments for 20 weeks as follows: (1) a positive control (PC) with 155 g CP/kg, 11 center dot 09 MJ ME/kg, calcium (Ca) 3 center dot 40% and non-phytic phosphorus (NPP) 0 center dot 26%, (2) a negative control (NC1) diet based on PC diet with Ca decreased to 3 center dot 30% and NPP to 0 center dot 14%, (3) NC2 diet was formulated on the basis of NC1 diet with 152 center dot 7 g CP/kg, 10 center dot 90 MJ/kg, (4) NC1 and (5) NC2 supplemented with phytase (300 FTU/kg) each. 3. Feed intake, hen-day or hen-housed egg production, egg number per hen-housed, and final body weight were depressed with NC1 and NC2 diets, but restored by phytase inclusion. There were no significant differences between the dietary treatments for feed conversion efficiency, rates of cracked and broken eggs, egg-shell thickness or egg-shell strength. Mortality was significantly increased by NC2 diet without phytase. Tibia ash was significantly decreased by both NC1 and NC2 diets. Bone strength, and Ca and P contents in tibia ash were significantly increased by phytase inclusion in the NC1 diet. 4. In conclusion, the NC1 and NC2 diets significantly depressed performance and tibia quality, but the addition of phytase (300 FTU/kg) significantly improved performance and tibia integrity.	[Lei, Q.

The objective of the research was to investigate the molecular evolutionary relationships between the duck myogenic determination factors (MYOD) gene family members and their roles in muscle development. 2. The four members of the duck MYOD gene family were cloned using RT-PCR, and their relative mRNA expression during duck muscle development was measured using qRT-PCR. 3. The results showed that MyoD and Myf5 clustered together, as did MyoG and MRF4 based on their complete amino acid sequence and the basic helix-loop-helix domain. Results of the evolutionary level analysis were consistent with that of the differential expression patterns during duck breast muscle development. As determined by qRT-PCR, MyoD and Myf5 were highly expressed in 22-day embryos, while MyoG and MRF4 expression was high in 14-day embryos. 4. We conclude that the entire MYOD gene family in the duck originated from a common ancestral gene and evolved after two duplication events. The roles of the MYOD gene family members in duck muscle development are similar to those in mammals.

Effect of dietary energy source on deposition and fatty acid synthesis in the liver of the laying hen	BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article							ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN-1; ACETYL-COA CARBOXYLASE; CARBOHYDRATE RESPONSE ELEMENT; LIPOGENIC GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; TRANSGENIC MICE; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; RAT-LIVER; S14 GENE; GLUCOSE REGULATION	1. This experiment was conducted to determine the effect of different dietary energy sources on hepatic lipid deposition and fatty acid synthesis in the layer's liver. 2. A total of 120 Lohmann Pink commercial layers were divided into three groups of 40 birds each and restricted-fed so that they had similar metabolisable energy intakes. Experimental diets were prepared as follows: (1) maize-soybean meal basal diet (CS) fed at 108 g/d, (2) soybean isolated protein plus lard diet (SL) fed at 63 g/d, (3) soybean isolated protein plus maize starch diet (SC) fed at 94.4g/d. All feed intakes were limited so that the birds consumed similar quantities of the major nutrient daily; all the birds were fed 4 times/d. 3. Compared with chicks fed on the CS and SC, hepatic EE (ether extraction) and triglyceride of the SL group were increased significantly and the total of cholesterol and phospholipids was increased. However, there were no significant reductions in plasma VLDL and ApoB100 concentrations. 4. The birds fed on the maize starch diets up-regulated srebp-1c and chrebp mRNA transcription levels significantly. The maize starch diet also increased the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) significantly. However, the lard diet led to a decrease of ACC activity, but had no significant effect on FAS. 5. These results showed that dietary carbohydrates can induce hepatic lipid deposition by increasing the ACC and FAS activities and up-regulating the srebp-1c and chrebp mRNA transcription levels in the layer's liver much more readily than dietary fat, and layers fed on high carbohydrate diets tend to have more fatty livers.

By combining the Lyapunov functional method with the contraction mapping principle and Poincare inequality, we establish several criteria for the existence and global exponential stability of periodic solutions. More interestingly, Poincare inequality is used to handle the reaction-diffusion terms, hence all the criteria depend on reaction-diffusion terms. These criteria are applicable in Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions on a general space domain. Several examples with numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Diversity and Anti-Microbial Activity of Endophytic Actinomycetes Isolated from Medicinal Plants in Panxi Plateau, China	CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							SECONDARY METABOLITES; RAIN-FORESTS; SP-NOV; ACTINOBACTERIA; MICROMONOSPORA; MICROORGANISMS; IDENTIFICATION; POLYKETIDE; ANTITUMOR; PRODUCTS	Traditional Chinese medicinal plants are sources of biologically active compounds, providing raw material for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and fragrance industries. The endophytes of medicinal plants participate in biochemical pathways and produce analogous or novel bioactive compounds. Panxi plateau in South-west Sichuan in China with its unique geographical and climatological characteristics is a habitat of a great variety of medicinal plants. In this study, 560 endophytic actinomycetes were isolated from 26 medicinal plant species in Panxi plateau. 60 isolates were selected for 16S rDNA-RFLP analysis and 14 representative strains were chosen for 16S rDNA sequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis, seven isolates were Streptomyces sp., while the remainder belonged to genera Micromonospora, Oerskovia, Nonomuraea, Promicromonospora and Rhodococcus. Antimicrobial activity analysis combined with the results of amplifying genes coding for polyketide synthetase (PKS-I, PKS-II) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) showed that endophytic actinomycetes isolated from medicinal plants in Panxi plateau had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and potential natural product diversity, which further proved that endophytic actinomycetes are valuable reservoirs of novel bioactive compounds.

Tangjiahe Nature Reserve (NR) is one of the most important national reserves for giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca in China. Previous studies have shown that giant pandas in Tangjiahe NR may be threatened by population decline and fragmentation. Here we used 10 microsatellite DNA markers to assess the genetic variability in the Tangjiahe population. The results indicate a low level of genetic differentiation between the Hongshihe and Motianling subpopulations in the reserve. Assignment tests using the Bayesian clustering method in STRUCTURE identified one genetic cluster from 42 individuals of the two subpopulations. All individuals from the same subpopulation were assigned to one cluster. This indicates high gene flow between subpopulations. F statistic analyses revealed a low F(IS)-value of 0.024 in the total population and implies a randomly mating population in Tangjiahe NR. Additionally, our data show a high level of genetic diversity for the Tangjiahe population. Mean allele number (A), Allelic richness (AR) and mean expected heterozygosity (HE) for the Tangjiahe population was 5.9, 5.173 and 0.703, respectively. This wild giant panda population can be restored through concerted effort [Current Zoology 57 (6): 717-724, 2011].

The 3Ns Chromosome of Psathyrostachys huashanica Carries the Gene(s) Underlying Wheat Stripe Rust Resistance	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article						Bread wheat; Genomic in situ hybridization; Giemsa C-banding; Psathyrostachys huashanica; Stripe rust resistance	MOLECULAR CYTOGENETIC CHARACTERIZATION; DISOMIC ADDITION LINE; FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT; KENG EX KUO; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; COMMON WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION; AGROPYRON; EXPRESSION; LOCATION	Stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis tritici (Pst)) is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the world. Exploiting and utilizing stripe rust resistance genes of wild species has become an essential strategy for resistance breeding. Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo is a wild species in Triticeae that has been used for wheat improvement because of its high resistance or immunity to stripe rust. In this study, 9 wheat-P. huashanica addition lines were characterized by Giemsa C-banding, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and disease resistance evaluation. Giemsa C-banding and GISH demonstrated that lines 163-5, 165-1, 183-5, 240-3, and 240-4 are P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome monosomic addition lines; lines 183-1 and 183-20 are P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome disomic addition lines; line 165-20 is a P. huashanica 3Ns and 4Ns chromosomes double disomic addition line, and line 219-1 is a P. huashanica 1Ns and 3Ns/5A chromosomes double disomic addition-substitution line. All these addition lines with P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome(s) expressed high resistance or immunity to stripe rust. By comparing the series of wheat-P. huashanica chromosome addition lines, we concluded that the P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome carries the gene(s) for resistance or immunity to stripe rust. These addition lines can be used as a donor source of novel stripe rust resistance to wheat breeding programs. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

The Homoeologous Regions on Long Arms of Group 3 Chromosomes in Wheat and Barley Harbour Major Crown Rot Resistance Loci	CZECH JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						Fusarium diseases; genome mapping; germplasm screening; quantitative trait loci	FUSARIUM-PSEUDOGRAMINEARUM; PLANT HEIGHT; DISEASE; SEVERITY	Crown rot (CR), caused by various Fusarium species, has become an important cereal disease worldwide and growing resistant varieties is an essential strategy to reduce the $A80 mil annual loss from CR in Australia. To facilitate the breeding of resistant varieties, we have screened 2514 wheat and 1059 barley genotypes and identified several lines with high levels of CR resistance in each crop. Initially focused on two wheat and one barley resistance sources, we have identified major QTL with unprecedented magnitudes. Two wheat QTL explain between 35% (LOD 7.6) and 49% (LOD 10.8) and the barley QTL explains up to 63% (LOD 14.8) of the phenotypic variance. One of the wheat QTL has been further assessed in four validation populations, and the presence of this QTL alone reduces CR severity by 33% on average. Surprisingly, all of the three major CR QTL are located in similar regions on the long arms of the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes, the two wheat QTL on 3BL and the barley QTL on 3HL. The possible homoeologous relationship between the 3BL wheat QTL and the 3HL barley QTL warrants further investigation. Relative rearrangements between 3H and 3B chromosomes are unknown, although the relative distances between the different QTL and the centromeres seem to be different. Compared with the barley QTL, the 3BL wheat QTL seems to be more distally located. However genetic distance can be affected by many factors including the use of different populations, thus the differences in genetic distances between the two different genera may have only limited value. The physical map of wheat chromosome 3B, which was recently made available as the first such resources for wheat, would make such a study much easier. Results will be presented on the detection, genetic analysis and mapping of these new sources of CR resistance.	[Liu, C. J.; Ma, J.; Li, H. B.; Liu, Y. X.; Liu, G. R.; Wen, S.

The results showed that the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA was greater at I to 5 and 8 months compared with that observed at I day. In particular, the level of expression of ERalpha and ERbeta at 8 months was greater, 2.47 +/- 0.23 fold and 29.07 +/- 1.25 fold, respectively, compared with that at 1 day (P < 0.05). The expression of ERalpha mRNA was not significantly different at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months (P > 0.05). The level of expression of ERalpha mRNA at 5 months was 1.86 +/- 0.17 fold higher than at 1 day (P < 0.05). The level of expression of ERbeta mRNA at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 months (1.96 +/- 0.13, 2.58 +/- 0.08, 2.08 +/- 0.05, 3.25 +/- 0.11 and 29.07 +/- 1.25 fold, respectively, P < 0.05) was significantly higher than at 1 day. In summary, the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA in the ovaries of geese was increased between newborn and the laying stage. These results suggest that ERalpha and ERbeta mediate the process of ovarian development and egg laying in geese. In addition, ERbeta may play a more important role in regulating the response of the ovary to estrogen during the developmental and egg-laying stages.

Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and no insertions and deletions (indels) were found in exon sequences of WAG-2 from different species. More SNPs and indels occurred in introns than in exons. For exons, exons+introns and introns, the nucleotide polymorphism pi decreased from diploid and tetraploid genotypes to hexaploid genotypes. This finding indicated that the diversity of WAG-2 in diploids was greater than in hexaploids because of the strong selection pressure on the latter. All dn/ds ratios were < 1.0, indicating that WAG-2 belongs to a conserved gene affected by negative selection. Thirty-nine of the 57 particular SNPs and eight of the 10 indels were detected in diploid species. The degree of divergence in intron length among WAG-2 clones and phylogenetic tree topology suggested the existence of three homoeologs in the A, B or D genome of common wheat. Wheat AG-like genes were divided into WAG-1 and WAG-2 clades. The latter clade contained WAG-2, OsMADS3 and ZMM2 genes, indicating functional homoeology among them.

Changes in miRNA expression are associated with many pathologies. Ovarian folliculogenesis and testicular spermatogenesis are complex and coordinated biological processes, in which tightly regulated expression and interaction of a multitude of genes could be regulated by these miRNAs. Identification and preliminary characterization of gonad-specific miRNAs would be a prerequisite for a thorough understanding of the role that miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation plays in mammalian reproduction. Method: Here, we present the identification of a repertoire of porcine miRNAs in adult ovary and testis using deep sequencing technology. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to distinguish authentic mature miRNA sequences from other classes of small RNAs represented in the sequencing data. Results: Using this approach, we detected 582 precursor hairpins (pre-miRNAs) encoding for 732 mature miRNAs, of which 673 are unique. Statistically, 224 unique miRNAs (out of 673, 33.28%) were identified which had significant differential expression (DE) between ovary and testis libraries (P < 0.001). Most of DE miRNAs located on the X chromosome (X-linked miRNAs) (24 out of 34, 70.59%) significantly up-regulated in ovary versus testis (P < 0.001). Predictably, X-linked miRNAs are expressed in a testis-preferential or testis-specific pattern. To explore the potential for co-expression among genomic location clusters of X-linked miRNAs, we surveyed the relationship between the distance separating miRNA loci and the coordinate expression patterns of 32 high confidence X-linked miRNAs in seven normal pig tissues using the real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR) approach. Our results show that proximal pairs of miRNAs are generally co-expressed implying that miRNAs within 50 kb of genomic bases are typically derived from a common transcript. Conclusions: The present study characterizes the miRNA transcriptome of adult porcine gonads, with an emphasis on the co-expression patterns of X-linked miRNAs. Our report should facilitate studies of the organ-specific reproductive roles of miRNAs.

Effect of Tremella fuciformis ferment substance on the growth performance and lipid metabolism of finishing pigs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						Tremella fuciformis ferment substance; growth performance; fat deposition; blood lipids; fatty acid synthase; acetyl CoA carboxylase; pigs	FATTY-ACID SYNTHASE; RATS; OBESE; OLIGOFRUCTOSE; LIPOGENESIS; PROPIONATE; EXPRESSION; MUSHROOM; DIET; HERB	An experiment was conducted to study the effects of Tremella fuciformis ferment substance (TFS) supplementation in diets on the growth performance, fat deposition, blood lipids, and mRNA expression of lipid storage-related enzymes in the liver and adipose tissue of finishing pigs. Twenty eight-week-old pigs (10.03 +/- 0.59 kg) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments: maize-soyabean meal-based diets with (TFS group) and without TFS (control group). The results of the experiment indicate that compared with the control group, the TFS diet led to a significant increase in the average daily gain and feed conversion ratio of pigs weighing 10 to 100 kg. However, the average backfat depth and leaf lard weight were not affected by TFS. Ingestion of TFS specifically decreased the serum triglyceride and glucose concentrations, but did not change the levels of total cholesterol and free fatty acids in the serum. The mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC alpha) in the liver were down-regulated by dietary TFS. Conversely, the gene expressions of FAS and ACC alpha in the adipose tissue increased. The mRNA level of carnitine palmityl transferase-I (CPT-I) in adipose tissue was also increased by TFS. These results suggest that the addition of TFS at a dose of 4 g kg(-1) improves growth performance and lowers lipid metabolism in finishing pigs.

A total of 20 crossbred, castrated boars (20 kg body weight) were fed a corn-soy basal diet (Se adequate, total fat <0.82%) or the diet added with lard at 3% (20-50 kg), 5% (50-80 kg) or 7% (>80 kg) for 180 days. Results showed that pigs fed the high fat diet showed greater (p<0.05) body weight (146 vs. 121 kg), back fat thickness (3.5 vs. 2.3 cm) and abdominal fat content (3.5 vs. 1.9 kg), along with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, compared with the control pigs. About 387 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated and 465 genes down-regulated (fold change >= 2.0) in the high-fat diet group compared to the control group. To further characterize the response of gene type to high-fat diet in subcutaneous fat tissue, 852 genes significantly altered in response to high-fat diet were classified into Gene Ontology (GO) slim terms. Genes involved in. metabolic process, immune response, translation and cell cycle were significantly up-regulated (p<0.05). Genes involved in regulation of transcription, RNA splicing and transcription were significantly down-regulated (p<0.05). The results indicated that the differentially expressed genes including 26 up-regulated and five down-regulated genes were associated with significant pathways involved in organization of metabolism and primary immunodeficiency (NSFC projects 30871844, 30700585).

Moreover, Matrix Metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) was important for embryo implantation. The objectives of studies were evaluated whether IFN-tau and progesterone regulated MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression in cultured bovine Endometrial Cells (bECs). In the studies, bECs were cultured in DMEM-Ham's F12 medium with free-serum. These cultured cells were divided into 4 groups and cultured in. four types culture medium: culture medium without IFN-tau and progesterone (Co group); culture medium including 100 ng mL(-1) IFN-tau (I(N) group); culture medium including 200 nmol L(-1) progesterone (Pr group); culture medium including 100 ng mL(-1) IFN-tau and 200 nmol L(-1) progesterone (I+P group). Cultured bECs were harvested and extracted total mRNA after being cultured for 1, 3, 6 and 12 h and then expression level of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were assessed with fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results showed that MMP-2 expression level in Pr, I(N) and I+P group were extremely significantly higher than in Co group (p<0.01). MMP-2 expression level in I(N) and I+P group was significantly higher than in Pr group (p<0.05). MMP-2 expression level was no statistical difference between I, group and I+P group (p>0.05); TIMP-2 expression level in Pr, I(N) and I+P group was extremely significantly lower than in Co group (p<0.01) and TIMP-2 expression level was no statistical difference among Pr, I(N) and I+P group (p>0.05). The conclusion indicated progesterone and IFN-tau induced MMP-2 expression in vitro cultured bECs whereas, progesterone and IFN-tau suppressed TIMP-2 expression in vitro cultured bECs.

In this study, researchers cloned the AMPD1 gene in rabbit and investigated the mRNA expression in longissimus dorsi muscle at 40, 70 and 90 days old, respectively using real-time PCR method. The association between mRNA expression and IMP content was subsequently studied among 48 individuals from two breeds of Tianfu black rabbit (n = 24) and Harbin albino rabbit (n = 24). Total 899 bp fragment containing entire coding region was obtained for rabbit AMPD1 gene. There is no significant difference of IMP content between the two breeds rabbits in the three studied ages (p>0.05). The slaughter age has significant effect on the IMP content with the highest value at 90 days old (3.41 +/- 0.29) and the lowest values at 40 days old (2.50 +/- 039). Researchers detected the negative correlation between IMP content and AMPD1 mRNA expression (r = -0.916, p<0.05). The AMPD1 gene have not significant effects on IMP contents. The results suggested the potential function of AMPD1 to determine the IMP content in rabbit which is significant to conduct the MAS for improving the meat quality.

In this study, the expression profiling of goat IGF-I and IGF-II genes was investigated in liver and skeletal muscle at six postnatal development stages (3, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days) and two types of muscles (longissimus dorsi muscle, LD; triceps brachii muscle, TB) using relative real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that IGF-I gene was expressed at the highest level in the liver with relatively high expression levels in spleen, skeletal muscle and heart. IGF-II gene was predominantly expressed in spleen, followed by liver and longissimus dorsi muscle, whereas expression in heart was relatively weak. IGF-I and IGF-II genes had different expression profiles during the postnatal period of the goat liver and skeletal muscle development. Moreover, IGF-I was expressed at higher levels in triceps brachii muscles compared with longissimus dorsi muscles. The present study provided the comprehensive understanding of IGF-I and IGF-II expression during liver and muscle development and laid the basis for further studies on their roles in goat liver and skeletal muscle development.

An immunoturbidimetric approach used to determine human CRP in serum that employ a human traceable calibrator has been assessed in pigs in the present research. Intra and inter-assay imprecision of Olympus were lower than that obtained with the porcine-specific commercially available ELISA. The expected difference in CRP between healthy and non-healthy pigs was detected. CRP values determined by the immunoturbidimetric assay showed a good correlation with those by ELISA although, differences in absolute CRP values were observed. When an in-house porcine standard was used a better agreement was obtained. In conclusion, the immunoturbidimetric approach can be used in. pigs. The easier use of this approach should facilitate the implementation of CRP serum determination for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in porcine medicine.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CAST gene polymorphisms on chicken carcass traits. The researchers screened CAST Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in 359 meat type quality chickens from 5 commercial pure lines (S01, S02, S03, S05 and D99; developed from Chinese local breeds), 3 crossbreeds (S01 xS05, S01 xS10 and S01 xD99) and 4 native breeds from Guangdong (Fengkai Xinghua chicken, Huiyang Huxu chicken, Qingyuan Ma chicken) and Guangxi province (Xiayan chicken) in China. Three SNPs (36127T>C, 37752A>T and 37868G>A) were detected by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) method and DNA sequencing. The linkage disequilibrium analyze found that only 37868G>A SNP in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium yet one SNP can not compose haplotype, therefore these three SNPs should be analyzed separately rather than as haplotypes. Association analysis showed that the 37752A>T genotypes were significantly associated with Body Weight (BW), Carcass Weight (CW), Breast Muscle Weight (BMW) and Leg Muscle Weight (LMW). The results suggest that CAST SNP is significantly associated with carcass trait in the twelve studied populations and could be useful in selection for changing meat quality in chicken.

In 60 days feeding trial, a total of 1 200 juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpi var.Jian) (27.26 +/- 0.04 g, mean +/- SD) were fed diets containing. six levels of avilamycin 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 mg kg(-1). After feeding experiment, a challenge trial was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila for 17 days to determine the effect of dietary avilamycin on disease resistance and immune response of juvenile Jian carp. Results indicated that dietary avilamcyin significantly improved weight gain, specific growth rate, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio (p<0.05). Red Blood Cell (RBC) count, White Blood Cell (WBC) count, Hemoglobin (HGB), Glucose in serum and Total Protein in serum (TP) improved with increasing dietary avilamycin concentration up to 50 similar to 75 mg kg(-1) diet (p<0.05) and further increase of dietary avilamycin level decreased these indexes. Survival rate challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila were improved (p>0.05) with increasing dietary avilamycin concentration up to 50 mg kg(-1) and no differences were found with further increase of dietary avilamycin level (p>0.05). Haemagglutinaiton titre (HA), Lysozyme Activity (LA), Acid Phosphatase Activity (ACP), Antibody titre (Ab titre) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) content of juvenile Sian carp challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila all appeared first significantly improved (p<0.05) then slightly decreased (p>0.05).

The amino acid sequences of the porcine myogenin were deduced from the nucleotide sequences to study the amino acid composition and diversity of the porcine myogenin. The following conclusions can be drawn from the experiment. The porcine myogenin consists of 220 amino acids, all of the 20 conventional amino acids can be found in all detected pig breed populations. Only one nonsynonymous mutation happened in Neijiang pig breed caused the substitution of Arg131 -> Cys131, the myogenin has completely identical deduced amino acid sequence in all the other pig breeds. That means mutations happen in myogenin gene mainly are synonymous mutation and the myogenin gene is very conservative. The structure of porcine myogenin is very stable. In all the detected pig populations the values of Ka and Ks in myogenin are very small that means the porcine myogenin gene keeps in a nature status does not be influenced by artificial selection.

The adsorption and desorption of monosulfuron-ester by seven type soils were measured using a batch equilibrium technique. The results showed that the Freundlich equation fitted its adsorption and desorption well, and the Freundlich constant values (Kf-ads) ranged from 0.88 to 5.66. Adsorption isotherms were nonlinear with 1/n(f-ads) values < 1. Soil pH, organic matter (OM), and clay content were the main factors influencing its adsorption and desorption. Adsorption and desorption were negatively correlated with pH 4.0-8.0 while positively correlated with OM and clay content. The adsorption of monosulfuron-ester was mainly a physical process, because its free energy (Delta G) in seven soils was less than 40 kJ/mol. Monosulfuron-ester adsorption by three soils increased with increasing CaCl2 concentration using CaCl2 as a background electrolyte. Monosulfuron-ester desorption was hysteretic in all tested soils.

By a large-scale screening of our T-DNA mutant population, we identified a mutant rice lesion initiation 1 (rlin1), which was controlled by a single nuclear recessive gene. Map-based cloning revealed that RLIN1 encoded a putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Sequencing results showed that a G to T substitution occurred in the second exon of RLIN1 and led to a missense mutation from Asp to Tyr. Ectopic expression of RLIN1 could rescue rlin1 lesion mimic phenotype. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that lesion formation in rlin1 was light-dependent accompanied by reactive oxygen species accumulated. These results suggest that tetrapyrrole participates in lesion formation in rice.

A total of 125 products were amplified by 72 sets of EST-PCR markers developed in barley, among which 106 (84.8%) products were found to be polymorphic. Each EST-PCR marker produced 0-6 polymorphic bands, with an average of 1.47. The relationship between H. duthiei ssp. duthiei and H. duthiei ssp. longearistata is close, but they are remote to H. patula. Hystrix duthiei ssp. duthiei and H. duthiei ssp. longearistata were clustered with Leymus species and Psathyrostachys huashanica, which suggested that they have close genetic relationships. The results of EST-PCR analysis are basically comparable with those obtained from studies on cytology, which indicated that EST-PCR can be used to assess the genetic relationships among the perennial species in Triticeae.

A total of 117 nonreplicate E. faecalis isolates, obtained from 502 clinical samples taken from different pig farms between 2007 and 2009 were included in the study Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the broth microdilution method. All of the isolates were screened for the presence of seven virulence genes (ace, asa1, cylA, elaA, esp, gelE, and hyl). In addition, the DNA from erythromycin-resistant isolates were amplified with primers specific for erythromycin resistance erm (A), erm(B), erm(C), mef(A/E), and msr(C) genes. Results show that erythromycin, tylosin, and ciprofloxacin resistance rates in E. faecalis were 66.67% (n=78), 66.67% (n=78), and 64.10% (n=75), respectively. About 69.23% of isolates (n=81) were positive for gelE, 48.72% (n=57) for ace, 15.38% (n=18) for efa, 7.69% (n=9) for asa1, and 6.84% (n=8) for esp. Among the erythromycin-resistant isolates, erm(B) (n=54) was the most prevalent resistance gene, followed by erm(A) (n=37). A significant correlation was found between the presence of the gelE virulence gene and erythromycin resistance (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that enterococci from swine should be regarded with caution because they can be reservoirs for antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes.

Among four extracts (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, and ethanol), only ethanol extract exhibited the best anthelmintic efficacy with 100% mortality of Dactylogyrus and no death of fish at the optimal anthelminthic concentration of 120 mg/L. Therefore, ethanol extract was subjected to column chromatography to obtain sixteen fractions. The activity was found in fraction F with 100% mortality of Dactylogyrus and no toxicity to fish at dose of 2.0 mg/L. A white crystal was isolated from fraction F and identified as osthole which exhibited the optimal activity with 100% mortality of Dactylogyrus at 1.6 mg/L had and no toxicity to fish at dose up to 6.2 mg/L.

Inorganic P (IP) and organic P (OP) fractions in surface soils (0-20 cm) under typical vegetation types, including subalpine coniferous forests, alpine shrubs, and alpine shrub-meadows, near the alpine timberline of the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China, were measured by a modified Hedley fraction method. The results showed that OP is the dominant soil P fraction and the main source of available P in alpine soils near the timberline. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total P contents were higher in subalpine coniferous forests than in alpine shrubs and alpine shrub-meadows. Concentrations of soil labile P (the sums of Resin-IP, NaHCO3-IP, and NaHCO3-OP) were higher in subalpine coniferous forests than in alpine shrubs and alpine shrub-meadows, an observation that may be partially ascribed to the presence of deep litter layers generated by trees. Concentrations of soil labile and moderately organic P (NaHCO3-OP and NaOH-OP) in subalpine coniferous forests were also greater than in alpine shrubs and alpine shrub-meadows. Greater amounts of soil stable OP (extracted by concentrated HCl and cHCl-OP) were accumulated in alpine shrub-meadows compared to alpine shrubs or subalpine coniferous forests. The reduced availability of OP may be attributed mainly to increasing recalcitrant soil organic matter input in alpine shrub-meadows and alpine shrubs. Concentrations of IP associated with Ca minerals and parent materials (extracted by diluted HCl and HCl-IP, and extracted by concentrated HCl and cHCl-IP, respectively) were lower in subalpine coniferous forests, indicating that coniferous forests are more likely to use recalcitrant IP than alpine shrubs and alpine shrub-meadows. In this alpine region, land cover changes from subalpine coniferous forests to alpine shrubs and alpine shrub-meadows near the alpine timberline could decrease soil P conservation, availability, and supplementation.

In order to identify the impacts of geochemical and environmental factors on birth defect risk, samples of soil, water and food were collected from an area with an unusually high rate of birth defects (study area) and an area with a low rate of birth defects (control area) in Shanxi Province, China. Element contents were determined by ICP-OES, and the results were analyzed using a non-parametric test and stepwise regression. Differences in the level and distribution of 14 geochemical elements, namely arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), zinc (Zn), strontium (Sr), iron (Fe), tin (Sn), magnesium (Mg). vanadium (V), calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), potassium (K) and sulfur (5) were thus compared between the study and control areas. The results reveal that the geochemical element contents in soil, water and food show a significant difference between the study area and control area, and suggest that the study area was characterized by higher S and lower Sr and Al contents. These findings, based on statistical analysis, may be useful in directing further epidemiological investigations identifying the leading causes of birth defects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The intricate networks of TIAs biosynthesis is regulated by all kinds of molecules such as plant signaling molecules (jasmonate acid, ethylene and nitric oxide), plant growth regulators, prenylated proteins and transcription factors. This fine-tuned regulation is also accompanied with compartmentalization and transportation of various alkaloids in different parts of C. roseus. In this paper, we present an analysis of the state of the art related to these molecules regulation mechanism in the TIAs pathway in C. roseus.

As the simplest technique of protein engineering, directed evolution has been applied to many fields, such as industry, agriculture and medicine. An experiment of directed evolution comprises mutant libraries creation and screening or selection for enzyme variants with desired properties. Therefore, a successful application of directed evolution depends on whether or not one can generate a quality library and perform effective screening to find the desired properties. Directed evolution is already increasingly used in many laboratories to improve protein stability and activity, alter enzyme substrate specificity, or design new activities. Meanwhile, many more effective novel strategies of mutant library generation and screening or selection have emerged in recent years, and will continue to be developed. Combining computational/rational design with directed evolution has been developed as more available means to redesign enzymes.

Recently, some new progress were achieved in molecular character of MDV. Along with the genomic sequencing of MDV serotype 1, some novel open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted, and ORF72.2 was one of them which have no homologues in other MDV serotypes or in other alphaherpesvirus. In the study, ORF72.2 was firstly identified as a protein-coding gene by the method of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay. This study paved the way to conduct further studies to determine whether ORF72.2 plays a role in MDV replication and pathogenicity.

The aim of this study was to define an experimental model of hepatocellular steatosis with TO overaccumulation and minimal cytotoxicity, using a mixture of various proportions of oleate and palmitate free fatty acids (FFAs) to induce fat-overloading, then using suppressive subtractive hybridization and a quantitative PCR approach to identify genes with higher or lower expression levels after the treatment of cells with FFA mixtures. Overall, 502 differentially expressed clones, representing 21 novel genes and 87 known genes, were detected by SSH. Based on functional clustering, up- and down-regulated genes were mostly related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, enzyme activity and signal transduction. The expression of 20 selected clones involved with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism pathways was further studied by quantitative PCR. The data indicated that six clones similar to the genes ChREBP, Fox01, apoB, IHPK2, KIF1B, and FSP27, which participate in de novo synthesis of fatty acid and secretion of very low density lipoproteins, had significantly lower expression levels in the hepatocytes treated with FFA mixtures. Meanwhile, 13 clones similar to the genes DGAT-1, ACSL1, DHRS7, PPAR alpha, L-FABP, DGAT-2, PCK, ACSL3, CPT-1, A-FABP, PPAR beta, MAT, and ALDOB had significantly higher expression levels in the hepatocytes treated with FFA mixtures. These results suggest that several metabolic pathways are altered in goose hepatocytes, which may be useful for further research into the molecular mechanism of goose hepatic steatosis. J. Cell.

The results showed that, 20 primer combinations produced a total of 350 clear bands with an average of 17.5 bands per primer pair, of which 153 bands (43.7%) were polymorphic. 324 allelic phenotypes were amplified with an average of 16.2 alleles per primer pair. The genetic diversity mean in Sichuan, Gansu, Tibet and Qinghai provinces was 0.6773, 0.5042, 0.7080 and 0.6816, respectively, while average genetic distance was 0.0418, 0.0657, 0.0605, 0.0921, respectively. The genetic differentiation among different regions ranged from 9.02 to 48.22% with an average of 18.77%. The 68 accessions were classified into four major groups by cluster analysis using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), indicating that the significant relationships between the original regions of accessions were existed. Thus, it is suggested that SRAP could be used as an effective molecular marker in researching barley genetic diversity, and also narrow genetic basis and poor genetic diversity made it imperative to search elite hulless barley germplasm for breeding superior hulless barley.

Three candidate genes with 1077bp coding for fructose-bisphosphate aldolase were cloned and sequenced in wheat, barley and rye. These genes could encode 358 amino acid residues. Sequence analysis indicated that wheat, barley and rye FBA genes were conserved with high identity (94.13%), while maize sequence had a 9bp deletion near the 3' terminal. According to the alignment of 75 amino acid sequences, conserved domains of the FBAs were detected. These conserved domains might be the important functional sites of the FBAs. The cytoplasmic FBAs of wheat, barley and rye were clustered together, and the cluster was close to maize and rice FBAs. Nine peptides of the FBAs and the last amino acid Tyr (necessary for preference for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate over fructose 1-phosphate) were most conserved in plants, animals and algae. Current findings suggested that the FBAs could be divided into three main subgroups: plant cytoplasmic FBA, plant chloroplastic FBA and animal FBA. These results also indicated that the active and binding sites of FBAs had rare variations during the long-term evolution.	[Wang, J. R.; Yan, Z. H.; Zheng, Y. L.; Wei, Y.

Two alleles of the barley waxy locus were characterized from non-waxy cultivar Bowman and waxy cultivar CDC Candle, respectively. Their nucleotide and protein sequences were compared with other known waxy genes. The comparison results indicated that there were 100 polymorphic sites, among which 69 were in the non-coding region and 31 were in the coding region. Out of 100 polymorphic sites, 45 were transversion, 35 were transition and 20 were indels. A 397 bp deletion and a 193 bp insertion in the promoter region and a 15 bp insertion in the coding region were found in CDC Candle, but not in Bowman. A deletion (11 bp) was detected in Bowman, which exhibited no effects on normal waxy expression. In summary, the 397 bp deletion was supposed to account for the reduction of GBSS I, resulting in the low amylose in CDC Candle; whereas other polymorphic sites might be not correlated with amylose synthesis.

Resistance of spinach plants to seawater stress is correlated with higher activity of xanthophyll cycle and better maintenance of chlorophyll metabolism	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						chlorophyll metabolism; photoinhibition; seawater; spinach; xanthophyll cycle	INDUCED PHOTODYNAMIC DAMAGE; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SINGLET OXYGEN; ENERGY-DISSIPATION; PROTOPORPHYRIN-IX; IN-VIVO; LIGHT; LEAVES; CHLOROPLASTS	The relationship between the activity of xanthophyll cycle and chlorophyll (Chl) metabolism was investigated using two cultivars, Helan No. 3 (seawater-tolerant cultivar) and Yuanye (seawater-sensitive cultivar), of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) plants cultured in Hoagland's nutrient solution, with or without seawater (40%). The results showed that, in plants of two cultivars with seawater, the xanthophyll cycle seems to show a principal protection mechanism against photoinhibition under seawater stress. Furthermore, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts of two cultivars was enhanced by seawater to lower the activity of porphobilinogen deaminase. Namely, the conversion of porphobilinogen into uroporphyrinogen III involved in Chl biosynthetic processes was inhibited by seawater. In Helan No. 3 spinach plants with seawater, higher activity of xanthophyll cycle in the leaves dissipated more excess light energy, which appeared to lower the levels of ROS in chloroplasts. As a consequence, the Chl biosynthesis in Helan No. 3 leaves with seawater showed only a weak inhibition and the activity of chlorophyllase (Chlase) was not affected by seawater stress. In contrast, a more pronounced accumulation of ROS in chloroplasts of Yuanye leaves, which possess lower xanthophyll cycle activity, severely inhibited Chl biosynthesis and remarkably enhanced the activity of Chlase, which aggravates the decomposition of Chl. These results suggest that higher activity of xanthophyll cycle in seawater-tolerant spinach plays a role in maintaining Chl metabolic processes, probably by decreasing the levels of ROS, when the plants are cultured in the nutrient solution with seawater (40%).

Antiserum against DSHDV strains HY-99 (hyperimmume serum) was prepared in 30-day-old ducks by vaccination with inactivated DSHDV and used as positive sera. The iELISA test was optimized with different reagents or dilutions. The validation results showed that this assay was only specific for antibodies against duck viral swollen head hemorrhagic disease. The OD(450) value for positive scrum diluted 1:800 was also determined to be greater than the positive threshold. The highest coefficient of variation value was 3.66% for the intra-assay and 5.79% for the interassay, which were all less than 10%. This assay has been successfully applied to the examination of the duck sera clinically. These results in this study indicate that the newly-developed iELISA offers a precise, specific, sensitive, and reproducible means of measuring DSHDV antibodies in duck sera.

We detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; c.108G -> A and c.627C -> T) in the goose MC4R gene and genotyped 94 Landes geese for association analysis with several carcass traits. Significant associations (P < 0.05) were obtained for c.108G -> A with carcass weight, breast muscle percentage, and leg muscle percentage, and for c.627C -> T with body weight, carcass weight, semi-eviscerated weight, and eviscerated weight. We re-constructed haplotypes based on the two SNPs and analyzed diplotypes in association with carcass traits, obtaining significant associations with several of the traits. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the MC4R gene could have effects on carcass traits in Landes geese. More study is required to confirm these results.

Three hundred 1-day-old Avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on control diet (F 23 mg/kg) and high F diets (400 mg/kg, high F group!; 800 mg/kg, high F group II; 1,200 mg/kg, high F group III) for 6 weeks. As tested by flow cytometry, the percentage of renal cell apoptosis was increased with increasing of dietary F, and it obviously rose in three high F groups when compared with that of control group. Renal cells in G(0)/G(1) phase were much higher, and renal cells in S phase, G(2)+M phase, and proliferation index value were much lower in high F groups I, II, and III than in control group. The results showed that excess dietary F in the range of 400-1,200 mg/kg caused G(0)/G(1) arrest and increased cellular apoptosis in the kidney, which might finally interfere with the excretion and retention of fluoride in chickens.

The MB was successfully used for the biosorption of methyl violet (MV) and was easily recycled by using an applied magnetic field. The mechanism of MV biosorption by MB was investigated by SEM, XRD, MR, zeta potential and potentiometric titration. The results revealed that nano-Fe3O4, with spherical and granular morphology, were distributed on the surface of baker's yeast biomass. The functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups found on the surface of MB may be responsible for MV biosorption. The optimal biosorption conditions were determined as pH 6.0, MV concentration 300 mg/L and contact time 30 min. The biosorption capacity in the optimal conditions was 60.84 mg/g. The biosorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm equation. The thermodynamic parameters Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees showed that the biosorption was feasible, spontaneous and endothermic. The desorption and regeneration experiments were investigated and the biosorption/desorption cycles of MV were repeated three times. The MB regeneration efficiency and the MV recovery efficiency were 82.64% and 84.54% respectively in the third cycle by using HAc as an eluent solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NOV.; CHINA; SOIL; BACTERIA; TREES; ACID	A novel bacterium, designated TRM 415(T), belonging to the genus Brevibacterium, was isolated from a sediment sample from a salt lake in Xinjiang province, China. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain TRM 415(T) was phylogenetically most closely related to Brevibacterium album YIM 90718(T) (98.4 % sequence similarity) and had low similarity (<95.5%) to other species of the genus Brevibacterium; however, DNA-DNA hybridization studies between strain TRM 415(T) and B. album YIM 90718(T) showed only 41.3% relatedness. Strain TRM 415(T) possessed meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic cell-wall diamino acid, MK-8(H(2)) as the major menaquinone and polar lipids including phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C(17:0) and anteiso-C(15:0) The genomic DNA G + C content was 69 mol%. Based on the evidence from this polyphasic study, strain TRM 415(T) represents a novel species of the genus Brevibacterium, for which the name Brevibacterium salitolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 415(T) (=JCM 15900(T) =CCTCC AB 208328(T) =KCTC 19616(T)).

The biological roles of REG gamma and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we provide evidence that REG gamma regulates cellular distribution of p53 by facilitating its multiple monoubiquitylation and subsequent nuclear export and degradation. We also show that inhibition of p53 tetramerization by REG gamma might further enhance cytoplasmic relocation of p53 and reduce active p53 in the nucleus. Furthermore, multiple monoubiquitylation of p53 enhances its physical interaction with HDM2 and probably facilitates subsequent polyubiquitylation of p53, suggesting that monoubiquitylation can act as a signal for p53 degradation. Depletion of REG gamma sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptosis, validating its crucial role in the control of apoptosis, probably through regulation of p53 function. Using a mouse xenograft model, we show that REG gamma knockdown results in a significant reduction of tumor growth, suggesting an important role for REG gamma in tumor development. Our study therefore demonstrates that REG gamma-mediated inactivation of p53 is one of the mechanisms involved in cancer progression.

Wheat and its wild related species possess numerous favourable genes for yield improvement, grain quality enhancement, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and constitute a giant gene pool for wheat improvement. In recent years, significant progress on molecular characterization and functional analysis of elite genes in wheat and its related species have been achieved. In this paper, we review the cloned functional genes correlated with grain quality, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, photosystem and nutrition utilization in wheat and its related species.

Primate animals can be infected by the pneumococcus. A disease occurred among rhesus monkeys in winter 2006. Methods Routine clinical observation, necropsies, bacteriological examinations were conducted, and PCR, pathogenicity to BALB/c mice and antibiotic susceptibility test were examined additionally. Results We conclude that the agent is S. pneumoniae. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility test, a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight daily of Erythromycin was given intramuscular injection for 5 days, resulting in the disappearance of clinical signs, and no newly case reappear be observed till today. Conclusions Therefore, it is suggested that the outbreak of respiratory disease in the rhesus monkeys was because of transmission of S. pneumoniae among rhesus monkeys. The antibiotic therapy finding underscores the utility of Erythromycin to cure the infected rhesus monkeys without causing side effects and without contributing to the further development of antibiotic resistance.

To test the hypotheses that (1) soil microbial composition changes over successional stages, and (2) soil microbial diversity is positively correlated with plant species diversity, we determined the soil microbial populations, community composition, and microflora diversity in evergreen broad-leaved forests along a chronosequence of vegetation succession from 5 to 300 years in southwestern China. The soil microbial community was mainly composed of bacteria (87.1-98.7% of the total microorganisms and 10 genera identified), fungi (0.3-4.0%, 7 genera), and actinomycetes (2.1-9.1%, 8 species and 1 genus). There were significant differences in soil microbial populations among different successional stages and within the four seasons. The seasonal variations of the soil microbial community may be associated with the seasonal changes in environmental conditions. The changes in soil microbial diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) with successional time followed one-humped, convex curves peaked at similar to 100 years since restoration, which is identical with the trends of the aboveground plant diversity. Higher plant diversity resulting in enhanced nutrient flow and root exudation may contribute to positive relationships between the soil microbial diversity and plant diversity. Hence, decreases in soil microbial diversity in the late-successional stages appear to be related to the net loss in species richness that occurs after 100 years since restoration. Our findings confirm the intermediate disturbance hypothesis that suggests diversity peaks at midsuccessional stages.

However, it remains unknown whether vitamin E supplement provides protection against PRV-induced failure of pregnancy. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the effect of dietary vitamin E level (0, 75, 375, 750 and 1,500 mg/kg) on the reproduction performance. immunity and expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of PRV-challenged mice. The mortality and abortion rate of PRV-challenged mice decreased with the increase in vitamin E consumption. Overall. PBS-injected mice had a higher live embryo number and live litter size than PRV-challenged mice. Both live embryo number and live litter size of PRV-challenged mice increased with increasing vitamin E levels. Vitamin E supplement resulted in decreased concentration of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but increased concentration of serum IL-10. The concentration of serum IgG, IgA and IgM increased with increasing vitamin E levels. In the uterine and embryo mRNA abundance of TLR3, TLR7 and TUR9 was higher in PRV-challenged mice than that in PBS-injected mice fed on the same dosage of vitamin E. The mRNA abundance of embryonic TLR3, TLR7 and TER9 in PRV-challenged mice decreased with increasing vitamin E levels. Collectively, vitamin E supplement may improve reproductive performance of PRV-challenged mice by attenuating PRV-induced negative effects on the cytokine profile, immunoglobulin synthesis and TLR expression.

The draft genome sequence of the giant panda shows that its umami taste receptor gene Tas1r1 is a pseudogene, prompting the proposal that the loss of the umami perception explains why the giant panda is herbivorous. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced all six exons of Tas1r1 in another individual of the giant panda and five other carnivores. We found that the open reading frame (ORF) of Tas1r1 is intact in all these carnivores except the giant panda. The rate ratio (omega) of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in Tas1r1 is significantly higher for the giant panda lineage than for other carnivore lineages. Based on the omega change and the observed number of ORF-disrupting substitutions, we estimated that the functional constraint on the giant panda Tas1r1 was relaxed similar to 4.2 Ma, with its 95% confidence interval between 1.3 and 10 Ma. Our estimate matches the approximate date of the giant panda's dietary switch inferred from fossil records. It is probable that the giant panda's decreased reliance on meat resulted in the dispensability of the umami taste, leading to Tas1r1 pseudogenization, which in turn reinforced its herbivorous life style because of the diminished attraction of returning to meat eating in the absence of Tas1r1. Nonetheless, additional factors are likely involved because herbivores such as cow and horse still retain an intact Tas1r1.

A total of 620 meat-type quality chickens from six commercial pure lines (S01, S02, S03, S05, S06 and D99) and two cross lines (S05 x S01 and S06 x S01) were screened by using the single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Five SNPs [g.49360G > A, g.48195G > A, g.46847A > G, g.46818A > G, and g.46555A > G] were identified in chicken FATP1 gene. SNP g.46818 A > G was a rare variant and was not considered in the subsequent analysis. Sixteen haplotypes were reconstructed on the basis of the other four SNPs. The linear regression model analysis indicated that there were significant associations of certain diplotypes with part of carcass traits, such as live weight (LW), carcass weight (CW), and semi-eviscerated weight (SEW) (P < 0.05). In particular, diplotype H2H4 had a negative effect on LW, CW, SEW, and abdominal fat weight (AW); diplotype H6H10 had the highest reducing effect on subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT). Our results suggested that FATP1gene polymorphisms were associated with chicken carcass traits or was linked with the major gene. The SNPs in this gene may be utilized as potential markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) during chicken breeding.

We hypothesized that such genes may be involved in the different predispositions between these two species to develop hepatic steatosis. RNA was isolated from primary hepatocytes of the two species, and suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to screen for genes that showed differences in mRNA expression. We built and characterized two reciprocal cDNA libraries that were enriched in genes up-regulated in Landes geese or Sichuan White geese. Using dot blot analysis we identified 128 of 600 randomly selected sequences that demonstrated differential expression between the two species. Of these differentially expressed genes, 115 sequences shared high homology with 46 known genes and 13 sequences corresponded to eight novel expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Based on functional clustering, up and down-regulated genes were mostly related to lipid metabolism, nuclear mRNA splicing, enzyme activity and transcription control. The expression of 18 selected clones was further studied by quantitative PCR. The data showed that eight clones similar to the genes ACSL5, CTGF, CIDEA, PPAR gamma, PCK, GSTS1, RPS4X, and THBS1 had significantly higher expression levels in the hepatocytes of Landes geese. In contrast, seven clones similar to the genes ADH5, YBX1, ASAH1, UCB, AOPVLDL, SCD-1, and ELOVL-6 had significantly higher expression levels in the hepatocytes of Sichuan White geese.

Results show that wastes exchanges can improve the two enterprises' comprehensive performance; however, this is limited for most wastes from the two systems have not been reused. Therefore, more wastes should be exchanged among them and other industrial systems in future. Meanwhile, the two industrial systems should continue to reform their technologies and crafts in order to further improve their resources efficiency due to their great dependence on non-renewable inputs. This study creates awareness, and brings a new insight to the gains achieved with resources recovery from wastes. In addition, other related issues were also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, the nutritional value of starch largely depends on its amylose and amylopectin ratio. In this study, the overall metabolic and transcriptomic responses of weaned pigs fed with different dietary starches were assessed. Sixteen weaned pigs were randomly allotted to two experimental diets containing either of pure cassava starch (CS) or maize starch (MS) as the sole energy source (the amylose-amylopectin ratio were 0.25 and 0.43, respectively). Results indicated that the body weight gain was not affected by different dietary starches. However, a moderate fatty liver was observed in CS-fed group. Long-term ingestion of CS not only increased the total liver fat content, but significantly elevated the liver triglyceride and cholesterol content (P < 0.05). In addition, the serum insulin and cholesterol concentrations were both elevated in CS-fed group (P < 0.05). Microarray analysis led to the identification of 648 genes differentially expressed in liver (P < 0.05), and a lot of them were involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, pathway analysis indicated that both the insulin and PPAR signaling pathways were acutely affected by dietary amylose-amylopectin ratio. Long-term ingestion of CS activated the transcription of lipogenic genes such as hmgr and fasn, but decreased the expression of lipolytic genes such as aox1, ppara and fbp. The microarray results correlated well with the measurements of several key enzymes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. Our results suggested that both the metabolic and transcriptomic responses of weaned pigs were tightly regulated by dietary starch composition, and a high amylose ratio starch (i.e MS) may be more healthful for mammals as the long-term energy source by down-regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and steroidogenesis.

Results: In this study, an envelope protein gene, gC (NCBI GenBank accession no. EU076811), was expressed and characterized from duck plague virus (DPV), a member of the family herpesviridae. The gene encodes a protein of 432 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45 kDa. Sequence comparisons, multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed that DPV gC has several features common to other identified herpesvirus gC, and was genetically close to the gallid herpervirus. Antibodies raised in rabbits against the pET32a-gC recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) recognized a 45-KDa DPV-specific protein from infected duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells. Transcriptional and expression analysis, using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) and Western blot detection, revealed that the transcripts encoding DPV gC and the protein itself appeared late during infection of DEF cells. Immunofluorescence localization further demonstrated that the gC protein exhibited substantial cytoplasm fluorescence in DPV-infected DEF cells. Conclusions: In this work, the DPV gC protein was successfully expressed in a prokaryotic expression system, and we presented the basic properties of the DPV gC product for the first time. These properties of the gC protein provided a prerequisite for further functional analysis of this gene.

A gene coding the y type HMW-GS at Glu-A1 locus in Triticum urartu (AA, 2n = 2x = 14) with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of 1Dy12, was cloned, sequenced, and heterologously expressed. This novel active 1 Ay gene FJ404595 was confirmed by structure analyses of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences combining with phylogenetic analysis. The open reading frame (ORF) of this gene was 1 830 bp, encoded a protein of 608 amino acid residues containing 46 hexapeptides and 14 nonapeptides, which was mostly similar to the 1 Ay gene AM183223 at a high identity of 99.62% with the two substitutions of both leucine/proline and valine/glutamate, obviously different from the I Ay gene EU984504 with 587 residues containing 44 hexapeptides and 13 nonapeptides in T. urartu. The amino acid (leucine) at 446 differed from that (proline) of all the eight compared active 1Ay subunits. The predicted secondary protein structure implied that this 1Ay subunit might also have positive impact on flour processing quality.

Recently, using biomarkers to monitor the effects of pollutants has attracted increased interest. Pot culture experiments using radish (Raphanus sativus L) was performed to investigate Cu phytotoxic effects on antioxidant enzymes and other early warning biomarkers of soil Cu exposure. Under low dose Cu stress (lower than the EC10. Cu concentration reducing root length by 10%), activity and isozyme expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidases (POD) increased significantly; no significant variations in chlorophyll, carotenoid, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in leaves and toxic symptoms were observed. Under a slightly higher Cu stress (close to the EC10), activity and isozyme expression of SOD and MDA content were enhanced significantly; those of CAT and POD decreased due to an inverted U-shape dose response. Chlorophyll content remained unchanged. Thus, antioxidant enzymes and MDA content are more sensitive to Cu stress, showing significant variations ahead of chlorophyll and toxic symptoms under Cu stress (lower than about 200 mg kg(-1) soil). Thus, the joint monitoring of antioxidant enzymes and MDA content of R. sativus can be used as biomarkers of soil Cu contamination. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These approaches were achieved using 2,052 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, including 659 SNPs developed from drought-response candidate genes, screened across three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations and 305 diverse inbred lines, with anthesis-silking interval (ASI), an important trait for maize drought tolerance, as the target trait. Mapping efficiency was improved significantly due to increased population size and allele diversity and balanced allele frequencies. Integrated mapping identified 18 additional quantitative trait loci (QTL) not detected by parallel mapping. The use of haplotypes improved mapping efficiency, with the sum of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) increasing from 5.4% to 23.3% for single SNP-based analysis. Integrated mapping with haplotype further improved the mapping efficiency, and the most significant QTL had a PVE of up to 34.7%. Normal allele frequencies for 113 of 277 (40.8%) SNPs with minor allele frequency (<5%) in 305 lines were recovered in three RIL populations, three of which were significantly associated with ASI. The candidate genes identified by two significant haplotype loci included one for a SET domain protein involved in the control of flowering time and the other encoding aldo/keto reductase associated with detoxification pathways that contribute to cellular damage due to environmental stress. Joint linkage-LD mapping is a powerful approach for detecting QTL underlying complex traits, including drought tolerance.

A. Love et Connor is a perennial octoploid (2n = 56) wheatgrass endemic to New Zealand. To investigate its genomic constitution, four artificial interspecific hybrids between E. tenuis and E. enysii (2n = 4x = 28, HW), and E. solandri (2n = 6x = 42, StYW) and E. multiflorus (2n = 6x = 42, StYW) were studied cytologically. Meioses in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the hybrids showed relatively high chromosome pairing, with an average of 13.50 in E. enysii x E. tenuis, 20.22 in E. solandri x E. tenuis, 19.62 in E. multiflorus x E. tenuis, and 20.00 in E. tenuis x E. multiflorus bivalents per cell, respectively. The results indicate that E. tenuis is an allo-octoploid species, with the new and unique genomic constitution StYHW. An autochthonous origin is proposed for it.

NOV.; IDENTIFICATION; TAXA; SOIL; CLASSIFICATION; DEFINITION	A novel halophilic, filamentous actinobacterium, designated TRM 40136(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. The strain is aerobic, Gram-positive, halophilic, and the optimum NaCl concentration for growth is 10-15% (w/v). The whole-cell sugar pattern consists of xylose, glucose and arabinose. The predominant menaquinone is MK-6 (51.2%) and the major fatty acids are anteiso-C15:0 (35.2%), anteiso-C17:0 (15.9%) and iso-C15:0 (13.7%). The phospholipid pattern consists of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and two unknown phospholipids. The G + C content of the genomic DNA is 68.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain TRM 40136(T) had 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96.1% with the closest described species Actinopolyspora mortivallis, and it can be distinguished from all species in the genus Actinopolyspora by using these data of polyphasic taxonomy study. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence, the strain TRM 40136(T) should be designated as a novel species of the genus Actinopolyspora for which the name Actinopolyspora xinjiangensis sp.nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 40136(T) (=CCTCC AA 209080(T) = KCTC 19656(T)).

In cultured skeletal muscle cells, CrSP was able to increase the basal and insulin-stimulated levels of protein deposition in skeletal muscles cells. CrCl(3) and CrPic augmented insulin-stimulated protein synthesis. At the molecular level, insulin significantly increased the mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. These impacts could be enhanced by the addition of chromium, especially CrSP. The mRNA levels of ubiquitin were significantly reduced when cells were cultured with chromium or/and insulin. Assuming that the mRNA level increase or decrease results in increased or decreased levels of these proteins, chromium would improve protein anabolism and reduce protein catabolism and then prove protein deposition in rat skeletal muscle cells.

The aim of the present study was to test the effects of feeding growing rats with balanced diets containing soya protein isolate, zein and casein as the sole protein source on the expression of genes related to protein metabolism responses in skeletal muscle. The results showed that feeding a zein protein diet to the growing rats induced changes in protein anabolic and catabolic metabolism in their gastrocnemius muscles when compared with those fed either the reference protein casein diet or the soya protein isolate diet. The zein protein diet increased not only the mRNA levels and phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), but also the mRNA expression of muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)/atrogin-1 and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1), as well as the forkhead box-O (FoxO) transcription factors involved in the induction of the E3 ligases. The amino acid profile of proteins seems to control signalling pathways leading to changes in protein synthesis and proteolysis.

The utilization of resistant cultivars is the most economical and environmentally safe method for controlling this disease. This work aims to screen the effective sources of special and partial resistance for the development of resistant cultivars. A total of 611 soybean germplasm lines from three ecological regions were evaluated for their responses to three P. sojae strains, namely, PNJ1, PNJ3, and PNJ4, using the hypocotyl inoculation technique. The soybean germplasm lines elicited eight different reaction types with three strains. Among these, 106 were resistant and 253 were susceptible to the three strains. A total of 123 soybean germplasm lines identified as susceptible to the three strains by the hypocotyl inoculation method were evaluated for partial resistance to PNJ1 using the slant board assay. Thirty-nine cultivars displayed high levels of partial resistance to PNJ1. The results of this study can be utilized to plant appropriately resistant cultivars in infected fields and to provide good breeding materials.

Simple and rapid detection of Salmonella serovar Enteritidis under field conditions by loop-mediated isothermal amplification	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						LAMP; real-time PCR; Salmonella enteritidis; Serovar-specific	ENTERICA; FOOD	Aim: The objective of this study is to develop a serovar-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive detection of Salmonella serovar Enteritidis under field conditions. Methods: A set of six specific primers was designed with Salmonella Enteritidis DNA as the target. LAMP conditions were optimized by incubating the target DNA with the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment in a simple water bath. The sensitivity and specificity of LAMP was then compared with those of fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR). Results: The results were as follows. (1) Serovar-specific Salmonella Enteritidis DNA was amplified at 65 degrees C in as early as 20 min in a water bath. (2) A colour change visible to the naked eye indicated a positive amplification reaction. (3) The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 4 copies mu l-1; thus, the sensitivity and specificity of this assay is similar to those of the FQ-PCR. Conclusions: LAMP is a high-throughput detection technique with high sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity; these factors make it suitable for specifically detecting Salmonella Enteritidis under field conditions and in laboratory settings. Thus, LAMP eliminates the need for complicated equipment and technical training in the detection of this specific serovar. Significance and impact of the study: This is the first study involving the use of LAMP to detect Salmonella serovar-specific DNA sequences. It is also the first to report an ideal method of distinguishing between Salmonella Enteritidis and other Salmonella under field conditions.

Based on the defined species-specific variations, two endonucleases, Alu I and Bfa I, were selected for species authentication using raw meat/tissue samples and the PCR-RFLP method. Goat and pig were identified using the Alu I enzyme, while cattle, yak, and buffalo were identified by digestion with Bfa I. Our approach had relatively high detection sensitivity of cattle DNA in mixed cattle and yak products, with the lowest detectable threshold equaling 20% of cattle DNA in a mixed cattle/yak sample. This method was successfully used to type commercial beef jerky products, which were produced by different companies utilizing various processing technologies. Our results show that several yak jerky products might be implicated in commercial fraud by using cattle meat instead of yak meat.

Humoral and cellular immune responses in adult geese induced by an inactivated vaccine against new type gosling viral enteritis virus	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						new type gosling viral enteritis virus; inactivated vaccine; recombinant goose interleukin-2; immunogenicity; adult geese	DUCK EMBRYO FIBROBLASTS; CHICKEN ANEMIA AGENT; HEMORRHAGIC ENTERITIS; PROTECTIVE EFFICACY; MATERNAL ANTIBODY; IN-VIVO; INTERLEUKIN-2; APOPTOSIS; IL-2; ENHANCEMENT	To assess the immunogenicity of an inactivated new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) vaccine, we investigated 3 different doses of the inactivated vaccine and the inactivated vaccine in conjunction with 3 different doses of recombinant goose interleukin-2 (rGoIL-2) adjuvant. A virus concentration of 10(5) 50% embryo infective dose/mL was subcutaneously inoculated into adult geese divided into 6 groups. The dynamic changes of the humoral and cellular immunity responses elicited by the vaccines in the adult geese postvaccination (PV) were investigated using ELISA, virus neutralization test, and lymphocyte proliferation assay. The clearance of virus from the intestines of geese (175 d PV) was studied by histopathological examination and indirect immunofluorescence assay after virulent NGVEV challenge. This study showed that the inactivated NGVEV vaccine elicits strong humoral and cellular responses in the vaccinated adult geese. The absorbance values of specific anti-NGVEV antibodies, the neutralization antibody titer, and the lymphocyte proliferation index rapidly increased, peaked at about 28 d PV, progressed to the plateau stage, and then decreased slightly. The rGoIL-2 adjuvant enhanced the immune response, and this adjuvant in conjunction with the inactivated NGVEV vaccine induces a significantly higher specific anti-NGVEV antibody absorbance value, neutralization antibody titer, and lymphocyte proliferation index than the non-adjuvant-inactivated NGVEV vaccine (P < 0.05). The inactivated NGVEV vaccine conferred adequate efficient ability to clear NGVEV in vaccinated geese even in the last phase of the vaccination period (175 d PV). The inactivated NGVEV vaccine (0.5 mL/goose) with 1,000 units of rGoIL-2 adjuvant/goose is the most effective dose, thereby eliciting the strongest humoral and cellular immunity responses and providing the most efficacious clearance of NGVEV in vivo.

Recently, S. maltophilia was isolated from channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, with infectious intussusception syndrome (IIS), which is the most common disease of unknown etiology of channel catfish in Sichuan Province, China. The goals of this study were to identify the bacterial strains isolated from fish with IIS collected between 2006 and 2009 in Sichuan Province, China; to evaluate the pathogenicity of the pathogen in channel catfish; and to determine the susceptibility of the pathogen strains to many currently available antimicrobial agents. All isolated strains acquired from diseased fish with IIS were identified as S. maltophilia by API 20NE identification and 16s rDNA sequencing analysis. Susceptibility of the isolates to 24 antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. All isolates showed a similar antibiotic susceptibility, which was characterized by resistance to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides and to ambramycin, erythromycin, and rifampicin; the strains were susceptible only to some fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole. Virulence tests with isolated strains were conducted and pathogenicity was demonstrated: 90-100%, 65-70%. 40-50% and 0-5% mortalities were achieved via intraperitoneal injection of channel catfish with the different isolates at doses of 1.5 x 10(6) CPU/fish, 1.5 x 10(5) CPU/fish, 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/fish and 1.5 x 10(3) CPU/fish, respectively.

Evaluating on the both stability of performance and high yield is essential in MET analyses. The objective of the present investigation was to compare 11 nonparametric stability statistics and apply nonparametric tests for genotype-by-environment interaction (GEE) to 14 maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes grown at 25 locations in southwestern China during 2005. Results of nonparametric tests of GEI and a combined ANOVA across locations showed that both crossover and noncrossover GEI, and genotypes varied highly significantly for yield. The results of principal component analysis, correlation analysis of nonparametric statistics, and yield indicated the nonparametric statistics grouped as four distinct classes that corresponded to different agronomic and biological concepts of stability. Furthermore, high values of TOP and low values of rank-sum were associated with high mean yield, but the other nonparametric statistics were not positively correlated with mean yield. Therefore, only rank-sum and TOP methods would be useful for simultaneously selection for high yield and stability. These two statistics recommended JY686 and HX168 as desirable and ND108, CM12, CN36, and NK6661 as undesirable genotypes.

The influence of initial cell density, methanol and yeast nitrogen base concentration was evaluated, and the cell density was found to be the most important parameter. Considering with the yield of enzyme activity and the amount of methanol and YNB used for fermentation, the optimal conditions in this study for enzyme production were 0.5% (w/v) methanol, 0.8% (w/v) YNB, and initial cell density of 3 x 10(8) cells/ml. The enzyme production in 15-l fermenter with the optimized conditions was performed and a twofold higher xylanase activity was obtained. The produced enzyme was practically free of cellulolytic activity. The molecular mass (21 kDa), optimal pH (6.0) and substrate specificity of the enzyme were both identical to native enzyme. However, the thermostability of the recombinant enzyme was better than the native enzyme. The optimal temperature for the recombinant Xyn2 was 5 degrees C higher than native Xyn2, and remained at least 90% of its activity after 30 min incubation at 55 degrees C. The high level of fully active recombinant xylanase obtained in P. pastoris makes this expression system attractive for fermenter growth and industrial applications.

The monitoring of DEV-specific antibodies is a key to evaluate the effect of DEV vaccine and develop rational immunization programs. Thus, in this study, an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) test was developed for detecting DEV serum antibodies. Results: The ICS test is based on membrane chromatography, and uses both the purified recombinant UL51 protein conjugated with colloidal gold and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with colloidal gold as tracers, the purified recombinant UL51 protein as the capture reagent at the test line, and rabbit IgG as the capture reagent at the control line. The specificity of the ICS was evaluated by sera against DEV, Duck hepatitis virus (DHV), Riemerella anatipestifer (RA), Duck E. coli, Muscovy duck parvovirus (MPV), or Duck Influenza viruses (DIV). Only sera against DEV showed the strong positive results. In order to determine the sensitivity of the ICS, anti-DEV serum diluted serially was tested, and the minimum detection limit of 1: 128 was obtained. The ICS components, which are provided in a sealed package, require no refrigeration and are stable for 12 months. To evaluate the effect of the ICS, 110 duck serum samples collected from several non-immune duck flocks were simultaneously tested by the ICS test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization test (NT). The results showed that the sensitivity of the ICS test was almost consistent with ELISA and much higher than NT, has low cost, and is rapid (15 min) and easy to perform with no requirement of specialized equipment, reagent or technicians. Conclusions: In this work, we successfully developed a simple and rapid ICS test for detecting DEV serum antibodies for the first time. The ICS test was high specific and sensitive for the rapid detection of anti-DEV antibodies, and has great potential to be used for the serological surveillance of DEV infection in the field.

In this work, we explore the effect of constitutive overexpression of CrORCA3 (octadecanoid-responsive Catharanthus AP2/ERF domain), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on the differentiated tissue of Catharanthus roseus hairy roots. The changes in catharanthine concentration and in the levels of mRNA transcripts of pathway genes and regulators were tracked for 192 h. ORCA3 overexpression led to a slight decrease of the accumulation of catharanthine, while MeJA treatment caused a large increase in the levels of transcripts of pathway genes and the catharanthine concentration. SNP treatment alone or SNP in combination with MeJA treatment caused a dramatic decrease of the cathanranthine concentration, while at the same time the levels of transcripts of zinc finger-binding proteins genes (ZCTs) increased. The latter treatment also caused a decrease of the levels of transcripts of type-I protein prenyltransferase gene (PGGT-I). This response of transcriptional repressors and pathway genes may explain the antagonistic effects of NO and MeJA on catharanthine biosynthesis in C. roseus hairy roots.

ION AFFINITY-CHROMATOGRAPHY; CITRUS DEHYDRIN; SALICYLIC-ACID; METAL-BINDING; WATER-STRESS; OXIDATIVE MODIFICATION; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; TRANSGENIC TOBACCO; LEA PROTEINS; TOLERANCE	Plant antioxidation system is composed of a series of complex mechanisms, in which many antioxidants including some special proteins are involved. Dehydrins are a family of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins which usually accumulate in plants during late embryogenesis or in response to environmental stresses. They were suggested to be associated with specific protective functions in plant cells, such as preventing coagulation of macromolecules and maintaining integrity of crucial cell structures. In recent years, many studies implied that dehydrins also play an antioxidative role to alleviate oxidative damage in stressed plants. They were proposed to scavenge radicals directly and sequester metals which are sources for radical generation to avoid the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this paper, we will discuss the novel putative role of dehydrins in plant antioxidation mechanisms and how dehydrins perform their antioxidative activity.

There are lots of reports on meiotic restitution in hybrids of tetraploid Triticum turgidum wheat with alien species. Hexaploid wheat SHW-L1 was newly synthesized from the F-1 plants between a T turgidum ssp. turgidum line with meiotic restitution gene(s) and Aegilops tauschii. Based on the male gametogenesis observation, the present study provided the experimental evidence on the occurring of meiotic restitution in the F-1 pentaploid (2n=5x=35, ABDUS(1)) hybrids of synthetic hexaploid wheat SHW-L1 with Ae. variabilis. Meiotic restitution resulted in unreduced gametes that in turn spontaneously produced neopolyploids with genome AABBDDUUS(1)S(1). The implications of these findings for gene flow between hexaploid wheat and alien species were discussed.

The typical type of E. hystrix is glumeless, and has loose spikes with spikelets that are horizontally spreading at maturity (type I), while type II has pubescent lemmas and type III possesses lanceolate glumes. In order to investigate the genetic relationships among the three types of E. hystrix, hybridization, genome analysis and Giemsa C-banding were carried out. Meiotic pairing in hybrids from three types of E. hystrix was quite regular, suggesting that the three E. hystrix types have the same basic genome constitution. All of the hybrids could set seed suggesting that reproductive barriers among the three types of E. hystrix were not strong, and they should belong to species of E. hystrix. Giemsa C-banded karyotypes supported the close relationships among three E. hystrix types. It is concluded that accession PI 531616 may not be a pure line of E. hystrix, but a hybrid derivative.

Allohexaploid bread wheat originated from spontaneous hybridization of Triticum turgidum L. with Aegilops tauschii Coss. Unreduced gametes originating via meiotic restitution, including first-division restitution (FDR) and single-division meiosis (SDM), are well documented in triploid F(1) hybrids of T. turgidum with diploid Ae. tauschii (genomic constitution ABD, usually with 21 univalents in meiotic metaphase I). In this study, two T. turgidum lines known to carry genes for meiotic restitution were crossed to tetraploid Ae. tauschii. The resulting F(1) hybrids (genomes ABDD), had seven pairs of homologous chromosomes and regularly formed 14 univalents and seven bivalents at metaphase I. Neither FDR nor SDM were observed. The distribution of chromosome numbers among progeny obtained by self pollination and a backcross to T. turgidum showed the absence of unreduced gametes. These results suggest that high homologous pairing interfered with meiotic restitution and the formation of unreduced gametes. This may be related to asynchronous movement during meiosis between paired and unpaired chromosomes or to uneven distribution of chromosomes in anaphases, resulting in nonviable gametes.

Therefore, the rDNA ITS copies appear to be virtually identical and can sometimes be treated as a single gene. In this paper we examined ITS polymorphism within and among 13 diploid (A and C genomes), seven tetraploid (AB, AC and CC genomes) and four hexaploid (ACD genome) to infer the extent and direction of concerted evolution, and to reveal the phylogenetic and genome relationship among species of Avena. A total of 170 clones of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 fragment were sequenced to carry out haplotype and phylogenetic analysis. In addition, 111 Avena ITS sequences retrieved from GenBank were combined with 170 clones to construct a phylogeny and a netwok. We demonstrate the major divergence between the A and C genomes whereas the distinction among the A and B/D genomes was generally not possible. High affinity among the A(d) genome species A. damascena and the ACD genome species A. fatua was found, whereas the rest of the ACD genome hexaploids and the AACC tetraploids were highly affiliated with the A(1) genome diploid A. longiglumis. One of the AACC species A. murphyi showed the closest relationship with most of the hexaploid species. Both C(v) and C(p) genome species have been proposed as paternal donors of the C-genome carrying polyploids. Incomplete concerted evolution is responsible for the observed differences among different clones of a single Avena individual. The elimination of C-genome rRNA sequences and the resulting evolutionary inference of hexaploid species are discussed.

The coding domain sequence of duck MyoD gene was cloned, and then the expression of MyoD in duck leg muscle and breast muscle during embryo stage on E10, E14, E18, E22, E27 and D7 was detected using qRT-PCR method. Results showed that the developmental status of the duck breast muscle in embryonic phrases lag behind that of leg muscle. The CDS of duck MyoD gene consists of 894 nucleotides, and showed relatively high similarity with the gene of other species. The MyoD mRNA expressed in both kinds of muscle tissues and the expression profile had a similar trend, although the expression level of MyoD in the breast muscle was significantly higher than that in the leg muscle at each developmental stages (p < 0.05). Results suggested that MyoD might have potential functions in controlling muscle fiber phenotype during the secondary myogenesis of muscle development. These fundamental works may provide some valuable clues for knowing the roles of MyoD in the myogenesis and the muscle fiber type differentiation in birds. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To improve their antibacterial activity, some modifications needs to be made. In this research, the hybrid peptide gene Attacin-Thanatin with 642 bp in length with preferred codons of E. coli was generated using the technology of Gene splicing by overlap extension. The gene was inserted in-frame into E. coli expression plasmid pET-32a (+) and induced to express in E. coli Rosetta. The recombinant protein was partial purified and its biological activity was determined. Analysis of the E. coli Rosetta induced with IPTG revealed that the molecular weight of fusion protein was approximately 41.8 kDa, which perfectly matched the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. Biological activity detection showed that this peptide effectively inhibited the growth of the test bacteria including E. coli DH5 alpha, E. coli BL21 (DE3), Salmonella choleraesuis and Staphylococcus aureus. Among these bacteria, the Gram-negative E. coli was the most sensitive. Furthermore, there was minor hemolysis activity for porcine red blood cells. So, the results indicated that the hybrid peptide Attacin-Thanatin could be served as a promising candidate for the chemical antibiotics.

Ideally, the expression level of those internal control genes should vary as little as possible between tissues, developmental stages and environmental conditions. In this study, 32 candidate genes for internal control were obtained from the analysis of nine independent experiments which included 333 Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome arrays. Expression levels of the selected genes were then evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR with cDNA samples from different tissues, stages of development and environmental conditions. Finally, fifteen novel internal control genes were selected and their respective expression profiles were compared using NormFinder, geNorm, Pearson correlation coefficients and the twofold-change method. The novel internal control genes from this study were compared with thirteen traditional ones for their expression stability. It was observed that seven of the novel internal control genes were better than the traditional ones in expression stability under all the tested cDNA samples. Among the traditional internal control genes, the elongation factor 1-alpha exhibited strong expression stability, whereas the 18S rRNA, Alpha-tubulin, Actin and GAPDH genes had very poor expression stability in the range of wheat samples tested. Therefore, the use of the novel internal control genes for normalization should improve the accuracy and validity of gene expression analysis.

However, it is hard to obtain a stable production of soybean with this system, since soybean plants grow under shading by corn; the stems are thinner and susceptible to lodging. We examined the effects of seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2,4 and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) on the growth of soybean seedlings under relay strip intercropping, some morphological characteristics and yield. The seedling height, first internode length, cotyledonary node height and leaf area per plant were decreased, while the stem diameter, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, root volume, leaf greenness and root to shoot dry weight ratio were increased by uniconazole treatment. The root vigor and root active absorption area were also increased significantly by uniconazole treatment. Moreover, 2 and 4 mg kg(-1) uniconazole powder treatment increased shoot dry weight, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and seed yield significantly. Thus, the results suggested that seed treatment with uniconazole powder at a suitable concentration can improve soybean seedling growth, resist the lodging and also increase the seed yield under shading by corn in relay strip intercropping system.

The matK and trnL-F sequences pointed to the A-genome diploid species as maternal parents of the polyploid species. Furthermore, different A-genome diploid species might have served as the A genome donor of several different polyploid species. The probable ancestor of most hexaploid species, of the AC-genome tetraploids, and of the A B-genome species A. agadiriana was A. wiestii (A(s) genome). The likely donor of the other three AB-genome tetraploids was A. hirtula (also A(s) genome) and A. damascena (A(d) genome) appears to be the A genome donor of the hexaploid A. fatua. The A genome origin of A. fatua differs from that for the other hexaploid Avena species, which is different from the common assumption that the hexaploid species evolved from a single hexaploid ancestor followed by gain or loss of domestication genes. Thus, several separate maternal lineages might be involved in different polyploid species.

Our objective in this study was to investigate the impact of the two factors on QTL mapping through computer simulations. Results indicate that detection power decreases with increasing levels of missing markers, and the false discovery rate increases. Missing markers have greater effects on smaller effect QTL and smaller size populations. The effect of missing markers can be quantified by a population with a reduced size similar to the marker missing rate. As for segregation distortion, if the distorted marker is not closely linked with any QTL, it will not have significant impact on QTL mapping; otherwise, the impact of the distortion will depend on the degree of dominance of QTL, frequencies of the three marker types, the linkage distance between the distorted marker and QTL, and the mapping population size. Sometimes, the distortion can result in a higher genetic variance than that of non-distortion, and therefore benefits the detection of linked QTL. A formula of the ratio of genetic variance explained by QTL under distortion and non-distortion was given in this study, so as to easily determine whether the segregation distortion marker (SDM) increases or decreases the QTL detection power. The effect of SDM decreases rapidly as its linkage relationship with QTL becomes looser. In general, distorted markers will not have a great effect on the position and effect estimations of QTL, and their effects can be ignored in large-size mapping populations.

Although IBVs of Taiwan-I type, massachusetts type, and proventriculitis type were isolated, but most isolates were LX4 genotype. Homology analysis of the sequences of S1 genes of the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains revealed that the identity of the nucleotides and amino acid sequences of the S1 genes between the 15 LX4-type isolates and other IBV strains were 71.9-99.3% and 72.1-99.1%, respectively, while those of the analyzed IBV of LX4 type were 96.0-99.9% and 94.3-99.8%, respectively. The results from this study and other published results in the GenBank database showed that isolates circulating in Sichuan province in recent years were mainly LX4 genotype, which is the predominant genotype circulated in China in recent years.

These factors are expressed in metaphase II oocytes and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The mechanisms responsible for the reprogramming of ooplasm during nuclear transfer are expected to be associated with the four factors. Here, we show that different paternal genetic backgrounds are able to influence the in vitro development of parthenogenetic and cloned embryos. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we found that the expression level of Oct4 in oocytes was less than that of ESCs, whereas oocytes from KM x C3H females showed the highest expression level of Sox2 than the other strains tested or in G1 ESCs. c-Myc mRNA levels in oocytes from KM mice were greater than those found in ESCs or oocytes of KM x C3H mice. These data demonstrate that the expression of the four transcription factors was different among the oocytes, which may be a contributing factor for the different efficiencies of parthenogenesis and the development of cloned embryos in vitro.

In the present study, a total of 143 core maize landraces from the South Maize Region (SR) of China, which can represent the general profile of the genetic diversity in the landraces germplasm of SR, were genotyped by 54 DNA microsatellite markers. Totally, 517 alleles (ranging from 4 to 22) were detected among these landraces, with an average of 9.57 alleles per locus. The total gene diversity of these core landraces was 0.61, suggesting a rather higher level of genetic diversity. Analysis of population structure based on Bayesian method obtained the samilar result as the phylogeny neighbor-joining (NJ) method. The results indicated that the whole set of 143 core landraces could be clustered into two distinct groups. All landraces from Guangdong, Hainan, and 15 landraces from Jiangxi were clustered into group 1, while those from the other regions of SR formed the group 2. The results from the analysis of genetic diversity showed that both of groups possessed a similar gene diversity, but group 1 possessed relatively lower mean alleles per locus (6.63) and distinct alleles (91) than group 2 (7.94 and 110, respectively). The relatively high richness of total alleles and distinct alleles preserved in the core landraces from SR suggested that all these germplasm could be useful resources in germplasm enhancement and maize breeding in China.

With the purpose of decreasing economic losses in the commercial duck industry, studying the unknown glycoprotein K (gK) of DEV may be a new method for preferably preventing and curing this disease. So this is the first time to product and purify the rabbit anti-tgK polyclonal antibody. Through the western blot and ELISA assay, the truncated glycoprotein K (tgK) has good antigenicity, also the antibody possesses high specificity and affinity. Meanwhile the rabbit anti-tgK polyclonal antibody has the potential to produce subunit vaccines and the functions of neutralizing DEV and anti-DEV infection because of its neutralization titer. Indirect immunofluorescent microscopy using the purified rabbit anti-tgK polyclonal antibody as diagnostic antibody was susceptive to detect a small quantity of antigen in tissues or cells. This approach also provides effective experimental technology for epidemiological investigation and retrospective diagnose of the preservative paraffin blocks.

A total of 1050 Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) (22.28 +/- 0.07 g) were randomly distributed into seven groups, of three replicates each, of feeding diets containing graded levels of MI (163.5, 232.7, 384.2, 535.8, 687.3, 838.8 and 990.3 mg MI kg-1 diet). After a 60-day growth trial, an infectious trial was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila for 17 days. Results showed that the red blood cell (RBC) and the white blood cell count were significantly increased with increasing MI levels up to 535.8 mg kg-1 diet (P < 0.05). The spleen index showed a tendency similar to RBC, whereas the head kidney index showed the inverse pattern (P < 0.05). The phagocytic activity of leucocytes, haemagglutination titre, lysozyme activity, anti-A. hydrophila antibody titre and immunoglobulin M, after being injected with A. hydrophila, were all improved with an increase in the MI levels up to 232.7-687.3 mg kg-1 diet respectively (P < 0.05). Myo-inositol did not influence serum acid phosphatase activity and total iron-binding capacity (P > 0.05). These results suggested that MI could enhance non-specific immune and specific immune responses in fish.

While there was no any report of the duck enteritis virus (DEV) UL45 protein as yet. Results: The UL45 gene and des-transmembrane domain of UL45 (named UL45 Delta gene, 295-675bp of UL45) of DEV were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a(+). The constructed recombinant plasmids were transformed into the host strain BL21(DE3) PLysS and induced by IPTG. SDS-PAGE analysis showed the UL45 gene couldn't express while UL45 Delta gene was highly expressed. His Purify Kit or salting-out could purify the protein effectively. Using the purified protein to immunize New-Zealand rabbits and produce polyclonal antibody. The agar diffusion reaction showed the titer of antibody was 1:32. Western blot analysis indicated the purified rabbit anti-UL45 Delta IgG had a high level of specificity and the UL45 gene was a part of DEV genome. The transcription phase study of UL45 gene showed that expression of UL45 mRNA was at a low level from 0 to 18 h post-infection (pi), then accumulated quickly at 24 h pi and peaked at 42 h pi. It can be detected till 72 h pi. Besides, western blot analysis of purified virion and different viral ingredients showed that the UL45 protein resided in the purified virion and the viral envelope. Conclusions: The rabbit anti-UL45 Delta IgG was produced successfully and it can serve as a good tool for penetrating studies of the function of DEV UL45 protein. The transcription phase and protein characteristics analysis indicated that DEV UL45 gene was a late gene and UL45 protein may be a viral envelope protein.

Aim of the study Nymphaea stellata willd. flowers (NSF) are used as a traditional medicine in India and Nepal to treat diabetic disease Different works have demonstrated that NSF extract showed antihyperglycemic effect on alloxan-induced diabetic rats In the present work we evaluated in vitro intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibition as the possible mode of action of NSF extract on suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia for curing diabetic mellitus. In addition, NSF extract was studied to assess its possible acute oral toxicity and genotoxicity Materials and methods Rat intestinal crude enzyme preparation and Caco-2 monolayer were used to evaluate alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of NSF extract. The main alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were detected by HPLC For acute toxicity test. NSF extract was administered at doses of 2000, 5000 and 10,000 mg/kg body to three groups of 10 ICR mice each, and then clinical symptoms including mortality, clinical sign and gross findings were observed once a day for 14 days. In Ames test, histidine-dependent auxotrophic mutants of Salmonella typhimurium (strains TA97, TA98, TA100. TA102 and TA1535) were used and incubated in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activation using NSF extract with concentrations of 150-5000 mu g/plate. The chromosome aberration test was conducted with Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells treated with NSF extract at doses of 150-5000 mu g/ml in the presence and absence of 59 metabolic activation In the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, 9-week-old male and female ICR mice (n = 90,25-30 g) were administered daily by oral gavage at doses of 2.5, 5 0 and 10.0 g/kg body for 1 or 2 days. Bone marrow smears were prepared from each treatment group 24 h after last administration and then polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) and normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) were identified. Results: NSF extract showed potent rat intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity for maltose hydrolysis with ED(50) value of 0 1 mg/ml. In Caco-2 monolayer, alpha-glucosidase activity for the maltose hydrolysis was down-regulated by NSF extract at a concentration of 0.05 mg/well level, showing 74% inhibition compared to the saline treated control. NSF was rich in phenol contents and the main alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose, was identified together with two phenolic compounds of gallic acid and conrilagin. In acute toxicity test, NSF extract did not produce any toxic signs or deaths and the LD(50) value of this extract could be greater than 10,000 mg/kg body weight. These results of genotoxicity assessment showed that NSF extract did not cause genotoxic effects in Ames test, in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus assay Conclusion The current study shows that the extract from Nymphaea stellata flowers exhibits significant intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, without showing any acute toxicity or genotoxicity, which may be useful in suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics The results presented here suggest that the use of NSF in folk medicine as a natural antidiabetic treatment could be safe as well as beneficial (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Two wheat cultivars, Chuannong12 (CN12) and Chuannong 18 (CN18), harboring the wheat-rye 1BL/1RS translocated chromosome were investigated for H2O2 change and physiological index after flowering under field conditions, and MY11, the agronomical parent of both CN12 and CN18, was used as the control. A combined change in the peak value of CdSe/ZnS quantum dot (QD) fluorescence and morphological observation indicated that the H2O2 contents in CN12 and CN18 were generally lower than that in MY11. They both had higher values for net photosynthetic rate (P(n)), stomatal conductance (G(s)), F(v)/F(m)' F(v)'/F(m)', and photochemical quenching of PSII (qP) than MY11 only in the late measurement stage. Some small differences were also observed, such as CN12 and CN18 wheat cultivars having higher and longer photosynthetic competence than MY11 during the grain filling stage, which perhaps resulted from a mechanism for removing oxidative species, especially H(2)O(2).

Fifty healthy male Sichuan white geese and fifty male Landes geese (Cygnus atratus) were hatched on the same day under the same feeding conditions and were selected as experimental animals. After overfeeding for 14 days (from 14 weeks to 16 weeks) and then slaughtering, the biochemical changes of hepatic lipogenesis were evaluated. Results showed that i) in Landes geese, the plasma concentration of glucose was higher (p<0.001), while plasma concentrations of insulin and VLDL were both lower (p<0.01); ii) the LPL mRNA level in pectoralis muscle and leg muscle of the overfed groups in both breeds was higher (p<0.05) than in the control groups; iii) in Sichuan white geese, the proportion of fatty liver weight was positively correlated with plasma triacylglycerols (TG)(p<0.05) and VLDL concentrations (p<0.05), while these correlations were not significant in Landes geese; and iv) the activity of LPL had significant positive correlation with the proportions of lipids in subcutaneous adipose tissue and abdominal adipose tissue in Sichuan white geese, while in Landes geese the correlation was negative (p<0.05) with proportions of lipids in the liver, LPL activity had a significant positive correlation with the proportions of lipids in subcutaneous adipose tissue. These results suggest that the Landes geese have a better ability to use the massive amount of ingested food and to store lipids preferentially in the liver, but the Sichuan white geese have a relatively lower ability to use energetic nutrients and lipid storage is more efficient in the adipose tissues.

Several factors were considered to explore the applicability and the effect of ACF/TiO(2) in the combined treatment of pulsed discharge and ACF/TiO(2). A synergistic effect appeared in the combined treatment. The increase in COD removal results from the photocatalysis of ACF/TiO(2), as well as the adsorption of ACF/TiO(2). Further, ACF/TiO(2) could be regenerated in situ in the combined treatment. The solution conductivity had a major effect on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from the MO solution in the combined treatment, while the initial solution pH value had a minor effect on COD removal.

ENDOGENOUS HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS IN EXPLANTS AND CALLUSES OF BITTER MELON (Momordica charantia L.)	INTERCIENCIA			English	Article							IN-VITRO; TISSUE-CULTURES; REGENERATION; GROWTH; AUXIN	Anthers and stems of bitter melon (Monnordica charantia L.) cv Bixiu were used for in vitro culture establishment. The endogenous hormone concentrations (indoleacetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins 3 (GA(3)), and zeatin (ZT)) of the initial explants and calluses were determined by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The endogenous IAA and IAA/ZT ratio were higher in the explants that were more effective to induce callus, and ABA was negative to callus formation. When analyzing the endogenous hormone concentrations in the various callus types generated in anthers and stems, it was found that a higher concentrations of ZT was present in the stem calluses that had formed buds, while higher IAA/ZT and GA(3)/ZT ratios were present in the calluses having no bud formation capacity, originated from anthers and stems.

Therefore it is widely used as a horticultural shrub because of its golden-color leaves. Its putative mechanism, light responses, chlorophyll synthesis and plastid development were studied. L. vicaryi has a higher level of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), but lower levels of chlorophylls compared with L. quihoui. The yellowish phenotype of L. vicaryi upper leaves could be attributed to their hampered conversion from chlorophyllide into chlorophyll a. Despite the enhanced ALA level and the decreased thylakoid stacking in plastids, L. vicaryi golden leaves contain normal levels of Lhcb transcripts and photosystem apoproteins. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation is almost the same in L. vicaryi and L. quihoui. The golden leaves often turn green and the contents of chlorophylls increase with decreasing light intensity. Dynamic changes of chlorophyll-synthesis-system under the light transition were also analyzed.

Both bidirectional best BLASTP (basic local alignment search tool for proteins) search and the conservation of gene order against each other were utilized to identify genomic islands, and 7 genomic islands were found to be immediately adjacent to tRNAs in Prochlorococcus marinus AS9601, 11 in P. marinus MIT9515, 8 in P. marinus MED4, 6 in P. marinus MIT9301, and 6 in P. marinus MIT9312. Monte Carlo simulation showed that tRNA genes are hotspots for the integration of genomic islands in Prochlorococcus strains. The tRNA genes associated with genomic islands showed the following characteristics: (1) the association was biased towards a specific subset of all iso-accepting tRNA genes; (2) the codon usages of genes within genomic islands appear to be unrelated to the codons recognized by associated tRNAs; and, (3) the majority of the 3' ends of associated tRNAs lack CCA ends. These findings contradict previous hypotheses concerning the molecular basis for the frequent use of tRNA as the insertion site for foreign genetic materials. The analysis of a genomic island associated with a tRNA-Asn gene in P. marinus MIT9301 suggests that foreign genetic material is inserted into the host genomes by means of site-specific recombination, with the 3' end of the tRNA as the target, and during the process, a direct repeat of the 3' end sequence of a boundary tRNA (namely, a scar from the process of insertion) is formed elsewhere in the genomic island. Through the analysis of the sequences of these targets, it can be concluded that a region characterized by both high GC content and a palindromic structure is the preferred insertion site.

Intrauterine growth restriction reduces intestinal structure and modifies the response to colostrum in preterm and term piglets	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Digestive Physiology of Pigs	MAY 20-22, 2009	Costa Daurada, SPAIN			Intrauterine growth restriction; Prematurity; Intestinal development; Enteral nutrition; Pig	NEWBORN PIGS; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; ENTERAL NUTRITION; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; RETARDATION; INFANTS	We investigated some consequences of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on weight and structural and functional parameters of the intestine at birth and after 2 days of colostrum feeding. IUGR altered intestinal morphology, leading to a longer and thinner small intestine in piglets born both preterm and at full term, together with reduced villous size in term IUGR piglets. Preterm IUGR piglets displayed an improved ability to adapt to colostrum intake by rapid intestinal catch-up growth, relative to other groups of pigs. In contrast, intestinal nutrient absorption surface was impaired by IUGR during the first days of life in term piglets. The postnatal effects of IUGR may have long term consequences for developing piglets, and these effects may depend on gestational age at birth, preterm or term. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Development and application of an indirect immunohistochemical method for the detection of duck plague virus vaccine antigens in paraffin sections and localization in the vaccinated duckling tissues	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						indirect immunohistochemical method; attenuated duck plague virus vaccine; duck plague virus vaccine antigen; antigenic distribution; localization regularity	HEMORRHAGIC-DISEASE VIRUS; ENTERITIS-VIRUS; VIRAL-ENTERITIS; PCR ASSAY; A VIRUS; INFECTION; OUTBREAK; ANTIBODY; PROTEIN; CELLS	The objective of the present study was to develop and apply a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase labeling system of indirect immunohistochemistry (SP-IHC) to detect antigenic distribution and localization regularity of duck plague virus (DPV) vaccine antigens in paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of experimentally vaccinated ducklings. Male New Zealand rabbits were immunized with purified DPV antigens, which were engaged by a combination of differential centrifugation and sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation. The rabbit anti-DPV polyclonal antibodies were purified and used as the primary anti-bodies. Forty-eight 28-d-old DPV-free Pekin ducklings were subcutaneously inoculated with attenuated DPV vaccine in the immunization group and sterile PBS in the control group. The tissues were collected at sequential time points between 4 h and 18 wk postvaccination (PV) and were prepared for SP-IHC observation. The presence of DPV-specific antigens was first observed in the liver and spleen at 12 h PV; in the bursa of Fabricius, thymus, Harderian gland, esophagus, and intestinal tract at 1 d PV; and in the heart, lung, kidney, pancreas, and brain at 3 d PV. The positive staining reaction could be detected in the vaccinated duckling tissues until 18 wk PV, and no positive staining cells could be observed in the controls. The highest levels of positive staining reaction were found in the liver, spleen, bursa of Fabricius, thymus, and intestinal tract, whereas a few DPV vaccine antigens were distributed in the heart, pancreas, and esophagus. The target cells had a ubiquitous distribution, especially in the mucosal epithelial cells, lamina propria cells, macrophages, hepatocytes, and lymphocytes, which served as the principal sites for antigen localization. These findings demonstrated that SP-IHC was a reliable method for detecting antigenic distribution and localization regularity of DPV vaccine antigens in routine paraffin sections. The present study may be useful for describing proliferation and distribution regularity of DPV vaccine in the vaccinated duckling tissues and enhance further studies and clinical application of attenuated DPV vaccine.

Effect of root-applied spermidine on growth and respiratory metabolism in roots of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) seedlings under hypoxia	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cucumis sativus; spermidine; hypoxia; growth; polyamines	ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE; POLYAMINE BIOSYNTHESIS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; ZONE HYPOXIA; IN-VITRO; STRESS; TOLERANCE; PUTRESCINE; SYNTHASE; EXPRESSION	The effects of exogenous spermidine (Spd) application to hypoxic nutrient solution on the contents of endogenous polyamines (PAs) and respiratory metabolism in the roots of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings were investigated. Cucumber seedlings were grown hydroponically in control and hypoxic nutrient solutions with and without addition of Spd at a concentration of 0.05 mM. The activities of key enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), were significantly inhibited under root-zone hypoxia with dissolved oxygen (DO) at 1 mg/l. In contrast, the activities of enzymes involved in the process of fermentation, such as pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT), were significantly increased. Thus, aerobic respiration was inhibited and fermentation was enhanced in the roots of cucumber seedlings as a result of decreasing ATP content to inhibit the dry weight of seedlings under hypoxic stress. Moreover, the contents of free, soluble conjugated, and insoluble bound putrescine (Put), Spd, and spermine (Spm) in the roots of cucumber seedlings were significantly increased under hypoxia stress. Interestingly, application of Spd to hypoxic roots markedly suppressed the accumulation of free Put and, in contrast, promoted an increase in free Spd and Spm, as well as soluble conjugated and insoluble bound Put, Spd, and Spm contents. From these data, we deduced that exogenous Spd promotes the conversion of free Put into free Spd and Spm, and soluble conjugated and insoluble bound PAs under hypoxia stress. Furthermore, the activities of LDH, PDC, and ADH were suppressed and, in contrast, the activities of SDH and IDH were enhanced by application of exogenous Spd to hypoxic roots. As a result, aerobic respiration was enhanced but fermentation metabolism was inhibited in the roots of cucumber seedlings, leading to an increase in ATP content to alleviate the inhibited dry weight of seedlings due to hypoxia stress. These results suggest that application of Spd to hypoxic nutrient solution promoted conversion of free Put into free Spd and Spm as well as soluble conjugated and insoluble bound PAs, further enhanced IDH and SDH activities, and inhibited ethanol fermentation and lactate fermentation, resulting in increased ATP content and eventually enhanced tolerance of cucumber plants to root-zone hypoxia.

Searching the HarvEST database of barley resulted in 25 putative USP cDNA sequences. Of these, 16 could translate into intact proteins (putative USPs). The alignments of multiple amino acid sequences between the putative barley USPs with those of Arabidopsis and Methanococcus jannaschii resulted in a set of common residues involved in ATP-binding. The 16 putative USPs in barley and the 21 in Arabidopsis were clustered into seven groups, which were distinct from those of E. coli. The genes in these different groups have different intron/exon structures. Nine putative USP genes of barley were cloned successfully based on their sequence characteristics, and they contain two or three introns each. Two of these introns were present in all the genes, one located between beta 2 and alpha 2, and the other between beta 4 and alpha 4. Five sets of primers were successfully developed for these putative USP genes. Two of them were mapped on chromosome 1H and the other three were located on three different chromosomes, 2H, 3H and 6H, respectively. Expression analyses were carried out for nine of these putative USP genes. The expression for two of them was undetectable within 27 h following exposure to salt stress.

Results from the previous analyses have left many questions concerning species evolutionary relationships unanswered, especially regarding the origins of the B and D genomes, which are only known to be present in polyploid oat species. To investigate the species and genome relationships in genus Avena, among 13 diploid (A and C genomes), we used the second intron of the nuclear gene FLORICAULA/LEAFY (FL int2) in seven tetraploid (AB and AC genomes), and five hexaploid (ACD genome) species. The Avena FL int2 is rather long, and high levels of variation in length and sequence composition were found. Evidence for more than one copy of the FL int2 sequence was obtained for both the A and C genome groups, and the degree of divergence of the A genome copies was greater than that observed within the C genome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the FL int2 sequences resulted in topologies that contained four major groups; these groups reemphasize the major genomic divergence between the A and C genomes, and the close relationship among the A, B, and D genomes. However, the D genome in hexaploids more likely originated from a C genome diploid rather than the generally believed A genome, and the C genome diploid A. clauda may have played an important role in the origination of both the C and D genome in polyploids.

When both cultivars were subjected to seawater stress, the leaves of the Helan No. 3 spinach preferred potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sulfate (SO42-) over sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-) to keep high ratios of K/Na, Mg/Na, Ca/Na, and SO42-/Cl-2 compared with the Yanye spinach. Moreover, those of the Helan No. 3 spinach under the seawater stress showed high efficiency of accumulation of compatible solutes (sugars and proline), low degradation of proteins, and suppression of free amino acids. However, the activities of plasma membrane H+-ATPase and tonoplast H+-ATPase in the leaves of spinach with the stress were enhanced. Taken together, the Helan No. 3 spinach under the seawater stress seems to acquire a high tolerance to the seawater salinity by inducing a high ion uptake, low concentration of Na+ and Cl-, efficient accumulation of compatible solutes, low decomposition of proteins, and suppression of free amino acids in the leaves.

The response of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) cultivar Zhongza 9 seedlings with AM F inoculation and control to salt stress (0, 0.5 and 1.0% NaCl solution, respectively) was investigated. The results showed that the salt stress significantly reduced the dry matter content of roots, stems and leaves, and also the leaf area as compared with the control treatment. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal-inoculated (AM) significantly improved the dry matter and the leaf area in the salt-stressed plants. The effect of AMF on dry matter was more pronounced in aerial biomass than in root biomass which might be due to AM colonization. The activities of SOD, POD, ASA-POD, and CAT in leaves and roots of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal treatment of tomato plants were increased and had different rules under different NaCl concentrations (solution of 0, 0.5 and 1% NaCl), but all enzymes had a rise in the beginning of treatment under salt stress conditions. The AMF did not change the rule of tomato itself under salt stress, but AMF increased these enzyme activities in different levels. The AMF treatment significantly increased SOD, POD and ASA-POD activities in leaves and roots, whereas it had little effects on CAT in root. O2(center dot-) production rate and MDA content in leaves increased continuously, which showed a positive line correlation with salt stress concentration. O(2)(center dot-) production rate and MDA content in tomato plants significantly decreased by AM treatment compared with non-mycorrhizal treatment. In conclusion, AM could alleviate the growth limitations imposed by saline conditions, and thereby play a very important role in promoting plant growth under salt stress in tomato.

In this study, we further investigated the immune-modulator potential of ZOE against the immunosuppression. Compared to mice irradiated alone, ZOE treatment significantly increased the spleen relative weight of the mice. Moreover, ZOE treatment enhanced the cellular immune response characterized by higher macrophage, splenocyte survival, splenocyte proliferation and higher ratio of CD4(+) and CD8(+). In addition, ZOE improved the humoral response represented by the higher antibody titers of IgG, IgA and IgM and up-regulated the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 beta and IL-3. Furthermore, ZOE treatment significantly reduced the numbers of micronuclei (MN) in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs). Collectively, these finding indicated that ZOE has the regulatory effect against gamma-rays-induced immun-suppression by means of protecting DNA against the radiation.

Consequently, researchers are interested in using hyperaccumulator and accumulator plants to decontaminate Cd polluted soils. To investigate Cd tolerance, uptake and accumulation by Amaranthus hybridus L, Cd concentration gradients were applied to a soil (at rates of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 mg kg(-1)) and hydroponics solutions (at rates of 0,5,10,15,20,30, and 40 mg L(-1)) following a field survey. A. hybridus grew normally at added Cd concentrations <= 90 mg kg(-1) and <= 20 mg L(-1) in the soil culture and in the hydroponics solutions, respectively. In the hydroponics solutions, peroxidase activity showed a quadratic relationship and catalase activity changed irregularly with increasing Cd concentrations. The highest Cd concentration and accumulation in shoots were 241.56 mg kg(-1) and 1006.95 mu g pot(-1) in the soil culture, and 354.56 mg kg(-1) and 668.42 mu g pot(-1) in the hydroponics experiment. Bioconcentration factors in soil culture and hydroponics solutions were 0.58-1.22 and 5.18-17.55, and translocation factors were 0.64-1.50 and 0.33-0.92, respectively.

To realize the genetic basis of grain yield of maize (Zea mays L.), a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and two nitrogen (N) regimes were used to detect the QTLs for grain yield in maize, as a result, a total of six QTLs associated with grain yield per year (GYPE) were identified on chromosomes 1 (one), 6 (one), 8 (two) and 9 (two), with 0 - 12.0 cm of mapping interval between QTLs and their nearest markers. The three QTLs identified under high N regime could explain 18.07% of phenotypic variance, and could increase GYPE from 3.91 - 5.40 g, due to positive additive effects. Whereas, the three QTLs located under low N regime could account for 20.96% of phenotypic variance, and due to negative additive effects, they could decrease GYPE from 3.40 to 6.68 g. These results were beneficial for realizing the genetic basis of GYPE and developing marker-assisted selection in maize breeding project.

However, the metabolism of SAA in the gut, specifically the transmethylation of methionine, will result in a net release of homocysteine, which is shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Furthermore, the extensive catabolism of dietary methionine by the intestine or by luminal microbes may result in a decrease in nutritional efficiency. Therefore, the regulation of SAA metabolism in the gut is not only nutritionally relevant, but also relevant to the overall health and well-being. The superiority of dl-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyrate to dl-methionine in decreasing homocysteine production, alleviating stress responses, and reducing the first-pass intestinal metabolism of dietary methionine may provide a promising implication for nutritional strategies to manipulate SAA metabolism and thus to improve the nutrition and health status of animals and perhaps humans.

Jian). Seven diets (4.0, 15.5, 25.6, 36.1, 45.9, 56.1 and 65.9 mg PA kg-1) were fed to Jian carp (12.95 +/- 0.03 g) for 9 weeks. After 9-week feeding trial, the challenge experiment with Aeromonas hydrophila was conducted to determine the impact of PA on fish disease resistance. Survival rate after challenge was promoted with the increasing PA levels (P < 0.05). Blood counts also significantly increased up to the dietary PA level of 25.6 mg PA kg-1 (P < 0.05). Leucocyte phagocytic activity, lectin potency, lysozyme and acid phosphatase activity, and total iron-binding capacity were improved with increasing PA levels (P < 0.05). Serum immunoglobulin M level and agglutination antibody titre to A. hydrophila were increased (P < 0.05) in fish fed the diets with the dietary PA levels between 56.1 and 65.9 mg kg-1. PA also promoted the growth and reproduction of Lactobacillus and depressed Escherichia coli and A. hydrophila (P < 0.05). These results suggested that pantothenic acid could improve disease resistance, immune response, and the balance of intestinal microflora in juvenile Jian carp.

J	Xu, LJ; Huang, JG; Wang, HJ; Long, B				Xu, Lijia; Huang, Jianguo; Wang, Houjun; Long, Bing			A Novel Method for the Diagnosis of the Incipient Faults in Analog Circuits Based on LDA and HMM	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						HMM; LDA; Feature extraction; Fault diagnosis	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ORDER DETERMINATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Diagnosis of incipient faults for electronic systems, especially for analog circuits, is very important, yet very difficult. The methods reported in the literature are only effective on hard faults, i.e., short-circuit or open-circuit of the components. For a soft fault, the fault can only be diagnosed under the occurrence of large variation of component parameters. In this paper, a novel method based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed for the diagnosis of incipient faults in analog circuits. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can significantly improve the recognition performance. First, to include more fault information, three kinds of original feature vectors, i.e., voltage, autoregression-moving average (ARMA), and wavelet, are extracted from the analog circuits. Subsequently, LDA is used to reduce the dimensions of the original feature vectors and remove their redundancy, and thus, the processed feature vectors are obtained. The LDA is further used to project three kinds of the processed feature vectors together, to obtain the hybrid feature vectors. Finally, the hybrid feature vectors are used to form the observation sequences, which are sent to HMM to accomplish the diagnosis of the incipient faults. The performance of the proposed method is tested, and it indicates that the method has better recognition capability than the popularly used backpropagation (BP) network.

In this study, the relationships between plant height (PH) and FHB were investigated across the whole wheat genome by QTL meta-analysis from fifty-six experiments. Coincident meta-QTL (MQTL) for PH and FHB were found on chromosomes 2D, 3A, 4B, 4D and 7A. Rht-B1, Rht-D1, Rht8, MQTLs P7 and P26 were consistent with FHB MQTLs. The meta-analysis results confirmed the negative associations of Rht-B1, Rht-D1, and Rht8 with FHB resistance. The associations of PH and FHB resistance on chromosomes 3A and 7A have not been reported and need further investigation. These regions should be given attention in breeding programs. MQTLs derived from several resistance sources were also observed. Some FHB MQTLs for different types of resistance overlapped. These findings could be useful for improving wheat varieties with resistance to FHB.

In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of both promoter region and ORF of novel HMW-GS allele 1St1.3 from a perennial Triticeae species, Elymus canadensis. The amino acid (AA) sequences of E. canadensis 1St 1.3 were deduced as 434 aa. Its protein primary structure comprises a signal peptide with a conserved N-terminal domain, a central repetitive domain and a C-terminal domain. E. canadensis 1St 1.3 possesses several distinct characteristics which are different from those of wheat HMW-GSs. The N-terminal domains of E. canadensis 1St 1.3 resemble that of y-type subunits, while their C-terminal domains are more similar to x-type subunits. The deletion of 85 bp fragment has been observed in promoter region of 1St 1.3, however which has not interrupted the expression of this gene. Our results indicate that 1St 1.3 is novel HMW-GS variants which will be valuable for enhancing our understanding of structural differentiation and the evolutionary relationship among HMW-GSs in Triticeae species.

RNA interference (RNAi) triggered by hairpin RNA (hpRNA) transcribed from a transgenic inverted-repeat sequence is an effective way to defend against viruses in plants. In this study, an hpRNA expression vector containing a sense arm and an antisense arm of 150 bp separated by an intron of the maize actin gene was constructed to target the P1 protein (protease) gene of MDMV and used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. The transformed Agrobacterium strain was used to transform maize embryonic calli isolated from immature embryos by an improved culture technique. In all, 46 plants were regenerated after stringent hygromycin B selection, and 18 of them were certified to be positive by PCR amplification. Of these positive plants, 13 were grown to produce offspring, and nine were identified by Southern blotting to have the transgene integrated with one or two copies. The resistance of three T(2) lines was evaluated in a field trial of dual MDMV inoculation in two environments and was found to be improved compared with the non-transformed control. The disease indexes of the transgenic plant lines h2, 13, and h1 were not significantly different from the highly resistant control line H9-21. The viral titers of the inoculated plants were detected by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), and the result was in accord with the resistance evaluated in the field trial. The addition of uniconazole S3307 (0.25 mg l(-1)) and ABT root-promoting powder (0.5 mg l(-1)) showed a significant improvement of hardening in regenerated plantlets, which were stronger and generated a better fibrous root system than the control. This improvement could facilitate the transgenic operation of maize.

Based on the field monitoring in a seasonally-frozen region of northeastern China, the effects of the frozen layer on the embankment responses to train-induced vibration were investigated in winter and summer via acceleration time histories and acceleration frequency spectrums. The results show that: (1) Compared to unfrozen soil conditions, the amplitudes of longitudinal and vertical vibrations at the points near the rail were increased, different influences of freight versus high-speed trains are the most evident. (2) With greater distance from the rail, the dominant frequency ranges of embankment with both frozen and unfrozen layers narrowed and shifted to low frequency bands. (3) The predominant frequency of embankment vibration with frozen soil layers shifted to higher frequencies with the increased train speed, although there was little change with unfrozen condition. Layer condition (frozen versus unfrozen) and distance to rail both play important roles in investigating the embankment vibration characteristics and rail transit field monitoring to improve the criterion of the rail construction in seasonally-frozen regions.

The LND treatment increased drip loss (P < 0.05), had a trend to increase intramuscular fat (IMF) content (P = 0.09), decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of pork (P < 0.05), improved mRNA level of mu-calpain (P < 0.05) in skeletal muscle, but had no effect on gene expression of calpastatin, compared with the CD treatment. These data suggest that a moderately reduced energy and protein diet increased pork tenderness and intramuscular fat. The increase in tenderness by LND treatment may be partly due to increased gene expression of mu-calpain in muscle. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is the only protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (POR)-less barley mutant known in the world. The putative mechanism of the mutation and its Chl synthesis and plastid development are studied here. Neither PORC nor an additional copy of porB could be detected in barley. porB mRNAs are normally expressed and correctly spliced in the mutant. However, the import of PORA, PORB, LHCIIb1 (light harvesting complex II b1) and SSU (small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) proteins to the plastid was greatly hampered in the mutant. We presume that a common translocon is mutated in NYB. The content of the supramolecular light-harvesting POR complex LHPP (light-harvesting NADPH: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase: protochloroph yllide) and the density of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts are decreased in the mutant. However, no further oxidative damage could be observed for the de-etiolated mutant seedlings after a dark to light shift. Development of the plastid is arrested (less stacking) in NYB, and the mutant becomes more yellowish in high-light conditions, with dwarfing of seedlings and decreased yield. The physiological significance and developmental roles of POR proteins and LHPP in barley cells are discussed.

We report the cloning of the IKU1 (At2g35230) gene. iku1 mutants cause reduced endosperm growth and the production of small seeds. IKU1 encodes a protein containing a VQ motif, which is a motif specific to plants. IKU1 is expressed in the early endosperm and its progenitor, the central cell. Restoration of IKU1 function in the endosperm is sufficient to rescue seed size. A genomic construct carrying mutations in the VQ motif failed to complement the iku1 mutation, suggesting an essential role for the VQ motif. IKU1 interacts with MINI3 in the yeast two-hybrid system, consistent with an IKU1 function in the IKU-MINI pathway. Our data support the proposition that endosperm development is an important determinant of seed size.

This study investigated the relationship among feed intake level, embryo survival, hormone secretion and mRNA expression. Fifty-four Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred gilts were allotted to three treatment groups of high (H, 2 x maintenance), medium (M, 1.2 x maintenance) and low (L, 0.6 x maintenance) after mating, to study the effect of feed intake levels on embryo survival, hormone secretion and mRNA expression of leptin, obesity receptor (ob-R), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and progesterone receptor (PGR) in embryos. Blood samples and embryos were collected for hormone concentrations determination and gene expression analysis. Slaughter weight, total weight gain and net weight gain were affected (p < 0.05) by dietary treatment. Embryonic survival was 80.23% and 78.45% in M group on days 25 and 35 of pregnancy, respectively, and was greater (p < 0.05) in M than H and L groups. Serum insulin-like growth factor-I and leptin concentrations enhanced (p < 0.05) with the increased feed intake, but progesterone concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) in H than M and L groups and no difference (p > 0.05) between M and L on days 25 and 35 of pregnancy. Real-Time PCR indicated that gene expression pattern of leptin, ob-R, STAT3 and DNMT1 were the highest (p < 0.05) in H group on days 25 and 35 of pregnancy. Transcript expression level of RBP4 and FGFR2 were the highest (p < 0.05) in M group on days 25 and 35 of pregnancy. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) expression of PGR was observed in L group on day 25 and in M group on day 35 of pregnancy. Our data suggest that 1.2 x maintenance feed intake level promoted the appropriate hormone secretion and enhanced genes expression in RBP4, FGFR2 and PGR, and thus resulted in better embryo survival compared with the high and low groups.

Giant unilamellar CdTe quantum dot vesicles (GUVs-CdTe), with diameters larger than 1.5 mu m, were obtained using lower-pressure evaporation techniques with soybean lecithin. Compared with other QD liposomes, the entrapment efficiency of GUVs-CdTe for QDs has been significantly improved to 86.3%. After GUVs-CdTe were injected into mice through the tail vein, the fluorescence microscopy of tissue sections showed that GUVs-CdTe could not pass through the blood-brain barrier and air-blood barrier, which were removed mostly by the reticuloendothelial system and were widely distributed in the spleen and the liver. This behavior is the same as the character of the metabolic pathway of giant unilamellar vesicles by intravenous injections in mice.

Oral inoculation with attenuated DEV stimulated an IgA-dominant response in intestinal secretions and a IgY-dominant response in the serum. The dramatic increase in virus-specific mucosal IgA 15 days after inoculation was accompanied by reductions in the DEV intestinal load, suggesting that the IgA response has a role in controlling viral replication. The kinetics of virus-specific IgA production closely correlated with the presence of IgA(+) plasma cells in the intestinal lamina propria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The negative regulation of miRNAs has been found in response to stress in Arabidopsis, rice and other plants. The sequence of the maize genome has been completed very recently; however, only a few maize miRNAs have been identified and deposited in the miRNA registry database, and the details of their regulation of target genes remain to be elucidated. We identified 21 maize miRNAs using bioinformatics computation and small RNA cloning. They are designated as zma-miR161, zma-miR397, zma-miR446, zma-miR479, zma-miR530, zma-miR776, zma-miR782, zma-miR815a, zma-miR818a, zma-miR820, zma-miR828, zma-miR834, zma-miR1, zma-miR2, zma-miR3, zma-miR4, zma-miR5, zma-miR6, zma-miR7, zma-miR8 and zma-miR9. The characterization of these miRNAs reveals a length of 19-24 nt and the typical secondary structure. Using reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 13 of these miRNAs were amplified and validated from total small RNA samples of maize. zma-miR1, zma-miR3, zma-miR6, zma-miR479, zma-miR782, zma-miR815a and zma-miR820 were found to be expressed specifically in drought-tolerant inbred line 87-1 under simulated drought stress, whereas the other six were amplified in line 87-1 and in the sensitive inbred line 200B under drought stress and in a well-watered control. The seven differentially expressed miRNAs are suggested to be associated with the regulation of gene expression under drought stress. Using the plant miRNA target finder software miRU and miRU2, 14 of the 21 miRNAs were identified to target genes encoding 21 proteins, most of which are metabolic enzymes. Seven of them are involved in signal transduction, transcription regulation, and bio- or abio-stress responses. The identification and characterization of 21 miRNAs enrich the maize miRNA database and provide valuable information for functional studies of miRNAs.

With the purpose of eliminating this disease and decreasing economic loss in the commercial duck industry, researching on glycoprotein K (gK) of DEV may be a new kind of method for preventing and curing this disease. Because glycoproteins project from the virus envelope as spikes and are directly involved in the host immune system and elicitation of the host immune responses, and also play an important role in mediating infection of target cells, the entry into cell for free virus and the maturation or egress of virus. The gK is one of the major envelope glycoproteins of DEV. However, little information correlated with gK is known, such as antigenic and functional characterization. Results: Bioinformatic predictions revealed that the expression of the full-length gK gene (fgK) in a prokaryotic system is difficult because of the presence of suboptimal exon and transmembrane domains at the C-terminal. In this study, we found that the fgK gene might not be expressed in a prokaryotic system in accordance with the bioinformatic predictions. Further, we successfully used bioinformatics tools to guide the prokaryotic expression of the gK gene by designing a novel truncated gK gene (tgK). These findings indicated that bioinformatics provides theoretical data for target gene expression and saves time for our research. The recombinant tgK protein (tgK) was expressed and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Western blotting and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the tgK possessed antigenic characteristics similar to native DEV-gK. Conclusions: In this work, the DEV-tgK was expressed successfully in prokaryotic system for the first time, which will provide usefull information for prokaryotic expression of alphaherpesvirus gK homologs, and the recombinant truncated gK possessed antigenic characteristics similar to native DEV gK. Because of the good reactionogenicity, specificity and sensitivity, the purified tgK could be useful for developing a sensitive serum diagnostic kit to monitor DEV outbreaks.

Monomers and the polymer were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The conjugated polyelectrolyte m-PPYPE-SO(3)Na was characterized by UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy and the solution photophysics properties of the polymer were investigated. The fluorescence spectra of the conjugated polyelectrolyte in different solvent and under different polymer concentrations showed concentration- and solvent-dependency of the conjugated polyelectrolyte, respectively, which could be attributed to the aggregation of the conjugated polyelectrolyte in water solution. The emission peak of the aggregation disappeared approximately when the concentration of the polymer was about 1 x 10(-6) mol/L, and this fact shows that the extent of the polymer aggregation was very low. It was found that surfactant affected the aggregation of the polyelectrolyte. The introduction of polymer-type surfactant poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) into the water solution of m-PPYPE-SO(3)Na increased the fluorescence intensity of the polymer solution. The interaction of PVP with m-PPYPE-SO(3)Na in aqueous solution broke the aggregation of the conjugated polyelectrolyte. The solution photophysics properties suggests that the conjugated polyelectrolyte has potential to be a kind of water soluble fluorescence probe.

Bioinformatic studies have predicted that the DEV pUL38 mainly targets the cytoplasm and nucleus. In this study, we obtained anti-pUL38 polyclonal sera. These antibodies were functional in western blotting and immunofluorescence in DEV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs). pUL38 was expressed as a 51-kDa protein from 8 h post-infection onward, initially showing a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm, and later in the nucleus. Furthermore, pUL38 was found in purified virus. These results provide the first evidence of the kinetics of expression and intracellular localization of DEV pUL38.

The crystalline phase transformation and the surface morphology of TiO2/ACF were investigated after calcination at various temperatures. X-ray diffraction results revealed the intensity of the diffraction peaks resulting from anatase increased in accordance with increasing calcination temperatures. An anatase-to-rutile phase transformation was observed for calcination at 1173 K. Morphology studies indicate that the TiO2 film fractured into irregular flakes on the ACF surface. TiO2/ACF calcined at 1173 K demonstrated the highest photocatalytic activity compared with samples calcined at lower temperatures. The enhancement of chemical oxygen demand removal may be due to the adsorption of ACF and the photocatalytic zonation of TiO2 in the combined treatment. The surface morphology of TiO2/ACF showed no change after re-use. Although micropores slightly increased, mesopores significantly decreased, and some oxygen-containing surface groups increased on the ACF surface after re-use, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/ACF was not affected.

Forty-seven estrus gilts were slaughtered at Day 19 after the second estrus, oocytes were recovered from follicles >4 mm in diameter, and matured in vitro for 44 h. Gilts fed high-energy diets had more follicles >4 mm (mean, 25 8 vs 19.1, P < 0 05) and more oocytes that reached metaphase II (80 3 vs 64.0%, P < 0.05) than those fed the low-energy diet Furthermore, gilts fed starch-rich diets had enhanced oocyte nuclear maturation relative to those fed fat-rich diets (75.4 vs 68 0%, P < 0.05). Compared to the lower-energy feeding groups, high-energy feeding groups had higher (P < 0.05) blood concentrations of postprandial insulin (1562 4 vs 990.0 ng/4 h), IGF-1 (321 2 vs. 256 9 ng/mL), and LH pulses (2 7 vs I 4 pulses/6 h) Follicular fluid concentrations of IGF-1 (198 5 vs 143 1 ng/mL) and estradiol (152 6 vs 124 8 ng/mL) were higher (P < 0 05) in the high-energy group than in the normal group Compared with gilts fed the high-energy diet supplemented with fat, gilts fed the high-energy diet supplemented with starch had a tendency (P < 0 10) towards increased IGF-1 concentration in both blood and follicular fluid, and unproved oocyte nuclear maturation during culture in vitro We inferred that starch-rich, high-energy diets during rearing may improve ovarian follicular development and oocyte maturation in replacement gilts Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[Zhou, D.

Information concerning the pig microRNAome (miRNAome) has been long overdue and elucidation of this information will permit an atlas of microRNA (miRNA) regulation functions and networks to be constructed. Here we performed a comprehensive search for porcine miRNAs on ten small RNA sequencing libraries prepared from a mixture of tissues obtained during the entire pig lifetime, from the fetal period through adulthood. The sequencing results were analyzed using mammalian miRNAs, the precursor hairpins (pre-miRNAs) and the first release of the high-coverage porcine genome assembly (Sscrofa9, April 2009) and the available expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. Our results extend the repertoire of pig miRNAome to 867 pre-miRNAs (623 with genomic coordinates) encoding for 1,004 miRNAs, of which 777 are unique. We preformed real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR) experiments for selected 30 miRNAs in 47 tissue-specific samples and found agreement between the sequencing and q-PCR data. This broad survey provides detailed information about multiple variants of mature sequences, precursors, chromosomal organization, development-specific expression, and conservation patterns. Our data mining produced a broad view of the pig miRNAome, consisting of miRNAs and isomiRs and a wealth of information of pig miRNA characteristics. These results are prelude to the advancement in pig biology as well the use of pigs as model organism for human biological and biomedical studies.

In this work, our extensive work tested water, soil and crop samples from 21 provinces in China. Soils nearby and waste waters from melamine-manufacturing factories were examined, and the highest melamine concentrations in waste water and soil samples were 226.766 and 41.136 mg/kg, respectively. Six of 94 irrigation water samples had melamine at a concentration of 21-198 mu g/L Only 1 sample collected from 124 farmlands farther than 150 km from melamine factories was detected for melamine at a content of 176 mu g/L. Only 3 out of 557 crop samples contaminated more than 1 mg/kg melamine, with the highest level of 2.05 mg/kg in a wheat sample. When basal diets contained 2 mg/kg melamine were fed to various animals, deposition of melamine in animal tissues and products was all lower than 122 mu g/kg. The melamine deposition was much higher (e.g., 4483 mu g/kg in the kidney of chicken) when diets contained 100 mg/kg melamine but was found to be completely depleted after 96 h for all animals after switching to the basal diets. Our work may be valuable to regulate melamine production and monitor the safety of food and animal products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Green hams were salted for 40 d and then ripened in a ventilated chamber for 15 months. Adipose triglyceride lipase and HSL could be detected during the whole ripening period of Xuanwei ham, but their protein levels decreased as the ripening time increased. The decrease of lipase proteins Could be attributed to the decrease in protein synthesis as ripening time progressed. The level of free fatty acids (FFAs) increased at the first stage but HSL protein remained constant indicating that HSL was more important than ATGL for adipose tissues lipolysis.

The amino acid sequences of the main wheat flour allergens associated with baker's asthma were analyzed in this study. The gene sequences of monomeric (WMAI), dimeric (WDAI), tetrameric (WTAI, which contains 1 WTAI-CM2 unit, 2 CM3 units and 1 CM16 unit) alpha-amylase inhibitor and fructose bisphosphate aldolase from wheat, barley and rye were obtained and characterized. Compared with other main allergens, it was shown that the fifteen proteins have a common conserved cysteine skeleton and the presence of CC and CX(1-4)C motifs, which are not usually found in other non-allergenic proteins. Most of these allergens have putative N-glycosylation sites. Protein structure either mediated through disulfide bonds or through higher order protein-protein interactions, plays a critical role in the allergenicity of allergens. It was also found that the same protein family allergens did not share similar 3D structures. With regard to the characterized sequences as well as protein structures of allergens, it is obvious that the flour proteins that have been implicated as important wheat seed allergens causing baker's asthma are complex but have some specific related behavioral traits.

The regression function for average daily body gain (ADO) was: Y = 5.31511794 + 5.455582552X3 + 0.026494118685X4 - 0.00000007785039453X1 * X1 - 6.839892518X3 * X3 - 0.00015110802779X4 * X4 + 0.000022749876748X1 * X2 + 0.0000026391823088X1 * X4 - 0.0004926339297X2 * X4 - 0.009843794221X3 * X4, where y = ADG; X1 = dosage of betaine; X2 = dosage of CLA; X3 = dosage of Met-Cr and X4 = dosage of CS. The regression function predicted that when the dosage of betaine, CLA, Met-Cr and CS was 408.1856 mg/kg, 0 mg/g, 0.325 mg/g and 80.2788 mg/kg, respectively, the ADO would be the highest as 7.3355 g/d.

The regression function predicted that when the dosage of betaine, CLA, Met-Cr and CS was 44.4714 mg/kg, 2.4944 mg/g, 0 mg/g and 154.7228 mg/kg, respectively, the FCR would be highest as 3.2988. The parameters of the regression function for ADG and FCR were acceptable and the predicted value was near the observed value for ADO and FCR in negative control treatment, respectively. Betaine and CS had significantly synergistic action on ADG and FCR. CLA and CS had antagonistic action on ADO. Significantly synergistic action of Met-Cr and CS on FCR was found. Furthermore, low synergistic action of Met-Cr and betaine as well as Met-Cr and CLA on FCR was found. These findings will help future combination of them in obesity prevention and treatment as well as in animal production.

It may also affect lipid deposition in birds. However, the molecular mechanism of its actions in birds remains unknown. In the present study, the coding sequence of ADP cDNA for Chinese native breed Sichuan Mountainous Black-bone chicken (MB) was first cloned from abdominal fat using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). This putative MB ADP cDNA (1,881 bp) encodes an open reading frame of 438 amino acids (AA) and shares high AA sequence identity with that of red jungle fowl (99%), duck (92%), house mouse (70%), human (70%), chimpanzee (70%), pig (70%), domestic cow (69%) and domestic sheep (68%). Further analysis using bioinformatics shows the deduced MB ADP protein has the typical characters of PAT (Perilipin, Adipophilin and Tip47) family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that ADP expresses in chicken leg muscle, whole brain, heart, liver, pectoralis muscle, abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat. Ontogenetic expression studies shows ADP expression levels in abdominal fat, subcutaneous fat and pectoralis muscle were prior to that in leg muscles at posthatch day (P) 84. But, its levels in abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat were less than that in leg muscles at P28, 42, 56 and 70, respectively. The ADP expression levels in subcutaneous fat and abdominal fat were stable from P28 to P70 and both were less than their counterparts at P84. However, it changed greatly in pectoralis muscle, liver, brain, heart and leg muscle at all points. Patterns of ADP expression suggest that ADP plays an important role in fat development, but further study is needed to reconfirm its function in a large population and in other breeds with different genetic backgrounds.

While in one case, the ES cell-derived germ cells have been reported to give birth to live offspring in the mouse, these cells differ in fertilization capacity from the sperm and oocytes produced in vivo as they cannot complete meiosis under in vitro conditions. The efficiency of functional germ cell isolation from ES cells is also low. According to published reports, factors such as the proper selection of feeder cells, including ovarian granulosa cells and those which could secrete bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4), and the addition of retinoic acid into culture medium, could to some extent establish and improve the microenvironment ES cells rely on for differentiation into germ cells. This review briefly describes the progress of deriving germ cells from ES cells and discusses possible factors that could improve in vitro gamete production. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 77: 586-594, 2010.

So far, three 8-vinyl reductase genes (DVR, bciA, and slr1923) have been characterized from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Chlorobium tepidum, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. However, no 8-vinyl reductase gene has yet been identified in monocotyledonous plants. In this study, we isolated a spontaneous mutant, 824ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant exhibited a yellow-green leaf phenotype, reduced Chl level, arrested chloroplast development, and retarded growth rate. The phenotype of the 824ys mutant was caused by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene on the short arm of rice chromosome 3. Map-based cloning of this mutant resulted in the identification of a gene (Os03g22780) showing sequence similarity with the Arabidopsis DVR gene (AT5G18660). In the 824ys mutant, nine nucleotides were deleted at residues 952 to 960 in the open reading frame, resulting in a deletion of three amino acid residues in the encoded product. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of Chls indicated the mutant accumulates only divinyl Chl a and b. A recombinant protein encoded by Os03g22780 was expressed in Escherichia coli and found to catalyze the conversion of divinyl chlorophyll(ide) a to monovinyl chlorophyll(ide) a. Therefore, it has been confirmed that Os03g22780, renamed as OsDVR, encodes a functional DVR in rice. Based upon these results, we succeeded to identify an 8-vinyl reductase gene in monocotyledonous plants and, more importantly, confirmed the DVR activity to convert divinyl Chl a to monovinyl Chl a.

To systematically track the genesis and evolution of H9N2 viruses in this region, whole genome sequences of seventeen H9N2 isolates were obtained and their phylogenetic properties were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several newly emerged lineages of gene segments in addition to the Y280-like and A/chicken/Shanghai/F/98(F 98)-like lineages, which are prevailing in northern and eastern China according to previous reports. Reassortments among these gene segments generated five novel genotypes of H9N2 viruses that have not been reported before in China. The emerging genotypes of H9N2 viruses in this region indicate that H9N2 virus genes undergo active evolution, particularly their internal genes, which raises concern for their likely contribution to gene reassortment and production of AlVs with new properties. Our study provides valuable insight into the prevalence of H9N2 viruses in northern and eastern China and demonstrates the need of long-term monitoring of the evolution of H9N2 AN.

It is difficult to combine micro-evaluation with the macro-evaluation process. To effectively eliminate the subjective errors of the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a new modeling approach-the analytic hierarchy process and grey target theory (AHP-GTT) systematic model-is presented in this study to evaluate water quality in a certain watershed. A case study of applying the AHP-GTT systematic model to the evaluation and analysis of the water environment was conducted in the Yibin section of the Yangtze River, China. The micro-evaluation is based on defining the weights of indices of the water quality (IWQ) of each water cross-section, while the macro-evaluation is based on calculating the comprehensive indices of water environmental quality and analyzing the tendency of the water environment of each cross-section. The results indicated that the Baixi and Shuidongmen sections are seriously polluted areas, with the tendencies of becoming worse. Also, the key IWQs of these two cross-sections are 5-day biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand of permanganate, respectively. Water Environ. Res., 82, 633 (2010).

A prevalent IBV strain ZY3 was isolated and the highly antigenic region of its SI gene was amplified and expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET-32a (+) vector. The fusion protein, which was expressed at a high level was similar antigenically to the native S1 protein as determined by Western blot assay using rabbits polyclonal antibodies against IBV ZY3 strain. The fusion protein was also purified. This research lays the foundation for using this recombinant protein for development of indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for serum antibody detection or for production of monoclonal antibodies against prevalent IBV.

The influence of different parameters on Cu2+ uptake by the three biomasses, such as initial Cu2+ concentration, initial pH of solution, contact time and temperature, was studied. The mechanism of Cu2+ binding by biomass was investigated by a number of techniques. Evidence from potentiometric titration revealed that the concentration of carboxyl and amino groups is higher on the caustic and ethanol-baker's yeast compared to the pristine baker's yeast and FTIR spectra confirmed carboxyl, and amino groups on the surface of baker's yeast could be available for characteristic coordination bonding with Cu2+. In addition, SEM and Zeta potential of the three samples show that caustic and ethanol-pretreatment resulted in the change of baker's yeast surface structure and charge which is relative to adsorption. These results demonstrate that the increase of biosorption capacity for Cu2+ by ethanol and caustic-baker's yeast was attributed to the increase and exposure of carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of biomass sample.

Alpha-amylase inhibitors have been widely investigated for their possible use in strengthening a plant's defense against insects that are highly dependent on starch as an energy source. We attempted to unravel the diversity of monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes of Israeli and Golan Heights' wild emmer wheat with different ecological factors (e. g., geography, water, and temperature). Population methods that analyze the nature and frequency of allele diversity within a species and the codon analysis method (comparing patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in protein coding sequences) were used to detect natural selection. Results: Three hundred and forty-eight sequences encoding monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors (WMAI) were obtained from 14 populations of wild emmer wheat. The frequency of SNPs in WMAI genes was 1 out of 16.3 bases, where 28 SNPs were detected in the coding sequence. The results of purifying and the positive selection hypothesis (p < 0.05) showed that the sequences of WMAI were contributed by both natural selection and co-evolution, which ensured conservation of protein function and inhibition against diverse insect amylases. The majority of amino acid substitutions occurred at the C-terminal (positive selection domain), which ensured the stability of WMAI. SNPs in this gene could be classified into several categories associated with water, temperature, and geographic factors, respectively. Conclusions: Great diversity at the WMAI locus, both between and within populations, was detected in the populations of wild emmer wheat. It was revealed that WMAI were naturally selected for across populations by a ratio of dN/dS as expected. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs. A sharp genetic divergence over very short geographic distances compared to a small genetic divergence between large geographic distances also suggested that the SNPs were subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary role in polymorphisms at this locus. According to population and codon analysis, these results suggested that monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors are adaptively selected under different environmental conditions.

In this study, we expressed and presented the characterization of the DPV gE product. Results: According to the sequence of the gE gene, a pair of primers were designed, and the DNA product with 1490bp in size was amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was cloned into pMD18-T vector, and subcloned into pET32a(+), generating the recombinant plasmid pET32a/DPV-gE. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the fusion pET32a/DPV-gE protein was highly expressed after induction by 0.2 mM IPTG at 30 degrees C for 4.5 h in Rosseta host cells. Over expressed 6xHis-gE fusion protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and used to immunize the rabbits for the preparation of polyclonal antibody. The result of the intracellular localization revealed that the gE protein was appeared to be in the cytoplasm region. The real time PCR, RT-PCR analysis and Western blotting revealed that the gE gene was produced most abundantly during the late phase of replication in DPV-infected cells. Conclusions: In this work, the DPV gE protein was successfully expressed in a prokaryotic expression system, and we presented the basic properties of the DPV gE product for the first time. These properties of the gE protein provided a prerequisite for further functional analysis of this gene.

Ten pairs of primer combinations with high polymorphism and resolution were selected from 64 primers. These 10 primer combinations resulted in a total of 480 bands, of which 374 bands (77.9%) were polymorphic and 51 bands (10.6%) were specific. Cluster analyses showed that 7 varieties of cottons were divided into two groups. Our results suggested that interspecific hybridization is feasible to broaden germplasm of upland cotton and AFLP technique could be applied for the identification of variety purity and genealogical relationship.

A total of 1050 Jian carp (11.71 +/- 0.05 g) were randomly distributed into seven groups, feeding diets containing graded levels of pyridoxine (0.2, 1.7, 3.2, 5.0, 6.3, 8.6 and 12.4 mg kg-1 diet). After 80 days of feeding, a challenge trial was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila for 17 days. Results indicated that with increasing dietary pyridoxine concentration up to 5.0 mg kg-1 diet, survival rate after challenge with A.hydrophila and phagocytic activity of leukocyte were improved (P < 0.05), and plateaued thereafter (P > 0.05). Red blood cell and white blood cell counts were lowest when fed the diet containing 1.7 mg pyridoxine kg-1 diet. Haemagglutination titre, lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase activity, total iron-binding capacity, antibody titre and immunoglobulin M content followed the similar pattern to that observed with survival rate. Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus counts in intestine were not affected by dietary pyridoxine concentration (P > 0.05). These results suggested that pyridoxine could enhance immune response of fish.

A rabbit anti-UL51 polyclonal serum, raised against a recombinant 6-His-UL51 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli, was prepared, purified, and used as primary antibodies. Fifty-eight 30-day-old DEV-free ducks were intramuscularly inoculated with the pathogenic DEV CHv strain as infection group, and two ducks were selected as preinfection group. The tissues were collected at sequential time points between 2 and 480 hr postinoculation (PI) and prepared for immunoperoxidase staining. DEV UL51p was first found in the spleen and liver at 8 hr PI; in the bursa of Fabricius and thymus at 12 hr PI; in the Harders glands, esophagus, small intestine (including the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), and large intestine (including the caecum and rectum) at 24 hr PI; in the glandularis ventriculus at 48 hr PI; and in the pancreas, cerebrum, kidney, lung, and myocardium at 72 hr PI. Throughout the infection process, the UL51p was not seen in the muscle. Furthermore, the intensity of positive staining of DEV UL51p antigen in various tissues increased sharply from 8 to 96 hr PI, peaked during 120144 hr PI, and then decreased steadily from 216 to 480 hr PI, suggesting that the expressional levels of DEV UL51p in systemic organs have a close correlation with the progression of duck virus enteritis (DVE) disease. A number of DEV UL51p was distributed in the bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen, liver, esophagus, small intestine, and large intestine of DEV-infected ducks, whereas less DEV UL51p was distributed in the Harders glands, glandularis ventriculus, cerebrum, kidney, lung, pancreas, and myocardium of DEV-infected ducks. Moreover, DEV UL51p can be expressed in the cytoplasm of various types of cells, especially most abundantly in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes, reticulum cells, macrophages, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes. The present study may be useful not only for describing the characteristics of UL51p expression and distribution in vivo but also for a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of this DVE.

Molecular cloning of the duck MyoG and MRF4 genes CDS and their differential expression patterns in the breast and leg muscle during fetal development. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 90: 179-188. The MyoG and MRF4 genes encode for transcription factors that play key roles in muscle formation during embryonic and fetal development. Due to the unique functions of these two genes, they have a specific expression pattern in the same muscle tissues. In order to investigate the different developmental expression patterns of the two genes, the coding region sequences of duck MyoG and MRF4 were cloned and their mRNA expression patterns in the duck breast and leg muscles were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The duck MyoG and MRF4 both have a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain with high homology to several other species. In addition, there is a low homology region at the carboxy-terminus of these two proteins. The mRNA expression of MyoG reaches a peak at embryonic day 14 (E14d) in both the breast muscle and the leg muscle of duck. The peak mRNA expression of MRF4 appears at E14d in the breast muscle and at E18d in the leg muscle. The expression patterns of MyoG and MRF4 were different between the breast muscle and the leg muscle of duck. In the fetal duck, the leg muscle develops earlier than the breast muscle, which may better accommodate the newborn duck to a new environment postnatally.

First, time history curves of residual strain of frozen soil are obtained and analyzed under different temperatures, frequency, confining pressure and moisture content. And conclusions can be drawn that the axial strain rate is greatly affected by the amplitude of dynamic stress, as well as increases with dynamic to static stress ratio and temperature rising, while it decreases with the raise of frequency and moisture content. Hereby, the power functions were adopted to fit the relationships of axial dynamic strain rate vs. stress ratio, temperature, frequency, and moisture content, respectively. Simultaneously, the permafrost dynamic subsidence mechanism was interpreted rationally and the variation of fitting parameters was discussed. Furthermore, the long-term traffic loading subsidence model was established through observing the axis residual strain time histories of frozen specimens under the longtime cyclic loading and adopting the amendment of vibratory number of times. The model can comprehensively consider the effects of stress state, temperature, moisture content, and confining pressure of frozen soil, as well as the vibratory frequency and vibration number of longtime cyclic loading. Consequently, the model can be applied to the train-induced subsidence forecast investigation of permafrost subgrade. The paper has an important significance for rational safety evaluation on long-term operation of permafrost regions railway such as QTR. Meanwhile, the investigation provides basic data for the further research on dynamic damage constitutive model of frozen soil under train traffic and the gradual improvement of railroading criterion in cold regions.

Total tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) content showed a downward trend to a point (P < 0.05). Conversely, total tissue anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reducase (GR) activities and glutathione (GSH) content were generally higher in MI-supplemented diets than MI-unsupplemented diet (P < 0.05). Muscle and intestinal superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal anti-superoxide anion (ASA) were increased by MI supplementation (P < 0.05), whereas these parameters in the other tissue showed no alterations (P > 0.05). These results indicated that antioxidant status was improved, and lipid peroxidation and protein oxidant were depressed in muscle, intestine and hepatopancreas by MI.

Using homologous primers, two gamma-gliadin genes (gli-Kr1 and gli-Kr2) were isolated from C. delileana, which had been deposited in the GenBank under accession numbers EU283818 and EU283821, respectively. Two gamma-gliadin genes of C. delileana had the similar primary structures to the corresponding gene sequences from other wheat related species. The differences were mainly resulted from substitutions, insertions and deletions involving single amino acid residues or motifs of gamma-gliadins. The repetitive domains of gli-Kr1 and gli-Kr2 from C. delileana are shorter than most of other sequences. By the alignment of gamma-gliadin genes from A, B, D, A(m), A(u), S, S(l), S(sh), S(s) and S(b) genomes of Triticum and Aegilops, R genome of Secale (gamma-secalin), Ee genome of Lophopyrum and K genome of Crithopsis in Triticeae, phylogenetic analysis indicated that two gamma-gliadin genes of C. delileana could be clustered together with a gamma-gliadin genefrom Ssh genome of Aegilops by an interior paralleled branch. It was the first time that the gamma-gliadin genes encoded by K genome of C. delileana were characterized. These could offer precious information for better understanding the qualities associated with gliadins, the response in coeliac disease and studying the evolutionary relationship of gliadins in Triticeae.

This study will help in understanding evolutionary mechanisms and relationships among the taxes in this section. The karyotypes of three species, F. densovillosum, F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes are being reported for the first time. F. esculentum, F. cymosum, F. tataricum and F. densovillosum are diploid while F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes are tetraploid, 2n = 4x = 32. At diploid level, the variation of the buckwheat chromosome karyotypes is bigger; however, on the tetraploid level, it shows a higher similarity. The karyotype evolutionary trend of buckwheat indicated that F. densovillosum seemed to be more advanced than F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes. F. densovillosum, F. gracilipes var. odontopterum. and F. gracilipes were found more closely related genetically whereas F. tataricum clustered into a separate group. F. esculentum and F. cymosum clustered together in one separate group.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of two novel HMW-GS alleles (1St 1.4 and 1St1.1) from the perennial Triticeae species Elymus glaucus. The amino acid (aa) sequences of E. glaucus 1St1.4 and 1St1.1 were predicted as 434 aa and 358 aa, respectively. Both subunits comprise a signal peptide with a conserved N-terminal domain, a central repetitive domain and a C-terminal domain. Elymus glaucus 1St 1.4 and 1St1.1 exhibit several distinct characteristics different from other known HMW-GSs. The lengths of repetitive domains in E. glaucus 1St 1.4 and 1St1.1 are substantially smaller than those of other known HMW-GSs, in which 1St1.1 (only 358 aa) is the smallest subunit identified so far. The N-terminal domains of E. glaucus 1St 1.4 and 1St1.1 are homologous to y-type subunits, whereas their C-terminal domains are similar to x-type subunits. Our results indicate that E. glaucus 1St 1.4 and 1St1.1 are novel HMW-GS variants or isoforms, and the characterization of both subunits can enhance our understanding on the structural differentiation and evolutionary relationship of HMW-GSs in Triticeae species.

Different methods and software were used and 6 phylogenetic trees were got based on the complete nucleotide sequence. To test the validation of these phylogenetic trees, the topologic structure differences between different trees were compared. The results indicate that the Neighbour Joining tree of the MyoG gene (Figure 2, NJ tree) has the best topological structure. In this NJ tree, 6 Chinese Domestic breeds cluster in one branch, Dahe and Wuzhishan pig constructed a new branch, Dahewu pig, Duroc and Standard MyoG gene sequence (Genbank accession number X89007) are clustered in one branch, the results are concord with the breeding history of these breeds and can reflect their true genetic background. Same topologic structure and parameters were found between different phylogenetic trees got by different methods. The same parameters of these trees confirmed the fact that the MyoG gene is very conservative and there are very few mutation sites between different breeds.

The importance of each parameter or property at each position in peptides is estimated by the value of the model RMSE obtained using leave-one-parameter-out (LOPO) approach in the SVR model. This will be provided with certain guidance meaning to design and exploit peptide analogues. The results also indicate that SVR can be used as an alternative powerful modeling tool for peptide QSAR studies, and give one advice (LOPO) about evaluating the importance of parameter in SVR model. Moreover, it also offered an idea about nonlinear relation between bioactive of peptides and their structural descriptors E. The establishment of such methods will be a very meaningful work to peptide bioactive investigation in peptide analogue drug design.

Relationship between Carbon Isotope Discrimination, Mineral Content and Gas Exchange Parameters in Vegetative Organs of Wheat Grown under Three Different Water Regimes	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						ash content; bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L; ); carbon isotope discrimination; drought; transpiration efficiency	DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; LEAF ASH CONTENT; GRAIN-YIELD; DURUM-WHEAT; USE EFFICIENCY; SPRING WHEAT; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; HELIANTHUS-ANNUUS; BREAD WHEAT; ACCUMULATION	Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) has been proposed as an indirect selection criterion for transpiration efficiency and grain yield in wheat. However, because of high cost for Delta analysis, attempts have been made to identify alternative screening criteria. Ash content (m(a)) has been proposed as an alternative criterion for Delta in wheat and barley. A pot experiment was conducted to analyse the relationship between Delta, mineral content and gas exchange parameters in seedlings and leaves of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Plants of 10 genotypes were cultivated under three different water regimes corresponding to moderate (T-3), intermediate (T-2) and severe drought (T-1) stress obtained by maintaining soil humidity at 75 %, 55 % and 45 % of the humidity at field capacity respectively. Delta and m(a) in seedlings and leaves showed significant differences among the three water treatments. Significant positive correlations were found between Delta and m(a) in seedlings and leaves at elongation and anthesis stages in severe drought stress (T-1). Delta was negatively associated with potassium (K) content in intermediate drought stress (T-2) and positively with magnesium (Mg) content in T-2 and T-3 (moderate drought stress) in flag leaf at anthesis. There were negative correlations between Delta and single-leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (W-T) in T-2 and T-3 at anthesis stage. Stronger positive associations were noted between Delta and stomatal conductance (g(s)) in T-1 and T-2 than in T-3 at anthesis. These results suggested that Delta is a good trait as an indirect selection criterion for genotypic improvement in transpiration efficiency, while m(a) is a possible alternative criterion of Delta in wheat vegetative organs, especially in stressed environments. Significant association was found between Delta and K, Mg and Ca contents that would merit being better investigated.

It consisted of 723 nucleotides and codes for 240 AA, including a bHLH domain. Relative mRNA developmental expression of MRF4 in heart tissues at different embryo stages and newborn birds (1w) was investigated. Duck MRF4 mRNA was expressed in each stage and the expression level of the day 18(th) stage was higher than that of other stages (P<0.05). It was concluded that MRF4 may be significant to the heart development regulation either through its bHLH domain directly or mediated by MEF2 gene family indirectly.

A total of 900 juvenile Jian carp (10.71 +/- 0.02 g) were randomly allocated into six groups of each three replicates, feeding isonitrogenous (35% crude protein) and isolipidic (7.8% crude fat) diets containing graded amounts of CLA (0, 0.5, 0.8, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0%) for 60 days. After a 60-day growth test, a challenge trial was conducted by intraperitoneal injection of Aeromonas hydrophila to determine the effect of CLA on disease resistance of juvenile Jian carp. The results showed that diets incorporated with a proportion of up to 2.0% CLA without effect on weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio, but improved immune parameters and disease resistance of juvenile Jian carp. The dietary CLA level of optimal disease resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila was estimated to be 1.7% in juvenile Jian carp using broken-line analysis.

To understand this gene better, gene cloning, expression and biological activity detection of Attacin A was carried out in present study. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) coding for Attacin A gene was generated using RT-PCR which takes total RNA extracted from Drosophila as the template. The gene was inserted directionally into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a (+). The resulting recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosetta. SDS-PAGE was carried out to detect the expression product which was induced by IPTG. The antimicrobial activity and hemolysis activity were tested in vitro after purification. Agarose gel electrophoresis indicated that the complete ORF of Attacin A gene has been cloned successfully from Drosophila stimulated by E. coli which includes 666 bp and encodes 221 AA. The gene encoding mature Attacin A protein was amplified by PCR from the recombinant plasmid containing Attacin A, which includes 570 bp in all. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the fusion protein expressed was approximately 39.2 kDa. Biological activities detection showed that this peptide exhibited certain antibacterial activity to several G- bacteria, as well as minor hemolysis activity for porcine red blood cells. In conclusion, Attacin A gene was cloned and expressed successfully. It was the basis for further study of Attacin.

J	Yan, XY; Gong, W				Yan, Xiaoyuan; Gong, Wei			The role of chemical and organic fertilizers on yield, yield variability and carbon sequestration- results of a 19-year experiment	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Long-term experiment; Yield variability; Yield trend; Roth-C model; Carbon sequestration	SOIL; CHINA; WHEAT; PRODUCTIVITY; MATTER; MANURE; AVAILABILITY; STABILITY; IMPACTS; BIOMASS	Fertilization practice in the North China Plain has been changing since the late 1970s. To evaluate how organic and chemical fertilizers contribute to yield, yield variability and soil carbon sequestration, we analyzed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield data in a long-term fertilization experiment that began in 1989, conducted pot experiments using soils from the long-term fertilization experiment plots, and simulated the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics of individual treatments in the long-term experiments. Wheat yield results showed that when organic fertilizer was used as an alternative nutrient source for chemical fertilizers, it was neither directly beneficial to crop yield, nor decreased yield variability when compared to a balanced chemical fertilizer. However, there was a linear relationship between yield trend and SOC change rate (r = 0.951, P < 0.01). The use of organic fertilizer increased SOC and soil fertility and consequently resulted in a larger yield trend when compared to a balanced chemical fertilizer. Roth-C model simulation and pot experimental results indicated that soils with higher SOC had a higher root/shoot ratio. Therefore, the long-term use of organic fertilizer not only directly increases SOC, but indirectly contributes to carbon sequestration by favoring root development. We found that yield variability was determined by the relative contributions of soil fertility and fertilizer to yield (the contribution of fertilizer to yield is the yield difference between fertilized and unfertilized treatments). The contribution of balanced chemical fertilizer to yield was higher than that of organic fertilizer, resulting in less yield variability in balanced chemical fertilizer treatment. However, if organic fertilizer was used as a complementary nutrient source with chemical fertilizers, it would increase the contribution of fertilizers to yield, thus decreasing yield variability.

In this study, a spontaneous male sterile mutant, SC-ms-2, was obtained from the F(4) progeny of the cross D 297B x Changfeng B. Microscopic observation revealed that the microspores were developed abnormally and the tapetum cells were incrassated during microsporogenesis. Genetic analysis indicated that male sterility of SC-ms-2 was controlled by a single recessive gene. By using bulked segregant analysis on two F(2) populations developed from crossing SC-ms-2 with Hua B and 'Nipponbare', this gene was finely mapped between two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on chromosome 9, RM24451 and RM7048, with genetic distance of 0.3 cM and 0.6 cM respectively, and the approximate physical distance was 172 kb. Our results showed that this gene was distinguished from all the other male sterility genes in rice reported and it was designated ms92(t), temporally. Moreover, candidate genes in the region of 172kb, including the rice homologue to the Arabidopsis MALE STERILITY1 (MS1) gene, were surveyed and discussed.	[Chen, J. B.; He, F.; Qin, P.; Wang, Y.

'Jingzhou rye' DNA as a probe to chromosomes of hexaploid triticale line Fenzhi-1 revealed that not only were all chromosomes of rye strongly hybridized along the entire chromosome length, but there were also stronger signals in terminal or subtelomeric regions. This pattern of hybridization signals is referred to as GISH banding. After GISH banding, sequential fluorescene in situ hybridizaion (FISH) with tandem repeated sequence pSc200 and pSc250 as probes showed that the chromosomal distribution of pSc200 is highly coincident with the GISH banding pattern, suggesting that GISH banding revealed chromosomal distribution of pSc200 in rye. In addition, FISH using pSc200 and pSc250 as probes to chromosomes of 11 species of the genus Secale and two artificial amphiploids (Triticum aestivum-S. strictum subsp. africanum amphiploid and Aegilops tauschii-S. silvestre amphiploid) showed that (1) the chromosomal distribution of pSc200 and pSc250 differed greatly in Secale species, and the trend towards an increase in pSc200 and pSc250 binding sites from wild species to cultivated rye suggested that pSc200 and pSc250 sequences gradually accumulated during Secale evolution; (2) the chromosomal distribution of pSc200 and pSc250 presented polymorphism on homologous chromosomes, suggesting that the same species has two heterogeneous homologous chromosomes; (3) the intensity and number of hybridization signals varied differently on chromosomes between pSc200 and pSc250, suggesting that each repetitive family evolved independently.

The diastereoisomeric 2-methyltetrols, 2-methylthreitol and 2-methylerythritol, are marker compounds of the photooxidation products of atmospheric isoprene. In order to obtain valuable information on the delta(13)C value of isoprene in the atmosphere, the stable carbon isotopic compositions of the 2-methyltetrols in ambient aerosols were investigated. The 2-methyltetrols were extracted from filter samples and derivatized with methylboronic acid, and the delta(13)C values of the methylboronate derivatives were determined by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). The delta(13)C values of the 2-methyltetrols were then calculated through a simple mass balance Equation between the 2-methyltetrols, methylboronic acid and the methylboronates. The delta(13)C values of the 2-methyltetrols in aerosol samples collected at the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserves in eastern China were found to be -24.66 +/- 0.90 parts per thousand and -24.53 +/- 1.08 parts per thousand for 2-methylerythritol and 2-methylthreitol, respectively. Based on the measured isotopic composition of the 2-methyltetrols, the average delta(13)C value of atmospheric isoprene is inferred to be close to or slightly heavier than -24.66 parts per thousand at the collection site during the sampling period.

The clinical, histological and ultrastructural features of ENA in goats were described. From July 2007 to May 2009, 21 cases of ENA in goats, from 6 months to 8 years old, were diagnosed solely in one big herd. Clinically, the affected goats showed nasal discharge, facial swelling, sneezing, stertorous breathing and weight loss. Tumours that originated from the ethmoid area of the nasal cavity were unilateral (18/21) or bilateral (3/21). All tumours were classified as low grade adenocarcinomas by histopathological examination and were displayed a combination of tubular and papillary growth. No metastases were detected in regional lymph nodes, brain or other organs. Ultrastructurally, virus-like particles with an average diameter between 80 and 110 nm were observed in 5/7 examined tumours.

In the present study, the recombinant Xyn2 was prepared from a 15 litre fermenter, and subsequently characterised. It has been confirmed to have a molecular mass of 21 kDa, an optimal pH of 6.0 and an optimal temperature of 60 degrees C. When tested using oat-spelt xylan, it showed a K-m and catalytic rate constant (k(cai)) of 1.1 mg/ml and 512.4/s, respectively. Analysis of the products from oat-spelt xylan degradation confirmed that the enzyme was an endoxylanase with xylotriose and xylobiose as the main degradation products. The unprocessed Xyn2 was supplemented to a xylan-containing diet to determine its influences on performance and nutrient digestibilities by weaned pigs. Results showed that the average body-weight gain increased 16.9 % when piglets received Xyn2 at a concentration of 500 U/kg diet. There also was a positive (0.05 < P<0.10) effect on the digestibility values of crude protein, ash, Ca and acid-detergent fibre with Xyn2 supplementation. The potential benefits of Xyn2 in the nutrition of weaned pigs should make it an alternative applicant for industrial xylanase production.

However, the Al tolerance of tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.), the AABB genome donor of hexaploid wheat, has not been well characterized To understand the Al tolerance of tetraploid wheat and identify potentially new sources of tolerance to acidic soils, 254 Triticum turgidum wheat lines, including six subspecies of T. turdigum ssp dicoccoides, ssp. dicoccon, ssp carthlicum, ssp turgidum, ssp durum, and ssp. polinicum, were screened for acid and Al tolerance by measuring the root regenerate lengths and the tolerance indices in acid nutrient culture solution containing Al Significant differences were observed either among or within tetraploid wheat subspecies on the RRL (root regenerate lengths). The orders for average RRL among subspecies in pH 7.00, pH 4 50 and pH 4.50 + 50 mu mol L(-1) Al(3+) were carthlicum >= turgidum >= durum >= dicoccoides >= polinicum >= dicoccon, carthlicum >= turgidum >= durum >= polinicum >= dicoccon >= dicoccoides and durum >= dicoccoides >= carthlicum >= turgidum >= polinicum >= dicoccon, respectively. Significant difference was also observed on the root acid tolerance index (RTI1) and root Al tolerance index (RTI2) either among or within tetraploid wheat subspecies. Compared to RTI2, RTI1 varied in a wide range but with large value The orders of the average RTI1 and RTI2 among subspecies were polinicum >= dicoccon >= carthlicum >= dicoccoides >= turgidum >= durum, and dicoccoides >= durum >= turgidum >= polinicum >= carthlicum >= dicoccon, respectively Significant difference on acid and Al tolerance was existed either among or within subspecies Some potentially tolerance germplasms different from those derived from hexaploid wheat, including 42 acid tolerance and 41 Al tolerance lines, were identified in 254 tetraploid wheat lines They provide new sources for hexaploid wheat acid and Al tolerance improvement.

This has resulted in a decline in the genetic diversity of agriculturally used wheat. However, the diversity lost in the elite material is somewhat preserved in crop gene banks. Therefore, the gene bank accessions provide the basis for genetic improvement of crops for specific traits and and represent rich sources of novel allelic variation. Results: We have undertaken large scale molecular allele mining to isolate new alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 from wheat gene bank accessions. The search for new Pm3 alleles was carried out on a geographically diverse set of 733 wheat accessions originating from 20 countries. Pm3 specific molecular tools as well as classical pathogenicity tests were used to characterize the accessions. Two new functional Pm3 alleles were identified out of the eight newly cloned Pm3 sequences. These new resistance alleles were isolated from accessions from China and Nepal. Thus, the repertoire of functional Pm3 alleles now includes 17 genes, making it one of the largest allelic series of plant resistance genes. The combined information on resistant and susceptible Pm3 sequences will allow to study molecular function and specificity of functional Pm3 alleles. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that molecular allele mining on geographically defined accessions is a useful strategy to rapidly characterize the diversity of gene bank accessions at a specific genetic locus of agronomical importance. The identified wheat accessions with new resistance specificities can be used for marker-assisted transfer of the Pm3 alleles to modern wheat lines.

Bulk soil organic carbon and nitrogen concentration at the soil depth of 0-20 cm were significantly lower in CF and RF than in NF, while no significant C/N ratio change was found. Top soil MnoxC concentration of CF showed a significant increase while RF demonstrated a slight decline compared to NF, whereas, non-MnoxC of CF and RF both presented a significant decline compare to NF. A different indication between chemical oxidization and physical fractionation method was found. POC, particulate organic nitrogen (PUN), mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) and mineral-associated organic nitrogen (MON) were significantly reduced in CF and RF compared to NF. CF, POC and PON showed significant reductions than that in RF. The losses of TOC and N in the particulate separates were more than that in the mineral-associated separates for both CF and RF. A significant decline of LFOC at 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm soil depths were found in CF and RF compared to NF, and a significant larger loss of LFOC in CF than in RF was also found. The heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) at the 0-10 cm soil depth was also significantly reduced in CF and RF, while there was no significant difference between CF and RF. The absence of vegetation cover in CF and RF, especially at the early stage of restoration, was contributed to the reductions in both labile and non-labile carbon. Timely thinning after canopy closure or establishing CF mixing with native broad-leaved species should be encouraged to mitigate the labile carbon loss.

After one growing period, the poplar accumulated the highest of 541.98 +/- 19.22 and 576.75 +/- 40.55 mu g cadmium per plant with 110.77 +/- 12.68 and 202.54 +/- 19.12 g dry mass in these contaminated purple soil and alluvial soil, respectively. Higher phytoextraction efficiency with higher cadmium concentration in tissues was observed in poplar growing in purple soil than that in alluvial soil at relative lower soil cadmium concentration. The poplar growing in alluvial soil had relative higher tolerance ability with lower reduction rates of morphological and growth characters than that in purple soil, suggesting that the poplar growing in alluvial soil might display the higher phytoextraction ability when cadmium contamination level increased. Even so, the poplars exhibited obvious cadmium transport from root to shoot in both soils regardless of cadmium contamination levels. It implies that this examined poplar can extract more cadmium than some hyperaccumulators. The results indicated that metal phytoextraction using the poplar can be applied to clean up soils moderately contaminated by cadmium in these purple soil and alluvial soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The crystals were found in one of three kidneys of hens treated with melamine at either 62.6 or 140.9 mg/kg. Furthermore, the melamine concentrations in egg, muscle, liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, uterus, ovary, and blood plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) methods. A higher dosage of melamine in the diet corresponded to higher concentrations in tissues and eggs. The concentrations of melamine in tissues were in the following ranges (mu g/g): egg, 1.1-28.7; muscle, 0.4-9.3; liver, 0.5-6.9; kidney, 1.3-21.7; stomach, 0.4-7.3; duodenum, 0,3-2.8; uterus, 0.5-6.9; ovary, 0.5-9.1; and blood plasma, 0.8-7.6. When melamine was withdrawn from the diet of hens, the melamine concentration in hen tissues fell to below 2.5 mu g/g by day 10 and no residues were detected in eggs or tissues at days 7 and 20, respectively.

These compounds are distributed predominantly in leguminous plants and play important roles in plant-environment interactions and human health. Consequently, the biosynthetic pathway of isoflavonoid compounds has been widely elucidated in the past decades. Up to now, most of the structural genes and some of the regulatory genes involved in this pathway have been isolated and well characterized. Nowadays, the protective effects of the legume isoflavonoids against hormone dependent cancers, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and menopausal symptoms have generated considerable interest within the genetic and metabolic engineering fields to enhance the dietary intake of these compounds for disease prevention. Subsequently, there are some great progresses in genetic and metabolic engineering to improve their yields in leguminous and non-leguminous plants and/or microorganisms. Because of the field of flavonoid biosynthesis has been reviewed fairly extensively in the past, this review concentrates on the more recent development in the isoflavonoid branch of phenylpropanoid pathway, including gene isolation and characterization. In addition, we describe the state-of-the-art research with respect to genetic and metabolic engineering of isoflavonoid biosynthesis.

ACFO fibers were modified with nitric acid (to yield ACFH fibers) or ammonia (to yield ACFN fibers) to create fibers with different porous structures and chemical properties. The adsorption properties of ACFO, ACFH, and ACFN depended on their pore diameter, but the catalytic properties were independent of their chemical properties. Acidic and basic surfaces both accelerated ozone decomposition, resulting in formation of hydroxyl radicals. Boehm titration and Fourier-transform infrared spectral studies indicated that the numbers of acidic and basic groups on ACFO. ACFH, and ACFN surfaces could be increased by this process, as could the surface areas and pores volumes. ACFO, ACFH, and ACFN could also be regenerated in situ after repeated use.

In this work we first constructed a general sewage treatment ecosystem (STE) which integrated the three systems. Emergy synthesis, with several improved emergy-based indicators which considered the waste input contribution and impacts of emissions, was applied to evaluate two alternative scenarios (scenario 1: sewage treatment system + treated water discharge + sludge landfilling: scenario 2: sewage treatment subsystem + reclaimed water reuse subsystem + aerobic compost production subsystem) for Mingjingtan sewage treatment plant in Wanzhou City of Chongqing in China. Results point out the environmental pressure of scenario 2 is much smaller than scenario 1 although its economic performance is somewhat poorer than scenario 1, and finally the sustainability of scenario 2 is still much better than scenario 1. Therefore, the treated water and sewage sludge reuse can further improve the environmental benefit of the sewage treatment process: however, the STE should be optimized in order to enhance its economic benefit. The proposed methods can help policy-makers make decisions and guide designers and operators to improve the comprehensive performance of sewage treatment processes. In addition, this paper also briefly discusses wastewater integrated management strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By employing the topological degree theory, delay differential inequality with impulses, linear matrix inequality (LMI) and Poincare inequality, a set of sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point. These global exponential stability conditions depend on the reaction-diffusion term. A comparison between our results and the previous results shows that our results establish a new set of stability criteria for reaction-diffusion neural networks and have improved the previous results.

To investigate the effect of Agaric-us bisporus residues return on soil fertility, this study compared the effects of five treatments on soil nutrients, soil enzymatic activities. N use efficiency and crop yields in a paddy soil under a rice-wheat rotation. Five treatments were designed including application of chemical fertilizer only (CF), a combined application of 30% fungal residues and 70% chemical fertilizer with the ratio of total N in the fungal residues to that in CF being 0.3:1 (30%FR), a combined application of 70% fungal residues and 30% chemical fertilizer with the ratio of total N in the fungal residues to that in CF being 0.7:1 (70%FR), a full dose of fungal residues return only with the ratio of total N in fungal residues to that in CF being 1:1 (100%FR), and a full return of fungal residues only with the ratio of total N in fungal residues to that in CF being 1.5:1 (150%FR). We found that the content of soil nutrients and soil enzymatic activities in the same treatment were higher at VGS (vegetative growth stage) than at RGS (reproductive growth stage) in rice and wheat seasons. 100%FR and 150%FR treatments had higher level of soil organic matter, available N. P. K, invertase, urease, neutral-phosphatase, catalase, N use efficiency and crop yields than CF treatment. These results indicated that A. bisporus residues return could positively affect soil nutrients, soil enzymatic activities, N use efficiency and crop yields as organic manure in a paddy soil. The information obtained will be helpful to more rational utilization of fungal residues. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We analyzed the amino acid sequence of UL46 using bioinformatics tools and defined the main antigenic domains to be between nucleotides 700-2,220 in the UL46 sequence. This region was designated UL46M. The DPV UL46 and UL46M genes were both expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) induced by isopropy 1-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subcloning into the prokaryotic expression vector pET32a(+). The recombinant proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA spin column and used to generate the polyclonal antibody against UL46 and UL46M in New Zealand white rabbits. The titer was then tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar diffusion reaction, and the specificity was tested by western blot analysis. Subsequently, we established Dot-ELISA using the polyclonal antibody and applied it to DPV detection. Results: In our study, the DPV UL46M fusion protein, with a relative molecular mass of 79 kDa, was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3). Expression of the full UL46 gene failed, which was consistent with the results from the bioinformatic analysis. The expressed product was directly purified using Ni-NTA spin column to prepare the polyclonal antibody against UL46M. The titer of the anti-UL46M antisera was over 1: 819,200 as determined by ELISA and 1: 8 by agar diffusion reaction. Dot-ELISA was used to detect DPV using a 1: 60 dilution of anti-UL46M IgG and a 1: 5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Conclusions: The anti-UL46M polyclonal antibody reported here specifically identifies DPV, and therefore, it is a promising diagnostic tool for DPV detection in animals. UL46M and the anti-UL46M antibody can be used for further clinical examination and research of DPV.

The diagnosis of DP currently relies on the use of live or inactivated whole DPV virion as antigens in ELISA, but it is too laborious and expensive for routine application, and it is still difficult to get purified DPV virion with current technology. Results: In this study, we describe the expression and purification of a recombinant Thymidine Kinase (TK) protein which makes antigen in an in-house developed, optimized and standardized ELISA. The specificity of the optimized TK-ELISA was evaluated by antisera against Duck Plague Virus (DPV), Duck Hepatitis B Virus (DHBV), Duck Hepatitis Virus (DHV), Riemerella Anatipestifer(R. A), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella anatum (S. anatum). Only antisera against DPV yielded a specific and strong signal. In order to determine the sensitivity of the TK-ELISA, a panel of diluted sera was tested, and the minimum detection limit of 1: 2560 (OD450 nm = 0.401) was obtained according to the endpoint cut-off (0.2438). The repeatability and reproducibility under the experimental conditions demonstrates a low variability (P > 0.05). The suspected sera samples (n = 30) were determined by TK-ELISA and the positive rate is 90% (27/30), and the TK-ELISA showed 83.33% (22+3/30) coincidence rate with the Serum Neutralization Test (SNT) and 90% (24+3/30) coincidence rate with the whole DPV virion based-ELISA (DPV-ELISA). When defining the dynamics of antibody response to attenuated live DPV vaccine, the maximum antibodies is reached after 4 weeks. Conclusions: The results suggest that the TK-ELISA provides high specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and reproducibility for detection of anti-DPV antibodies in duck sera, and has the potential to be much simpler than DPV-ELISA and SNT for the sera epidemiological investigation.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR, and H-1-NMR spectra were used to identify the formation of Pt-DEB target material. Sensitive properties of Pt-DEB-based quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor to various organic vapors such as trichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and methanol have been studied. The results show that Pt-DEB has good reversibility, reproducibility, and linear sensitivity to organic vapors at room temperature. The sensitivity of Pt-DEB (dissolved in CHCl3) toward CHCl3 is clearly higher than that toward other analytes, and a larger molecular weight of alcohol has a higher sensitivity response. The Pt-DEB-based QCM gas sensor shows low detection limits ranging from 1.0 to 3.56 ppm for the organic vapors and stable performance during a period of 30 days. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here, the levels of nucleotide diversity for COXII intron were obtained. The estimates of nucleotide diversity for different genome constitution ranged from theta = 0.00082 and pi = 0.00082 for St genome species to pi = 0.01227 and theta = 0.01229 for P genome species. Employing COXII intron sequences, the phylogenetic relationships within Kengyilia and between Kengyilia genus and its closely related genera were examined. The Maximum Parsimony analysis demonstrated that Kengyilia species were positioned into two clades corresponding to different maternal genomic donor. Kengyilia stenachyra, Kengyilia grandiglumis, Kengyilia hirsuta, Kengyilia melanthera, Kengyilia thoroldiana, Kengyilia alatavica and Kengyilia zhaosuensis were related to species of Agropyron, while Kengyilia kokonorica, Kengyilia rigidula, Kengyilia nana, Kengyilia mutica, Kengyilia longiglumis, Kengyilia laxiflora and Kengyilia gobicola were close to species of Roegneria and Pseudoroegneria. In addition, other three species of Kengyilia, such as Kengyilia batalinii, Kengyilia tahelacana and Kengyilia kaschgarica, were related to Douglasdeweya deweyi, Pseudoroegneria strigosa and Roegneria tibetica. This result indicated that there had been two phylogenetically divergent maternal donors within Kengyilia. Our new finding will help to understand the evolutionary history of the genus Kengyilia.

Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the nutritional protective effect of vitamin A supplementation on reproductive performance and immune function of the male mouse challenged with pseudorabies virus (PRV). Sperm quality, testis toll-like receptors (TLRs) mRNA expression levels, and serum concentration of cytokines and immunoglobulins at 7 or 14 days post-injection were compared between control mice and PRV-challenged mice fed the same diet supplemented with vitamin A at 0, 4000, 10,000, 25,000 and 50,000 1U/kg, respectively. PRV- and phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-injection were performed when the mice in the unsupplemented group were marginally deficient in vitamin A. Sperm quality (sperm density and deformity ratio) of PRV-injected mice was significantly harmed by PRV, but this effect was attenuated by increased vitamin A consumption. Vitamin A supplements also attenuated PRV-challenge-induced increase in testis TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 mRNA expression and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine (gamma interferon, IFN-gamma; and interleukin1-beta,IL-1 beta) concentration, and decrease in serum anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) concentration. Higher than normal vitamin A consumption was recommended to counteract the deleterious effects of viral invasion, possibly through the downregulated expression of TLRs, and thus to improve immunity and reproductivity of male mice challenged with an invading pathogen.

After PCR products were separated by horizontal common agarose electrophoresis, gel fragments containing the desired PCR products were directly subjected to NFM. The resulting gel was frozen in nitrogen canister for 60 s and thawed in 70 degrees C for 2 min and then centrifuged. DNA in the supernatant was stored at -20 degrees C until further use. PCR products in the size range of 100-2000 bp were purified within nearly 5 min. NFM could separate 2 DNA fragments that differed in length by 50 bp. As judged by the purification efficiency, the quality of PCR products separated by NFM was equal to that of the method of DNA purification by low-melting-agarose gel method (LMM) and freeze-squeeze method (FSM). NFM reduces the operational time and cost of recombinant DNA technology, in which purification of PCR products is a repetitive process. With no complicated equipment and technical training, NFM is very simple and easy to operate.

In the plant kingdom, trehalose is biosynthesized by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). Over-expression of exogenous and endogenous genes encoding TPS and TPP is reported to be effective for improving abiotic stress tolerance in tobacco, potato, tomato, rice, and Arabidopsis. On the basis of bioinformatics prediction, we cloned a fragment containing an open reading frame of 2,820 bp from maize, which encodes a protein of 939 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this gene belongs to the class I subfamily of the TPS gene family. Analysis of conserved domains revealed the presence of a TPS domain and a TPP domain. Yeast complementation with TPS and TPP mutants demonstrated that this protein has the activity of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR indicated that the expression of this gene is upregulated in response to both salt and cold stress.

We quantified gene expression by competitive reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The results indicated: First, 0150 nM insulin could increase the mRNA level of LPL in a dose-dependent pattern, and 200 nM insulin had an inhibiting effect. Second, there was a synergistic effect of insulin and glucose on LPL gene expression, and the synergistic effect of 30 mM glucose and 50 nM insulin was much higher than the single effect of insulin or glucose. In addition, the induction of LPL mRNA level by insulin and glucose was higher in Landes goose than the induction in Sichuan white goose. It was concluded that LPL was highly expressed in the goose liver, and the LPL gene level could be up-regulated by insulin and glucose.

Pigs were raised in the same condition, and SAT and LDM were sampled on 90 d, 180 d and 270 d. Lipids content decreased (P < 0.01) from 90 d to 180 d and increased (P < 0.01) from 180 d to 270 d in SAT and LDM. Neutral lipids in both tissues decreased (P < 0.01) from 90 d to 180 d and increased (P < 0.01) from 180 d to 270 cl, while phospholipids content changed inversely during the three selected time points. Developmental times had great influence on fatty acids (FAs) composition of neutral lipids, phospholipids and free fatty acids (FFAs) except FAs composition of FFAs in SAT. Lipids oxidative stability in SAT and LDM both decreased between 90 d and 180 d (P < 0.05) and increased by 270 d (P < 0.05). In conclusion, due to the increased contents of unsaturated fatty acids and decreased oxidation stability, Guizhou or other mini-pigs slaughtered at an early age may have a negative effect on meat quality.

Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, in situ apoptosis, and ultrastructure characterization of the digestive and lymphoid organs of new type gosling viral enteritis virus experimentally infected gosling	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						new type gosling viral enteritis virus; histopathology; distribution of viral antigen; in situ apoptosis; digestive and lymphoid organ	DUCK EMBRYO FIBROBLASTS; B-CELL DEVELOPMENT; T-CELLS; ADENOVIRUS; TURKEYS; BURSA; MOUSE; IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS; IMMUNODEFICIENCY; PATHOGENESIS	Here, for the first time, to colocalize new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) with histological lesions and in situ apoptosis in the digestive organs (esophagus, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, cecum, rectum, liver, and pancreas) and the lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, Harderian gland, and spleen) of experimentally infected goslings, portions of tissues were collected at sequential infection time points and examined by histopathology for histological lesions, immunohistochemical staining for viral antigens, ultrastructural observation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) for virus particles and apoptotic cells, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay for in situ apoptosis. The hyperemia, hemorrhage, infiltration of lymphocytes, progressive lymphoid depletion, apoptosis, and necrosis were readily observed in the lymphoid organs and intestine tract by histopathological examination. The NGVEV particles and viral antigens widely appeared in the small intestine and bursa of Fabricius as early as 2 d postinfection (PI) by TEM and immunohistochemical staining, and the presence and quantity of it reached a maximum during 6 to 12 d PI. The principal sites for NGVEV were endothelial cells, epithelia, mucosal cells, glandular cells, fibrocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. A series of apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic body were observed by TEM, and the number of apoptotic cells was largely increased from 4 d PI and peaked at 9 d PI by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling analysis. The histological organ lesions and apoptosis in vivo were generally associated with sites of NGVEV localization, which can be regarded as the cause of death. This work may shed light on the pathogenesis of new type gosling viral enteritis and put new insight into the pathogenesis of goose adenovirus.	[Chen, S.; Cheng, A. C.; Wang, M. S.; Chen, X.

Structural and functional characterization of a pollen-specific promoter NTPp13 in tobacco	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							GENE-FUSION MARKER; BETA-GLUCURONIDASE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; EXPRESSION; MAIZE	A novel 407 bp nucleotide sequence NTPp13 was isolated from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) by PCR, its structure and function were characterized. The NTPp13 sequence was highly homologous with the pollen-specific expression promoter Zm13 from maize (Zea mays L.) and contained some key motifs which controlled pollen-specific expression. The NTPp13 was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transferred into tobacco. Analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that this putative promoter fragment was sufficient to direct GUS expression specifically in the anther, exactly in the pollen and pollen tube, and that GUS activity reached the maximum at the stage of pollen grain began to separate. Further study showed that the expression of NTPp13 sequence at pollen was stable at the range of temperature measured. These data suggested that the NTPp13 sequence was likely the essential element of promoter region of an unknown pollen-specific gene from tobacco.

Organic goat production, processing and marketing: Opportunities, challenges and outlook	SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Goats	AUG 31-SEP 05, 2008	Queretaro, MEXICO	Int Goat Assoc		Goats; Organic; Production system; Environment; Animal welfare	SMALL RUMINANTS; SAINFOIN HAY; SYSTEMS; SUPPLEMENTATION; SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE; INFECTIONS; NEMATODES; ANGORA	Organic goat production can be a rewarding livelihood and is gaining popularity. Global organic production has increased significantly annually over the past decade. Industry analysts forecast that demand in many markets will continue to grow at 10-30% per year, with the international organic market expected to grow to a volume of US$ 100 billion in the next decade. Organic dairy has shown stronger growth rates than organic meat production. In certain regions, the rise in organic milk production has increased the range of processed value-added organic milk and dairy products, and demand is out-stripping supply. The basic principles of organic goat production include care, ecology, fairness, and health as stated by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement (IFOAM). Organic goat production can improve animal welfare, protect the environment, and sustain rewarding rural live styles. There are challenges when dealing with organic goat production, especially when one hopes to control intestinal parasites and to achieve adequate nutritional management. Exploring nutritional technology and disease prevention and treatment will eventually improve the production efficiency. There are various regulations in different countries that apply to certify organic foods, and the number of regulations is growing. One of the leading federations in international organic farming is IFOAM. The standards can be certified under IFOAM then can be recognized in many counties around the world. These regulations serve as branding effort, not only to protect the "organic" brand but also to promote it. Future of organic goat production will have to rely on continue search for alternatives in nutrition and disease prevention and control that are environmentally friendly, human health conscientious and animal considerate. Understanding organic goat farming from economic, ecological, and animal welfare perspectives will increase the likelihood of success. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lu, C.

Identification and validation of a major QTL conferring crown rot resistance in hexaploid wheat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							HEAD BLIGHT RESISTANCE; FUSARIUM-PSEUDOGRAMINEARUM; BREAD WHEAT; DISEASE; GENOME; GRAMINEARUM; POPULATION; CHROMOSOME; MARKERS; LOCUS	Crown rot (CR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a chronic wheat disease in Australia. As part of our objective of improving the efficiency of breeding CR resistant wheat varieties, we have been searching for novel sources of resistance. This paper reports on the genetic control of one of these newly identified resistant genotypes, 'CSCR6'. A population derived from a cross between CSCR6 and an Australian variety 'Lang' was analyzed using two Fusarium isolates belonging to two different species, one Fusarium pseudograminearum and the other Fusarium graminearum. The two isolates detected QTL with the same chromosomal locations and comparable magnitudes, indicating that CR resistance is not species-specific. The resistant allele of one of the QTL was derived from 'CSCR6'. This QTL, designated as Qcrs.cpi-3B, was located on the long arm of chromosome 3B and explains up to 48.8% of the phenotypic variance based on interval mapping analysis. Another QTL, with resistant allele from the variety 'Lang', was located on chromosome 4B. This QTL explained up to 22.8% of the phenotypic variance. A strong interaction between Qcsr.cpi-3B and Qcsr.cpi-4B was detected, reducing the maximum effect of Qcrs.cpi-3B to 43.1%. The effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were further validated in four additional populations and the presence of this single QTL reduced CR severity by up to 42.1%. The fact that significant effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were detected across all trials with different genetic backgrounds and with the use of isolates belonging to two different Fusarium species make it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) involved in its resistance.

CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS			English	Article						Dendrobium nobile Lindl.; Polysaccharide; Monosaccharides composition; Antioxidant activity	CAPACITY; EXTRACTS	Crude water-soluble polysaccharides were extracted from the stem of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. using boiling-water. The polysaccharides were successively purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 column, giving four major polysaccharide fractions termed DNP1-1, DNP2-1, DNP3-1, DNP4-2. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis showed that the average molecular weight (Mw) of polysaccharides (DNP1-1, DNP2-1, DNP3-1, DNP4-2) were approximately 136 kDa, 27.7 kDa, 11.8 kDa and 11.4 kDa, respectively. Monosaccharides analysis revealed the dominance of mannose, glucose, galactose, and smaller amounts of rhamnose, arabinose and xylose in the four polysaccharides. The evaluation of antioxidant activity suggested that DNP4-2 had good potential for scavenging activity of ABTS radical, and higher scavenging activity of hydroxyl radical and DPPH radical than the other polysaccharides, and should be explored as a novel potential antioxidant.

Barrows (n 6; aged 35 d; weight 8.6 kg), implanted with arterial, portal, mesenteric and gastric catheters, were fed a diet containing DL-methionine (DL-MET) or DL-HMTB once hourly and infused intra-mesenterically with 1 % p-aminohippurate and intragastrically with [1-(13)C]methionine at 7.0 mu mol/kg body weight per h. Arterial and portal blood samples were taken at hourly intervals until 6 h of tracer infusion and pigs was then killed for collection of muscle, intestine, liver and kidney samples. The net portal appearance of methionine, expressed as the fraction of ingested directly available L-methionine, was higher (P<0.05) in the DL-HMTB than in he DL-MET diet, and there was no difference (P=0.26) in the fractional portal balance of [1-(13)C]methionine between the diets. [1-(13)C]methionine enrichment (tracer:tracer ratio; mol/100 mol amino acid) in the jejunum, arterial and portal plasma, liver, kidney and muscle was also not different (P>0.05) between the groups. Over the 6 h period after the start of feeding, the average concentration of citrulline both in the arterial and portal plasma was higher (P<0.05) in the DL-HMTB than in the DL-MET group, and arterial plasma ornithine and taurine concentration was also higher (P<0.05) in the DL-HMTB than in the DL-MET group. However, plasma urea concentration both in the arterial and portal vein was lower (P<0.05) in the DL-HMTB than in the DL-MET group. These results suggested that the potential difference in the first-pass use of methionine by the intestine between the DL-HMTB and DL-MET diets might affect intestinal and systemic metabolism of other amino acids, which may provide new important insights into nutritional efficiency of different methionine sources.

The results showed that base composition, mutational bias and natural selection were the major determinants of the codon usage variation in the DPV gC gene. The primary codon usage trends in the DPV gC gene showed obvious difference with a strong bias towards the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon position. Characterization of nucleotide composition in the DPV gC gene was related to dinucleotide usage bias characterized by the variation of CpG islands. The ENc-plot and GC12s-GC3s revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in the gC genes of the 28 herpesviruses were constrained by G + C content. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that codon usage patterns of the DPV gC gene were phylogenetically conserved and similar to the gC genes of the avian alphaherpesvirinae. Furthermore, comparisons of the codon preferences in the DPV gC gene with those of Escherichia coli, yeast and human revealed that there was a statistically positive correlation between DPV and yeast (r = 0.646, P < 0.05). The above results could provide useful information for the synonymous codons usage bias of the DPV gC gene and promote the relevant mechanism for evolution, pathogenesis and functional studies in the area of DPV research and possibly studies with other herpesvirus viruses.

A methane gas sensor was made by deposition polyaniline/PdO thin films on a mass-type quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device through layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly method. Scanning electron microscopy inspection shows that the polyaniline/PdO multilayers are formed with a dense network of nanofibers. The frequency responses of the polyaniline/PdO based QCM sensor to methane gas were measured at room temperature and 50 degrees C. It exhibited that the polyaniline/PdO based QCM gas sensor has a better response at room temperature than that at 50 degrees C. Meanwhile, the humidity effect is also discussed.

Using the pH-sensitive carboxyl-modified magnetic nanoparticles, both cell capture and the subsequent removal of genomic DNA/protein complex after lysis can be achieved simply by magnetic separation. Furthermore, the yield and purity of pDNA extracted by MNPs are comparable to those obtained using organic solvents or commercial kits. This time- and cost-effective protocol does not require centrifugation or precipitation steps and has the potential for automated DNA extraction, especially within miniaturized lab chip applications.

Interestingly, a novel cry2A-type gene, encoding a 635 amino acid protein with 92% homology to cry2Ab1, was found and cloned from this strain. According to the nomenclature principles adopted for B. thuringiensis insecticidal crystal proteins, this gene represents a novel haplotype cry gene and was designated as cry2Ag1 by the Bacillus thuringiensis Pesticide Crystal Protein Nomenclature Committee. Cry2Ag1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and the results of insecticidal activity assays showed that Cry2Ag1 was toxic to both Dipteran (Aedes aegypti) and Lepidopteran (Plutella xylostella and Helicoverpa armigera) pests. These results strongly suggest that the cloning of the cry2Ag1 gene is not only of interest to researchers studying insecticidal crystal genes, but may ultimately serve as a solution to the increasing resistance of pests to currently used insecticides.
