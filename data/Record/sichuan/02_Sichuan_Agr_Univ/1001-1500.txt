In order to be well used by cells, glutamine must be transported to cells by specific transporters and converted to glutamate by glutaminase. There are currently several drugs that target glutaminase under development or clinical trials. Also, glutamine metabolism restriction has been proved to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth both in vivo and vitro through inducing apoptosis, growth arrest and/or autophagy. Here, we review recent researches about glutamine metabolism in cancer, and cell death induced by targeting glutamine, and their potential roles in cancer therapy.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher susceptibility to pathogens in goslings than in adult geese remains poorly understood. In this study, the histological sections of spleen tissue from a two-week-old gosling and an adult goose, respectively, were subjected to comparative analysis. The spleen of gosling was mainly composed of mesenchyma, accompanied by scattered lymphocytes, whereas the spleen parenchyma was well developed in the adult goose. To investigate goose immune-related genes, we performed deep transcriptome and gene expression analyses of the spleen samples using paired-end sequencing technology (Illumina). In total, 50,390 unigenes were assembled using Trinity software and TGICL software. Moreover, these assembled unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions and gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed. Through Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis, we investigated 558 important immune-relevant unigenes and 23 predicted cytokines. In addition, 22 immune-related genes with differential expression between gosling and adult goose were identified, among which the three genes showing largest differences in expression were immunoglobulin alpha heavy chain (IgH), mannan-binding lectin serine protease 1 isoform X1 (MASP1) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). Finally, of these 22 differentially expressed immune-related genes, seven genes, including tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (TNFRSF13B), C-C motif chemokine 4-like (CCL4), CXCR4, interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA), MHC class I heavy chain (MHCI), transporter of antigen processing 2 (TAP2) IgH, were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression levels of all the candidate unigenes were up-regulated in adult geese other than that of TNFRSF13B. The comparative analysis of the spleen transcriptomes of gosling and adult goose may promote better understanding of immune molecular development in goose.

Ni compounds can induce apoptosis, but the mechanism and the pathway of Ni compounds-induced apoptosis are unclear. We evaluated the alterations of apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt) pathway, and Bcl-2 family proteins induced by nickel chloride (NiCl2) in the kidneys of broiler chickens, using flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL), immunohistochemstry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We found that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, which was associated with decrease in MMP, and increase in apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) protein and mRNA expression. Concurrently, NiCl2 inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway, which was characterized by decreasing PI3K, Akt1 and Akt2 mRNA expression levels. NiCl2 also reduced the protein and mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increased the protein and mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak. These results show that NiCl2 causes mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by disruption of MMP and increased expression of AIF and EndoG mRNA and protein, and that the underlying mechanism of MMP loss involves the Bcl-2 family proteins modulation and PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition.

In agricultural practice, potassium deficiency is common worldwide, and leads to crop growth inhibition and output reduction. In this study, we analysed the transcriptome of tobacco seedlings under low potassium stress. Tobacco seedlings with or without decreased potassium treatment were harvested after 0 (control), 6, 12, or 24 h and were submitted for microarray analysis. The results showed that up to 3790 genes were upregulated or downregulated more than 2-fold as a result of the decreased potassium treatment. Gene ontology analysis revealed significantly differentially expressed genes that were categorized as cation binding, transcription regulation, metabolic processes, transporter activity and enzyme regulation. Some potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus transporters; transcription factors; and plant signal molecules, such as CPKs were also significantly differentially expressed under potassium deficiency. Our results indicate that the expression profiles of a large number of genes involved in various plant physiological processes are significantly altered in response to potassium deficiency, which can result in physiological and morphological changes in tobacco plants.

The level of economic development, population size, the efficiency of the industrial water use and the water resource development as well as utilization level were comprehensively considered. Through constructing all factor decomposition model, Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method was used to conduct decomposition analyses on the factors that caused the changes in total water consumption and water use efficiency in Urumqi from 1995 to 2012. The relative contribution rates of various positively driving factors and inhibitory factors were calculated, and their influence levels and directions were measured. The results indicated that the level of economic development and water use intensity, and the effects of industrial water use structures, economic level, and water use intensity were the determining factors that influenced the water use consumption and efficiency respectively. The results obtained from this study could provide guidance for the studies on the correct understanding of the relationship between the process of water utilization and the process of economic development in this oasis city and for promoting the social and economic development and for increasing the ensuring ability of water resources. The adjustment of industrial structures and the upgrading of industrial technologies caused certain inhibitory effects on the total water consumption but these effects were not strong. Other methods used as the supplements are needed for relaxation of the sharp contradictions between the demand and supply of water resources. The amount of water supply per capital had inhibitory effects to a certain extent on water resource utilization efficiency. The efficiency of water resource utilization can be increased through controlling water resources supply to artificially create the shortage of water resource supply so that the contradictions between the increasing demand on water use for social and economic development and the water supply shortage can be effectively alleviated.

Here, we isolated and characterized the full-length cDNA and DNA sequences of SBEI gene from diploid Triticeae species, Triticum monococcum, T. urartu, Aegilopsspeltoides, and Ae. tauschii. Then we predicted its protein structure, analyzed its evolutionary relationship with other species, and explored its expression patterns using real-time quantitative PCR. The SBEI cDNA includes a 2,490-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 829 amino acids. The genomic DNA of SBEI is 5,526-bp in length, containes fourteen exons and thirteen introns, and shares a similar structure with its homologous genes from other cereal plants. Sequence similarity ranging from 70.50% to 98.02% in exons and from 15.50% to 83.63% in introns was detected. Results of phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid sequences from T. monococcum and other plants indicated that T. monococcum SBEI is more closely related to T. boeoticum and T. urartu. Expression analysis revealed that T. monococcum SBEI and AGPase genes were highly expressed in the seeds at middle developmental stage. This is the first report on characterization of the SBEI gene in T. monococcum. These results could be used to explore the roles of this enzyme in amylopectin synthesis.

Here, 103 maize lines were used to compare root architectures under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. Significant genetic variation, with medium to high heritability and significant correlations, was observed for root traits. Total root length (TRL) and total root surface area (TSA) had high phenotypical diversity, and TRL was positively correlated with TSA, root volume, and root forks. The first two principal components explained 94.01% and 91.15% of total root variation in well-watered and water-stressed conditions, respectively. Thus, TRL and TSA, major contributors to root variation, can be used as favorable selection criteria at the seedling stage. We found that stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk groups (temperate backgrounds) showed relatively higher mean values for root morphological diversity than the TST group (tropical/subtropical background). Of the tested lines, 7, 42, 45, and 9 were classified as drought sensitive, moderately sensitive, moderately drought tolerant, and highly drought tolerant, respectively. Seven of the 9 extremely drought tolerant lines were from the TST group, suggesting that TST germplasms harbor valuable genetic resources for drought tolerance that could be used in breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in maize.

However, for economically viable industrial applications, it is necessary to increase their catalytic activities and/or protein yields to satisfy the increasing needs for feruloyl esterases. Results: The gene AnFaeA that encodes a type A feruloyl esterase was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris by a two-copy engineered yeast. After a screen in shaker flask, a one-copy strain GSKFA3 having the highest feruloyl esterase activity of 2.4 U/mL was obtained. Then, the pPICZ alpha A-AnFaeA plasmid was transformed into GSKFA3 and the transformants were grown on YPDS plates with antibiotic Zeocin. After cultivation, a two-copy strain GSKZ alpha FA20 with the highest feruloyl esterase activity of 15.49 U/mL was obtained. The expressed protein (recombinant AnFaeA) may be a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 40 kDa. It displayed the maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 50 degrees C, and was stable at a pH range of 4.0-6.5 and at below 45 degrees C. Its activity was not significantly affected by K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Na+ and EDTA, but activated by Fe2+. The Km and Vmax toward 4-nitrophenyl ferulate were 5.5 mM and 69.0 U/mg, respectively. Conclusions: The two-copy strain GSKZ alpha FA20 showed a 4.4-fold increase in extracellular enzyme activity compared with the one-copy strain GSKFA3. Construction of two-copy strain improved secretion of recombinant AnFaeA in P. pastoris. (C) 2015 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Mechanisms of Competitive Adsorption Organic Pollutants on Hexylene-Bridged Polysilsesquioxane	MATERIALS			English	Article						hexylene bridged polysilsesquioxane; organic pollutants; pore blockage; competition adsorption sites; competitive adsorption	PORE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; ACTIVATED CARBON; ATRAZINE; WATER; NOM; SILSESQUIOXANE; CONDENSATION; POROSITY; SORPTION; MIB	Hexylene-bridged periodic mesoporous polysilsesquioxanes (HBPMS) are a promising new class of adsorbent for the removal of organic contaminants from aqueous solutions. These hybrid organic-inorganic materials have a larger BET surface area of 897 m(2)g(-1) accessible through a cubic, isotropic network of 3.82-nm diameter pores. The hexylene bridging group provides enhanced adsorption of organic molecules while the bridged polysilsesquioxane structure permits sufficient silanols that are hydrophilic to be retained. In this study, adsorption of phenanthrene (PHEN), 2,4-Dichlorophenol (DCP), and nitrobenzene (NBZ) with HBPMS materials was studied to ascertain the relative contributions to adsorption performance from (1) direct competition for sites and (2) pore blockage. A conceptual model was proposed to further explain the phenomena. This study suggests a promising application of cubic mesoporous BPS in wastewater treatment.

Application of Chromatographic Techniques in the Detection and Identification of Constituents Formed during Food Frying: A Review	COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND FOOD SAFETY			English	Review							PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; TRANS-FATTY-ACIDS; CONJUGATED LINOLEIC-ACID; PHYTOSTEROL OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; IONIZATION-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; 2-DIMENSIONAL GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE; SIZE-EXCLUSION CHROMATOGRAPHY; GLYCEROL-BOUND COMPOUNDS	Frying is one of the most popular food processing methods. However, many physicochemical reactions occur during frying, forming complex products in both the frying oil and the fried food. Chromatographic techniques have been successfully applied to characterize the products formed during food-frying or during a simulated frying process. In this review, the specific products analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are elucidated in detail. The most studied components are polar compounds (such as volatile compounds, hydrolysis products, oxidized triacylglycerol [TAG] decomposition products, oxidized TAG monomers, sterol oxides, oxygenated TAG polymers, and acrylamide) and nonpolar compounds (such as cyclic fatty acid monomers and trans isomers), which are classified based on their polarity. However, the definite structures of TAG polymers and sterol oxides, and polymers analyzed by GC or HPLC-based methods are only investigated in modeled reactions. Furthermore, some of the sample pretreatments and chromatographic methods are only used to analyze the known products. A number of earlier trace amounts of undetected products need to be investigated by more effective detection techniques. The development of multidimensional chromatographic techniques and elaborate mass spectrometry detectors makes composition analysis possible for the food-frying process, which may effectively promote the development of quality monitoring and nutrition evaluation for the fried foods.

The aim of this study is to research the anti-infection effect of Chinese patent medicine "Wuhuanghu" for the treatment of porcine infectious pleuropneumonia and to evaluate the safety of "Wuhuanghu" in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of its toxicity. The anti-infection results showed that the treatment with "Wuhuanghu" could significantly inhibit pneumonia and decrement of the pneumonia in high, medium and low doses of "Wuhuanghu" groups were 70.97%, 61.29% and 58.06% respectively. The acute toxicity test showed that rats in the highest group (5000 mg/kg) had no death and no abnormal response, suggesting the LD50 of "Wuhuanghu" was more than 5000 mg/kg. The subchronic toxicity study showed that hematology indexes in all groups had no obvious differences; blood biochemical index, only albumin and total cholesterol in middle and low doses of "Wuhuanghu" groups were significantly decreased when compared with control group. The clinical pathology showed that the target organ of "Wuhuanghu" was liver. The safety pharmacology study indicated that "Wuhuanghu" had no side effects on rats. In conclusion, "Wuhuanghu" has therapeutic and protective effects to porcine infectious pleuropneumonia in a dose-dependent manner and "Wuhuanghu" is a safe veterinary medicine.

Two hundred one-day-old healthy male Avian broilers were divided into four groups, namely control group, AFB(1) group (0.3 mg/kg AFB(1)), +Se group (0.4 mg/kg Se), and AFB(1)+Se group (0.3 mg/kg AFB(1)+0.4 mg/kg Se). Compared with that of the control group, the relative weight of kidney was increased in the AFB(1) group. There were no significant differences between the AFB(1)+Se group and the control group. By histopathological observation, the renal epithelia were swelling and necrosis at 7 and 21 days of age. Ultrastructurally, the lipid droplets and expanded endoplasmic reticulum appeared in the plasma of epithelia cells in the AFB(1) group. Enlarged mitochondria with degenerated cristae were observed in the +Se group. Compared with the control group, the contents of serum creatinine and serum uric acid in the AFB(1) group were increased, while the activity of renal Na+-K+ ATPase was decreased. When 0.4 mg/kg selenium was added into the diet containing 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1), there were no obvious histological changes in the AFB(1)+Se group, and the contents of the serum creatinine and serum uric acid contents and the activity of renal Na+-K+ ATPase were close to those in the control group. In conclusion, sodium selenite exhibited protective effects on AFB(1)-induced kidney toxicity in broilers.

Developmentally regulated HEART STOPPER, a mitochondrially targeted L18 ribosomal protein gene, is required for cell division, differentiation, and seed development in Arabidopsis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Cellularization; development; differentiation; embryo; endosperm; lethality; mitochondria; ribosome; ros; seed	THALIANA; EMBRYO; ENDOSPERM; EXPRESSION; SEQUENCE; MERISTEM; ENCODES; GENOME; STRESS; GROWTH	An Arabidopsis L18 mitochondrial ribosomal protein modulates cell division, differentiation, and development, potentially with other diverse L18 family members, by forming heterogeneous ribosomes in mitochondria.Evidence is presented for the role of a mitochondrial ribosomal (mitoribosomal) L18 protein in cell division, differentiation, and seed development after the characterization of a recessive mutant, heart stopper (hes). The hes mutant produced uncellularized endosperm and embryos arrested at the late globular stage. The mutant embryos differentiated partially on rescue medium with some forming callus. HES (At1g08845) encodes a mitochondrially targeted member of a highly diverged L18 ribosomal protein family. The substitution of a conserved amino residue in the hes mutant potentially perturbs mitoribosomal function via altered binding of 5S rRNA and/or influences the stability of the 50S ribosomal subunit, affecting mRNA binding and translation. Consistent with this, marker genes for mitochondrial dysfunction were up-regulated in the mutant. The slow growth of the endosperm and embryo indicates a defect in cell cycle progression, which is evidenced by the down-regulation of cell cycle genes. The down-regulation of other genes such as EMBRYO DEFECTIVE genes links the mitochondria to the regulation of many aspects of seed development. HES expression is developmentally regulated, being preferentially expressed in tissues with active cell division and differentiation, including developing embryos and the root tips. The divergence of the L18 family, the tissue type restricted expression of HES, and the failure of other L18 members to complement the hes phenotype suggest that the L18 proteins are involved in modulating development. This is likely via heterogeneous mitoribosomes containing different L18 members, which may result in differential mitochondrial functions in response to different physiological situations during development.

One hundred and twenty Chinese yellow quails were divided into 12 groups. After dissecting, the weight, length, width and index analysis of the BF were determined, and histomorphological observation was performed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining at different ages. The weight of the BF gradually increased with age from 0 to 5 wk, reached a peak at 5 wk (100.23 +/- 6.47), then decreased quickly from 5 to 9 wk (63.21 +/- 3.90) and decreased slowly after 9 wk (P<0.05). The length of the BF was greater at 5 wk old than at 0 wk old (11.00 +/- 2.45 vs. 5.00 +/- 1.15, P<0.05), and there was no significant difference after 5 wk of age (P > 0.05). The width of the BF was similar to the length. The organ index was higher at 1 wk of age compared with 5 wk of age (1.25 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.05, P<0.05) and reached its maximum from 0 to 36 wk of age. Histomorphological analysis revealed the different development stages of the BF at different ages. We detected the age-related development of the BF in Chinese yellow quails and observed the histomorphological modifications. This study may help increase our understanding of the quail's immune system and provide a basis for immunization research in Chinese yellow quails.

Molecular Mapping of YrSP and Its Relationship with Other Genes for Stripe Rust Resistance in Wheat Chromosome 2BL	PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							F-SP TRITICI; ADULT-PLANT RESISTANCE; PUCCINIA-STRIIFORMIS; COMMON WHEAT; VIRULENCE CHARACTERIZATION; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; UNITED-STATES; LINKAGE MAPS; MARKERS; CULTIVARS	Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Resistance is the best way to control the disease. YrSP, a gene originally from 'Spaldings Prolific' wheat and providing resistance to a broad spectrum of races, is used for differentiating striiformis f. sp. tritici races but its chromosomal location is not clear. To map YrSP, a near-isogenic line (AvSYrSPNIL) was backcrossed to the recurrent parent, Avocet S. Genetic analysis of the BC7F1, BC8, BC7F2, and BC7F3 progenies confirmed a single dominant gene for resistance. In total, 182 BC7F2 plants and their derived BC7F3 lines were phenotyped with an avirulent P. striiformis f sp. triad race and genotyped with simple-sequence repeat (SSR), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. A linkage map was constructed with 3 SSR, 17 SNP, and 3 STS markers covering 23.3 centimorgans (cM). Markers IWA638 and dp269 were 0.6 cM proximal and 1.5 cM distal, respectively, to YrSP. The gene was mapped in chromosome bin 2BL-C-0.5, physically within the proximal 50% of the chromosome 2BL arm. Allelism tests based on F-2 phenotypes indicated that YrSP is closely linked to but not allelic with genes Yr5, Yr7, Yr43, Yr44, and Yr53. Infection type data from tests with 10 historical and currently predominant P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races in the United States also demonstrated differences in specificity between YrSP and the other genes. The specificity of YrSP is useful in differentiating P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races and studying the plant pathogen interactions, and the information of chromosomal location of the gene and its tightly linked markers should be useful in developing resistant cultivars when combined with other genes for resistance to stripe rust.

Chlamydia psittaci infections in Chinese poultry: a literature review	WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Review						Chlamydiaceae; avian; China; psittacosis; biosecurity; antibiotic treatment	CHLAMYDOPHILA-PSITTACI; ACCUMULATION; PREVALENCE; STRAINS; TURKEYS; SOWS	Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, formerly known as Chlamydophila psittaci infections cause important economical losses to the poultry industry and are a danger to public health. The economic and zoonotic impact of C. psittaci infections in the Western poultry industry is well documented. Less is known on its occurrence in Asia. In the following review we address C. psittaci infections in Chinese poultry in view of China supplying 40.8% of global egg production and 14.2, 69.3 and 91.1% of global chicken, duck and goose meat, respectively. The current paper compiles English and Chinese scientific literature on C. psittaci infections in Chinese poultry. The paper is focusing on seroprevalence, culture, direct antigen detection, molecular characterisation, observed symptoms, Chinese traditional medicine and psittacosis case reports. A review on the epidemiology of chlamydiosis in Chinese poultry clearly illustrates the widespread presence of virulent C. psittaci strains in chickens, ducks and geese across China. In Western countries, C. psittaci infections in poultry are principally treated with antibiotics. In China, however, herbal medicine is often used in conjunction with antibiotic treatment or as prophylaxis. The applied production and marketing systems facilitate zoonotic transfer. Chinese occupationally acquired psittacosis cases include reports on infections contracted from ducks, pigeons, chickens and peacocks.

In Silico Cloning and Chromosomal Localization of EST Sequences that are Related to Leaf Senescence Using Nulli-tetrasomes in Wheat	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						expression sequence tag (EST); leaf senescence; nullisomic-tetrasomic; in silico mapping; wheat	STAY-GREEN; GENE-EXPRESSION; DEGRADATION; RESISTANCE	Leaf senescence is a notably important trait that limits the yield and biomass accumulation of agronomic crops. Therefore, determining the chromosomal position of the expression sequence tags (ESTs) that are associated with leaf senescence is notably interesting in the manipulation of leaf senescence for crop improvement. A total of 32 ESTs that were previously identified during the delaying leaf senescence stage in the stay-green wheat cultivar CN17 were mapped to 42 chromosomes, a chloroplast, a mitochondrion, and a ribosome using in silico mapping. Then, we developed 19 pairs of primers based on these sequences and used them to determine the polymorphisms between the stay-green cultivars (CN12, CN17, and CN18) and the control cultivar MY11. Among the 19 pairs of primers, 5 pairs produced polymorphisms between the stay-green cultivar and the non-stay-green control. Further studies of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomics show that JK738991 is mapped to 3B, JK738983 is mapped to 5D, and JK738989 is mapped to 2A, 4A, and 3D. The other two ESTs, JK738994 and JK739003, were not assigned to a chromosome using the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomics, which indicates that these ESTs may be derived from rye DNA in the wide cross. In particular, the ESTs that produce polymorphisms are notably useful in identifying the stay-green cultivar using molecular marker-assisted selection. The results also suggest that the in silico mapping data, even from a comparison genomic analysis based on the homogeneous comparison, are useful at some points, but the data were not always reliable, which requires further investigation using experimental methods.

Besides Fds, there is a type of Fd-like proteins designated as FdC, which have conserved elements of Fds, but contain a significant C-terminal extension. So far, only two FdC genes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified in higher plants and thus the functions of FdC proteins remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a yellow-green leaf mutant, 501ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant exhibited yellow-green leaf phenotype and reduced chlorophyll level. The phenotype of 501ys was caused by mutation of a gene on rice chromosome 3. Map-based cloning of this mutant resulted in identification of OsFdC2 gene (LOC_Os03g48040) showing high identity with Arabidopsis FdC2 gene (AT1G32550). OsFdC2 was expressed most abundantly in leaves and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast. In 501ys mutant, a missense mutation was detected in DNA sequence of the gene, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein. The mutant phenotype was rescued by introduction of the wild-type gene. Therefore, we successfully identified FdC2 gene via map-based cloning approach, and demonstrated that mutation of this gene caused yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Amino acid composition, molecular weight distribution, antioxidant activity and functional property of the seed cake protein hydrolysates (SCPH) were investigated. Enzymatic hydrolysis improved protein solubility significantly but impaired the foaming and emulsifying property. Hydrolysate generated by alcalase had the highest hydrolysis degree (DH) and antioxidant activity, and displayed excellent protein solubility over wide range of pH, while hydrolysate prepared by flavorzyme showed better copper chelating capacity and emulsifying stability with low molecular weight distribution. Trypsin-treated SCPH showed better foaming property than original protein. The results indicated that enzyme type greatly influenced the molecular weight, functional property and antioxidant activity of SCPH. It was also found that electing appropriate protease and controlling the DH could be enhanced or reduced functional property according to actual applications.

Therefore, understanding the genetic basis of canopy architecture-related traits is important for maize breeding. In this study, an F-2:3 population derived from a cross between R08 (representing a breeding pattern of lower planting density with large ears breeding pattern) x Ye478 (representing a breeding pattern of high planting density) was evaluated for nine canopy architecture-related traits in six environments, including Nanning, Ya'an, and Jinghong, in 2012 and 2013. Mixed linear model-based composite interval mapping was used to dissect the genetic basis of canopy architecture-related traits. Sixty-five quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for all nine traits through a joint analysis across all environments. More than 80 % of the QTL in this study did not show significant QTL x environment interactions, but epistasis played an important role in architecture-related trait inheritance. Nine chromosome segments were identified that affected multiple canopy architecture-related traits.

However, little is known about winter soil respiration on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. We therefore measured winter soil CO2 fluxes and estimated annual soil respiration in two contrasting coniferous forest ecosystems (a Picea asperata plantation and a natural forest). Mean winter soil CO2 effluxes were 1.08 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the plantation and 1.16 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the natural forest. These values are higher than most reported winter soil CO2 efflux values for temperate or boreal forest ecosystems. Winter soil respiration rates were similar for our two forest ecosystems but mean soil CO2 efflux over the growing season was higher in the natural forest than in the plantation. The estimated winter and annual soil effluxes for the natural forest were 176.3 and 1070.3 g m(-2), respectively, based on the relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature, which were 17.2 and 9.7 % greater than their counterparts in the plantation. The contributions of winter soil respiration to annual soil efflux were 15.4 % for the plantation and 16.5 % for the natural forest and were statistically similar. Our results indicate that winter soil CO2 efflux from frozen soils in the alpine coniferous forest ecosystems of the eastern Tibetan Plateau was considerable and was an important component of annual soil respiration. Moreover, reforestation (natural coniferous forests were deforested and reforested with P. asperata plantation) may reduce soil respiration by reducing soil carbon substrate availability and input.

The objective of this study was to express and characterize a codon optimized parasin I peptide fused with human lysozyme (hLY). A 513 bp cDNA fragment encoding the mature hLY protein and parasin I peptide was designed and synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris. A 4 x Gly flexible amino acid linker with an enterokinase cleavage (DDDDK) was designed to link the PI to the C-terminal of hLY. The codon optimized recombinant hLY-PI was cloned into the pPICZ alpha A vector and expressed in P. pastoris. The over-expressed extracellular rehLY-PI was purified using Ni sepharose affinity column and exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 18 kDa. After digested with enterokinase the rehLY-PI protein release its corresponding rehLY and rePI, with molecular mass of 16 kDa and 2 kDa, respectively, on Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The released rehLY exhibited similar lytical activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus to its commercial hLY. The digested rehLY-PI product exhibited antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and synergism has been found between the released rePI and rehLY. In conclusion, we successfully optimized a rehLY-PI fusion protein encoding gene and over-expressed the rehLY-PI in P. pastoris. The recombination protein digested with enterokinase released functional hLY and antimicrobial parasin I, which demonstrates a potential for future use as an animal feed additive to partly replace antibiotic.

This study investigated influence of sewage treatment on China's energy consumption and economic growth and its performances from 2008 to 2013. We adopted a set of indicator system based on energy, emergy and money to depict these interactions, including Energy use per unit emission reduction (EUER), Cost per unit emission reduction (CUER), Environmental benefit per unit investment (EBUI), Ratio of energy consumption from sewage treatment to national total energy consumption (REST), Ratio of cost of sewage treatment to the Gross Domestic Product (RCSG), Structural Coordination degree of sewage treatment (SCDS), and Scale harmony degree of sewage treatment (SHDS). Here emergy was used to quantify the environmental impact of water pollutants. The study results show that energy efficiency of sewage treatment keeps relatively stable, the economic cost of sewage treatment increases obviously, the environmental performance of sewage treatment investment slightly rises, and the sewage treatment has an increasing impact on the energy consumption and economic growth of this country. As far as the relationships between different indicators or factors are concerned, the structure of China's sewage treatment industry worsens obviously due to rising energy consumption and economic cost; meanwhile, the relationship between economic cost and energy consumption for sewage treatment, domestic water consumption, and discharged sewage's impact seriously deteriorated. Finally, some corresponding issues are discussed and the related policy implications are put forward. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, various NO modulators (NO donor: SNP; NO scavenger: cPTIO: NO synthase inhibitor: L-NAME; and SNP analogs: sodium nitrite/nitrate and sodium ferrocyanide) were investigated to determine the role of NO in Trifolium repens L. plants exposed to Cd. Cd (100 mu M) markedly reduced biomass, NO production and chlorophyll (Chl a, Chl b and total Chl) concentration but stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Cd accumulation in plants. SNP (50 mu M) substantially attenuated growth inhibition, reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) levels, stimulated ROS-scavenging enzymes/agents, and mitigated the H+-ATPase inhibition in proton pumps. Interestingly, SNP considerably up-regulated the levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and proline in plant tissues but down-regulated the levels of ethylene (ET) in both shoots and roots and the level of salicylic acid (SA) in roots only, which might be related to the elevated NO synthesis. Additionally, SNP (25-200 mu M) regulated mineral absorption and, particularly at 50 mu M, significantly enhanced the uptake of shoot magnesium (Mg) and copper (Cu) and of root calcium (Ca), Mg and iron (Fe). Nevertheless, the effects of SNP on plant growth were reversed by cPTIO and L-NAME, suggesting that the protective effect of SNP might be associated with NO synthesis in vivo. Moreover, SNP analogs did not display roles similar to that of SNP. These results indicated that NO depleted Cd toxicity by eliminating oxidative damage, enhancing minerals absorption, regulating proton pumps, and maintaining hormone equilibrium.

Understanding the spatial patterns of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q(10)) and its controlling factors is very important to quantify the climate-carbon cycle feedback at regional scales. In this study, we conducted a synthesis of 74 field measurements on Q(10) value across China's forests. Based on the overall data, the Q(10) values ranged from 1.10 to 5.18, with a mean value of 2.51. Moreover, the largest relative frequency of Q10 values was within the range of 2.0-3.0. The Q(10) value in China's forests was significantly and negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. However, the Q(10) values increased with latitude and altitude but there was no obvious relationship between Q(10) and longitude. There were no significant differences in Q(10) among evergreen coniferous forest, coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest, deciduous broadleaved forest and deciduous coniferous forest. However, the Q(10) of evergreen broadleaved forest was significantly lower than that of evergreen coniferous forest and deciduous coniferous forest. The findings may advance our understanding on the different environmental controls of Q(10) of soil respiration and also improve our ability to predict regional-scale soil carbon flux in a changing world.

YUNNANENSIS; CANCER CELLS; IN-VITRO; ANTICANCER ACTIVITY; STEROIDAL SAPONINS; GROWTH; GEFITINIB; CHEMOTHERAPY; EXPRESSION; INHIBITORS	Background: As a traditional Chinese medicine herb, Chonglou (Paris polyphylla var. chinensis) has been used as anticancer medicine in China in recent decades, as it can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in numerous cancer cells. The saponins extract from the rhizoma of Chonglou [Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS)] is known as the main active component for anticancer treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of RPS is unknown. Material/Methods: The present study evaluated the effect of RPS in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Subsequently, the expression of several genes associated with cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results: RPS was revealed to inhibit cell growth, causing a number of cells to accumulate in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, leading to apoptosis. In addition, the effect was dose-dependent. Moreover, the results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed that p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) were significantly downregulated, and that BCL2, BAX, and p21 were upregulated, by RPS treatment. Conclusions: We speculated that the RPS could act on a pathway, including p53, p21, BCL2, BAX, and CDK2, and results in G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.

This study was carried out to enhance our understanding of the developmental process of porcine fetal ovaries and to better address the differences in fetal ovary development of local and foreign pigs. The objective of the present study is to test the expression of key proteins that regulate the growth and development of fetal ovaries in Meishan and Yorkshire porcine breeds by using proteomics technology. Six Meishan and 6 Yorkshire pregnant gilts were used in this experiment. Fetal ovaries were obtained from Yorkshire and Meishan gilts on days 55 and 90 of the gestation period. Using 2D-DIGE (two dimensional-difference in gel electrophoresis) analysis, the results showed that there are about 1551 and 1400 proteins in gilt fetal ovaries on days 55 and 90, respectively of the gestation. Using MALDI TOF-TOF MS analysis, 27 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the fetal ovaries of the 2 breeds on day 55 of gestation, and a total of 18 proteins were identified on day 90 of gestation. These differentially expressed proteins were involved in the regulation of biological processes (cell death, stress response, cytoskeletal proteins) and molecular functions (enzyme regulator activity). We also found that alpha-1-antitrypsin, actin, vimentin, and PP2A proteins promote the formation of primordial follicles in the ovaries of Yorkshire pigs on day 55 of gestation while low expression heat shock proteins and high expression alpha-fetoproteins (AFP) may promote Meishan fetal ovarian follicular development on day 90 of gestation. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how reduced expression of heat shock proteins and increased expression of AFP can significantly reduce the risk of reproductive disease in obese Meishan sows. Our study also shows how these proteins can increase the ovulation rate and may be responsible for the low reproductive efficiency reported in other obese breeds. The ovarian developmental potential was found to be greater in Meishan pigs than in Yorkshire pigs.

However, the uncertainties caused by wide variations in sgRNA activity impede the utility of this system in generating genetically modified pigs. Here, we described a single blastocyst genotyping system to provide a simple and rapid solution to evaluate and compare the sgRNA efficiency at inducing indel mutations for a given gene locus. Assessment of sgRNA mutagenesis efficiencies can be achieved within 10 days from the design of the sgRNA. The most effective sgRNA selected by this system was successfully used to induce site-specific insertion through homology-directed repair at a frequency exceeding 13%. Additionally, the highly efficient gene deletion via the selected sgRNA was confirmed in pig fibroblast cells, which could serve as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer. We further showed that direct cytoplasmic injection of Cas9 mRNA and the favorable sgRNA into zygotes could generate biallelic knockout piglets with an efficiency of up to 100%. Thus, our method considerably reduces the uncertainties and expands the practical possibilities of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering in pigs.

However, the genetic mechanism underlying the phenotypic differentiation between the inflection point and asymptotic stages of the growth curve is not well characterized. Here, we employed Liangshan pigs in stages of growth at the inflection point (under inflection point: UIP) and the two asymptotic stages (before the inflection point: BIP, after the inflection point: AIP) as models to survey global gene expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle using digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling. We found Liangshan pigs reached maximum growth rate (UIP) at 163.6 days of age and a weight of 134.6 kg. The DGE libraries generated 117 million reads of 5.89 gigabases in length. 21,331, 20,996 and 20,139 expressed transcripts were identified BIP, UIP and AIP, respectively. Among them, we identified 757 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BIP and UIP, and 271 DEGs between AIP and UIP. An enrichment analysis of DEGs proved the immune system was strengthened in the AIP stage. Energy metabolism rate, global transcriptional activity and bone development intensity were highest UIP. Meat from Liangshan pigs had the highest intramuscular fat content and most favorable fatty acid composition in the AIP. Three hundred eighty (27.70%) specific expression genes were highly enriched in QTL regions for growth and meat quality traits. This study completed a comprehensive analysis of diverse genetic mechanisms underlying the inflection point and asymptotic stages of growth. Our findings will serve as an important resource in the understanding of animal growth and development in indigenous pig breeds.

Field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of shading stress on photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence characters, as well as grain yield and yield components of rice from 2010 to 2012, in Sichuan, China. Rice cv. IIyou 498, Gangyou 188, Dexiang 4103, Gangyou 527, and Chuanxiang 9838 were selected and shaded during grain filling period, which resulted in 53% shading environment (achieved with white cloth above the rice canopy). Shading increased the flag leaf chlorophyll (Chl) content and maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry under dark-adaption (F-v/F-m), but decreased the net photosynthetic rate, electron transport rate (ETR), saturation irradiance (PAR(sat)), and maximum electron transport (J(max)), which resulted in a sharply falling grain yield mainly due to reduced spikelet filling and grain weight. The shading tolerances were different in different rice varieties. Maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max), light saturation point (LSP), quantum yield of PSII (Phi PSII), and photochemical quenching (qP) of Gangyou 188 were reduced under shading. However, IIyou 498 had its adaptive capacity to shading enhanced by increasing the Chl content to improve light-harvesting potential as well as increased P-max, LSP, F-v/F-m, and Phi PSII. In addition, there was reduced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), while maintaining a more stable ETR, PAR(sat), and J(max) to enhance light-use efficiency and reduce the dissipation of light energy, which relieved damage to spikelet filling and resulted in a smaller reduction in grain yield of IIyou 498. Therefore, the improvement in light-harvesting and -use capability and increased spikelet filling under shading stress might be important characteristics for plant breeders. For example, IIyou 498 can be selected as a shade-tolerant variety. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the molecular characteristics of the AZIN1 gene and its expression profile in goose tissues and ovarian follicles have not been reported. In this study, the AZIN1 cDNA of the Sichuan white goose (Anser cygnoides) was cloned, and analyzed for its phylogenetic and physiochemical properties. The expression profile of AZIN1 mRNA in geese tissues and ovarian follicles were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the open reading frame of the AZIN1 cDNA is 1353 bp in length, encoding a 450 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 50 kDa. Out of all tissues examined, AZIN1 expression was highest in the adrenal gland and lowest in breast muscle. There was also a high expression of AZIN1 in the cerebellum and isthmus of oviduct. With follicular development, AZIN1 gene expression gradually increased, and its expression in F1 was significantly higher than in F5 (P < 0.05). AZIN1 expression was also significantly higher in the POF1 than in the other follicles (P < 0.05), and there was a low mRNA expression of AZIN1 in atretic follicles. The results of AZIN1 expression profiling in ovarian follicles suggest that AZIN1 may play an important role in the progression of follicular development, potentially through regulating polyamine levels.

As the second most abundant form of genetic variation, InDels, with characteristics of co-dominance, multiple alleles and high stability and density and that are easy to genotype, have received an increasing amount attention. Results: In this work, a total of 2,329,544 InDels were identified in 1767 rice genomes; these InDels were dispersed across all 12 rice chromosomes, with one InDel marker found, on average, every 160.22 bp. There were 162,380 highly polymorphic InDels with a polymorphism information content (PIC) >= 0.5, contributing 1.81 % to the unique primer set. Of these highly polymorphic InDels, we also selected InDels with major allele differences (the size difference between the most and second most frequent alleles) >= 3 bp or 8 bp for primer design, which provided a more flexible choice for researchers. Finally, we experimentally validated 100 highly polymorphic InDels for accuracy and polymorphism. The PCR results showed that the accuracy of the InDel markers was 95.70 %, while the average PIC value was 0.56, with a range of 0.19 to 0.78; the average allele number was 3.02, with a range of 2 to 5. Conclusions: Our genome-wide and easily used InDel markers with high polymorphism and density in both cultivated and wild rice will undoubtedly have practical implications in rice marker-assisted breeding and will also meet the need of fine-scale genetic mapping in map-based rice gene cloning.

Indels have been increasingly recognized as an important source of molecular markers due to high-density occurrence, cost-effectiveness, and ease of genotyping. Coupled with developments in bioinformatics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms enable the discovery of millions of indel polymorphisms by comparing the whole genome sequences of individuals within a species. Results: A total of 1,973,746 unique indels were identified in 345 maize genomes, with an overall density of 958.79 indels/Mbp, and an average allele number of 2.76, ranging from 2 to 107. There were 264,214 indels with polymorphism information content (PIC) values greater than or equal to 0.5, accounting for 13.39 % of overall indels. Of these highly polymorphic indels, we designed primer pairs for 83,481 and 29,403 indels with major allele differences (i.e. the size difference between the most and second most frequent alleles) greater than or equal to 3 and 8 bp, respectively, based on the differing resolution capabilities of gel electrophoresis. The accuracy of our indel markers was experimentally validated, and among 100 indel markers, average accuracy was approximately 90 %. In addition, we also validated the polymorphism of the indel markers. Of 100 highly polymorphic indel markers, all had polymorphisms with average PIC values of 0.54. Conclusions: The maize genome is rich in indel polymorphisms. Intriguingly, the level of polymorphism in genic regions of the maize genome was higher than that in intergenic regions. The polymorphic indel markers developed from this study may enhance the efficiency of genetic research and marker-assisted breeding in maize.

To investigate the gene expression changes of goats that are induced by high altitude stress, we performed RNA-seq on 27 samples from the three hypoxia-sensitive tissues (heart, lung, and skeletal muscle) in three indigenous populations from distinct altitudes (600 m, 2000 m, and 3000 m). We generated 129 Gb of high-quality sequencing data (similar to 4 Gb per sample) and catalogued the expression profiles of 12,421 annotated hircine genes in each sample. The analysis showed global similarities and differences of high-altitude transcriptomes among populations and tissues as well as revealed that the heart underwent the most high-altitude induced expression changes. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes that exhibited distinct expression patterns, and nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant-containing genes that were highly differentiated between the high- and low-altitude populations. These genes have known or potential roles in hypoxia response and were enriched in functional gene categories potentially responsible for high-altitude stress. Therefore, they are appealing candidates for further investigation of the gene expression and associated regulatory mechanisms related to high-altitude acclimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Results: Weight gain, specific growth rate, feed intake and feed efficiency were significantly improved by dietary threonine (P < 0.05). Intestinal activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, alpha-amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase took the similar trends. Contents of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl in intestine and hepatopancreas were significantly decreased by dietary optimal threonine supplementation (P < 0.05). Anti-superoxide anion capacity, anti-hydroxyl radical capacity, glutathione content and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase in intestine and hepatopancreas were enhanced by dietary threonine (P < 0.05).

The results indicated that the major constituents of C. limonum and Cy. citrates were D-limonene (38.22%) and 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal (26.21%), while which of L. cubeba and M. fragrans were (E)-3, 7-dimethyl-2, 6-octadienal (49.78%) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (79.31%), respectively. Contact activities of L. cubeba and C. limonum with LC50 values of 21.2 and 13.9 mu g/cm(2) at 48 h and repellence activities (>89.0% repellence indexes) (P < 0.05) at 12 h on 10th instar were better than those of the other two EOs. Nevertheless, the fumigation activities of L. cubeba on 10th instar and adults (LC50 = 2.7, 3.7 mu l/liter) were stronger than those of C. limonum (LC50 = 10.9, 12.0 mu l/liter) at 96 h and significant (not overlapping confidence intervals). The EOs of L. cubeba and C. limonum have clearly elongated the growth and development of larvae, egg, and slightly shorten pupae and adults of T. molitor compared with the control. The mainly active ingredients of L. cubeba and C. limonum, including D-limonene and beta-pinene, were demonstrated to coinhibit the actives of AChE and enhance the toxicities on 10th instar of T. molitor. These results indicate that the EOs of L. cubeba and C. limonum could have great potential as botanical insecticides against T. molitor.

PLANT METHODS			English	Article						Allopolyploid; Multiple sequence alignment; blastn; Primer design; Genome-specificity; Sequence polymorphism	GENOME SEQUENCE; PROVIDES INSIGHTS; DRAFT GENOME; EVOLUTION; BLAST	Background: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) is an allohexaploid with a huge genome. Due to the presence of extensive homoeologs and paralogs, generating locus-specific sequences can be challenging, especially when a large number of sequences are required. Traditional methods of generating locus-specific sequences are rather strenuous and time-consuming if large numbers of sequences are to be handled. Results: To improve the efficiency of isolating sequences for targeted loci, a time-saving and high-throughput pipeline integrating orthologous sequence alignment, genomic sequence retrieving, and multiple sequence alignment was developed. This pipeline was successfully employed in retrieving and aligning homoeologous sequences and 83% of the primers designed based on the pipeline successfully amplified fragments from the targeted subgenomes. Conclusions: The high-throughput pipeline developed in this study makes it feasible to efficiently identify locus-specific sequences for large numbers of sequences. It could find applications in all research projects where locus-specific sequences are required. In addition to generating locus-specific markers, the pipeline was also used in our laboratory to identify differentially expressed genes among the three subgenomes of bread wheat. Importantly, the pipeline is not only valuable for research in wheat but should also be applicable to other allopolyploid species.

The parvovirus is composed of a single strand molecule of DNA wrapped into an icosahedral capsid. In a viral infection, the massy capsid participates in the entire viral infection process, which is summarized in this review. The capsid protein VP1 is primarily responsible for the infectivity of the virus, and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the VP1 serves as a guide to assist the viral genome in locating the nucleus. The dominant protein VP2 provides an "anti-receptor", which interacts with the cellular receptor and leads to the further internalization of virus, and, the N-terminal of VP2 also cooperates with the VP1 to prompt the process of nucleus translocation. Additionally, a cleavage protein VP3 is a part of the capsid, which exists only in several members of the parvovirus family; however, the function of this cleavage protein remains to be fully determined. Parvoviruses can suffer from the extreme environmental conditions such as low pH, or even escape from the recognition of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), due to the protection of the stable capsid, which is thought to be an immune escape mechanism. The applications of the capsid proteins to the screening and the treatment of diseases are also discussed. The processes of viral infection should be noted, because understanding the virus-host interactions will contribute to the development of therapeutic vaccines.

The drying kinetics and the effects of drying temperature on the sugar conversion characteristics of the dried slices were investigated. The results indicated that the drying process could be described well by the Logarithmic model. The diffusivity constant (Do) and active energy (Ea) for drying of the fresh slices were calculated to be 1.97 x 10(-4) m(2)/s and 28.1 KJ/mol, respectively. By measuring the sugar content in dried slices obtained at different drying temperatures, the appropriate drying temperature was found to be 55 degrees C, with only a 1.8% reduction in total sugars when compared with the fresh tubers. However, subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of the reducing sugars from the dried slices was significantly reduced as the drying temperature increased.

Detailed knowledge of chromosome translocations in a given species and its close relatives should increase the efficiency and precision of chromosome engineering in crop improvement. To identify genes flanking the breakpoints of translocations and inversions as a step toward identifying breakpoints in bread wheat, we systematically analysed genes in the Brachypodium genome against wheat survey sequences and bin-mapped ESTs (expressed sequence tags) derived from the hexaploid wheat genotype 'Chinese Spring'. In addition to those well-known translocations between group 4, 5, and 7 chromosomes, this analysis identified genes flanking the three pericentric inversions on chromosomes 2B, 4B, and 5A. However, numerous chromosomal rearrangements reported in early studies could not be confirmed. The genes flanking the breakpoints reported in this study are valuable for isolating these breakpoints.

STUDY DESIGN: Studies were carried out on Tianfu ducks on 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, and 26 days of age prehatching, and at 0 (hatching), 1, 3, 5, 8, 14, 17, 20, 26, 29, and 32 weeks of age posthatching using high-sensitivity immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: CGRP-ir was detected in the neuron-like cells, the lymphocytes, the vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as the reticular epithelial cells of Hassall's corpuscle and diffuse forms of Hassall's corpuscle. CGRP-ir cells were predominantly distributed in the medulla and very rarely in the cortex. The distribution density of CGRP-ir cells in the medulla increased progressively from 24 days of age prehatching to 5 weeks of age posthatching, and thereafter showed a tendency to decrease. CGRP-ir nerves, mainly running along the blood vessels, were recognized during the postembryonic development of the thymus. CONCLUSION: The expression pattern of CGRP-ir showed obvious age-related changes during the embryonic and postembryonic development of the duck thymus, which might be related to thymus growth and involution.

This should improve our ability to predict shifts in insect population dynamics and community interactions under the conditions of climate change. Effects of elevated CO2 levels on the fitness-related parameters were examined for multigenerations in the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee). The larvae were allowed to feed on artificial diet, and reared in the closed-dynamic environment chambers with three CO2 levels (ambient, 550 mu l/liter, and 750 mu l/liter) for six generations. In comparison with the ambient CO2 level, mean larval survival rate decreased 9.9% in 750 mu l/liter CO2 level, across O. furnacalis generations, and larval and pupal development times increased 7.5-16.4% and 4.5-13.4%, respectively, in two elevated CO2 levels. Pupal weight was reduced more than 12.2% in 750 mu l/liter CO2 level. Across O. furnacalis generations, mean food consumption per larva increased 2.7, 7.0% and frass excretion per larva increased 14.4, 22.5% in the two elevated CO2 levels, respectively, compared with ambient CO2 level. Elevated CO2 levels resulted in the decline mean across O. furnacalis generations in mean relative growth rate, but increased in relative consumption rate. These results suggested that elevated CO2 would reduce the fitness-related parameters such as higher mortality, lower pupal weight, and longer development times in long term. It also reduced the larval food digestibility and utilizing efficiency; in turn, this would result in increase of food consumption.

Concentrated flows were found to be turbulent and supercritical in the upstream catchment area and downstream gully beds. As discharge increased, values of the soil erosion rate, Reynolds number (Re), shear stress, stream power, and flow energy consumption (E) increased while values of the Froude number (Fr) and the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (resistance f) did not. With the exception of gully headcut collapse under discharge rates of 60, 90, and 120 l min(-1), a declining power function trend (P < 0.05) in the soil erosion rate developed in the upstream catchment area, headcuts, and downstream gully beds. However, increasing trends were observed in temporal variations of hydraulic properties for downstream gully beds and the upstream catchment area. Despite significant differences in temporal variation between the soil erosion rate and hydraulic property values, relative steady state conditions of the soil erosion rate and E were attained following an initial period of adjustment in the upstream catchment area, headcuts, and downstream gully beds under different discharge rates. A logarithmic growth of flow energy consumption per unit soil loss (E-u) was observed in bank gullies and the upstream catchment area as the experiment progressed, further illustrating the actual reason behind the discrepancy in temporal variation between soil erosion rates and E. Results demonstrate that E can be used to estimate headcut erosion soil loss, but further quantitative studies are required to quantify coupling effects between hydraulic properties and vertical variation in soil mechanical properties on temporal variation for bank gully soil erosion rates.

Statistical analysis of the results showed that the linear and quadratic terms of the three variables of the extraction process had significant effects. The optimal conditions are as follows: extracting time of 2.6 h, extraction temperature of 89 degrees C, and ratio of water to raw material of 32 mL/g. Moreover, a new polysaccharide with antioxidant activity [i.e., SMWP-1 (similar to 5.27 x 10(5) Da)] was isolated from S. miltiorrhiza residue. The carbohydrate, uronic acid, and protein contents of SMWP-1 were 90.11%, 0.13%, and 0.53%, respectively. The SMWP-1 is composed of glucose, xylose, mannose, and galactose. The preliminary structural characterization of SMWP-1 was determined via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. This polysaccharide exhibited strong reducing power and free-radical scavenging activities in vitro against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl. Therefore, SMWP-1 can be investigated further as a novel natural antioxidant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) are the most important aspects of nutritive value of forages. A successful application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with partial least square regression (PLSR) for the determination of four parameters (CP, ADF, NDF and IVDMD) of Siberian wildrye was developed. The standard errors of calibration (SEC, %DM) and R-cal(2) values (in parentheses) were 0.329 9(0. 994 5), 0.779 9(0. 949 9), 1.343 0(0. 913 3), and 1.376 2 (0. 982 2) for CP, ADF, NDF and IVDMD equations, respectively. The standard errors of prediction (SEP, %DM) and R-val(2) values (in parentheses) were 0. 362 1(0. 993 8), 0. 787 8(0. 944 9), 1. 385 2.(0. 890 7), and 1. 430 3(0. 979 0) for CP, ADF, NDF and IVDMD, respectively. A good correlation (r>0. 943 8) was found between results from NIRS and the traditional chemical method, and residual predictive deviation (RPD) ranged from 3. 02 to 12. 63. It was concluded that NIR spectroscopic technique associated with chemometrics is sufficiently sensitive to allow the accurate prediction of the concentrations of components (CP, ADF and NDF) and IVDMD of Siberian wildrye.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding genes that play many diverse and complex roles in viral infections. Finding: Aiming to determine the impact of PPV infections on the cellular miRNAome, we used high-throughput sequencing to sequence two miRNA libraries prepared from porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells under normal conditions and during PPV infection. There was differential miRNA expression between the uninfected and infected cells: 65 miRNAs were upregulated and 128 miRNAs were downregulated. We detected the expression of miR-10b, miR-20a, miR-19b, miR-181a, miR-146b, miR-18a, and other previously identified immune-related miRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis and KEGG function annotations of the host target genes suggested that the miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including cellular metabolic processes, immune system processes, and gene expression. Conclusions: These data suggest that a large group of miRNAs is expressed in PK-15 cells and that some miRNAs were altered in PPV-infected PK-15 cells. A number of microRNAs play an important role in regulating immune-related gene expression. Our findings should help with the development of new control strategies to prevent or treat PPV infections in swine.

BUCKWHEATS; GENE-EXPRESSION; LOW-TEMPERATURE; APPLE SKIN; UV-B; FLAVONOIDS	Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is rich in flavonoids. Anthocyanins, a special class of flavonoids, offer significant nutrients and provide the red pigment found in sprouts. The anthocyanins biosynthesis has been shown influenced by environmental stress. In this study, we investigate the effects of cold stress on anthocyanins biosynthesis of tartary buckwheat sprouts. On cellular level, cross-sectional observations were performed and result indicated that anthocyanins accumulated primarily in the epidermal and cortex cells of hypocotyls. Biochemical analysis, including anthocyanin quantification, thin-layer chromatography and radical scavenging assay, showed that cold stress significantly increased the synthesis of anthocyanins and antioxidant activity of tartary buckwheat sprouts. At the molecular level, semi-RTPCR was used to investigate 14 anthocyanin-related genes in tartary buckwheat sprouts treated with cold stress. All the selected genes were upregulated in cold-stressed sprouts, except for FtGST, FtAHA, and FtMYB. More importantly, the expression level of three late biosynthesis genes, FtF3'H, FtDFR, and FtANS, was highest in hypocotyl tissue. Our results suggest that anthocyanins play a considerable role in the cold stress tolerance of tartary buckwheat sprouts.

Effect of dietary nonphytate phosphorus content on ileal lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokine expression in the cecal tonsils and spleen of laying hens that were or were not orally inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article							ENTERICA SEROVAR ENTERITIDIS; BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PARATHYROID-HORMONE; INTERFERON-GAMMA; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; GENE-EXPRESSION; IMMUNOGLOBULIN PRODUCTION; IN-VITRO; CHICKENS	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of dietary nonphytate phosphorus (NPP) content on ileal lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokine expression in the cecal tonsils and spleen of hens that were or were not inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium. ANIMALS 64 Salmonella-free hens. PROCEDURES Hens were fed a diet with 0.22% (control; n = 32) or 0.42% (high-P; 32) NPP for 6 weeks and then orally inoculated with S Typhimurium (5 X 10(7) CFUs) or PBSS. Tissues were obtained from 8 S Typhimurium-inoculated and 8 PBSS-inoculated hens from each group at 2 and 7 days postinoculation (DPI). Percentages of ileal CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine mRNA expression was determined by quantitative realtime PCR assays. RESULTS For S Typhimurium-inoculated hens, plasma parathyroid hormone concentration was significantly increased and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentration was decreased in hens fed the high-P diet, compared with values in hens fed the control diet. Salmonella Typhimurium inoculation caused an increase in the percentage of ileal CD8+ lymphocytes and the expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-12, and IL-18 in the cecal tonsils and spleen and a decrease in the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 in the cecal tonsils. Hens fed the high-P diet had significantly increased splenic expression of interferon-gamma at 2 DPI and IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 at 7 DPI, compared with hens fed the control diet. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested there was a T-helper 1 cytokine reaction in the cecal tonsils and spleen of S Typhimurium-inoculated hens, and dietary NPP content altered calcium regulation hormone concentrations and affected splenic cytokine expression.

Yet, little is known about the underlying mechanisms responsible for nonhierarchical follicular development in avian species. The aim of the present study is identify genes that are differentially expressed during nonhierarchical follicular development in geese by performing a transcriptome screen. A sequencing depth of 13.9 and 14.9 million mapped tags was obtained in pools of small white follicles (SWF) and small yellow follicles (SYF), respectively, and a total of 160 differentially expressed genes were identified. The fold-changes of eight differentially expressed genes, identified using qRT-PCR, were consistent with the Digital Gene Expression Profiling (DGE) data. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analyses showed that lipid metabolism, steroid secretion, extracellular ligand reactions, enzyme activities, the cell cycle, ECM-receptor interactions and the extracellular matrix are involved in follicular development. The majority of the newly identified genes could be considered to be new candidate genes with potential roles in regulating follicular development. These results provide useful information for future in-depth studies associated with nonhierarchical follicular development in goose reproduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of the isolated rhizobia were no- or low-effective strains. Eight out of 75 isolates promoted significantly the growth of soybean cultivar Gongxuan No. 1. When tested with three more soybean cultivars, the isolates assigned as Bradyrhizobium japonicum SCAUs36, Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens SCAUs46, and Ensifer fredii SCAUs65 promoted significantly (P < 0.05) the growth of each cultivar. The nodC and nifH genes of bradyrhizobial SCAUs36 and SCAUd46 and E. fredii SCAUs65 grouped together with those of broad host range strains. In field experiments with two more soybean cultivars, B. diazoefficiens SCAUs46 and E. fredii SCAUs65 performed well both in mild and hot-dry climates, implying that the isolates were potential inoculants to be applied in diverse soil and climate conditions.

Fish were fed six different experimental diets containing graded levels of valine (4.3, 8.0, 10.6, 13.1, 16.7, 19.1 g/kg). The results indicated that valine deficiency decreased Claudin b, Claudin 3, Occludin and ZO-1 transcription and increased Claudin 15 expression in the fish gill (P < 0.05). These effects were partly due to the down-regulation of interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor 131 (TGF-beta 1) and I kappa B alpha and the up-regulation of relative mRNA expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF-kappa B P65) (P < 0.05). However, valine deficiency and valine supplementation did not have a significant effect on Claudin c and Claudin 12 expression in grass carp gills (P > 0.05). Valine deficiency also disrupted antioxidant status in the gill by decreasing anti-superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radical capacity, glutathione contents and the activities and mRNA levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P < 0.05). These results may be ascribed to the down-regulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), target of rapamycin (TOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the up-regulation of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) (P < 0.05). Additionally, valine deficiency induced DNA fragmentation via the up-regulation of Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9 expressions (P < 0.05). These results may be ascribed to the improvement in ROS levels in the fish gill (P < 0.05). Taken together, the results showed that valine deficiency impaired the structural integrity of fish gill by disrupted fish antioxidant defenses and regulating the expression of tight junction protein, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes, NF-kappa B p65, I kappa B alpha, TOR, Nrf2, Keap1 and apoptosis-related genes in the fish gill.

Immunohistochemistry analysis indicates that Foxp3 was expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and certain packed lymphocytes in particular, what's more, the percentage of Foxp3(+) cells among PBMC was 5.7 +/- 2.0% (n = 5) in healthy adults and could be significantly up-regulated after phytohemagglutinin (50 mu g/ml) stimulation in vitro at 6, 12 and 24 h, respectively. In the lymphoid tissues, such as the thymus, spleen and head kidney, Foxp3 expression was observed mainly in lymphocyte-like cells. Surprisingly, in the non-lymphoid organ stomach, Foxp3 was detected in epithelial-like cells within the mucosa. Our study demonstrates for the first time that Foxp3 protein expression occurs not only in hematopoietic cells of lymphoid organ systems but also non-hematopoietic cells of non-lymphoid organ in lower vertebrates such as the fish tilapia.

JIAN; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GENE-EXPRESSION	This study investigated the effects of dietary riboflavin on the growth, gill immunity, tight junction proteins, antioxidant system and related signaling molecules mRNA expression of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were fed six diets containing graded levels of riboflavin (0.63-10.04 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks. The study indicated that riboflavin deficiency decreased lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, and complement component 3 content in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). Moreover, riboflavin deficiency caused oxidative damage, which might be partly due to decrease copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities and reduced glutathione content in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the relative mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and Hepcidin), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor beta 1), tight junction proteins (Occludin, zonula occludens 1, Claudin-c and Claudin-3), signaling molecules (inhibitor of kappa B alpha, target of rapamycin and NF-E2-related factor 2) and antioxidant enzymes (copper, zinc superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase) were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the gills of fish fed riboflavin-deficient diet. Conversely, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 8, interferon gamma 2, and interleukin 1 beta), signaling molecules (nuclear factor kappa B p65, I kappa B kinase beta, I kappa B kinase gamma, Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1b and myosin light chain kinase) and tight junction protein Claudin-12 were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the gills of fish fed riboflavin-deficient diet. In addition, this study indicated for the first time that young fish fed a riboflavin-deficient diet exhibited anorexia and poor growth. In conclusion, riboflavin deficiency decreased growth and gill immunity, impaired gill antioxidant system, as well as regulated mRNA expression of gill tight junction proteins and related signaling molecules of fish. Based on percent weight gain, gill lysozyme activity and reduced glutathione content, the dietary riboflavin requirements for young grass carp (275-722 g) were estimated to be 5.85, 7.39 and 6.34 mg/kg diet, respectively.

A total of 540 grass carp (253.44 +/- 0.69 g) were fed six diets with graded levels of PA (PA1, PA15, PA30, PA45, PA60 and PA75 diets) for 8 weeks. The results indicated that compared with PA deficiency (PA1 diet) and excess (PA75 diet) groups, optimal PA supplementation increased (P < 0.05): (1) percent weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency; (2) lysozyme activity, complement 3 content, liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and hepcidin, interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta 1 and inhibitor of kappa B alpha mRNA levels in some intestinal segments; (3) activities and mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferases and glutathione reductase, and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA level in the whole intestine; (4) Claudin b, Claudin 3, Claudin c, Occludin and ZO-1 mRNA levels in some intestinal segments of grass carp. Conversely, optimal PA supplementation decreased (P < 0.05): (1) tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, interferon gamma 2, interleukin 8, nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF-kappa B P65), I kappa B kinase alpha, I kappa B kinase beta, I kappa B kinase gamma and target of rapamycin (TOR) mRNA expression levels in some intestinal segments; (2) reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents, and Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1b in the intestine; (3) Claudin 12, Claudin 15a and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) mRNA levels in some intestinal segments of grass carp. In conclusion, optimum PA promoted growth, intestinal mucosal immune and physical function, as well as regulated mRNA levels of signaling molecules NF-kappa B P65, TOR, Nrf2 and MLCK in grass carp intestine. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of PWG and intestinal lysozyme activity, the optimal PA levels in grass carp (253.44-745.25 g) were estimated to be 37.73 mg/kg and 4138 mg/kg diet, respectively.

In addition, the dietary Phe (and Phe + Tyr) requirement of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) was also estimated. Fish were fed fish meal -casein-gelatin based diets (302.3 g crude protein kg(-1)) containing 3.4 (basal diet), 6.1, 9.1, 11.5, 14.0 and 16.8 g Phe kg(-1), with a fixed amount of 10.7 g tyrosine kg(-1) for 8 weeks. The results showed that Phe deficiency or excess Phe reduced the lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities and complement C 3 content in the intestine (P < 0.05). Moreover, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), ocdudin and claudin c mRNA levels were highest in the fish fed the diet containing 11.5 g Phe kg(-1) (P < 0.05). However, claudin 12 and claudin b mRNA levels were not significantly affected by dietary Phe (P > 0.05). Gene expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), target of rapamycin (TOR) and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) in proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) increased as dietary Phe increased up to 6.1, 9.1, 11.5 and 14.0 g kg(-1), respectively (P < 0.05). However, interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B p6.5 (NF-kappa B p65) mRNA levels showed opposite tendencies. In addition, the mRNA level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower in the intestinal tissue of the group fed a diet with Phe levels of 16.8 g kg(-1) than in those of other groups (P < 0.05). The expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene was increased as dietary Phe increased up to 9.1 g kg(-1) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Phe improved intestinal immune status, and regulated gene expression of cytokines, tight junction proteins, antioxidant enzymes, NF-kappa B p65, I kappa B alpha, TOR, and Nrf2 in the fish intestine. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of lysozyme activity at a 95% maximum, the dietary Phe requirement of young grass carp (256-629 g) was estimated to be 8.31 g kg(-1), corresponding to 2.75 g 100 g(-1) protein.

The effects of the two OKGM products on IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and TLR22 gene expression, and immune parameters and the resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila of Schizothorax prenanti were determined. The results showed that the lysozyme activity was significantly enhanced by the L-OKGM diets. The SOD activity was significantly increased by both OKGM and L-OKGM diets. The MDA level of fish fed the OKGM and L-OKGM diets was significantly lower than the control group. IL-1 beta mRNA level in the spleen significantly increased in all L-OKGM fed groups. The 8.0 g kg(-1) L-OKGM diet also significantly up-regulated IL-1 beta gene expression in the head kidney. In the gut, IL-1 beta mRNA levels were significantly higher in fish fed with the 8.0 g kg(-1), OKGM and 16.0 g kg(-1) L-OKGM diets. The TNF-alpha mRNA level of L-OKGM group significantly increased in the spleen, head kidney and gut. High dosing of OKGM significantly up-regulated TNF-alpha transcription in the head kidney, while only the 8.0 g kg(-1) OKGM group showed significantly higher TNF-alpha mRNA expression in the mesonephros. Fish fed the L-OKGM diets showed significantly higher expression of TLR22 in the spleen, head kidney and mesonephros. After the injection of A. hydrophila, the 8.0 g kg(-1) L-OKGM group showed a significantly higher survival rate than did the control group. Present study suggests that OKGM and L-OKGM can up-regulate immune-related gene expression and enhance disease resistance in S. prenanti, and L-OKGM exhibits higher immunomodulatory activity.

A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the chemical forms, subcellular distribution, and thiol compounds in A. wardii under different Pb treatments. The results showed that plants of the mining ecotype (ME) of A. wardii were more tolerant to Pb than those of the non-mining ecotype (NME) in spite of accumulation of higher Pb concentrations. The Pb concentrations in shoots and roots of the ME were 3.2 similar to 8.6 times and 3.0 similar to 24.6 times higher than those of the NME, respectively. The ME was more efficient in Pb uptake than the NME. Moreover, 27.8 similar to 39.0 % of the total Pb in ME was sodium chloride (NaCl) extractable and 38.0 similar to 48.5 % was acetic acid (HAc) extractable, whereas only a minority of total Pb was in ethanol and H2O extractable. In subcellular level, 77.4 similar to 88.8 % of total Pb was stored in the cell walls of ME and 9.0 similar to 18.9 % in soluble fractions. Increasing Pb concentrations enhanced sequestration of Pb into the cell walls and soluble fractions of ME tissues to protect organelles against Pb. Synthesis of non-protein thiols (NP-SH) and phytochelatins (PCs) in roots of ME significantly enhanced in response to Pb stress, and significant increases in glutathione (GSH) were observed in shoots of ME. Higher levels of NP-SH, GSH, and PCs were observed in roots of the ME comparing with NME, especially under high Pb treatments. The results indicated that Pb was localized mainly in cell wall and soluble fraction of ME plants with low biological activity by cell wall deposition and vacuolar compartmentalization, which might be the important adapted Pb detoxification mechanisms of ME.

However, how the heterogeneity in environments from the gap center to the adjacent closed canopy affects foliar litter cellulose degradation is poorly understood. Litterbags were used to examine the cellulose degradation over a 734-day period for the litter of two dominant shrubs from the gap center to the closed canopy in three alpine forest gaps of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The cellulose degradation of the two foliar litter species decreased from the gap center to the closed canopy during the two winters, the first year, the second year and the entire 2 years, whereas this trend reversed in the two growing seasons. Cellulose degradation of both litter species in the first winter and in the first year accounted for approximately 50 and 70 % of the 2 years of degradation, respectively. This degradation was positively related to average daily temperature and microbial biomass carbon but negatively related to the frequency of the freeze-thaw cycle. Forest gaps promote the wintertime and annual cellulose degradation during shrub-litter decomposition. Moreover, reduced snow cover during gap vanishing as forests are regenerated or during winter warming may inhibit shrub litter cellulose degradation in high-latitude and -altitude ecosystems.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the composition and individual variability of microbiota in the rumen of yaks using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing technique. Rumen samples used in the present study were obtained from grazing adult male yaks (n = 6) in a commercial farm in Ganzi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, China. Universal prokaryote primers were used to target the V4-V5 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene. A total of 7200 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained after sequence filtering and chimera removal. Within these OTUs, 0.56% belonged to Archaea (40 OTUs), 7.19% to unassigned species (518 OTUs), and the remaining OTUs (6642) in all samples were of bacterial origin. When examining the community structure of bacteria, we identified 23 phyla within 159 families after taxonomic summarization. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the predominant phyla accounting for 39.68% (SD = 0.05) and 45.90% (SD = 0.06), respectively. Moreover, 3764 OTUs were identified as shared OTUs (i.e. represented in all yaks) and belonged to 35 genera, exhibiting highly variable abundance across individual samples. Phylogenetic placement of these genera across individual samples was examined. In addition, we evaluated the distance among the 6 rumen samples by adding taxon phylogeny using UniFrac, representing 24.1% of average distance. In summary, the current study reveals a shared rumen microbiome and phylogenetic lineage and presents novel information on composition and individual variability of the bacterial community in the rumen of yaks.

The in vitro antifungal activity of 30 Chinese herb extracts to Saprolegnia sp.	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; RAINBOW-TROUT; SODIUM-CHLORIDE; EGGS; FISH; PARASITICA; EFFICACY; SALMON; AGENT	Chinese traditional medicines have been used for several thousands of years in Asian countries, not only in humans but also in many animal species. These compounds prevent and control different types of diseases including internal diseases as well as some infectious diseases, where the aetiological agent is viral, bacterial, parasitic or mycotic. Rhizoma coptidis is believed to inhibit Shigella dysenteriae and that Radix isatidis can prevent flu caused by the influenza virus. It is thus hypothesized that some of these traditional herbal compounds will have anti-fungal activity. Saprolegniosis is a disease common in fish and their eggs in both fresh and brackish water; a newer, safer medication against Saprolegnia is needed after the prohibition in many countries of the extremely effective fungicide, malachite green. In the present study an attempt is made to identify herbal compounds that have anti-Saprolegnia activity. A strain of Saprolegnia, CCF1301, was isolated from the skin of infected grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and identified as Saprolegnia ferax by the 26S rDNA D1/D2 region and ITS region. This strain was used to evaluate the antifungal activity of thirty Chinese traditional herbal medicine extracts, and a modified dish dilutionmethod was developed for the evaluation. Saprolegnia-infected rapeseeds with visible hyphae were transplanted onto prepared PDA plates containing 2gL(-1) herbal plant extracts and incubated at 20 degrees C for 48h. Each herbal plant species was tested in triplicate. Those herbal plant extracts that showed negative mycelium presence at 2gL(-1) were further tested for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) evaluation. The results showed that Syzygium aromaticum, Magnolia officinalis, Melaphis chinensis, Euphorbia fischeriana Steud, and Sophora flavescentis exhibited enhanced growth inhibition at 2gL(-1) and MIC values of 500, 62.5, 250, 62.5, 250mgL(-1) concentrations, respectively. It was obvious that Magnolia officinalis and Euphorbia fischeriana Steud exhibited the best antifungal activity. Since there is a high natural toxicity in Euphorbia fischeriana Steud, its applicability as the main ingredient in an aquaculture therapeutic formulation requires further research. Thus, Magnolia officinalis would appear to be the more valuable antifungal herbal species with which to pursue further research.	[Huang, X. L.; Liu, R. J.; Du, Z. J.; Chen, D.

Plant miRNAs have been implicated in developmental processes and adaptation to environmental stress including biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs and associated target genes under banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) stress caused by R. solani in maize. Eight differentially expressed miRNAs were randomly selected from deep sequencing results and validated by qRT-PCR together with their putative target genes, most of which are transcription factors as well as metabolic genes involved in auxin signaling. The results revealed that majorities of the analyzed miRNAs show an inverse correlation with their corresponding predicted target genes. In addition, a putative regulatory network of miRNAs-mRNAs responsive to R. solani was constructed. This study provides insight into the regulatory functions of miRNAs, thereby expanding our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pathogen resistance.

In the present study, the acaricidal activity of 1,8-cineole against S. scabiei var. cuniculi was evaluated and the acaricidal mechanism was also investigated by assaying enzyme activities. The results showed that the lethal concentration of 50 % (LC50) value (95 % confidence limit (CL)) and the lethal time of 50 % (LT50) value (95 % CL) of 1,8-cineole were 2.77 mg/mL and 3.606 h, respectively. The pathological changes under transmission electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the mitochondria was abnormal, the cell nuclear membrane was damaged, and the nuclear chromatin was dissoluted. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs), monoamine oxidase (MAO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were significantly changed after treatment with 1,8-cineole for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. SOD and GSTs are associated with the protection mechanism of scabies mites. And, the activities of SOD and GSTs were increased as compared with the control group. MAO, AChE, and NOS are associated with the nervous system of scabies mites. The activity of MAO was increased whereas the AChE was suppressed. The activity of NOS was suppressed in the high-dose group whereas increased in the middle-dose group and low-dose group. These results indicated that the mechanism of 1,8-cineole mainly attributed to the changes of these enzyme activities related to the nervous system of scabies mites.

The strain was found to grow at 15-40 A degrees C and pH 5-10, with an optimum of 30 A degrees C and pH 8.0. The strain was found to be negative with respect to catalase and positive for oxidase activity, nitrate reduction and Voges-Proskauer reaction. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data indicated that the isolate belongs to the genus Lampropedia, having sequence similarity of 96.24 % with Lampropedia hyalina ATCC11041(T). DNA-DNA relatedness of strain 2-bin(T) with L. hyalina JCM 21380(T) was 26.7 +/- A 4.6 %. The DNA G+C content of strain 2-bin(T) was determined to be 57 % and the major cellular fatty acids were identified as C-16:0, C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16:1 omega 6c and C-18:1 omega 7c. The polar lipid profile of strain 2-bin(T) was found to contain diphosphatidylglycerol, a glycolipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, a phospholipid, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and three unidentified lipids (L1, L2, L3). Based on molecular data and physiological and biochemical characteristics, strain 2-bin(T) is considered to represent a novel species in the genus Lampropedia, for which the name Lampropedia puyangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 2-bin(T) (= CFCC 10925(T) = KCTC 32235(T)).

In this study, five amphidiploids with AABBUU and AABBNN genomes were produced by spontaneous chromosome doubling of unreduced triploid F-1 gametes from crosses between diploid Aegilops (A. umbellulata accessions CIae 29 and PI 226500, and A. uniaristata accession PI 554419) and tetraploid Triticum turgidum (ssp. durum cultivar Langdon and ssp. dicoccum accessions PI 94668 and PI 349045) species. The composition of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in these amphidiploids and in their parental A. umbellulata and A. uniaristata species was analysed. As expected, the amphidiploids from T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum accession PI 944668 or PI 349045 and A. umbellulata accession CIae 29 or PI 226500 and A. uniaristata accession PI 554419 showed the same HMW-GS patterns as those of their Aegilops parents, because HMW-GS genes were all silenced in the T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum parents. The amphidiploids from CIae 29 and Langdon inherited all of the HMW-GS genes from their parents except for the Uy type. Using 10 and 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 10% urea/SDS-PAGE, 11 Ux and ten Uy types in 16 combinations were observed in 48 A. umbellulata accessions, and two Nx and two Ny types in two combinations were detected in six A. uniaristata accessions. These novel HMW-GS variants may provide new genetic resources for improving the quality of wheat.

To better utilize and provide the genetic basis of breeding for improving phosphorus deficiency tolerance, large-scale screening for tolerant A. tauschii to phosphorus deficiency was conducted using hydroponic experiment. A total of 380 A. tauschii genotypes were used to evaluate their phosphorus deficiency tolerance using root system at seedling stage. The results indicate that compared to applied phosphorus condition, genetic variation of the tested traits among 380 A. tauschii genotypes was significant under non-applied phosphorus condition. Heritability estimates showed that root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and total dry weight is highly inheritable. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that first four PCs explained 81.387 % of total variation. S value and phosphorus deficiency tolerance index (PDTI) showed that all A. tauschii genotypes can be divided into three groups, high (17 %), moderate (58 %) and low (25 %) tolerance groups. Compared with other cultivated wheat using S value and PDTI, the top five tolerant A. tauschii genotypes have stronger ability of phosphorus deficiency tolerance than other cultivated wheat. In conclusion, we systematically evaluated large-scale A. tauschii genotypes, and 63 tolerant lines and some root traits used as selection criteria were selected. The top five tolerant A. tauschii genotypes have relative higher tolerance than other wheat, and can be further used for wheat genetic improvement and molecular breeding for abiotic stress tolerance.

The temporal dynamics of wheat powdery mildew examined over a five-year period (2007-2012) indicated that disease incidence and index fitted an "S"-shaped curve. The initial stage of wheat powdery mildew occurred mainly in late November, and the logistic stage in 2010-2011 was the longest in all experiments. The 2010 and 2011 experiments exhibited the highest disease index across the five years. The logistic curve best fit disease development during the five years and provided a good prediction of powdery mildew with an accuracy of 85%. Meteorological factors in March and April were highly correlated with disease index. To better understand powdery mildew epidemics, effective dispersal of the fungus was studied in 2011 and 2012. The results showed that the pathogen can spread more than 500 cm in one infection cycle. The rate of disease spread was relatively fast between late March and mid-April in 2012 and reached 175 cm/d. Curve fitting of the disease spread distance in eight directions identified the exponential and quadratic functions as the best fitting curves. Information on the temporal dynamics and effective spread distance of wheat powdery mildew and the relationship between disease epidemics and weather conditions provides the insight needed for future disease forecasting and management.

Functional studies of metallo-beta-lactamases and trihelix transcription factors in higher plants remain very sparse. In this study, we isolated the green-revertible yellow79 (gry79) mutant in rice. The mutant developed yellow-green leaves before the three-leaf stage but recovered to normal green at the sixth-leaf stage. Meanwhile, the mutant exhibited reduced level of chlorophylls and arrested development of chloroplasts in the yellow leaves. Genetic analysis suggested that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene on rice chromosome 2. Map-based cloning revealed that the candidate gene was Os02g33610 encoding a putative metallo-beta-lactamase-trihelix chimera. In the gry79 mutant, a single-base mutation occurred in coding region of the gene, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein. Furthermore, the mutant phenotype was rescued by transformation with the wild-type gene. Therefore, we have confirmed that the gry79 mutant phenotype resulted from a single-base mutation in GRY79 (Os02g33610) gene, suggesting that the gene encoding a putative metallo-beta-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice. In addition, we considered that the gry79 mutant gene could be applicable as a leaf-color marker gene for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production.

MicroRNAs have been implicated as a negative regulator for diverse biological events including immune responses. However, the involvement of miRNAs in regulating the immune responses is just beginning to be explored. Here, we characterized the expression profiling of 375 microRNAs in porcine monocytes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and result shows that several of them are endotoxin-responsive genes. Through promoter analysis, the miR-628 was found to be a NF-kappa B dependent gene. Importantly, miR-628 was predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3'-UTR of the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) gene. And we found that the UTR inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene coding a key adapter molecule downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), resulting in suppressing of the TLR signaling. Therefore, we not only propose a role of miR-628 in control of the TLR signaling through a negative feedback regulation loop involving down-regulation of MyD88 protein levels, but results may also contribute to rational target selection orchestrating the inflammatory responses.

Rethinking Rice Preparation for Highly Efficient Removal of Inorganic Arsenic Using Percolating Cooking Water	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COOKED RICE; WHITE	A novel way of cooking rice to maximize the removal of the carcinogen inorganic arsenic (As-i) is presented here. In conventional rice cooking water and grain are in continuous contact, and it is known that the larger the water: rice cooking ratio, the more As-i removed by cooking, suggesting that the As-i in the grain is mobile in water. Experiments were designed where rice is cooked in a continual stream of percolating near boiling water, either low in As-i, or As-i free. This has the advantage of not only exposing grain to large volumes of cooking water, but also physically removes any As-i leached from the grain into the water receiving vessel. The relationship between cooking water volume and As-i removal in conventional rice cooking was demonstrated for the rice types under study. At a water-to-rice cooking ratio of 12:1, 57 +/- 5% of As-i could be removed, average of 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples. Two types of percolating technology were tested, one where the cooking water was recycled through condensing boiling water steam and passing the freshly distilled hot water through the grain in a laboratory setting, and one where tap water was used to cook the rice held in an off-the-shelf coffee percolator in a domestic setting. Both approaches proved highly effective in removing As-i from the cooking rice, with up to 85% of As-i removed from individual rice types. For the recycled water experiment 59 +/- 8% and 69 +/- 10% of As-i was removed, on average, compared to uncooked rice for polished (n=27) and wholegrain (n=13) rice, respectively. For coffee percolation there was no difference between wholegrain and polished rice, and the effectiveness of As-i removal was 49 +/- 7% across 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples. The manuscript explores the potential applications and further optimization of this percolating cooking water, high As-i removal, discovery.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether postnatal nutritional restriction could improve intestinal development and immune function of neonates with IUGR using piglets as model. A total of twelve pairs of normal-birth weight (NBW) and IUGR piglets (7 d old) were randomly assigned to receive adequate nutrient intake or restricted nutrient intake (RNI) by artificially liquid feeding for a period of 21 d. Blood samples and intestinal tissues were collected at necropsy and were analysed for morphology, digestive enzyme activities, immune cells and expression of innate immunity-related genes. The results indicated that both IUGR and postnatal nutritional restriction delayed the growth rate during the sucking period. Irrespective of nutrient intake, piglets with IUGR had a significantly lower villous height and crypt depth in the ileum than the NBW piglets. Moreover, IUGR decreased alkaline phosphatase activity while enhanced lactase activity in the jejunum and mRNA expressions of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the ileum of piglets. Irrespective of body weight, RNI significantly decreased the number and/or percentage of peripheral leucocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes of piglets, whereas the percentage of neutrophils and the ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) were increased. Furthermore, RNI markedly enhanced the mRNA expression of TLR-9 and DNMT1, but decreased the expression of NOD2 and TRAF-6 in the ileum of piglets. In summary, postnatal nutritional restriction led to abnormal cellular and innate immune response, as well as delayed the growth and intestinal development of IUGR piglets.

Thus, the process of polyploidization and evolutionary history of polyploids is of widespread interest. The species in Elymus L. sensu lato are allopolyploids that share a common St genome from Pseudoroegneria in different combinations with H, Y, P, and W genomes. But how the St genome evolved in the Elymus s. l. during the hybridization and polyploidization events remains unclear. We used nuclear and chloroplast DNA-based phylogenetic analyses to shed some light on this process. Results: The Maximum likelihood (ML) tree based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (nrITS) data showed that the Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum and Agropyron species served as the St, H and P genome diploid ancestors, respectively, for the Elymus s. l. polyploids. The ML tree for the chloroplast genes (matK and the intergenic region of trnH-psbA) suggests that the Pseudoroegneria served as the maternal donor of the St genome for Elymus s. l. Furthermore, it suggested that Pseudoroegneria species from Central Asia and Europe were more ancient than those from North America. The molecular evolution in the St genome appeared to be non-random following the polyploidy event with a departure from the equilibrium neutral model due to a genetic bottleneck caused by recent polyploidization. Conclusion: Our results suggest the ancient common maternal ancestral genome in Elymus s. l. is the St genome from Pseudoroegneria. The evolutionary differentiation of the St genome in Elymus s. l. after rise of this group may have multiple causes, including hybridization and polyploidization. They also suggest that E. tangutorum should be treated as C. dahurica var. tangutorum, and E. breviaristatus should be transferred into Campeiostachys. We hypothesized that the Elymus s. l. species origined in Central Asia and Europe, then spread to North America. Further study of intraspecific variation may help us evaluate our phylogenetic results in greater detail and with more certainty.

A two-year field experiment was conducted in the subalpine and alpine forests of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The intact soil cores from 3,600 m site were incubated in three elevations (3,000 m, 3,300 m and 3,600 m) to simulate climate warming. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were measured at different periods (early growing season [EG], late growing season [LG], onset of soil freezing period [OF], deep soil frozen period [DF] and soil thawing period [ET]) from May 2010 to August 2012. Average air temperature and soil temperature increased with the decrease of elevation during the experimental period. MBC and MBN showed a sharp decrease during the OF and ET in both organic layer and mineral layer at the three sites. Additionally, a relatively high MBC was observed during the DF. MBC and MBN in the soil organic layer decreased with the decrease of elevation but the opposite was true in the mineral soil layer. Warming had stronger effects on soil microbial biomass in the organic layer than in the mineral soil layer. The results indicated that future warming would alter soil microbial biomass and biogeochemical cycling in the forest ecosystems on the eastern Tibetan Plateau.

In this study, impact of realized genetic relationship and linkage disequilibrium (LD) on marker density and training population size required was investigated and their impact on practical application was further discussed. This study is based on experimental data of two populations derived from the same two founder lines (B73, Mo17). Two populations were genotyped with different marker sets at different density: IBM Syn4 and IBM Syn10. A high-density marker set in Syn10 was imputed into the Syn4 population with low marker density. Seven different prediction scenarios were carried out with a random regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) model. The result showed that the closer the real genetic relationship between training and validation population, the fewer markers were required to reach a good prediction accuracy. Taken the short-term cost for consideration, relationship information is more valuable than LD information. Meanwhile, the result indicated that accuracies based on high LD between QTL and markers were more stable over generations, thus LD information would provide more robust prediction capacity in practical applications.

In this study, a male sterile mutant, K305ms, was derived from the M-3 progeny of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line K305 exposed to Co-60-gamma irradiation. Male sterile K305ms plants did not show any obvious differences from their sibling male fertile plants (K305F) during the vegetative stage, but failed to produce functional pollen at the reproductive stage. Microscopic observations determined that the dyads and tetrads from the pollen of K305ms plants developed abnormally, and subsequently the microspores were shriveled. Genetic analysis indicated that the male sterility of K305ms was controlled by a single recessive genic gene. Gene mapping showed that the responsible gene was located between two simple sequence repeat markers on chromosome 2L in a region of 10.3 cM, bnlg469b and bnlg1940, with genetic distances of 2.9 and 7.4 cM, respectively. According to the microscopic and mapping characteristics, our results showed that this gene was distinguishable from all other reported male sterile genes in maize, and it is temporarily designated as ms305. The linkage map in this study will provide a useful fundamental basis for molecular marker-assisted selection as well as for further map-based cloning of ms305.

Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of S. iniae is vital to evade phagocytic clearance of the host and serves as an important protective antigen of S. iniae infection in aquatic animals. The CpsD gene was determined to be highly conservative in capsule polysaccharide operon. Prokaryotic expression of the CpsD gene of a clinical isolate of S. iniae from channel catfish and immunogenic examination of the recombinant protein were first described in this essay. The recombinant protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). Induction conditions in Escherichia coli were optimized with 0.6mM Isopropyl beta-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside at 37 degrees C for 5h after the culture mid-log phase in Luria Bertani (LB) medium. The recombinant protein CpsD was thus expressed and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), yielding approximate 582.47 mg the protein per liter culture. Western blot analysis showed that the purified CpsD had reactogenicity. It will possibly reveal more details of capsule synthesis and capsule regulation during various stages of the S. iniae infectious process.	[Wang, H. C.; Wang, K. Y.; Wang, J.; Huang, J.

Results: Single factor effect trends were achieved through yields and contends of YPF-P obtained from different extracting conditions. Then through a three-level, four-variable Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology adopting yield as response, the optimal conditions were determined as follows: Material/solvent ratio 1:23.37, microwave power 560 W, Extraction temperature 64 degrees C, and extraction time 9.62 min. Under the optimal conditions, the YPF-P extraction yield was 3.23%, and its content was detected as 38.52%. In antioxidant assays, the YPF-P was tested to possess 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities with an IC50 value of 0.262 mg/ml. In addition, YPF-P was also proved to have relatively low ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), compared to Vc, through FRAP assay. Conclusion: In the microwave-assisted reflux extraction research, good YPF-P yield was achieved from materials with relatively low YPF-P content. And for the, first time, both DPPH and FRAP assays were conducted on YPF-P, which proved that the antioxidant activity of YPF-P contributed to the functions of this medicine.

Varying levels of hormones and sugars possibly affect flower bud formation. This study aimed to determine the changes in endogenous hormones, sugars, and respiration levels in leaves and in apical buds. In addition, the current research was also conducted to observe the morphological changes during the induction, initiation and development of flower buds. Results showed that the periods of floral induction, initiation and development of S. spectabile were the period from 0 d to 1 d, 2 d to 10 d and after 11 d respectively under long day of 20 hours. High zeatin level in apical buds was conducive to floral induction; the increasing levels of gibberrelin and indole acetic acid favor floral initiation; floral development was regulated by mutually synergistic and antagonistic relationships of hormones. The total starch content in leaves remarkably decreased during floral induction. Moreover, soluble sugar content increased and reached the maximum level at 20 d of the treatment period. Afterward, soluble sugar content declined rapidly and was probably transported to the apical buds for rapid floral development. Furthermore, the total respiration of leaves maintained an upward trend; the cytochrome pathway also maintained an increasing trend after the plants were treated for 20 d. Such changes may favour the morphological differentiation of apical buds in floral development.

Eighty healthy male Gang geese were reared under the same feeding conditions, and were divided at 14 weeks of age into a control group and an overfed group. All birds were slaughtered after three weeks of over feeding. Gene expression and protein content of several genes involved in the mTOR pathway were evaluated. The results showed that the gene expression of mTOR, raptor, and rictor, and the protein contents of mTOR and PI3K were higher in liver, breast muscle, and leg muscle of the overfed group than that of control group. However, the S6K expression level was clearly lower in the liver of the overfed group than that of control group, and there was no evident difference in both breast muscle and leg muscle between the control group and the overfed group. These results suggest that overfeeding induces the activity of raptor, rictor, and mTOR, and that mTOR signaling pathway was closely linked with PI3K pathway in the evaluated geese.

To increase the diversity of powdery mildew pathogens, we identified a tobacco powdery mildew, designated Gc SICAU1, which belonged to Golovinomyces cichoracearum (Gc) based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA fragment sequences. Inoculation test in laboratory conditions revealed that Gc SICAU1 could colonize on wild type Arabidopsis Col-O leaves, but failed to grow as abundantly on tobacco leaves, indicating that Gc SICAU1 has completely overcome the pre-invasion resistance and its colonization is hindered by the post-invasion resistance in Arabidopsis. The growth of Gc SICAU1 in the fls2, efr-1 and pen1-1 mutants displayed no obvious difference from that of wild type plants. In contrast, salicylic acid (SA)-signaling deficient mutants such as pad4-1 and eds5-1, but not ethylene-signaling mutants, exhibited increased susceptibility to Gc SICAU1. Moreover, eds1-2 and pad4-1/sid2-1 were fully susceptible to Gc SICAU1 and the disease symptom was comparable to Gc SICAU1 on tobacco leaves. These data indicate that EDS1-mediated basal defense and SA-signaling play critical roles for post-invasion resistance against this pathogen. Taken together, our data demonstrated that Gc SICAU1 is a pathogen weakly virulent to Arabidopsis and can be used as a tool to finely dissect post-invasion resistance mechanisms.

Stem cell markers, CD34, CD117, and SOX2; normal liver stem cell markers, alpha fetoprotein, CK19, CK18, and OV6; putative CSC markers, CD44, CD133, EpCAM, and CD90; as well as CD31 were expressed in cloned CD34+ LCSC. SOX2 was the major factor in maintaining this LCSC before colonization, and interestingly, OCT4, SOX2, NAONG, Klf4, c-Myc, and Lin28 were upregulated in association with symmetric self-renewal for colony growth of CD34+ LCSC on feeder cells. Gene expression patterns of in vitro differentiation were consistent with our in vivo finding; furthermore, the tumorigenicity of cloned CD34+ LCSC was not different from uncloned CD34+ LCSC sorted from parental PLC. These results show that our cloned CD34+ LCSC maintained CSC property, including self-renewal, bipotency, and tumorigenicity after long-term culture, demonstrating that this LCSC can be cultured in an unlimited manner in vitro. Thus, establishing pure population of CSCs isolated from the patients will provide an opportunity to explore the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and cancer development, and to identify unique biomarkers presenting potential indicators of drug efficacy against CSCs for establishment of a novel strategy for cancer therapy.

However, it is hard to produce soybean stably with this system, since the growth of soybean plants is slower under shading by corn at the seedling stage, and it is compensated by accelerated growth after the symbiotic stage. Soybean plants show excessive vegetative growth due to more rain during the flowering stage, which results in fallen petals, fallen pods and lower yield. This study investigated whether seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2, 4 and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) suppresses excessive vegetative growth of soybean plants during the flowering stage and delays senescence of photosynthetically active leaves at the pod-setting stage. If such events are correlated with changes in photosynthesis, they may affect dry matter accumulation and seed yield in the relay stripping system. Uniconazole promoted biomass accumulation from 31 (R-3) to 61 (R-5) days after flowering (DAF) and seed yield. Seed treatment with uniconazole raised the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a contents. In contrast, uniconazole reduced leaf area index (LAI) from 1 DAF (R-1) to 46 DAF (R-4) with the increase in uniconazole concentration, whereas, uniconazole significantly increased LAI at 61 DAF and the greatest promotion occurred at 2 mg kg(-1) treatment. The study clearly showed that uniconazole effectively suppressed excessive vegetative growth of soybean during flowering stage, delayed senescence of photosynthetically active leaves at pod-setting stage and induced higher yield, which were related to the changes in photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, dry matter accumulation and LAI in the relay strip intercropping system.

Merr.) in Relay Strip Intercropping System	PLANT PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						Accumulation; Post-ripening period; Relay strip intercropping system; Soybean isoflavones	SOY ISOFLAVONES; SEED DEVELOPMENT; PROSTATE-CANCER; TEMPERATURE; CULTIVARS; GROWTH; IRRIGATION; GENISTEIN; DAIDZEIN; LOCATION	Soybean is the most common resource of isoflavonoid in human food. Wide development of relay strip intercropped soybean has contributed to the soybean industry in China. Due to the shading from maize, growth and grain production of soybean is reduced. However, whether soybean isoflavonoid accumulation pattern is influenced in the relay strip intercropping system is still unclear. Here, we studied the accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones in the relay strip intercropping system and sole cropping system at the per-harvest stage. The accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones at the postharvest stage were also studied. The results indicated that accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones of all varieties in leaf and seed in the two systems were similar, but the trend was delayed in the relay strip intercropping system compared with the sole cropping system. During the pod filling stage, the total content of isoflavone, M-type isoflavone content, G-type isoflavone content in seed in the relay strip intercropping system were lower than those in the sole cropping system. During the after-ripening period, seed isoflavone content, M-type isoflavone content, G-type isoflavone content in seed increased in both systems, but were higher in the relay strip intercropping system. The temperature and photosynthetically active radiation were significantly lower in relay intercropping than in sole cropping, while relative humidity showed the opposite trend. Path analysis showed that total isoflavone content in leaves and seeds showed a significantly positive correlation with temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but significantly negative correlation with relative humidity. Correlation analysis between the highest isoflavone content in sole cropping or relay intercropping seeds and agronomic traits revealed a significant positive correlation between the number of both branches and pods with total isoflavone, M-type isoflavone and G-type isoflavone in both systems.

The wheat-maize-soybean relay intercropping system has been widely employed by famers in Southwestern China for years, but the detailed mechanisms through which the nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency reach the high level in this system remain unclear. In the present study, two separate pot experiments were performed by N-15 isotope dilution (ID) labeling and direct N-15 foliar feeding (Ft) assays, and a solid barrier was employed to prevent the roots intergrowth and N movement among crops in the first experiment, using no barrier as the control. The results showed that, under the no-barrier condition, the grain yields, N-15 uptake and N-15 recovery efficiency of wheat and maize were significantly increased, but those measures in soybean were decreased compared to the solid barrier condition. Furthermore, hi-directional N transfer was detected during the co-growing stage of crops, the amount (N-transfer) and percentage (%NT) of N-15 transferred varied significantly with the fertilizer-N rate, and the maximum reached at 150 - 300 kg N ha(-1) level. The N-transfer fer from maize to wheat was 16.1% - 163.0% higher than that from wheat to maize; the N-transfer from soybean to maize was 1.7 - 6.0 times higher than those from maize to soybean, while the %NT from soybean to maize were 6.7 - 22.2 times higher than those from maize to soybean. Conclusively, this study revealed that the interaction of the roots among crops significantly increased the uptake efficiency and recovery efficiency, and further, the positive N competition and hi-directional N transfer of each crops were the main contributors to improve the N use efficiency in the wheat-maize-soybean relay intercropping system.

Screening for and identification of protective antigens plays an important role in developing therapies against S. iniae infections. In this study, we indicated that the -enolase of S. iniae was not only distributed in the cytoplasm and associated to cell walls, but was also secreted to the bacterial cell surface. The functional identity of the purified recombinant -enolase protein was verified by its ability to catalyze the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGE) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and both the recombinant and native proteins interacted with human plasminogen. The rabbit anti-rENO serum blockade assay shows that -enolase participates in S. iniae adhesion to and invasion of BHK-21 cells. In addition, the recombinant -enolase can confer effective protection against S. iniae infection in mice, which suggests that -enolase has potential as a vaccine candidate in mammals. We conclude that S. iniae -enolase is a moonlighting protein that also associates with the bacterial outer surface and functions as a protective antigen in mice.

Genetic characteristics of Chinese isolates of the tapeworm Taenia pisiformis based on two mitochondrial genes	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article							SOFTWARE; SEQUENCE; DNA; PARASITES; HEALTH	Cysticercosis is caused by infections with embryonated eggs of the tapeworm Taenia pisiformis. Knowledge of the genetic characteristics of T. pisiformis could be applied to study the epidemiology and transmission of this parasite. In this study, 61 isolates of intraperitoneal cysticerci from eight geographically distinct regions in Sichuan province, China, were subjected to a molecular analysis in order to determine their intra-regional genetic characteristics. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1, 1427bp) and NADH dehydrogenase 1 (nad1, 738bp) were concatenated. Five haplotypes were identified, and 89.04% of total genetic variation was found in collections of T. pisiformis isolates from a single region. According to the phylogenetic reconstruction, the T. pisiformis isolates from eight regions did not form geographical clusters. Our study highlights the genetic characteristics of T. pisiformis with the aim of accelerating the genetic research and control of cysticercosis.	[Yang, D. Y.; Fu, Y.; Xie, Y.; Nong, X.; Gu, X.

We detected one single nucleotide polymorphism and the SNP was located at 536 bp in intron 5 of this gene. Chi-square tests showed that the genotypic frequencies in the three rabbit populations were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The PIC values indicated that the three populations had intermediate levels of genetic diversity. Rabbits with the CC genotype had a significantly greater pH(0h) than those with the CT genotype in the biceps femoris muscle. The least squares means for cooking loss in CT and CC rabbits were significantly higher than those for TT rabbits. Rabbits with the CC genotype had a significantly higher intramuscular fat content in the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles than those with genotype TT and CT. Thus, the results here indicate that this POU1F1 SNP may be of potential use in marker assisted selection for meat quality traits in rabbits.

However, lack of fundamental information about their functionality and specific characteristics may hinder their industrial use. Predictive microbiology may help to solve this problem by simulating the kinetics of bacteriocin-producing strains and optimising the cell growth and production of beneficial metabolites. In this study, a combined model was developed which could estimate, from a given initial condition of temperature and pH, the growth and bacteriocin production of Lactobacillus plantarum BC-25 in MRS broth. A logistic model was used to model the growth of cells, and the Luedeking-Piret model was used to simulate the biomass and bacteriocin production. The parameters generated from these primary models were used in a response surface model to describe the combined influence on cell growth, biomass and bacteriocin production. Both the temperature and pH influenced cell and bacteriocin production significantly. The optimal temperature and pH for cell growth is 35 degrees C and 6.8, and the optimal bacteriocin production condition is a range dependent on two growth-associated constants (Y-A/X and K), where temperature is from 27 to 34 degrees C, and pH is 6.35 to 6.65. The developed model is consistent with similar studies and could be a useful tool to control and increase the production of lactic acid bacteria in bioreactors.

Storage roots develop from adventitious roots (ARs) present in stem cuttings that serve as propagation material. Data on the origin of sweetpotato ARs and the effect of nodal position on AR establishment and further development are limited. METHODS: We anatomically described root primordium initiation using stem sections and measured number of root primordia formed at different nodal positions using light microscopy and correlated nodal positions with AR number and length 14 d after planting (DAP). KEY RESULTS: Primordia for ARs initiate at the junction of the stem pith ray and the cambium, on both sides of the leaf gap, and they are well developed before emerging from the stem. The number of ARs that develop from isolated stem nodes 14 DAP corresponded to the number of AR primordia detected inside the stem. The total length of established roots at nodes 9-13 from the apex is about 2-fold longer than at nodes 5-8. CONCLUSIONS: Nodal position (age) has a significant effect on the developmental status and number of root primordia inside the stem, determining the number and length of ARs that have developed by 14 DAP. Adventitious roots originating from nodes 9-13 possess similar AR systems and develop better than those originating from younger nodes 3-8. The mechanism regulating AR initiation in nodes is discussed. This system can serve for studying the effect of environmental conditions on AR initiation, development, and capacity to form storage roots.

An extract was prepared by refluxing with ethanol and steam distillation, and its toxic effect was tested in vitro against Sarcoptes scabiei. The data from the toxicity tests were analyzed using a complementary log-log (CLL) model. The ethanol extract exhibited strong acaricidal activity against these mites; at a concentration of 2 g/ml it killed all S. scabiei within 2 h and at 1 g/ml it killed all S. scabiei within 6 h. Similarly, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml concentrations of the extract had strong toxicity against S. scabiei, with median lethal time (LT50) values of 0.716, 1.741, 2.968 and 4.838 h, respectively. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 1.388, 0.624, 0.310 and 0.213 g/ml for Scabies mite in 1, 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively. The results indicate that the L. virgaurea extract has strong acaricidal activity and may be exploited as a novel treatment for the effective control of acariasis in animals.

In this work, three different topographies of HA materials HA-sheet, HA-rod, and HA-whisker were synthesized and testified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). We have systematically investigated the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2) on the three different topography surfaces of HA, respectively. The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of HA-sheet, HA-rod and HA-whisker were (219.96 +/- 10.18), (247.13 +/- 1235), and (354.67 +/- 1 17.73) mu g . g(-1), respectively. Kinetic parameters, rate constants, equilibrium adsorption capacities and related correlation coefficients, for each kinetic model were calculated as well as discussed. It demonstrated that the adsorption of BMP-2 onto HA could be described by the pseudo second-order equation. Adsorption of BMP-2 onto HA followed the Langmuir isotherm. It confirmed that compared with other samples HA-whisker had more adsorption sites for its high specific surface area which could provide more opportunities for protein molecules. The adsorption processes were endothermic (Delta H > 0), spontaneous (Delta G < 0) and entropy increasing (Delta S > 0).A possible adsorption mechanism has been proposed. In addition, the BMP-2 could be adsorbed to the surface which existed slight conformational changes by FT-IR. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The maximum power density of MFCs with the N-doped carbon catalyst (1041 +/- 90mWm(-2)) was much higher than that of Pt/C-based MFC (584 +/- 10mWm(-2)), while the cost was significantly lower. These results demonstrated that such N-doped carbon has the advantages of low cost and high efficiency, and can be a promising alternative to Pt/C in large-scale applications of MFCs.

Objective: This study explored impacts of high-fat diet-induced obesity on inflammation and expressions of selenoprotein and obesity-related genes in 10 tissues of pigs. Methods: Plasma and 10 tissues were collected from pigs In = 10) fed a corn-soy based control diet or that diet containing 3-7% lard from weanling to finishing (180 d). Plasma concentrations, (n = 8) of cytokines and thyroid hormones and tissue mRNA abundance In = 4) of 25 selenoprotein genes and 16 obesity-related genes were compared between the pigs fed the control and high-fat diets. Stepwise regression was applied to analyze correlations among all these measures, including the previously reported body physical and plasma biochemical variables. Results: The high-fat diet elevated (P < 0.05) plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, leptin, and leptin receptor by 29-42% and affected (P < 0.05-0.11 tissue mRNA levels of the selenoprotein and obesity-related genes in 3 patterns. Specifically, the high-fat diet up-regulated 12 selenoprotein genes in 6 tissues, down-regulated 13 selenoprotein genes in 7 tissues, and exerted no effect on 5 genes in any tissue. Body weights and plasma triglyceride concentrations of pigs showed the strongest regressions to tissue mRNA abundances of selenoprotein and obesity-related genes. Among the selenoprotein genes, selenoprotein V and I were ranked as the strongest independent variables for the regression of phenotypic and plasma measures. Meanwhile, agouti signaling protein, adiponectin, and resistin genes represented the strongest independent variables of the obesity-related genes for the regression of tissue selenoprotein mRNA. Conclusions: The high-fat diet induced inflammation in pigs and affected their gene expression of selenoproteins associated with thioredoxin and oxidoreductase systems, local tissue thyroid hormone activity, endoplasmic reticulum protein degradation, and phosphorylation of lipids. This porcine model may be used to study interactive mechanisms between excess fat intake and selenoprotein function.

In this study, we measured starch content, determined SBE activity within endosperms, analyzed expression patterns of SBE I by real-time quantitative PCR(RT-qPCR), and characterized sequences of SBE I from two accessions (Y59 and Y63) of Triticum monococcum with different starch content. Our results indicated that contents of total starch and amylopectin during grain development were significantly different between the two investigated accessions. Analysis of enzyme activity revealed that SBE activity in endosperm of Y59 was obviously higher than that in Y63 at early developmental stage. Accumulation rates of both amylopectin and starch were significantly correlated to the SBE activities in the two accessions. Expression analysis showed that SBEI genes were highly expressed at middle stage of development. Further, the expression of SBE I in Y59 was higher than that in Y63 from 5 days after pollination (DAP) to 23 DAP. Coding sequences of SBE I in both Y59 and Y63 included a 2490-bp opening reading frame (ORF) encoding 829 amino acids. The genomic DNAs of SBE I were about 5.5 kb in length, contained 14 exons and 13 introns, and shared a similar structure with wheat. Our results may provide some bases to research amylopectin accumulation of T. monococcum, further provided relevant theoretical foundation for exploring the amylopectin synthesis in wheat.

A total of 24 sows were fed a basal diet supplemented with additional corn starch (CON), fish oil (FO) or olive oil (OO). Sows fed an OO diet during late gestation had a higher piglet birth weight compared with CON-fed and FO-fed sows (P < 0.05). Furthermore, sows from the OO group had a higher milk fat content than sows from CON and FO groups, and a lower pre-weaning mortality of piglets was observed in the OO group (P < 0.05). Maternal FO supplementation resulted in increased malondialdehyde concentration in sow plasma, colostrum, milk and piglet plasma than in CON and OO groups (P < 0.05). However, an increased total antioxidant capacity (T-ACC) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) were also observed in the FO group (P < 0.05). Sows fed an OO diet had significantly decreased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations in milk compared with CON and FO fed sows (P < 0.05). Moreover, lower plasma IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels were observed in piglets from the OO group compared with the CON group (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that an OO diet is most beneficial in late gestation and during lactation in sows. However, FO increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress in sows and piglets.

Antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from giant pandas	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						antimicrobial; disinfectant; giant pandas; PFGE; resistance genes	KLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE STRAINS; SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASES; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; ANTISEPTICS; STAPHYLOCOCCI; PREVALENCE; GENES	AimsThe study aims to demonstrate the antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance phenotypes and genotypes of Escherichia coli isolates obtained from giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Methods and ResultsAntimicrobial testing was performed according to the standard disk diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of disinfectants were determined using the agar dilution method. All isolates were screened for the presence of antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance genes and further analysed for genetic relatedness by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results showed that 466% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to fewer antimicrobials as panda age increased. Among antimicrobial-resistant E.coli isolates, the antimicrobial resistance genes blaCTX-M (882%) and sul1 (923%) were most prevalent. The disinfectant resistance genes emrE, ydgE/ydgF, mdfA and sugE(c) were commonly present (682-989%), whereas qac and sugE(p) were relatively less prevalent (0-213%). The frequencies of resistance genes tended to be higher in E.coli isolated in December than in July, and PFGE profiles were also more diverse in isolates in December. The qacE1 and sugE(p) genes were higher in adolescent pandas than in any other age groups. PFGE revealed that antimicrobial resistance correlated well with sampling time and habitat. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance was common in giant panda-derived E.coli, and the antimicrobial resistance was associated with sampling time and habitat. Escherichia coli could serve as a critical vector in spreading disinfectant and antimicrobial resistance. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis is the first study that demonstrated the phenotypic and genetic characterizations of antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance in E.coli isolates from more than 60 giant pandas. Frequent transfer of pandas to other cages may lead to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. The study highlights the need for regularly monitoring the antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance in bacteria from giant pandas.

This study investigates the effect of LL-pEGF on the development and expression of genes that maintain the structural integrity and function of the small intestine in early-weaned piglets. Methods and ResultsThe mitogenic effect of porcine epidermal growth factor (pEGF) was tested invitro with the 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay in fibroblast cells. In the invivo study, 40 weaned piglets were randomly allocated to control, antibiotic control, Lc.lactis-expressing empty vector (LL-EV) and LL-pEGF treatment groups. Cells treated with LL-pEGF had higher BrdU-positive stained cells than those in the control and the LL-EV treatments (P<005). Scanning electron microscope and histological examination demonstrated that the small intestinal villi treated with LL-pEGF were higher (P<005) than in the other treatments. LL-pEGF increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of the intestinal structural integrity proteins trefoil factor 3, claudin 1 (CLDN1), occludin and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), the digestive enzymes sucrose, aminopeptidase A, and aminopeptidase N, and the nutrient transporters sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), glucose transporter 2, and peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) as compared with the control (P<005) in the small intestine. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of CLDN1 in the jejunum and ZO-1 in the ileum were higher in the LL-EV group than in the control group (P<005). LL-EV and the antibiotic control increased SGLT1 mRNA in the jejunum and PEPT1 mRNA in the ileum compared with the control (P<005). ConclusionsRecombinant pEGF promotes cell mitosis. Oral administration of Lc.lactis-expressing pEGF stimulated intestinal development by upregulating the gene expression of the intestinal structural integrity proteins, the digestive enzymes and the nutrient transporters. Significance and Impact of the StudyThe combination of epidermal growth factor and genetically modified micro-organisms may be used as dietary supplements to reduce intestinal stress in animals and even humans.

Phylogeography of Chinese cherry (Prunus pseudocerasus Lindl.) inferred from chloroplast and nuclear DNA: insights into evolutionary patterns and demographic history	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Chinese cherry (Prunus pseudocerasus Lindl); cpDNA; nrDNA; phylogeography	GENETIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SEQUENCE POLYMORPHISM; PHYLOGENETIC UTILITY; S-HAPLOTYPES; ROSACEAE; PLANT; DOMESTICATION; TAXONOMY; GENOME	Chinese cherry (Prunus pseudocerasus Lindl.) is a commercially valuable fruit crop in China. In order to obtain new insights into its evolutionary history and provide valuable recommendations for resource conservation, phylogeographic patterns of 26 natural populations (305 total individuals) from six geographic regions were analyzed using chloroplast and nuclear DNA fragments. Low levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were found in these populations, especially in landrace populations. It is likely that a combined effect of botanical characteristics impact the effective population size, such as inbreeding mating system, long life span, as well as vegetative reproduction. In addition, strong bottleneck effect caused by domestication, together with founder effect after dispersal and subsequent demographic expansion, might also accelerate the reduction of the genetic variation in landrace populations. Interestingly, populations from Longmen Mountain (LMM) and Daliangshan Mountain (DLSM) exhibited relatively higher levels of genetic diversity, inferring the two historical genetic diversity centers of the species. Moreover, moderate population subdivision was also detected by both chloroplast DNA (G(ST)=0.215; N-ST=0.256) and nuclear DNA (G(ST)=0.146; N-ST=0.342), respectively. We inferred that the episodes of efficient gene flow through seed dispersal, together with features of long generation cycle and inbreeding mating system, were likely the main contributors causing the observed phylogeographic patterns. Finally, factors that led to the present demographic patterns of populations from these regions and taxonomic varieties were also discussed.

The crude polysaccharides, PL (polysaccharides from light-grown sprouts) and PD (polysaccharides from dark-grown sprouts), were extracted by hot water method, and were further purified by chromatography of DEAE-52. Under scanning electron microscope, the smooth surface of PL was distinct from that of PD. Two purified fractions (PD and PD3), although both were mainly composed of arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose, had different molecular weight, 126.61 vs. 111.94 kDa, respectively. In vitro, stronger 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing activity power (FRAP) were observed in PI3 compared with PD3. These results indicate that light treatment can significantly enhance polysaccharides' antioxidant activity. This work also provides a scientific basis for the further exploitation of polysaccharides from soybean sprouts grown in the light. Light treatment may have a potential application in vegetable processing industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The average molecular weight (Mw) of the CVPS was 968.31 kDa. The monosaccharide components of the CVPS was rhamnose, arabinose, fucose, mannose, glucose, and galactose with a relative mass of 6.29%, 21.87%, 16.59%, 12.54%, 13.07%, and 28.05%, respectively. Administering CVPS as an adjuvant significantly enhanced the phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophages, splenocyte proliferation, and the activity of NK cells and CTL as well as increased FMDV-specific IgG and IgG subclass antibody titers. Moreover, CVPS increased the expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 in CD4(+) T cells and IFN-gamma expression in CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, CVPS enhanced CD40(+), CD80(+), and CD86(+) expression on DCs. Moreover, CVPS upregulated MHC-I/II, TLR-2/4 mRNA levels. In contrast, CVPS downregulated TGF-beta mRNA expression and the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Taken together, these results indicate that administering CVPS as an adjuvant enhances both cellular and humoral immune responses via the TLR-2 and TLR-4 signalling pathways, thereby promoting DC maturation and suppressing TGF-beta expression and Treg frequency.

Changes in expression of an antimicrobial peptide, digestive enzymes, and nutrient transporters in the intestine of E. praecox-infected chickens	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Eimeria praecox; nutrient transporter; liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2	CAMPYLOBACTER-JEJUNI; EIMERIA-ACERVULINA; BROILERS; FAMILY	Coccidiosis is a major intestinal disease of poultry, caused by several species of the protozoan Eimeria. The objective of this study was to examine changes in expression of digestive enzymes, nutrient transporters, and an antimicrobial peptide following an Eimeria praecox challenge of chickens at days 3 and 6 post-infection. Gene expression was determined by real-time PCR and analyzed by one-way ANOVA. In the duodenum, the primary site of E. praecox infection, a number of genes were downregulated at both d3 and d6 post-infection. These genes included liver ex-pressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2), the cationic (CAT1), anionic (EAAT3), and L-type (LAT1) amino acid transporters, the peptide transporter PepT1 and the zinc transporter ZnT1. Other transporters were downregulated either at d3 or d6. At both d3 and d6, there was downregulation of BoAT and CAT1 in the jejunum and downregulation of LEAP2 and LAT1 in the ileum. LEAP2, EAAT3, and ZnT1 have been found to be downregulated following challenge with other Eimeria species, suggesting a common cellular response to Eimeria.

Effect of dietary methionine content on growth performance, carcass traits, and feather growth of Pekin duck from 15 to 35 days of age	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						carcass traits; feather growth; methionine; Pekin ducks	BROILER-CHICKENS; DL-METHIONINE; AMINO-ACIDS; REQUIREMENTS; DIGESTIBILITY; PROTEIN; LYSINE	A study was conducted to establish the response of Pekin ducks to dietary Met from 15 to 35 d age. Experimental diets were formulated to contain 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, and 0.75% Met (0.30, 0.39, 0.45, 0.56, and 0.68% on an analyzed basis, respectively) and 0.3% cysteine (0.25, 0.27, 0.26, 0.26, and 0.28% on an analyzed basis, respectively). Each diet was fed to 10 pens of 55 ducks/pen. Carcass yields and feather growth were determined at 28 and 35 d. Results showed that feeding 0.30% Met (0.55% Met+Cys) significantly impaired ADG, feed-to-gain (F:G) ratio, breast meat yield, and feather growth in comparison to the other dietary treatments (P < 0.05). BW, ADG, F: G, carcass and breast meat weight and yield, breast skin and subcutaneous fat weight and yield, the fourth primary wing feather length, and feather coverage showed significant quadratic broken-line or quadratic polynomial response to increasing dietary Met (P < 0.05). From 15 to 28 d age, the optimal Met requirement for the BW, breast meat yield, and the fourth primary wing feather length were 0.510, 0.445, and 0.404%, respectively, based on quadratic broken-line model, and correspondingly were 0.606, 0.576, and 0.559% by quadratic regression. For ducks from 15 to 35 d age, the optimal Met requirement for BW, breast meat yield, and feather coverage were 0.468, 0.408, and 0.484%, respectively, by quadratic broken-line model, and 0.605, 0.564, and 0.612%, by quadratic regression, respectively.

Reported here are comparisons between pen and cage rearing (the housing system, denoted HS), line crosses (LC), two native Chinese lines (EM males were mated to Y1 and Y2 and their offspring denoted as EMY1 and EMY2), and sex in determining broiler traits. At hatch, 320 males and 320 females from each LC (giving a total of 1,280 chicks) were randomly assigned within each subgroup to 16 battery pens. There were 4 replicates for each combination of LC by sex. On d 28, half of the chicks were transferred to indoor floor pens, and the others were raised in single cages from d 29 to 91. Weekly body weights, livability, and feed conversion ratios (FCR) were obtained to d 91, the age at which the broilers were slaughtered for carcass measurements. The caged males and females were heavier (P < 0.05) than their penned counterparts (2,292 vs 2,219 g). Except for females from line EMY1 (94.9%), the livability for each unit from 1 to 28 d, and 29 to 91 d was greater than 95%. Penned EMY2 broilers had the highest FCR (3.02), whereas penned EMY1 broilers had the lowest FCR (2.96) among the housing systems by LC combinations (P < 0.05). Caged chickens had thicker subcutaneous fat (7.24 mm), a higher percentages of abdominal fat (5.01%) and liver mass (3.13%), but lower eviscerated carcass (60.63%) and breast muscle weights (pectoralis major and minor, 17.10%). Males were heavier and had higher percentages of leg muscle (boneless drum plus thigh, 24.22%) and heart muscle (1.08%) than the females (P < 0.05). However, the females had thicker subcutaneous fat (7.19 mm) and higher percentages of carcass weight (87.28%), breast muscle (18.11%), abdominal fat (6.54%), and liver mass (3.15%) than males. Penned females had the highest percentage of breast muscle (18.94%), and caged females had the highest percentage of liver mass (3.72%). Females of EMY1 had the highest percentage of breast muscle (18.40%). Generally, the housing system employed and the sex of the broilers greatly affect the carcass traits.

With rising energy demands and costs for fossil fuels, alternative energy from renewable sources such as maize cobs will become competitive. Maize cobs have beneficial characteristics for utilization as feedstock including compact tissue, high cellulose content, and low ash and nitrogen content. Nitrogen is quantitatively the most important nutrient for plant growth. However, the influence of nitrogen fertilization on maize cob production is unclear. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been analyzed for cob morphological traits such as cob weight, volume, length, diameter and cob tissue density, and grain yield under normal and low nitrogen regimes. 213 doubled-haploid lines of the intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population have been resequenced for 8575 bins, based on SNP markers. A total of 138 QTL were found for six traits across six trials using composite interval mapping with ten cofactors and empirical comparison-wise thresholds (P = 0.001). Despite moderate to high repeatabilities across trials, few QTL were consistent across trials and overall levels of explained phenotypic variance were lower than expected some of the cob trait x trial combinations (R (2) = 7.3-43.1 %). Variation for cob traits was less affected by nitrogen conditions than by grain yield. Thus, the economics of cob usage under low nitrogen regimes is promising.

Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase participates in catalyzing biosynthesis of abscisic acid, which plays a crucial role in the response of plants to abiotic stresses. In this study, we cloned molybdenum cofactor sulfurase gene (AnMCSU) from a super-xerophytic desert plant, Ammopiptanthus nanus, by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. This gene has a total length of 2544 bp, with a 5'- and a 3'-untranslated region of 167 and 88 bp, and an open reading frame of 2289 bp, which encodes an 84.85 kDa protein of 762 amino acids. The putative amino acid sequence shares high homology and conserved amino acid residues crucial for the function of molybdenum cofactor sulfurases with other leguminous species. The encoded protein of the AnMCSU gene was located in the cytoplasm by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The result of real-time quantitative PCR showed that the expression of the AnMCSU gene was induced by heat, dehydration, high salt stresses, and ABA induction, and inhibited by cold stress. The heterologous expression of the AnMCSU gene significantly enhanced the tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana to high salt, cold, osmotic stresses, and abscisic acid induction. All these results suggest that the AnMCSU gene might play a crucial role in the adaptation of A. nanus to abiotic stress and has potential to be applied to transgenic improvement of commercial crops.

We demonstrated its utilization for protein expression, localization, protein-protein interaction, and the investigation of PCD-related processes. Plant protoplasts are an important and versatile cell system that is widely used in the analysis of gene characterization and diverse signaling pathways. Programmed cell death (PCD) occurs throughout the life of plants from embryogenesis to fertilization. The maize nucellus undergoes typical PCD during development of the embryo sac. The nucellus protoplast shows potential for use in research of PCD-related processes. No studies have reported previously the isolation and transfection of nucellus protoplasts. In this study, conditions for the isolation and transfection of maize nucellus protoplasts were established. The maize protoplast system can be used for protein expression, localization, and protein-protein interaction. We applied this system to investigate PCD-related processes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that transient expression of MADS29 in the maize nucellus protoplast increases Cys-protease gene transcript level. In addition, beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity assays showed that MADS29 could enhance the promoter activities of the Cys-protease gene. Thus, we demonstrated the potential of a highly efficient maize nucellus protoplast system for transient gene expression and investigation of PCD-related processes.

Based on genome-wide profile analysis, we detected differential mRNA of maize genes. Some of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predicted to be potential candidates of maize ear development. Several well-known genes were found with reported mutant analyses, such as, compact plant2 (ct2), zea AGAMOUS homolog1 (zag1), bearded ear (bde), and silky1 (si1). MicroRNAs such as microRNA156 were predicted to target genes involved in maize ear development. Antisense transcripts were widespread throughout all the four stages, and are suspected to play important roles in maize ear development. Thus, identification and characterization of important genes and regulators at all the four developmental stages will contribute to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for maize ear development.

The CLAE at 80 or 120 g pot(-1) significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate (P-n), transpiration rate (T-r) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), followed by a reduction of relative height growth and basal diameter growth. Under light saturation, apparent quantum yield, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-n (max)) in all treated groups and light respiration (R-d) in A(1) and A(2) showed a decreasing trend, whereas light compensation point and light saturation point had an increased tendency. Under CO2 concentration saturation, carboxylation rate, P-n max and light respiration (R-p) first increased (A(1)) and dramatically decreased (A(2) and A(3)) thereafter, whereas CO2 compensation point and CO2 saturation point increased. However, all parameters of the chlorophyll content of E. grandis seedlings were found to decrease with increased concentrations of CLAE. The results demonstrate that the aqueous extracts from C. septentrionale leaf litter have allelopathic potential and that a higher concentration of CLAE presents a risk or disadvantage to the growth of E. grandis seedling which suggests that the growth of E. grandis seedlings could be inhibited when planted under or near mature C. septentrionale plantation, and it is better not to develop mixed-plantation of C. septentrionale and E. grandis.

In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of ruminants, cellulolytic bacteria aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Rumen contents and feces in ruminants are often used to assess gastrointestinal microbial communities; however, these sites do not guarantee to represent the diversity of microbes found in the entire GIT. In this study, we investigated the microbiota along the GIT of five Chinese Mongolian sheep using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR analysis. Results indicated that microbiota were more abundant in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. DGGE and real-time PCR revealed the predominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the GIT. Meanwhile, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium cluster IV showed significant difference in their abundance along the GIT (P < 0.05). Fibrobacter succinogenes was the most dominant species, followed by Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. The ileum harbored a larger number of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly-Clostridium cluster IV, than reported previously. In addition, comparisons between microbiota in the rumen and rectum indicated similar number of total bacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, F. succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Clostridium cluster IV, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, whereas the number of R. albus and R. flavefaciens was higher in the rumen. This study investigated the composition and quantification of GIT microbial community in Chinese Mongolian sheep, and revealed for the first time the cellulolytic bacterial community in these sheep.

To further understand the role of PIAS in immune and stress response in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain), in the present study, a full-length cDNA of PIAS from S. paramamosain (SpPIAS) was cloned for the first time, which contained an open reading frame of 2364 bp encoding a polypeptide of 788 amino acids. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the tissue distribution of PIAS in mud crab. The results revealed that SpPIAS was expressed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, intestines, muscle, connective tissue and gonad of S. paramamosain, and the higher expression levels were found in connective tissue and gonad. The expression levels of SpPIAS in hemocytes were up-regulated after challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio harveyi, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) for 2-24 h, which suggested that SpPIAS was involved in the pathogen-resistant activities of mud crab. Furthermore, the RING-like domain (RLD) and Serine/Threonine rich repeat C-terminal domain (S/T) of SpPIAS were expressed by prokaryotic expression system and purified by glutathione Sepharose 4B chromatography. This study contributed to define the biological characteristics of SpPAIS and further demonstrate the critical role of SpPAIS in vivo during the pathogen infection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Six iso-nitrogenous diets that contained graded levels of Leu (7.1-17.1 g Leu kg(-1) diets) were fed to the fish for 8 weeks. Compared with the control group, appropriate Leu supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the following: (1) the lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase activity and complement component 3 (C3) content in all intestinal segments; (2) the mRNA levels of interleukin 10, inhibitor factor kappa B alpha (I kappa Ba) and target of rapamycin ( TOR) in the mid and distal intestine as well as transforming growth factor beta 1 in all intestinal segments; and ( 3) the transcript levels for claudin b, claudin 3, claudin 15, occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the intestine of young grass carp. At the same time, appropriate Leu supplementation down-regulated the mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor a, interleukin 8 and nuclear factor kappa B p65 ( NF-kappa B p65) in the mid and distal intestine of young grass carp (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the transcript levels for claudin c and claudin 12 showed no significant differences among the groups in the intestine of young grass carp. In conclusion, the positive effect of Leu on intestinal health is associated with the improvement of the intestinal immune status and the regulation of immune-related signalling molecules and tight junction transcripts of fish.

In this paper, a method for accounting the carbon dioxide emission of small hydropower plants is proposed. Twenty-six small hydropower plants (SHPs) in southwest China are chosen as a case study. The following results were found: (1) the carbon dioxide emission during the construction period (COEc) per installed capacity ranged between 0.01957 t/kW and 0.1926 t/kW, with its average value 0.04592 t/kw; (2) the carbon dioxide emission during the construction period is classified into two groups; for each group, there is a reciprocal relationship between the installed capacity and the annual COEc per installed capacity, and (3) the annual CEOo (carbon dioxide emission during the operation period) declines with increasing installed capacity, the two related by a straight line. Specifically, when the installed capacity increases by 1 kW carbon emissions are reduced by 16.33 t. COEo is directly determined by hydropower. In addition, (4) the trend of carbon dioxide emission during the system lifecycle of SHPs is determined by COEo. The most important factor in determining the carbon dioxide emission of SHPs is to ensure the precise hydropower of SHPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although natural forest gaps could play important roles in the release of heavy metals from foliar litter by affecting the snow cover during the winter and solar irradiation during the growing season, few studies have examined these potential roles. The objectives of this study were to document changes in Pb and Cd dynamics during litter decomposition in the center of gaps and under closed canopies and to investigate the factors that controlled these changes during the winter and growing seasons. Methods Senesced foliar litter from six dominant species, including Kangding willow (Salix paraplesia), Masters larch (Larix mastersiana), Mingjiang fir (Abies faxoniana), Alpine azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), Red birch (Betula albosinensis) and Mourning cypress (Sabina saltuaria), was placed in litterbags and incubated between the gap center and closed canopy conditions in an alpine forest in the eastern region of the Tibetan Plateau. The litterbags were sampled at the snow formation stage, snow coverage stage, snow melt stage and during the growing season. The Pb and Cd concentrations in the sampled foliar litter were determined by acid digestion (HNO3/HClO4). Important findings Over one year of decomposition, Pb accumulation and Cd release from the foliar litter occurred, regardless of the foliar litter species. However, Pb and Cd were both released from the foliar litter during the winter and accumulated during the growing season. Compared with the gap center and the canopy gap edge, the extended gap edge and the closed canopy showed higher Pb and Cd release rates in winter and higher Pb and Cd accumulation rates during the growing season, respectively. Statistical analyses indicate that the dynamics of Pb were significantly influenced by frequent freeze-thaw cycles in winter and appropriate hydrothermal conditions during the growing season, the dynamics of Cd were strongly influenced by species and the presence of a forest gap at different decomposition stages. These results show that forest gaps could inhibit Pb and Cd release from foliar litter in the alpine forest of western Sichuan. In addition, a decrease in the snow depth in the winter warming scenario would promote the release of Pb during foliar litter decomposition. There exist some difference that may be influenced by litter quality, microenvironment and microtopography during litter decomposition.

On the contrary, little information is available on the prevalence and characterization of Cryptosporidium in wild animals in China, especially in giant pandas. The aim of the present study was to detect Cryptosporidium infections and identify Cryptosporidium species at the molecular level in both captive and wild giant pandas in Sichuan province, China. Findings: Using a PCR approach, we amplified and sequenced the 18S rRNA gene from 322 giant pandas fecal samples (122 from 122 captive individuals and 200 collected from four habitats) in Sichuan province, China. The Cryptosporidium species/genotypes were identified via a BLAST comparison against published Cryptosporidium sequences available in GenBank followed by phylogenetic analysis. The results revealed that both captive and wild giant pandas were infected with a single Cryptosporidium species, C. andersoni, at a prevalence of 15.6 % (19/122) and 0.5 % (1/200) in captive and wild giant pandas, respectively. Conclusions: The present study revealed the existence of C. andersoni in both captive and wild giant panda fecal samples for the first time, and also provided useful fundamental data for further research on the molecular epidemiology and control of Cryptosporidium infection in giant pandas.

Indica 9311 using Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). Both st1-2 and st1-3 mutants encoded the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase 1 (RNRS1), differed in the location of the mutated base, and displayed white-stripe from the L2 stage through maturity. The mutants were sensitive to temperature, and their chlorophyll content increased with the increase in temperature; however, they did not revert to normal green leaf phenotype under field conditions. The mutant st1-2 showed loosely arranged thylakoid lamellar structure as compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Contrastingly, st1-3 displayed normal thylakoid lamellar structure, good agronomic traits, and higher yield than st1-2 but lower yield than WT. Three-dimensional structure prediction for RNRS1 indicated that the mutation in Val-171 residue in st1-2 influenced the connection of RNRS1 to iron, causing abnormal development of chloroplasts. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels associated with chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and photosynthesis were affected in st1-2 and st1-3 at different temperatures and different developmental stages.

Understanding the virulence structure of and genetic variations in this pathogen is essential for disease control and for breeding resistance to wheat powdery mildew. This study investigated 17 pathogenic populations in Sichuan, China and classified 109 isolates into two distinct groups based on pathogenicity analysis: high virulence (HV, 92 isolates) and low virulence (LV, 17 isolates). Populations from Yibin (Southern region), Xichang (Western region), and Meishan (Middle region) showed lower virulence frequencies than populations from other regions. Many of the previously known resistance genes did not confer resistance in this study. The resistance gene Pm21 displayed an immune response to pathogenic challenge with all populations in Sichuan, and Pm13, Pm5b, Pm2+6, and PmXBD maintained resistance. AMOVA revealed significantly higher levels of variation within populations and lower levels of variation among populations within regions. High levels of gene flow were detected among populations in the four regions. Closely related populations within each region were distinguished by cluster analyses using ISSR and SRAP alleles. Both ISSR and SRAP allele profiling analyses revealed high levels of genetic diversity among pathogenic populations in Sichuan. Although ISSR and SRAP profiling analysis showed similar resolutions, the SRAP alleles appeared to be more informative. We did not detect any significant association between these alleles and the virulence or pathogenicity of the pathogen. Our results suggest that ISSR and SRAP alleles are more efficient for the characterization of small or closely related populations versus distantly related populations.

The stratification ratio (SR) can be an indicator of soil quality. This study was conducted to determine tillage effects on the profile distribution of certain soil properties in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) systems in the North China Plain (NCP). Three tillage treatments, including no till (NT), rotary tillage (RT), and plow tillage (PT), were established in 2001 in Luancheng County, Hebei Province. The concentration, storage, and SR of SOC and soil total nitrogen (TN) were assessed in both the wheat and maize seasons. Compared with RT and PT, the mean SRs for all depth ratios of SOC under NT increased by 7.85% and 30.61% during the maize season, and by 14.67% and 30.91% during the wheat season, respectively. The SR of TN for 0-5:30-50 cm increased by 140%, 161%, and 161% in the maize season, and 266%, 154%, and 122% in the wheat season compared to the SR for 0-5:5-10 cm under NT, RT and PT, respectively. The data indicated that SOC and TN were both concentrated in the surface-soil layers (0-10 cm) under NT but were distributed relatively evenly through the soil profile under PT. Meanwhile, the storage of SOC and TN was higher under NT for the surface soil (0-10 cm) but was higher under PT for the deeper soil (30-50 cm). Furthermore, the storage of SOC and TN was significantly related to SR of SOC and TN along the whole soil profile (P< 0.0001). Therefore, SR could be used to explain and indicate the changes in the storage of SOC and TN. Further, NT stratifies SOC and TN, enhances the topsoil SOC storage, and helps to improve SOC sequestration and soil quality.

Proteins from the tetraspanin family in parasites have recently become regarded as crucial molecules in interaction with hosts in parasitism and are therefore suitable for the development of vaccines and diagnostic agents. However, no information is available to date on E. granulosus tetraspanin. Methods: In this study, a uroplakin-I-like tetraspanin (Eg-TSP1) of E. granulosus was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The immunolocalization of Eg-TSP1 in different life stages of E. granulosus was determined using specific polyclonal antibody. The antibody and cytokine profiles of mice that immunized with recombinant Eg-TSP1 (rEg-TSP1) were measured for the immunogenicity analysis of this protein. Additionally, we use RNA interference method to explore the biological function of Eg-TSP1 in larva of E. granulosus. Results: Immunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous Eg-TSP1 mainly localized in the tegument of larvae and adults. Significantly elevated levels of antibodies IgG1 and IgG2a and of cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-12 were observed in the sera of mice after immunization with rEg-TSP1, suggesting a typical T helper (Th) 1-mediated immune response elicited by rEg-TSP1. On further probing the role of Eg-TSP1 in E. granulosus by RNA interference, we found that a thinner tegmental distal cytoplasm was induced in protoscoleces treated with siRNA-132 compared to controls. Conclusions: This is the first report characterizing a tetraspanin from the tapeworm E. granulosus. Our results suggest that Eg-TSP1 is associated with biogenesis of the tegument and maintenance of structural integrity of E. granulosus and could therefore be a candidate intervention target for control of hydatid disease.

Since the evolutionary history of this gene family across the eukaryotic kingdom remains unknown, we performed a comparative analysis of 2R-MYBs from 50 major eukaryotic lineages, with particular emphasis on land plants. A total of 1548 candidates were identified among diverse taxonomic groups, which allowed for an updated classification of 73 highly conserved subfamilies, including many newly identified subfamilies. Our results revealed that the protein architectures, intron patterns, and sequence characteristics were remarkably conserved in each subfamily. At least four subfamilies were derived from early land plants, 10 evolved from spermatophytes, and 19 from angiosperms, demonstrating the diversity and preferential expansion of this gene family in land plants. Moreover, we determined that their remarkable expansion was mainly attributed to whole genome and segmental duplication, where duplicates were preferentially retained within certain subfamilies that shared three homologous intron patterns (a, b, and c) even though up to 12 types of patterns existed. Through our integrated distributions, sequence characteristics, and phylogenetic tree analyses, we confirm that 2R-MYBs are old and postulate that 3R-MYBs may be evolutionarily derived from 2R-MYBs via intragenic domain duplication.

We investigated the impacts of population size and density on reproduction in more than 30 populations of Circaeaster agristis, a narrow endemic and threatened species, in 2010 and 2011. We also examined the effects of NND (nearest neighbor distance) and LNS (local neighbor size), within radii of 0.1 m, 0.2 m and 0.3 m, on reproduction in two of the populations in 2011. Results: Population size did not affect fruit (seed) number and fruit set in either year studied. Population density had an indirect negative effect on fruit number and fruit set as a consequence of a negative effect on plant size in 2010, but had no effect on fruit number and fruit set in 2011. Within populations, individual fruit number did not change, and individual fruit set increased independent of plant size, in response to increasing NND. Both individual fruit number and individual fruit set increased, independent of plant size, with increases in LNS within a 0.1 m radius, but did not change with increases in LNS within radii of between 0.1 m and 0.2 m radii or between 0.2 m and 0.3 m. Conclusions: The effect of habitat fragmentation on reproduction of C. agristis is scale-dependent. In contrast to the generally accepted idea that fragmentation reduces plant reproduction, reproductive success may increase in sparse populations or increase in response to decreases in LNS in C. agristis.

Although efforts have been made to protect this rare and endangered species through breeding and conservative biology, the long-term preservation of giant panda genome resources (gametes, tissues, organs, genomic libraries, etc.) is still a practical option. In this study, the giant panda skeletal muscle-derived cell line was successfully established via primary explants culture and cryopreservation techniques. The population doubling time of giant panda skeletal cells was approximately 33.8h, and this population maintained a high cell viability before and after cryopreservation (95.6% and 90.7%, respectively). The two skeletal muscle-specific genes SMYD1 and MYF6 were expressed and detected by RT-PCR in the giant panda skeletal muscle-derived cell line. Karyotyping analysis revealed that the frequencies of giant panda skeletal muscle cells showing a chromosome number of 2n=42 ranged from 90.6 approximate to 94.2%. Thus, the giant panda skeletal muscle-derived cell line provides a vital resource and material platform for further studies and is likely to be useful for the protection of this rare and endangered species.

However, the functional relationship between phyA and phyB is not fully understood under different kinds of light and in response to different intensities of such light. In this work, we compared hypocotyl elongation of the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant with the wild type, the phyA-211 and phyB-9 single mutants under different intensities of far-red (FR), red (R), blue (B) and white (W) light. We confirmed that phyA and phyB synergistically promote seedling de-etiolation in B-, B plus R-, W- and high R-light conditions. The correlation of endogenous ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) protein levels with the trend of hypocotyl elongation of all lines indicate that both phyA and phyB promote seedling photomorphogenesis in a synergistic manner in high-irradiance white light. Gene expression analyses of RBCS members and HY5 suggest that phyB and phyA act antagonistically on seedling development under FR light.

LPS is recognized by the toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 complex of mammalian immune cells and leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is a vital step to remove LPS from the proteins before use for therapeutic purpose. In this study, we constructed BL21 (DE3) msbB28 pagP38 mutant, which produces a penta-acylated LPS with reduced endotoxicity. The plasmids harboring pagL and/or lpxE were then introduced into this mutant to further modify the LPS. The new strain (S004) carrying plasmid pQK004 (pagL and lpxE) produced mono-phosphoryated tetra-acylated lipid A, which induces markedly less production of tumor necrosis factor- in the RAW264.7 and IL-12 in the THP1, but still retains ability to produce recombinant proteins. This study provides a strategy to decrease endotoxic activity of recombinant proteins purified from E. coli BL21 backgrounds and a feasible approach to modify lipid A structure for alternative purposes such as mono-phosphoryl lipid A (MPL) as vaccine adjuvants.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional value of RSM fermented by Aspergillus niger for growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 6 barrows (21.20 +/- 1.47 kg initial BW) fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were allotted to a repeated 3 x 3 Latin square with 3 diets and 3 periods per square to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA. A N-free diet and 2 diets containing RSM or FRSM as the only source of AA were formulated. Results indicated that there was no difference in AID and SID of CP and most AA between FRSM and RSM. However, the AID of 2 indispensable AA (Lys and Met) and 3 dispensable AA (Asp, Gly, and Tyr) were greater (P < 0.05) for FRSM than for RSM. The SID of only 2 dispensable AA (Gly and Tyr) were greater (P < 0.05) for FRSM than for RSM. In Exp. 2, 16 barrows (32.57 +/- 2.67 kg initial BW) were allotted to 2 diets formulated to contain RSM or FRSM as the sole source of P to determine the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P. The ATTD and standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of P in FRSM were 72.10 and 77.31%, respectively. These values were greater (P < 0.01) than in RSM (34.79 and 41.34%, respectively). In Exp. 3, 24 growing barrows (32.23 +/- 1.33 kg initial BW) were fed 3 diets with 8 replicate pigs per diet to measure concentration of DE and ME of FRSM. A corn diet consisting of 98.40% corn was formulated and 2 additional diets were formulated by mixing corn with 35% RSM or FRSM. The DE and ME in FRSM (2,887 and 2,650 kcal/kg of DM, respectively) were greater (P < 0.05) than those in RSM (2,609 and 2,328 kcal/kg of DM, respectively). In summary, solid-state fermentation of RSM by A. niger has a greater nutritional value than RSM and is a promising alternative high-quality protein source.

Pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: 1) CON (control; a basal diet), 2) SDPP (containing 5% SDPP), 3) SDPP + SDCP (containing 2.5% SDPP and 2.5% SDCP), and 4) SDCP (containing 5% SDCP). Six pigs from each treatment were randomly selected to collect serum and intestinal samples. Compared with the CON group, both the SDPP and the SDPP + SDCP groups improved final BW of pigs (P < 0.05), but there were no differences among the SDPP, SDPP + SDCP, and SDCP groups. From d 1 to 14 and d 15 to 28, pigs fed the SDPP and SDPP + SDCP diets had a greater (P < 0.05) ADG than pigs fed the CON diet. During the overall period, both ADG and ADFI of pigs in the SDPP and SDPP + SDCP groups were improved (P < 0.05) compared with pigs in the CON group. Furthermore, pigs fed diets con-taining SDPP or SDCP had a greater (P < 0.05) apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of CP, ether extract, Ca, and ash and less (P < 0.05) incidence of diarrhea than pigs fed the CON diet. However, no differences were observed for ATTD and diarrhea incidence between the SDPP and SDCP groups. Compared with the CON group, duodenal villus height and the ratio of villi to crypt were increased (P < 0.05) in the SDPP, SDPP + SDCP, and SDCP groups and jejunal crypt depth was decreased in the SDPP + SDCP and SDCP groups (P < 0.05). Pigs in the SDPP group had greater (P < 0.05) activities of amylase, maltase, and trypsin than pigs in the CON group. However, no significant differences were observed between the SDCP and SDPP groups. Additionally, inclusion of SDCP in diet decreased (P < 0.05) the population of Escherichia coli. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the addition of SDCP in pigs' diet had an effect similar to SDPP on improving growth performance through the promotion of the small intestinal development, increasing digestive enzymes activities, enhancing ATTD of nutrients, and decreasing diarrhea incidence.

The bulbus of Fritillaria unibracteata var. wabuerzsis (FUW) was officially recorded in the National Pharmacopoeia of China (2010 edition) as one of the sources of BFC because of its positive therapeutic effects and few side effects. The endophytic fungus strain 6WBY3 was isolated from the fresh bulbus of FUW that had been cultivated for six years. Based on morphological methods and the phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, this strain was identified as Fusarium redolens. Using color reaction analysis, high performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD), and mass spectrometry (MS), it was demonstrated that F. redolens 6WBY3 could produce peimisine and imperialine-3 beta-D-glucoside, similar to its host plant. The yields of peimisine and imperialine-3 beta-D-glucoside were 16.0 mu g.I-1 and 18.8 mu g.I-1, respectively, in one week of culture. These results indicate that F. redolens 6WBY3 is a promising candidate for the large scale production of peimisine and imperialine-3 beta-D-glucoside. In addition, the results from the strain 6WBY3 lay the foundation for further study into the mechanism of Fritillaria alkaloids biosynthesis in fungi. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, the porcine (Sus scrofa) homologue of the Enho gene, which was named pEnho, was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using oligonucleotide primers derived from in silico sequences. The gene sequence was submitted into the GenBank of NCBI, and the access number is GQ414763. The pEnho encodes a protein of 76 amino acids which shows 75% similarity to Homo sapiens adropin. The expression profile of pEnho in tissues (liver, muscle, anterior jejunum, posterior jejunum, and ileum) was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. pEnho was localized on porcine chromosome 10 and no introns were found. In conclusion, pEnho was cloned and analysed with the aim of increasing knowledge about glucose and lipid metabolism in piglets and helping to promote the health and growth of piglets through adropin regulation.

Several commonly used thermodynamic models, including the ideal solution model, the modified Apelblat equation and the Buchowski-Ksiazaczak lambda h equation, were applied to correlate the experimental solubility data. The experimental results show that the solubility increases with the increasing temperature, and the highest solubility is in methanol, the lowest in pure water. Results of these measurements were well-correlated with the three equations above, but the modified Apelblat equation is more suitable in regressing the solubility data of diphenoxylate. Through the Vant Hoff equation, the enthalpy and the entropy in different solvents can be calculated.

The aim of this study was to understand the effect of PAs (0.1, 1.0 g/L) on growth and alcoholic fermentation of 2 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commercial strain FREDDO and newly selected strain BH8) during copper-stress fermentation, using a simple model fermentation system. Our results showed that both PAs and Cu2+ could pose significant inhibition effects on the growth of yeast cells, CO2 release, sugar consumption, and ethanol production during the initial phase of the fermentation. Compared to PAs, Cu2+ performed more obvious inhibition on the yeast growth and fermentation. However, adding 1.0 g/L PAs increased in the vitality and metabolism activity of yeast cells at the mid-exponential phase of fermentation in the mediums with no copper and 0.1 mM Cu2+ added, shortened the period of wine fermentation, and decreased the copper residues. It indicated that PAs could improve the ability of wine yeast to resist detrimental effects under copper-stress fermentation condition, maintaining cells metabolic activity, and fermentation could be controlled by manipulating PAs supplementation. Practical Application Proanthocyanidins (PAs) derived from the grape's skin, grape seeds, and grape stems, could be macerated into wine during winemaking. PAs have been reported to have many beneficial biological activities. These experimental findings suggested PAs could improve the ability of wine yeast to resist detrimental effects of copper. Therefore, it will be helpful for further research on the mechanism of the beneficial effects of PAs on wine yeast under multiple stresses during winemaking.

In this study, we assessed genetic variability and genetic structure of E. granulosus in the Tibet plateau, using the complete mitochondrial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene for the first time. We collected and sequenced 62 isolates of E. granulosus from 3 populations in the Tibet plateau. A BLAST analysis indicated that 61 isolates belonged to E. granulosus sensu stricto (genotypes G1-G3), while one isolate belonged to E. canadensis (genotype G6). We detected 16 haplotypes with a haplotype network revealing a star-like expansion, with the most common haplotype occupying the center of the network. Haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were low, while negative values were observed for Tajima's D and Fu's Fs. AMOVA results and Fst values revealed that the three geographic populations were not genetically differentiated. Our results suggest that a population bottleneck or population expansion has occurred in the past, and that this explains the low genetic variability of E. granulosus in the Tibet Plateau.

Silencing of GhNPR1 in Gladiolus results in an enhanced susceptibility to Curvularia gladioli. We propose that GhNPR1 plays important roles in plant immunity. Abstract Gladiolus plants and corms are susceptible to various types of pathogens including fungi, bacteria and viruses. Understanding the innate defense mechanism in Gladiolus is a prerequisite for the development of new protection strategies. The non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (NPR1) and bzip transcription factor TGA2 play a key role in regulating salicylic acid (SA)-mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In this study, the homologous genes, GhNPR1 and GhTGA2, were isolated from Gladiolus and functionally characterized. Expression of GhNPR1 exhibited a 3.8-fold increase in Gladiolus leaves following salicylic acid treatment. A 1332 bp fragment of the GhNPR1 promoter from Gladiolus hybridus was identified. Inducibility of the GhNPR1 promoter by SA was demonstrated using transient expression assays in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. The GhNPR1 protein is located in the nucleus and cytomembrane. GhNPR1 interacts with GhTGA2, as observed using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation system. Overexpression of GhNPR1 in an Arabidopsis npr1 mutant can restore its basal resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Silencing of GhNPR1, using a tobacco rattle virus-based silencing vector, resulted in an enhanced susceptibility to Curvularia gladioli. In conclusion, these results suggest that GhNPR1 plays a pivotal role in the SA-dependent systemic acquired resistance in Gladiolus.

In this study, we examined the impact of commonly encountered temperature abuse scenarios on the proliferation of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocyto genes on fresh-cut cantaloupe. Inoculated fresh-cut cantaloupe cubes were subjected to various temperature abuse conditions, and the growth of S. enterica and L. monocyto genes was determined. During 1 week of storage, Salmonella cell counts on fresh-cut cantaloupe increased by -0.26, 1.39, and 2.23 log units at 4 degrees C (control), 8 degrees C, and 12 degrees C (chronic temperature abuse), respectively, whereas that of L. monocytogenes increased by 0.75, 2.86, and 4.17 log units. Under intermittent temperature abuse conditions, where storage temperature fluctuated twice daily to room temperature for 30 min, Salmonella cell count increased by 2.18 log units, whereas that of L. monocytogenes increased by 1.86 log units. In contrast, terminal acute temperature abuses for 2 to 4 h resulted in upwards to 0.6 log unit for Salmonella, whereas the effect on L. monocyto genes was less significant compared with L. monocytogenes on cut cantaloupe stored at 4 degrees C. Significant deterioration of produce visual quality and tissue integrity, as reflected by electrolyte leakage, was also observed under various temperature abuse conditions.

The typical feature of this disease is that the fungal pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens (Uv) specifically infects rice flower and forms false smut ball, the ustiloxin-containing ball-like fungal colony, of which the size is usually several times larger than that of a mature rice seed. However, the underlying mechanisms of Uv-rice interaction are poorly understood. Here, we applied time-course microscopic and transcriptional approaches to investigate rice responses to Uv infection. The results demonstrated that the flower-opening process and expression of associated transcription factors, including ARF6 and ARF8, were inhibited in Uv-infected spikelets. The ovaries in infected spikelets were interrupted in fertilization and thus were unable to set seeds. However, a number of grain-filling-related genes, including seed storage protein genes, starch anabolism genes and endosperm-specific transcription factors (RISBZ1 and RPBF), were highly transcribed as if the ovaries were fertilized. In addition, critical defense-related genes like NPR1 and PR1 were downregulated by Uv infection. Our data imply that Uv may hijack host nutrient reservoir by activation of the grain-filling network because of growth and formation of false smut balls.

Polyploidization provided niches for rigorous genome modification at cytogenetic, genetic, and epigenetic levels, rendering a broader spread than its progenitors. This review summarizes the latest advances in understanding gene regulation mechanisms in newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat and possible correlation with polyploid growth vigor and adaptation. Cytogenetic studies reveal persistent association of whole-chromosome aneuploidy with nascent allopolyploids, in contrast to the genetic stability in common wheat. Transcriptome analysis of the euploid wheat shows that small RNAs are driving forces for homoeo-allele expression regulation via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The ensuing non-additively expressed genes and those with expression level dominance to the respective progenitor may play distinct functions in growth vigor and adaptation in nascent allohexaploid wheat. Further genetic diploidization of allohexaploid wheat is not random. Regional asymmetrical gene distribution, rather than subgenome dominance, is observed in both synthetic and natural allohexaploid wheats. The combinatorial effects of diverged genomes, subsequent selection of specific gene categories, and subgenome-specific traits are essential for the successful establishment of common wheat.

Transposon position effects are now hypothesized to balance the expression of networked genes and provide spring-like tension between pericentromeric heterochromatin and microtubules. The balance (coordination) of gene expression and centromere movement is under selection. Our hypothesis states that this balance can be maintained by many or few transposons about equally well. We explain known balanced distributions of junk DNA within genomes and between subgenomes in allopolyploids (and our hypothesis passes "the onion test'' for any so-called solution to the C-value paradox). Importantly, when the allotetraploid maize chromosomes delete redundant genes, their nearby transposons are also lost; this result is explained if transposons near genes function. The Genome Balance Hypothesis is hypothetical because the position effect mechanisms implicated are not proved to apply to all junk DNA, and the continuous nature of the centromeric and gene position effects have not yet been studied as a single phenomenon.

Six Rongchang and six Landrace barrows were slaughtered at 161 days of age. Subsequently, meat quality traits and gene expression levels in LM were observed. Results showed that Rongchang pigs not only exhibited greater pH, CIE a*(24 h) and intramuscular fat content but also exhibited lower body weight, carcass weight, dressing percentage, LM area and CIE b*(24 h) compared with Landrace pigs (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the mRNA expression levels of the lipogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase) and fatty acid uptake (lipoprotein lipase)-related genes were greater in the Rongchang (P<0.05), whereas the lipolysis (adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase) and fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1B)-related genes were better expressed in the Landrace. Moreover, compared with the Landrace, the mRNA expression levels of MyHCI, MyHCIIa and MyHCIIx were greater, whereas the mRNA expression levels of MyHCIIb were lower in the Rongchang pigs (P<0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of PGC-1 were greater in Rongchang pigs than in the Landrace (P<0.05), which can partly explain the differences in MyHC isoform gene expressions between Rongchang and Landrace pigs. Although the small number of samples does not allow to obtain a definitive conclusion, we can suggest that Rongchang pigs possess better meat quality, and the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the better meat quality in fatty pigs may be partly due to the higher mRNA expression levels of lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake-related genes, as well as the oxidative and intermediate muscle fibers, and due to the lower mRNA expression levels of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation-related genes, as well as the glycolytic muscle fibers.

However, the effect of these membrane polymers on paddy soil is unknown. A soil incubation experiment was conducted using Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy to monitor the changes in the polymer-coated membranes in paddy soil, and Biolog EcoPlates and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were used to detect the effects of the membranes on soil bacterial community profiles. Compared to unmodified membranes, the biodegradation rate of the biochar-modified membrane was slower, and the membrane was more intact, which improved and guaranteed the controlled release of nutrients. Compared to the soil without membranes, the biochar-modified membranes, as well as unmodified ones, showed no significant impacts on the composition diversity of soil dominant bacterial community. The activity and functional diversity of soil culturable microbial community during the early stage of incubation were reduced by biochar-modified membranes due to the release of small amount of soluble organic materials but were both recovered in the 12(th) month of the incubation period. Therefore, the biochar-modified waterborne polyacrylate was environmentally friendly, demonstrating its potential both in the development of coated controlled-release fertilizers and in the utilization of crop residue.

Maize is a very important cereal crop that is grown widely throughout the world. However, many genes and gene family members involved in terpenoid biosynthesis are still unknown in maize. Through systematic analysis, 43 isoprenoid diphosphate biosynthesis-related genes were identified. These genes are members of 15 families, which encode all of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the universal isoprene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate. Using a comprehensive approach, the intron/exon structures and their responses to jasmonic acid treatment were investigated. Meta-analysis revealed that some of the genes show differential, organ-specific expression patterns in the 60 different developmental stages of maize. It was found that all 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway genes present the same expression patterns which were highly expressed in leaves and showed the lowest expression in seed. All investigated MEP pathway enzymes are localized in plastids by transient assay using Arabidopsis cells. In addition, some of the enzymes, such as acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, are encoded by multiple gene members with different expression patterns, and both homomeric and heteromeric geranyl diphosphate synthases exist in maize. The results reveal the complexity of terpenoid biosynthesis and the existence of metabolic channels for diverse terpenoids in maize.

Here, a novel R2R3-type MYB gene, designated FtMYB12, was isolated from the cultivated tartary buckwheat F. tataricum. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the FtMYB12 was greatly induced by low temperature. Sub-localization and yeast transactivity assay demonstrated that the FtMYB12 gene encodes a nuclear transcription activator. Overexpression of FtMYB12 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced cold tolerance. The FtMYB12 overexpressing Arabidopsis lines showed higher root length and had elevated levels of proline content and lower levels of malondialdehyde under cold stress conditions compared to the wild-type plants. The results revealed that FtMYB12 may play an essential role in regulation of cold stress-responsive signaling in F. tataricum.

Nine hundred 15-d-old ducks were randomly allocated to 5 treatments with 10 cages/treatment and 18 ducks/cage on the basis of BW. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric experimental diets were formulated on a digestible amino acid basis to produce diets in which 0% (without FG), 25% (36mg FG/kg), 50% (75mg FG/kg), 75% (111 mg FG/kg), and 100% (153 mg FG/kg) of protein from soybean meal were replaced by that from CSM. Increasing dietary FG content, BW, and ADG decreased (linearly, P < 0.05, except for ADG of days 29 to 35), and F/G linearly increased (P < 0.05). At 35 d, blood hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration linearly decreased (P < 0.05), while serum total protein, albumin, and globulin content linearly decreased (P < 0.05), and the residue of gossypol in liver, kidney, heart, breast, and leg muscle linearly increased (P < 0.001) with increases in dietary FG concentration. Ducks fed 36 mg FG/kg (5.83% CSM of diet) diet had a normal histological structure of liver, and muscle (breast and leg) had no residue of gossypol. The maximum limit of dietary FG concentration was estimated to range from a low of 36 mg/kg to maximize serum globulin concentration to a high of 124 mg/kg to minimize feed intake for 22 to 28d on the basis of a quadratic broken-line model.

FINGERLINGS; PHORBOL ESTERS; TOXICITY; ENZYMES; PROTEIN	The study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing soybean meal (SBM) with different levels of detoxified Jatropha curcas kernel meal (DJKM) in growing pig diets on growth performance, haemato-immunological and histopathological parameters. A total of 144 pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) with initial body weight of (20.47 +/- 1.44) kg, were randomly allocated to 6 dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment and 4 pigs per replication for a period of 79 days. The 6 diets (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 and D6) were formulated using DJKM to replace 0%, 15%, 30%, 45%, 60% and 75% SBM protein and contained phorbol esters (PEs) of 0, 2.75, 5.50, 8.25, 11.00, 13.75 mg/kg diets. At d 29, pigs in 3 replicates in 06 treatment were offered D1 diet (expressed as D6 + D1) to examine the residual effect of diet D6 in a re-feeding trial. From d1 to 79 of experimental period, pigs fed diets D4, D5 and 06 had significantly lower average daily gain, average daily feed intake and gain-to-feed ratio than those fed diet D1 (P<0.05). However, the negative effect of diet D6 was disappeared after two weeks of feeding diet D1 in the re-feeding trial. In addition, pigs offered diets D5 and D6 had significantly higher activities of serum alkaline phosphatase, but lower serum alanine transaminase when compared with pigs given diet D1 (P<0.05). Moreover, pathological alterations in liver were observed in pigs fed diets D3, 04, 05 and D6 relative to D1. There results indicate that DJKM could be used to replace SBM protein up to 30% with no detrimental impacts on growth performance, haemato-immunological and pathological parameters in growing pig diet.

Here, we report the isolation of multiple BPSV strains coinfecting a single animal. Whole-genome analysis of isolated BPSV strains revealed genomic variability likely affecting virus virulence and infectivity. Further, incongruent phylogenetic relationships between viruses suggested genomic recombination.

A whole-genome linkage map of T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum was constructed for a population of 186 recombinant inbred lines using 645 diversity array technology (DArT) markers, 127 simple sequence repeat markers and three R-1 genotyping markers. Seed dormancy was evaluated at five post-ripening stages from 2010 to 2013. Comprehensive quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping by inclusive composite interval mapping analysis identified seven QTLs for seed dormancy, designated as Qsd.sau-1B, Qsd.sau-3A, Qsd.sau-3B, Qsd.sau-3D, Qsd.sau-4A1, Qsd.sau-4A2, and Qsd.sau-7A, on chromosomes 1BL, 3AL, 3BL, 3DL, 4AS, 4AL, and 7AL, which explained 8.9, 7.2, 10.8, 7.0, 11.4, 9.4, and 12.7 % of phenotypic variation, respectively. Qsd.sau-4A1 and Qsd.sau-7A have only rarely been reported in domesticated common wheat but were prominent in T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum accession Q1028.

Fermentation occurs in cellars lined with pit mud containing microbes. The identity and community diversity of bacteria in pit mud of fermentation cellars contributes to the aromatic compounds of the liquor. In order to determine the contribution of genus Clostridium to this fermentation, the community diversity of Clostridium cluster I in pit mud of different cellar ages (1, 50, 100, and 400 years) was investigated based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Differences in the community structure within pit mud depended on wall and bottom layer cellar locations. A better understanding of the role of Clostridium in Luzhou-flavor liquor manufacture will be useful.

The cell-mediated immunity is very important in eliminating the intracellular antigens. Expression of CD4 and CD8 on T cell surface is essential for cell-mediated immune defence and T-cell development. However, the ontogeny of T lymphocytes in waterfowl is scarce and fragmentary. To address these questions, here we report the development and tissues distribution of CD4 and CD8 alpha in goose embryo, gosling and goose by immunocytochemistry assay using monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, the age-related mRNA level of goose CD4 and CD8 alpha in different immune tissues were study by real time quantitative PCR. Our results suggested that the high expression of CD4 and CD8 alpha were readily found in thymus, which peaked at the first week post-hatch. And the highest expression level of CD4 and CD8 alpha were detected in bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, spleen and intestine at the second week, after that the expression level were gradually decreased. Interestingly, the remarkably high expression of CD4 and CD8 alpha in Harderian gland were detected at the first week, which is about hundreds times more than that in other tissues. Our findings demonstrated that the development and the distribution of CD4 and CD8 alpha are partly changed in an age-related way. Moreover, the histological morphogenesis of immune tissues were also discussed. Our results may shed lights on the better understand of T-cell mediate immunity in goose. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Both soil productivity and fertilizer applications affect crop yields. A long-term experiment with a winter wheat-summer maize rotation was established in 1989 in a field of the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station, a region typical of the North China Plain, including seven treatments: 1) a balanced application of NPK chemical fertilizers (NPK); 2) application of organic fertilizer (OM); 3) application of 50% organic fertilizer and 50% NPK chemical fertilizers (1/2OMN); 4) application of NP chemical fertilizers (NP); 5) application of PK chemical fertilizer (PK); 6) application of NK chemical fertilizers (NK); and 7) unfertilized control (CK). To investigate the effects of fertilization practices on soil productivity, further pot tests were conducted in 2007-2008 using soil samples from the different fertilization treatments of the long-term field experiment. The soil sample of each treatment of the long-term experiment was divided into three pots to grow wheat: with no fertilization (Pot(unf)), with balanced NPK fertilization (Pot(NPK)), and with the same fertilizer(s) of the long-term field experiment (Pot(ori)). The fertilized soils of the field experiment used in all the pot tests showed a higher wheat grain yield and higher nutrient uptake levels than the unfertilized soil. Soil productivity of the treatments of the field experiment after 18 years of continuous fertilizer applications were ranked in the order of OM > 1/2OMN > NPK > NP > PK > NK > CK. The contribution of soil productivity of the different treatments of the field experiment to the wheat grain yield of Pot(ori) was 36.0%-76.7%, with the PK and NK treatments being higher than the OM, 1/2OMN, NPK, and NP treatments since the soil in this area was deficient in N and P and rich in K. Wheat grain yields of Pot(NPK) were higher than those of Pot(ori) and Pot(unf). The N, P, and K use efficiencies were higher in Pot(NPK) than Potori and significantly positively correlated with wheat grain yield. Soil organic matter could be a better predictor of soil productivity because it correlated more strongly than other nutrients with the wheat grain yield of Pot(unf). Wheat yields of Pot(NPK) showed a similar trend to those of Pot(unf), indicating that soil productivity improvement was essential for a further increase in crop yield. The long-term applications of both organic and chemical fertilizers were capable of increasing soil productivity on the North China Plain, but the former was more effective than the latter. The balanced application of NPK chemical fertilizers not only increased soil productivity, but also largely increased crop yields, especially in soils with lower productivity. Thus, such an approach should be a feasible practice for the sustainable use of agricultural soils on the North China Plain, particularly when taking into account crop yields, labor costs, and the limited availability of organic fertilizers.

Tolerance vs. avoidance: two strategies of soybean (Glycine max) seedlings in response to shade in intercropping	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						biomass partitioning; gas exchange; leaf structure; monocropping; palisade mesophyll; stem elongation	CO2 DIFFUSION; RAIN-FOREST; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LIGHT; PLANTS; LEAF; NITROGEN; YIELD; WHEAT; SUN	Intercropping is a sustainable agricultural practice used worldwide for highly efficient utilization of resources. However, short crops often grow under the shade of the canopy of tall crops in intercropping systems. Plants evolved two main strategies to deal with shade: avoidance and tolerance. Soybean (Glycine max), a legume crop, is often planted in intercropping. But little is known about a strategy that soybean may employ to deal with shade at seedling stage. Therefore, we determined morphological and physiological traits related to shade tolerance and shade avoidance in seedlings of two varieties. Generally, both varieties showed similar shade tolerance traits, such as increased specific leaf area and chlorophyll (Chl) content, and reduced photosynthetic capacity and the Chl a/b ratio. The light-limiting environment eliminated the benefits of shade tolerance traits for the carbon gain, which led to similar real-time photosynthesis and biomass in intercropping. By contrast, two varieties expressed different changes in shade avoidance traits. The variety Guixia 3 exhibited clear preference of shade avoidance that resulted in a high main stem, hypocotyl elongation, and biomass allocation towards the stem. The variety Gongxuan 1 showed those traits less. We suggested that the genetic variation occurs within soybean, thus the shade avoidance related traits might be important for variety selection for intercropping. Hence, the evaluation of performance should focus on shade avoidance in soybean genotypes in future experiments.	[Gong, W. Z.; Wu, Y. S.; Chen, H. H.; Liu, W. Y.; Yang, W.

Jian). Fish were fed the basal (control) and glutamine-supplemented (12.0 g glutamine kg(-1) diet) diets for 6 weeks. Results indicated that the dietary glutamine supplementation improved the growth performance, spleen protein content, serum complement 3 content, and lysozyme activity in fish. In the spleen, glutamine down-regulated the expression of the interleukin 1 and interleukin 10 genes, and increased the level of phosphorylation of TOR protein. In the head kidney, glutamine down-regulated the tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10 gene expressions, phosphorylated and total TOR protein levels, while up-regulated the transforming growth factor beta 2 gene expression. Furthermore, the protein carbonyl content was decreased in the spleen of fish fed glutamine-supplemented diet; conversely, the anti-hydroxyl radical capacity and glutathione content in the spleen were increased by glutamine. However, diet supplemented with glutamine did not affect the lipid peroxidation, anti-superoxide anion capacity, and antioxidant enzyme activities in the spleen. Moreover, all of these antioxidant parameters in the head kidney were not affected by glutamine. Results from the present experiment showed the importance of dietary supplementation of glutamine in benefaction of the growth performance and several components of the innate immune system, and the deferential role in cytokine gene expression, TOR kinase activity, and antioxidant status between the spleen and head kidney of juvenile Jian carp.

Fish were fed a basal diet or basal diet plus 4.0, 8.0, 16.0 and 32.0 g kg(-1) OKGM for 60 days. The results indicated that WGR and SGR were significantly higher in fish fed 8.0 and 16.0 g kg(-1) OKGM diets (P < 0.05) than those in fish fed basal diet, and PER was significantly higher and FCR was significantly lower in fish fed 16.0 g kg(-1) OKGM diet (P < 0.05). The content of body protein, lipid and moisture was affected by the OKGM diets. The light and electron microscopy demonstrated that intestinal morphology of fish fed 8.0 and 16.0 g kg(-1) OKGM diet was better (P < 0.05) than the control group, including mucosa fold height, mucosal epithelial height, submucosa height, longitudinal muscularis thickness and circular muscularis thickness. Compared with the control group, fish fed 32.0 g kg(-1) OKGM diet showed significantly lower goblet cell number in anterior intestine (P < 0.05). Furthermore, intestinal microflora was analyzed by PCR-DGGE, and the results showed that OKGM diets also significantly modulated the intestinal microflora of fish (P < 0.05). The study clearly demonstrates that OKGM could enhance the growth performance, improve intestinal morphology and modulate intestinal microflora of S. prenanti, and the optimal dietary OKGM levels was suggested to be 16.0 g kg(-1).

After removal of the carbon layer the recovered Zhennan exhibited a dark green color, which differed from the yellow color of the living samples. Low molecular weight components (including hot-water and toluene-alcohol extractives), hemicellulose, and 1 % NaOH solubility in the recovered wood were greatly degraded. Degradation of cellulose was minor. Moreover, the ancient wood had somewhat more klason lignin than the modern wood. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis gave further evidence on the differences in chemical components. According to the GC-MS results, naphthalene derivatives were detected in the essential oils from both the modern and recovered wood. The delicate fragrance of the modern and recovered wood may be attributed to the aromatic constituents as identified by GC-MS.

Mass and chemical component concentrations, including organic carbon, elemental carbon, and inorganic ions (F-, Cl-, NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, C2O42-, PO43-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+), of PM2.5 aerosols were measured. The average PM2.5 concentrations for 24 h were 72.42, 104.89, 20.55, and 29.19 mu g/m(3) at BM, PZ, GG, and WL, respectively. Organic matter accounted for 38.0-49.3%, while elemental carbon accounted for 2.0-5.7% of PM2.5 mass. The sum concentrations of SO42-, NH4+, and NO(3)(-)accounted for 23.0%, 17.4%, 22.1%, and 30.5% of PM2.5 mass at BM, PZ, GG, and WL, respectively. Soil dust was also an important source of PM2.5, accounting for 6.3%, 17.0%, 10.4%, and 19.1% of PM2.5 mass at BM, PZ, GG, and WL, respectively. These reconstructed masses accounted for 75.9-102.0% of PM2.5 mass from the four forest areas of SW China.

Past studies indicated that polymorphisms of the Perilipin gene (PLIN1) are highly associated with adiposity in mammals and are potential molecular markers for improving meat quality and carcass traits in chickens. In the present study, we screened single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all exons of the PLIN1 gene with a direct sequencing method in six populations with different genetic backgrounds (total 240 individuals). We evaluated the association between the polymorphisms and carcass and meat quality traits. We identified three SNPs, located on the 5' flanking region and exon 1 of PLIN1 on chromosome 10 (rs315831750, rs313726543, and rs80724063, respectively). Eight main haplotypes were constructed based on these SNPs. We calculated the allelic and genotypic frequencies, and genetic diversity parameters of the three SNPs. The polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.2768 to 0.3750, which reflected an intermediate genetic diversity for all chickens. The CC, CT, and TT genotypes influenced the percentage of breast muscle (PBM), percentage of leg muscle (PLM) and percentage of abdominal fat at rs315831750 (p<0.05). Diplotypes (haplotype pairs) affected the percentage of eviscerated weight (PEW) and PBM (p<0.05). Compared with chickens carrying other diplotypes, H3H7 had the greatest PEW and H2H2 had the greatest PBM, and those with diplotype H7H7 had the smallest PEW and PBM. We conclude that PLIN1 gene polymorphisms may affect broiler carcass and breast muscle yields, and diplotypes H3H7 and H2H2 could be positive molecular markers to enhance PEW and PBM in chickens.

In the present study, we performed candidate gene analysis to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the MyoD, Myf5, MyoG, and Mrf4 genes using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism in 360 Erlang Mountain Chickens from three different housing systems (cage, pen, and free-range). The general linear model procedure was used to estimate the statistical significance of association between combined genotypes and muscle fiber traits of chickens. Two polymorphisms (g.39928301T>G and g.11579368C>T) were detected in the Mrf4 and MyoD gene, respectively. The diameters of thigh and pectoralis muscle fibers were higher in birds with the combined genotypes of GG-TT and TT-CT (p<0.05). Moreover, the interaction between housing system and combined genotypes has no significant effect on the traits of muscle fiber (p>0.05). Our findings suggest that the combined genotypes of TT-CT and GG-TT might be advantageous for muscle fiber traits, and could be the potential genetic markers for breeding program in Erlang Mountain Chickens.

Pigs were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments: i) control (C), basal diet, ii) C+1,000 mg/kg benzoic acid+100 mg/kg thymol (BT1), iii) C+1,000 mg/kg benzoic acid+200 mg/kg thymol (BT2) and, iv) C+2,000 mg/kg benzoic acid+100 mg/kg thymol (BT3). Relative to the control, pigs fed diet BT3 had lower diarrhoea score during the overall period (p<0.10) and improved feed to gain ratio between days 1 to 14 (p<0.05), which was accompanied by improved apparent total tract digestibility of ether extract, Ca and crude ash (p<0.05), and larger lipase, lactase and sucrose activities in the jejunum (p<0.05) at d 14 and d 42. Similarly, relative to the control, pigs fed diet BT3 had higher counts for Lactobacillus spp in digesta of ileum at d 14 (p<0.05), and pigs fed diets BT1, BT2, or BT3 also had higher counts of Bacillus spp in digesta of caecum at d 14 (p<0.05), and lower concentration of ammonia nitrogen in digesta of caecum at d 14 and d 42 (p<0.05). Finally, pigs fed diet BT3 had higher concentration of butyric acid in digesta of caecum at d 42 (p<0.05), and a larger villus height:crypt depth ratio in jejunum and ileum at d 14 (p<0.05) than pigs fed the control diet. In conclusion, piglets fed diet supplementation with different concentrations/combinations of benzoic acid and thymol could improve feed efficiency and diarrhoea, and improve gut microfloral composition. The combination of 2,000 mg/kg benzoic acid+100 mg/kg thymol produced better effects than other treatments in most measurements.

In this study, four novel genes SnRK2s:TpSnRK2.11, TpSnRK2.2, TpSnRK2.5, and TpSnRK2.10 from dwarf Polish wheat (Triticum polonicum L.) were characterized and classified into three groups. TpSnRK2.5 and TpSnRK2.11 were members of group 1; TpSnRK2.2 was member of group 2; TpSnRK2.10 belonged to group 3. The expression of TpSNRK2.2 was strongly regulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaCl, and cold in roots and leaves, as well as by ABA in leaves. The transcript of TpSnRK2.5 was intensely induced by all the treatments in roots and leaves. The distinct expression patterns of TpSnRK2.10 indicate that this gene was very sensitive to ABA and NaCl, less sensitive to cold and PEG. The transcript of TpSnRK2.11 was activated significantly by PEG, NaCl, and cold, but weakly by ABA. Our results indicate that these four genes were probably involved in wheat responses to different abiotic stresses in different tissues.

However, the functional role of PYY in the appetite regulatory of fish is not clear. In this study, we characterized a high conservation of PYY cDNA and found high expression levels of PYY mRNA in the brain and digestive tract of Siberian sturgeon. Then, we examined preprandial (pre- and post-feeding) changes of PYY mRNA expression in the brain that showed a significantly increased in 3 h post-feeding, suggesting an anorectic possible function of PYY in Siberian sturgeon. Next, we examined the expression of PYY mRNA during 15 days fasting and refeed after fasting. The SsPYY mRNA expression of unfed fish had a significant 2.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.2, and 2.1-fold decrease compared to 1-, 3-, 6-, 10- and 15-day ad libitum fed animals, respectively. After refeed, SsPYY mRNA significantly increased 1.9 and 4.1-fold above that of the 15-day fed and unfed fish control group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, a single intraperitoneal injection of 10,100 and 200 ng/g BW SsPYY1-36 caused a reduction in the next feeding and no significant reduction in food intake was observed in fish injected with a 1 ng/g BW. Overall, PYY has a potentially role in food intake attenuation of Siberian sturgeon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the lack of a cell culture system for propagating DuCV, little is known regarding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of DuCV. The aim of this study was to describe the construction and initial in vivo characterization of full-length DNA clones of DuCV (pIC-Mu2DuCV) and its infectivity under in vivo conditions. Method: The constructed pIC-Mu2DuCV contained two copies of the whole DuCV genome and an introduced Xho I restriction enzyme site. Eighty-one 10-day-old conventional ducklings that were free of DuCV were randomly divided equally into three groups (1, 2 and 3). The ducklings in groups 1, 2 and 3 were inoculated intramuscularly with pIC-Mu2DuCV, wild-type virus GH01 and PBS, respectively. Subsequently, all of the ducklings were examined clinically, which were each given a physical condition score, and their rectal temperatures were taken daily during the experimental period. DuCV genomes in serum samples and in various tissues from all of the ducklings at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 21 and 28 DPC were detected by PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Results: The average daily weight gain (ADWG) of group 3 was significantly higher than those of groups 1 and 2, and the temperature of all ducklings was stable between 41.7 degrees C and 42.2 degrees C. The clinical values (physical condition scores) of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 12.5, 15.6 and 0, respectively. In addition, viremia occurred at 15 and 10 days post-challenge (DPC) in groups 1 and 2, and antibodies could be detected in these ducklings at 21 and 15 DPC. Proliferation ability analysis showed that the viral titers of group 1 were lower than those of their parental viruses in group 2. Conclusion: This study shows that the rescued viruses are not significantly different but exhibit lower pathogenicity and proliferation ability compared with the parental virus. The results will facilitate future studies on DuCV pathogenesis and biology.

The bacteria causes acute or chronic septicemia characterized by fibrinous pericarditis and meningitis. The R. anatipestifer genome encodes multiple iron/hemin-uptake systems that facilitate adaptation to iron-limited host environments. These systems include several TonB-dependent transporters and three TonB proteins responsible for energy transduction. These three tonB genes are present in all the R. anatipestifer genomes sequenced so far. Two of these genes are contained within the exbB-exbD-tonB1 and exbB-exbD-exbD-tonB2 operons. The third, tonB3, forms a monocistronic transcription unit. The inability to recover derivatives deleted for this gene suggests its product is essential for R. anatipestifer growth. Here, we show that deletion of tonB1 had no effect on hemin uptake of R. anatipestifer, though disruption of tonB2 strongly decreases hemin uptake, and disruption of both tonB1 and tonB2 abolishes the transport of exogenously added hemin. The ability of R. anatipestifer to grow on iron-depleted medium is decreased by tonB2 but not tonB1 disruption. When expressed in an E. coli model strain, the TonB1 complex, TonB2 complex, and TonB3 protein from R. anatipestifer cannot energize heterologous hemin transporters. Further, only the TonB1 complex can energize a R. anatipestifer hemin transporter when co-expressed in an E. coli model strain.

Additionally, LHY is highly expressed in the SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) cDNA library-induced stripe rust pathogen (CYR32) in our previous research. To identify the function of the LHY gene in disease resistance against stripe rust, we used RACE-PCR technology to clone TaLHY in the wheat variety Chuannong19. The cDNA of TaLHY is 3085 bp long with an open reading frame of 1947 bp. TaLHY is speculated to encode a 70.3 kDa protein of 648 amino acids, which has one typical plant MYB-DNA binding domain; additionally, phylogenetic tree shows that TaLHY has the highest homology with LHY of Brachypodium distachyon(BdLHY-like). Quantitative fluorescence PCR indicates that TaLHY has higher expression in the leaf, ear and stem of wheat but lower expression in the root. Infestation of CYR32 can result in up-regulated expression of TaLHY, peaking at 72 h. Using VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) technology to disease-resistant wheat in the fourth leaf stage, plants with silenced TaLHY cannot complete their heading stage. Through the compatible interaction with the stripe rust physiological race CYR32, Chuannong 19 loses its immune capability toward the stripe rust pathogen, indicating that TaLHY may regulate and participate in the heading of wheat, as well as the defense responses against stripe rust infection.

The routine procedure of GISH using genomic DNA of rye as a probe is time-consuming and labor-intensive because of the preparation and labeling of genomic DNA of rye and denaturing of chromosomes and probes. In this study, new oligonucleotide probes Oligo-1162, Oligo-pSc200 and Oligo-pSc250 were developed. The three new probes can be used for non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) assays and replace genomic DNA of rye as a probe to discriminate rye chromosomes in wheat backgrounds. In addition, previously developed oligonucleotide probes Oligo-pSc119.2-1, Oligo-pSc119.2-2, Oligo-pTa535-1, Oligo-pTa535-2, Oligo-pTa71-2, Oligo-pAWRC.1 and Oligo-CCS1 can also be used for ND-FISH of wheat and rye. These probes have provided an easier, faster and more cost-effective method for the FISH analysis of wheat and hybrids derived from wheat x rye.

In this study, a successive markerless mutation system for H. parasuisusing two sequential steps of natural transformation was developed. By the first homologous recombination, the target genes were replaced by a cassette carrying kanamycin resistance gene and sacB (which confers sensitivity to sucrose) gene using kanamycin selection, followed by the second reconstruction to remove the selection cassette, with application of sucrose to further screen unmarked mutants. To improve DNA transformation frequency, several parameters have been analyzed further in this work. With this method, two unmarked deletions in one strain have been generated successfully. It is demonstrated that this system can be employed to construct multi-gene scarless deletions, which is of great help for developing live attenuated vaccines for H. parasuis.

Although previous studies have shown convergent evolution of the giant and the red pandas at both morphological and molecular level, the evolution of the gut microbiota in these pandas remains largely unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether the gut microbiota of the pandas converged due to the same diet, or diverged. We characterized the fecal microbiota from these two species by pyrosequencing the 16S V-1-V-3 hypervariable regions using the 454 GS FLX Titanium platform. We also included fecal samples from Asian black bears, a species phylogenetically closer to the giant panda, in our analyses. By analyzing the microbiota from these 3 species and those from other carnivores reported previously, we found the gut microbiotas of the giant pandas are distinct from those of the red pandas and clustered closer to those of the black bears. Our data suggests the divergent evolution of the gut microbiota in the pandas.

Electroantennography and Y-tube olfactometer behavioral tests were used to compare and analyze the responses of male and female beetles to each of selected eight compounds. The spectrometry results showed that monoterpenes are the primary chemicals emitted by P yunnanensis. The electroantennogram responses of adult T. minor to six of the plant compounds peaked at 10 mu g/mu L; the exceptions were terpinolene and myrcene, which had maxima above 100 mu g/mu L.

Viroporins form transmembrane pores in host cells via oligomerization, thereby destroying cellular homeostasis and inducing cytopathy for virus replication and virion release. Among the Picornaviridae family of viruses, the 2B protein encoded by enteroviruses is well understood, whereas the viroporin activity of the 2B protein encoded by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has not yet been described. An analysis of the FMDV 2B protein domains by computer-aided programs conducted in this study revealed that this protein may contain two transmembrane regions. Further biochemical, biophysical and functional studies revealed that the protein possesses a number of features typical of a viroporin when it is overexpressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as well as in FMDV-infected cells. The protein was found to be mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with both the N-and C-terminal domains stretched into the cytosol. It exhibited cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli, which attenuated 2B protein expression. The release of virions from cells infected with FMDV was inhibited by amantadine, a viroporin inhibitor. The 2B protein monomers interacted with each other to form both intracellular and extracellular oligomers. The Ca2+ concentration in the cells increased, and the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane was disrupted in cells that expressed the 2B protein. Moreover, the 2B protein induced intense autophagy in host cells. All of the results of this study demonstrate that the FMDV 2B protein has properties that are also found in other viroporins and may be involved in the infection mechanism of FMDV.

Recent studies have suggested a crucial role for the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in regulating lipid metabolism; therefore, we hypothesized that insulin affects goose hepatocellular lipid metabolism through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Methods Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with serum-free media supplemented with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors (LY294002, rapamycin, and NVP-BEZ235, respectively) and 50 or 150 nmol/L insulin. Results Insulin induced strong effects on lipid accumulation as well as the mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion in primary goose hepatocytes. The stimulatory effect of insulin on lipogenesis was significantly decreased by treatment with PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors. These inhibitors also rescued the insulin-induced down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion. Conclusion These findings suggest that the stimulatory effect of insulin on lipid deposition is mediated by PI3K-Akt-mTOR regulation of lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion in goose hepatocytes.

Two FDA-approved c-AbI1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors Gleevec and Tasigna block the release of viral particles; however, their clinical dosages are much lower than the dosages required for effective EBOV suppression. An alpha-1,2-glucosidase inhibitor Miglustat has been shown to inhibit EBOV particle assembly and secretion. Additionally, the estrogen receptor modulators Clomiphene and Toremifene prevent membrane fusion of EBOV and 50-90% of treated mice survived after Clomiphene/Toremifene treatments. However, the uptake efficiency of Clomiphene by oral administration is very low. Thus, I propose a hypothetical treatment protocol to treat Ebola virus infection with a cumulative use of both Miglustat and Toremifene to inhibit the virus effectively and synergistically. EBOV infection induces massive apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes. Also, cytolysis of endothelial cells triggers disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and subsequent multiple organ failures. Therefore, blood transfusions and active treatments with FDA-approved drugs to treat DIC are also recommended.

The results show that IPEC-J2 cells express high baseline levels of 1 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), which converts inactive 25D(3) to the active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25D(3)). Porcine rotavirus (PRV) infection alone resulted in a significant increase in CYP27B1 mRNA, which augmented the production of active vitamin D. Physiological concentrations of 25D(3) were found to decrease PRV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. RIG-I plays an important role in the recognition of double-stranded RNA virus by host cells. Upon recognition, RIG-I triggers a series of signalling molecules such as interferon-beta (IFN-beta) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) leading to the expression of type I interferons (IFN-beta). Active 25D(3) that was generated by PRV-infected IPEC-J2 cells led to an increased expression of toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, IPS-1, IFN-beta and IFN-stimulated genes 15 (ISG(15)) with important innate immune functions. Inhibiting CYP27B1 also failed to increase RIG-I, IPS-1, IFN-beta and ISG(15) mRNA expression. These observations suggest that 25D(3) can directly inhibit PRV in IPEC-J2 cells, which requires this active form of vitamin D. The anti-rotavirus effect of 25D(3) is mediated at least in part by RIG-I signalling pathways in IPEC-J2 cells.

As chemotherapy is the predominant method for the prevention and treatment of R. anatipestifer infection in poultry, the widespread use of antibiotics has favoured the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. However, little is known about R. anatipestifer susceptibility to macrolide antibiotics and its resistance mechanism. We report for the first time the identification of a macrolide resistance mechanism in R. anatipestifer that is mediated by the ribosomal RNA methyltransferase ermF. We identified the presence of the ermF gene in 64/206 (31%) R. anatipestifer isolates from different regions in China. An ermF deletion strain was constructed to investigate the function of the ermF gene on the resistance to high levels of macrolides. The ermF mutant strain showed significantly decreased resistance to macrolide and lincosamide, exhibiting 1024-, 1024-, 4- and >2048-fold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations for erythromycin, azithromycin, tylosin and lincomycin, respectively. Furthermore, functional analysis of ermF expression in E. coli XL1-blue showed that the R. anatipestifer ermF gene was functional in E. coli XL1-blue and conferred resistance to high levels of erythromycin (100 mu g/ml), supporting the hypothesis that the ermF gene is associated with high-level macrolide resistance. Our work suggests that ribosomal RNA modification mediated by the ermF methyltransferase is the predominant mechanism of resistance to erythromycin in R. anatipestifer isolates.

COBB500 (TM) male broiler chicks were randomly allocated to two groups. The control group was fed on a basal corn-based diet while the other group (the AFB group) was fed on a similar diet but the corn was naturally contaminated with aflatoxins B-1 and B-2. Histopathological examination revealed that in the AFB group there was more nuclear debris in the three immune organs and obvious congestion of red pulp in the spleen, when compared with the control group. Ultrastructural examination showed lesions in the lymphocytes and reticulocytes of the three immune organs, the mucosal epithelium of the BF and the plasmocytes of the spleen. Increased apoptotic cells and an impaired membrane system (including nuclear membrane, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum [ER]) could be observed in the three immune organs in birds of the AFB group. In the plasmocytes, dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum contained electron-dense matrix. By flow cytometry, the percentages of apoptosis were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the three organs of the AFB group than those of the control group. These observations suggested that the lesions of the immune organs were related to the immunosuppression, and that the apoptosis might be initiated by the mitochondrial pathway and ER chaperone pathway.

NOV.; SOIL; EXTRACTION	Five non-spore-forming, aerobic and Gram-stain-positive bacterial strains, 10-107-8(T), 1C-4, NHI3_6, 4107_1_2, and 3D-3, were isolated from Populusxeuramericana bark collected in Puyang City, Henan Province, PR China. The isolates grew at 15-40 degrees C and pH 5-10. The optimum temperature and pH for growth were 30 degrees C and pH 8.0, respectively. Chemotaxonomic features included MK-10 and MK-11 as major menaquinones (type strain); predominating iso-and anteiso-branched cellular fatty acids; diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol as major polar lipids (type strain); ornithine as the principal diamino acid of the cell-wall peptidoglycan (type strain); glycolyl type as cell-wall acyl type; and DNA G+C content of 66.8-67.6 mol%. These features were consistent with classification in the genus Microbacterium. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data indicated that the five isolates belonged to the genus Microbacterium and were closely related to Microbacterium halotolerans. A high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96.97% to M. halotolerans YIM 70130(T) was observed. The five isolates showed less than 96.20% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the other species of the genus Microbacterium with validly published names. DNA DNA relatedness of the five isolates with M. halotolerans JCM 13013(T) ranged from 35.62% to 44.36 %. Considering the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and the physiological and biochemical characteristics, we propose that the five strains should be assigned to a novel species of the genus Microbacterium. The name proposed for the five strains is Microbacterium populi sp. nov., and the type strain is 10-107-8T (=CFCC 11275(T)=KCTC 29152(T)).

In recent years, kiwifruit rot has been a serious problem in Sichuan Province, one of the important kiwifruit production areas of China. Botryosphaeria dothidea has previously been associated with kiwifruit rot but little is known regarding whether other Botryosphaeriaceae genera also constitute kiwifruit rot pathogens in China. Accordingly, diseased fruit were collected from six different areas of Sichuan Province. Based on morphological characteristics, pathogenicity testing, and comparisons of DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer, transcription elongation factor 1-alpha, and p-tubulin genes, 135 isolates of Botryosphaeriaceae were identified as B. dothidea, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Neofusicoccum parvum. All of these species were found to cause kiwifruit rot. To understand the infection cycle of kiwifruit rot pathogens, these three species were used to inoculate leaves and shoots of kiwifruit. The results showed that these species could cause spots on leaves and lesions on shoots, producing abundant pycnidia on leaves and shoots surfaces. Moreover, B. dothidea conidia and ascospores from overwintered pycnidia and pseudothecia in kiwifruit orchards in April and August could cause fruit rot and spots on leaves of kiwifruit. Therefore, we concluded that overwintered pycnidia and pseudothecia of B. dothidea in kiwifruit orchards are the primary inoculum for kiwifruit rot, with new pycnidia that develop during the growing season serving as a secondary inoculum. This is the first report of N. parvum and L. theobromae causing kiwifruit rot in China and is also the first report that B. dothidea is able to overwinter as pycnidia and pseudothecia in kiwifruit orchards and serve as the primary inoculum for kiwifruit rot.

Tremendous amount of genetic diversity exists in Rubus due to inter- or intra-species hybridization, polyploidization, or agamospermy make it a typical taxonomically challenging but genetically intriguing genus among land. plants. In present study, meiotic pairing behavior and the distribution patterns of 45S and 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in six Rubus taxa with ploidy ranging from diploid (2n=14) to octoploid (2n=56). At all ploidy levels, bivalent pairing is the most predominant form in meiotic configuration. Very few multivalents were observed in tetraploid or octoploid samples. FISH analysis revealed two 45S rDNA sites in each of the two diploid taxa. Each of the polyploids (2n=28) studied had the expected multiples of this number except the tetraploid R. setchuenensis (with only three sites). On the contrary, both diploid and tetraploid taxa had two 5S rDNA loci, while the octoploid R. buergeri carried only three sites. Both meiotic behavior observations and FISH results support that Rubus polyploids might be of allopolyploid in origin.

The stability of NLRs is tightly regulated, though its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show the crucial impact of N-terminal acetylation on the turnover of one plant NLR, Suppressor of NPR1, Constitutive 1 (SNC1), in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic and biochemical analyses of SNC1 uncovered its multilayered regulation by different N-terminal acetyltransferase (Nat) complexes. SNC1 exhibits a few distinct N-terminal isoforms generated through alternative initiation and N-terminal acetylation. Its first Met is acetylated by N-terminal acetyltransferase complex A (NatA), while the second Met is acetylated by N-terminal acetyltransferase complex B (NatB). Unexpectedly, the NatA-mediated acetylation serves as a degradation signal, while NatB-mediated acetylation stabilizes the NLR protein, thus revealing antagonistic N-terminal acetylation of a single protein substrate. Moreover, NatA also contributes to the turnover of another NLR, RESISTANCE TO P. syringae pv maculicola 1. The intricate regulation of protein stability by Nats is speculated to provide flexibility for the target protein in maintaining its homeostasis.

Effect of dietary supplementation with glycitein during late pregnancy and lactation on antioxidative indices and performance of primiparous sows	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						antioxidant indices; gilts; glycitein; reproductive performance; soy isoflavone	OXIDATIVE STRESS; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; SOYBEAN ISOFLAVONE; SOY ISOFLAVONE; VITAMIN-E; INORGANIC SELENIUM; FETAL TISSUES; MALE BROILERS; NURSING PIGS; MEAT QUALITY	The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with glycitein, a major soy isoflavone, during late pregnancy (starting on d 85) and lactation on antioxidative indices and performance in primiparous sows. A total of 227 gilts (Yorkshire x Landrace) were used, and after parturition, piglets were crossfostered within treatment so that each sow suckled 10 piglets. Gilts were randomly divided into 4 groups on d 85 of pregnancy and thereafter fed the basal diets of gestation or lactation (controls) or those supplemented with 15, 30, or 45 mg/kg diet glycitein. Reproductive performance of the sows, growth of litters, concentration of plasma glycitein, milk composition, and antioxidative indices in sows' plasma and milk, such as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured. Supplementation of the dam's diets with glycitein increased ADG of piglets (linear, P = 0.003) and weaned BW of litters (linear, P = 0.01) and both variables were approximately 10% greater than controls with the 45 mg/kg treatment. The percentage of milk protein was linearly (P < 0.05) increased on d 1 and 7 of lactation, and milk fat content increased on d 7 and 14 (linear, P < 0.05). All other measured indices of performance were unaffected by supplementation with glycitein (P > 0.05). The glycitein concentration in sow's plasma was linearly (P < 0.0001) elevated. During lactation, linear increases occurred in plasma activities of SOD (P < 0.001) and T-AOC (P < 0.05 to < 0.001), CAT (d 7 to 18 of lactation, P < 0.05) and GSH-Px (d 7 of lactation, P < 0.05), whereas the content of plasma MDA decreased (linear, P < 0.05) throughout lactation with glycitein supplementation. Activities of CAT and T-AOC in milk were not affected by maternal supplementation with glycitein, but increases in SOD on d 18 of lactation (P < 0.001) and GSH-Px in colostrum (P < 0.05) were observed. The content of MDA in milk was decreased (linear, P < 0.05) at all stages of lactation except d 14. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that dietary supplementation with glycitein in sows during late pregnancy and lactation elevated the antioxidative indices, decreased the content of MDA in sow's plasma and milk, improved milk composition, and enhanced the growth performance of the sucking piglets.

This could have a negative effect on maize production. To understand the sensitivity of maize production to future changes in precipitation, we analyzed growing season precipitation and average state maize yields in the eastern United States for the period 1963-2011. Growing season precipitation did not show a strong trend during this period. However, crop yields increased at 3.90% in the southern, 2.62% in the central, and 2.31% in the northern part of the eastern United States, which we attributed to technology and management. To separate technology and management effects from precipitation variability, we corrected maize yields for these yield trends. We then correlated maize yield corrected for advances in technology and management with total growing season precipitation and precipitation in the critical month of pollination, from the regional to state scale. Maize yield - precipitation relationships showed that moisture shortage rather than excess determined maize yield in the Eastern United States. The relationship between total growing season precipitation-maize yield was stronger in the southeastern than in the northeastern U.S., but the critical month precipitation-maize yield relationship was stronger in the northeastern than in the southeastern U.S. If climate model predictions are accurate and total growing season precipitation will not decrease in this region but variability will, it is likely that maize yields in the northeastern U.S. will be more significantly affected.

Skeletal muscle comprises different fiber types that can be broadly classified as red, intermediate, and white. Recently, a set of miRNAs was found expressed in a fiber type-specific manner in red and white fiber types. However, an in-depth analysis of the miRNA transcriptome differences between all three fiber types has not been undertaken. Herein, we collected 15 porcine skeletal muscles from different anatomical locations, which were then clearly divided into red, white, and intermediate fiber type based on the ratios of myosin heavy chain isoforms. We further illustrated that three muscles, which typically represented each muscle fiber type (i.e., red: peroneal longus (PL), intermediate: psoas major muscle (PMM), white: longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM)), have distinct metabolic patterns of mitochondrial and glycolytic enzyme levels. Furthermore, we constructed small RNA libraries for PL, PMM, and LDM using a deep sequencing approach. Results showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly enriched in PL and played a vital role in myogenesis and energy metabolism. Overall, this comprehensive analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the miRNA regulatory mechanism that achieves the phenotypic diversity of skeletal muscles.

However, the suitable reference selection is critical for normalizing target genes expression in qPCR. In the present study, six commonly used endogenous controls were selected as candidate reference genes to evaluate and analyze their expression levels, stabilities and normalization to immune-related gene IgM expression during vaccination and infection in spleen of tilapia with RefFinder and GeNorm programs. The results showed that all of these candidate reference genes exhibited transcriptional variations to some extent at different periods. Among them, EF1A was the most stable reference with RefFinder, followed by 18S rRNA, ACTB, UBCE, TUBA and GAPDH respectively and the optimal number of reference genes for IgM normalization under different experiment sets was two with GeNorm. Meanwhile, combination the Cq (quantification cycle) value and the recommended comprehensive ranking of reference genes, EF1A and ACTB, the two optimal reference genes, were used together as reference genes for accurate analysis of immune-related gene expression during vaccination and infection in Nile tilapia with qPCR. Moreover, the highest IgM expression level was at two weeks post-vaccination when normalized to EF1A, 18S rRNA, ACTB, and EF1A together with ACTB compared to one week post-vaccination before normalizing, which was also consistent with the IgM antibody titers detection by ELISA.

Methods: The relationship of chemical constituents in Baizhi with different sulfur fumigation time and dosages was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint and chemometrics methods, including similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). HPLC was carried out on a Diamonil C18 column; linear gradient elution was performed with acetonitrile and water; column temperature, injection volume of sample, flow rate, detection wavelength and testing time were 30 degrees C, 20 mu L, 1 mL/min, 310 nm and 75 min respectively. Results: The chemical constituents of Baizhi significantly (p < 0.05) decreased after sulfur fumigation though sulfur fumigation time and dosage were at low levels - 2 h and 25 g (sulphur)/10 kg (Baizhi), respectively. Conclusion: Sulfur fumigation is not a desirable method for field processing of Baizhi even when sulfur fumigation time and dosage were short and small.

Methods: By using reference sequences of ASFV and SVDV, this study synthesized parts of the genes connected to the 19-T vector which was inserted into competent DH5 alpha cells to establish recombinant plasmids. Two specific primers of ASFV P72 proteins and SVDV genome were designed to amplify the two target genes. Two pairs of primers and two kinds of recombinant plasmids were added to one PCR reaction system to establish a double PCR assay for detection of the two diseases simultaneously. The double PCR conditions were optimized and the sensitivity and specificity of the assay determined. Results: The reaction was optimal with a final concentration of 0.36 mu M for each primer, and a final annealing temperature of 55.5 degrees C. The lowest target gene copy number for detecting SVDV and ASFV was 7.6 x 10(2) and 1.5x10(5) copies/mu L, respectively. The assay has a high level of specificity as only the recombinant plasmids of ASFV and SVDV were amplified and control plasmids for three other diseases - porcine circovirus (PCV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and porcine parvovirus (PPV) - failed amplification. Conclusion: This study provides a rapid, sensitive and specific double PCR method for the simultaneous detection of ASFV and SVDV.

Two concentration gradient experiments (preliminary and verification), involving the same soil Cd concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg kg(-1)), were conducted to study Cd accumulation and tolerance in Capsella bursa-pastoris. In the preliminary and verification concentration gradient experiments, the Cd content in shoots of C. bursa-pastoris exceeded 100 mg kg(-1) at a soil Cd concentration of 50 mg kg(-1), and the maxima of Cd contents in shoots were 307.67 and 369.20 mg kg(-1) at 125 mg kg(-1) Cd in soil, respectively. The shoot bioconcentration factor of C. bursa-pastoris was greater than 1, but the translocation factor was less than 1.0 in the preliminary and verification concentration gradient experiments. In the verification concentration gradient experiment, the malondialdehyde content and the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase increased compared with the control. Therefore, C. bursa-pastoris is a Cd-accumulator with strong tolerance to Cd, and could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil in winter.

The knowledge of the physicochemical properties of the marketed agrochemicals is useful for guiding the design and selection of such libraries. Since the earlier profiling of marketed agrochemicals, the number and types of marketed agrochemicals have significantly increased. Recent studies have shown the change of some physicochemical properties of oral drugs with time. There is a need to also profile the physicochemical properties of the marketed agrochemicals. In this work, we analyzed the key physicochemical properties of 1751 marketed agrochemicals in comparison with the previously-analyzed herbicides and insecticides, 106391 natural products and 57548 diverse synthetic libraries compounds. Our study revealed the distribution profiles and evolution trend of different types of agrochemicals that in many respects are broadly similar to the reported profiles for oral drugs, with the most marked difference being that agrochemicals have a lower number of hydrogen bond donors. The derived distribution patterns provided the rule of thumb guidelines for selecting potential agrochemical leads and also provided clues for further improving the libraries for agrochemical lead discovery.

Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stocks in soil organic layer as affected by forest gaps in the alpine forest of the eastern Tibet Plateau	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						soil organic layer; forest gap; alpine-gorge area; carbon stock; nutrient stocks	LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATES; WESTERN SICHUAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIR FOREST; WINTER; SIZE; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS; ECOSYSTEM; REMOVAL	Carbon (C) and nutrients storages in soil organic layer play an important role in forest productivity in the alpine-gorge area. However, forest gaps during forest regeneration could regulate carbon and nutrients stocks in soil organic layer by controlling hydro-thermal environment conditions, but little information has been available on it. Therefore, concentrations and stocks of carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in fresh litter layer (LL), fragmented litter layer (FL) and humified litter layer (HL) were investigated from gap center, canopy gap and expanded gap to closed canopy in an alpine forest of eastern Tibetan Plateau in later fall (October, 2013). The results showed that the forest gaps reduced the thicknesses of LL and FL, but increased the thickness of HL. Carbon concentrations in LL and FL decreased as affected by forest gaps, whereas both N and P concentrations increased regardless of soil organic layers. Moreover, forest gaps reduced C, N and P stocks in LL and FL, although which in HL increased. In addition, C, N and P stocks were significantly related to negative accumulated temperature regardless of soil organic layers. These results suggest that forest gap could promote carbon and nutrient releases from fresh litters, but limit carbon and nutrients output from humified litters in these alpine forests.

The results showed that average Cd contents in shoots of the two ecotypes of K. brevifolia were higher than those in roots, whereas Cd concentrations in roots were greater than those in shoots. Also, shoot Cd contents in NME of K. brevifolia were 1.65-45.45 times greater than those in ME when the plants were grown at 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg Cd kg(-1) soil. Moreover, Cd contents in the roots in NME were 1.75-45.45 times higher than those in ME. Subcellular distribution of Cd demonstrated that the majority of Cd in the two ecotypes of K. brevifolia was distributed in the cell walls and soluble fraction, and a small percentage of Cd existed in organelle fraction. In addition, proportions of Cd distributed in shoots and roots cell walls of NME were greater than those in ME. It could be assumed that compared with ME, NME of K. brevifolia has better Cd accumulation capacity, and the subcellular distribution of Cd might be one of the mechanisms to explain such phenomena.

J	Chang, XL; Riemann, M; Liu, Q; Nick, P				Chang, Xiaoli; Riemann, Michael; Liu, Qiong; Nick, Peter			Actin as Deathly Switch? How Auxin Can Suppress Cell-Death Related Defence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PATTERN-RECOGNITION RECEPTORS; PHOSPHATIDIC-ACID; GENE-EXPRESSION; PLANT; CYTOSKELETON; ARABIDOPSIS; PATHOGEN; GROWTH; GRAPEVINE; RESPONSES	Plant innate immunity is composed of two layers - a basal immunity, and a specific effector-triggered immunity, which is often accompanied by hypersensitive cell death. Initiation of cell death depends on a complex network of signalling pathways. The phytohormone auxin as central regulator of plant growth and development represents an important component for the modulation of plant defence. In our previous work, we showed that cell death is heralded by detachment of actin from the membrane. Both, actin response and cell death, are triggered by the bacterial elicitor harpin in grapevine cells. In this study we investigated, whether harpin-triggered actin bundling is necessary for harpin-triggered cell death. Since actin organisation is dependent upon auxin, we used different auxins to suppress actin bundling. Extracellular alkalinisation and transcription of defence genes as the basal immunity were examined as well as cell death. Furthermore, organisation of actin was observed in response to pharmacological manipulation of reactive oxygen species and phospholipase D. We find that induction of defence genes is independent of auxin. However, auxin can suppress harpin-induced cell death and also counteract actin bundling. We integrate our findings into a model, where harpin interferes with an auxin dependent pathway that sustains dynamic cortical actin through the activity of phospholipase D. The antagonism between growth and defence is explained by mutual competition for signal molecules such as superoxide and phosphatidic acid. Perturbations of the auxin-actin pathway might be used to detect disturbed integrity of the plasma membrane and channel defence signalling towards programmed cell death.

This paper proposes an approach based on a risk-assessment program and demonstrates how this can be extended to enhance the multimode resource-constrained project-scheduling problem (MRCPSP) to realize risk control and effective scheduling. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a means to control scheduling and material-purchasing risks by using a bilevel decision framework to identify risk and conduct a focused evaluation. Specifically, this paper establishes a hybrid uncertain multiobjective bilevel programming model and introduces an expected-value operator to deal with the hybrid uncertainty. A multiswarm differential-updating particle swarm optimization is developed to support the model calculations. Worthiness and efficiency of the proposed approach is validated using a case study. This approach can help improve scheduling strategies and ensure realistic project-planning.

Jian). Fish were fed graded levels of dietary arginine for 9 weeks. Subsequently, a challenge test was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila. Head kidney and spleen weights, as well as erythrocyte and leukocyte counts were significantly influenced by dietary arginine levels. A similar trend was also observed for hemagglutination titre, serum lysozyme activity, IgM concentration, C3 and C4 content. The highest survival rates following A. hydrophila infection were obtained in fish fed the diets containing arginine at 16.1-21.9 g/kg diet. Phagocytic activity of leukocytes was significantly enhanced by dietary arginine supplementation. In contrast, acid phosphatase activity significantly decreased with dietary arginine levels. Dietary arginine levels did not have a significant effect on the total iron-binding capacity. Gene expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta in head kidney significantly increased with dietary arginine levels up to 21.9 g/kg diet, and decreased thereafter. Fish fed the basal diet exhibited the highest IL-10 mRNA expression level. Gene expression of IL-1 beta and TOR increased with dietary arginine addition, reaching a plateau at 18.5 and 21.9 g arginine/kg diet, respectively. In spleen, higher IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha gene expressions were obtained in fish fed the diets containing 24.5 g arginine/kg diet than in fish fed the other dietary treatments. TGF-beta mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in fish fed the diets containing <= 21.9 g arginine/kg diet. IL-10 and TOR mRNA expression levels were lower in fish fed 16.1 g arginine/kg diet, while 4E-BP mRNA expression levels increased with dietary arginine levels up to 12.7 g/kg diet and decreased thereafter. Our results indicate that arginine has beneficial effects on regulating mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, as well as TOR and 4E-BP and improving humoral and cellular immunity, therefore enhancing disease resistance of fish.

Their best-characterized role is to suppress transposon expression, which ensures genomic stability in the germline. However, increasing evidence has suggested that PIWI proteins are linked to the hallmarks of cancer defined by Weinberg and Hanahan, such as cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, genomic instability, invasion and metastasis. This provides new possibilities for anticancer therapies through the targeting of PIWI proteins, which may have fewer side effects due to their potential classification as a CTA (cancer/testis antigen). Furthermore, PIWI has been proposed to act as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for many types of cancer, and even to differentiate early-and late-stage cancers. We herein summarize the latest progress in this exciting field, hoping to encourage new investigations of PIWIs in cancer biology that will help to develop new therapeutics for clinical application.

Three independent variables, namely, extraction temperature (X-1), ultrasonic power (X-2) and extraction time (X-3) were investigated. Response surface methodology was performed based on the results of single-factor tests. Experimental data were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation using multiple regression analysis, and results were examined using appropriate statistical methods. The optimal conditions were as follows: extraction temperature of 85 degrees C, ultrasonic power of 187W and extraction time of 29 min. Under these conditions, the experimental yield of polysaccharides was 5.33%, which is close to the predicted yield of 5.41%. The extracted and purified polysaccharides showed excellent antioxidative effects on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazy, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in vitro. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These two compounds inhibit microbial growth and interfere with subsequent alcohol fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has the in situ ability to detoxify furfural and HMF to the less toxic 2-furanmethanol (FM) and furan-2,5-dimethanol (FDM), respectively. Herein, we report that an uncharacterized gene, YNL134C, was highly up-regulated under furfural or HMF stress and Yap1p and Msn2/4p transcription factors likely controlled its up-regulated expression. Enzyme activity assays showed that YNL134C is an NADH-dependent aldehyde reductase, which plays a role in detoxification of furfural to FM. However, no NADH- or NADPH-dependent enzyme activity was observed for detoxification of HMF to FDM. This enzyme did not catalyse the reverse reaction of FM to furfural or FDM to HMF. Further studies showed that YNL134C is a broad-substrate aldehyde reductase, which can reduce multiple aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. Although YNL134C is grouped into the quinone oxidoreductase family, no quinone reductase activity was observed using 1,2-naphthoquinone or 9,10-phenanthrenequinone as a substrate, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is genetically distant to quinone reductases. Proteins similar to YNL134C in sequence from S. cerevisiae and other microorganisms were phylogenetically analysed. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, its underlying mechanism of action remains to be clarified. Here, we characterized a hypomorphic mutant allele of OsMADS32/CFO1, cfo1-3 and identified its function in controlling rice flower development by bioinformatics and protein-protein interaction analysis. The cfo1-3 mutant produces defective flowers, including loss of lodicule identity, formation of ectopic lodicule or hull-like organs and decreased stamen number, mimicking phenotypes related to the mutation of B class genes. Molecular characterization indicated that mis-splicing of OsMADS32 transcripts in the cfo1-3 mutant resulted in an extra eight amino acids in the K-domain of OsMADS32 protein. By yeast two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we revealed that the insertion of eight amino acids or deletion of the internal region in the K1 subdomain of OsMADS32 affects the interaction between OsMADS32 with PISTILLATA (PI)-like proteins OsMADS2 and OsMADS4. This work provides new insight into the mechanism by which OsMADS32 regulates rice lodicule and stamen identity, by interaction with two PI-like proteins via its K domain.

Identification and characterisation of tobacco microRNA transcriptome using high-throughput sequencing	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						MicroRNA expression profile; stem-loop RT-PCR; tobacco	AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR; TARGET GENES; CONSERVED MICRORNAS; ROOT-FORMATION; RT-PCR; ARABIDOPSIS; PLANTS; BIOGENESIS; STRESS; MIRNAS	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that are involved in numerous biological processes in plants. In this study, we investigate miRNAs in Honghua Dajinyuan, an agronomically important species of tobacco in China. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles in the leaf, stem and root using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 165 miRNAs, representing 55 conserved families, and 50 novel miRNAs, representing 19 families, were identified in three libraries. In addition, 12 miRNAs were randomly selected from a differentially expressed conserved miRNA family in three libraries with expression alterations and subjected to qRT-PCR validation. Of these, the expression level of nta-miR167d is highly enriched in the leaf tissue. In addition, the expression level of nta-miR319a is prominently enriched in the stem, while nta-miR160c is highly enriched in the root. Moreover, the target prediction showed that most of the targets coded for transcription factors that are involved in cellular and metabolic processes. GO analysis showed that most of the targets were involved in organelle function, served binding functions, and take part in cellular and metabolic processes. This study helps shed new light on understanding the role of miRNAs in different parts of the tobacco plant and adds a significant number of novel miRNAs to the tobacco miRNA transcriptome.

Progress in wheat breeding is hampered by a relatively narrow range of genetic variation. To overcome this hurdle, wild relatives of common wheat with superior agronomic traits are often used as donors of desirable genes in wheat-breeding programs. One of the successfully utilized wheat wild relatives is Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn (2n = 4x = 28; genomes PPPP). We previously reported that WAT31-13 was a wheat-A. cristatum 5A-6P reciprocal translocation line with higher fertile tiller number and grain number per spike compared to common wheat. However, WAT31-13 was genetically unstable. In this study, we analyzed the 43 genetically stable progenies from WAT31-13 using genomic in situ hybridization, dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular markers. We classified them into three translocation types (TrS, TrL and TrA) and seven subtypes, and also pinpointed the translocation breakpoint. The genotypic data, combined with the phenotypes of each translocation type, enabled us to physically map agronomic traits to specific A. cristatum 6P chromosome arms or segments. Our results indicated that A. cristatum chromosome 6P played an important role in regulating fertile tiller number, and that positive and negative regulators of fertile tiller number existed on the A. cristatum chromosome arm 6PS and 6PL, respectively. By exploring the relationship between fertile tiller number and A. cristatum chromosome segment, this study presented a number of feasible approaches for creation, analysis, and utilization of wheat-alien chromosome translocation lines in genetic improvement of wheat.

Currently, most studies have focused on the evolution of the VP2 gene, whereas the full-length genome of CPV has been rarely reported. In this study, the whole genomes of CPV-LZ1 and CPV-LZ2 strains prevalent in Northwest China were determined and analyzed in comparison with those of the reference CPVs. The genome sequences of both LZ strains consisted of 5053 nucleotides. CPV-LZ1 and CPV-LZ2 strains were designated as new CPV-2a and CPV-2b, respectively. Sequence alignment analysis results revealed that these two new strains underwent specific unique variations during the process of local adaption. The left non-translated regions of these strains formed a Y-shaped hairpin structure, whereas the right non-translated regions lacked the reiteration of DNA sequence. A phylogenetic tree constructed from 33 whole coding regions of CPVs showed a strong spatial clustering, and these two strains belonged to the Chinese strain cluster lineage. This study provides a method to obtain the full-length genome of CPV. The isolation and characterization of these viruses adds incrementally to the knowledge of the full-length genome of CPV. The results from this study also provide insight into the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of the CPV field isolates from Northwest China and can be useful in preventing and controlling CPV infection in this region.

In this study, leaves of creeping bentgrass (cv. 'Penn-A4') were pretreated with 0.2 mmol Spd every another day for three cycles before water was limited for 15 days in a growth chamber. The application of exogenous Spd elevated the accumulation of endogenous PA, including putrescine, Spd and spermine in leaves of creeping bentgrass under drought stress. Exogenous Spd effectively alleviated the damage effects from drought stress, as demonstrated by lower O-2 (center dot-) generation rate, H2O2 and malondialdehyde content, higher relative water content, chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase) as compared to untreated plants. Additionally, the pretreatment with Spd resulted in a lower accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin A(3) (GA(3)) after 15 days of drought stress, but an unchanged accumulation of abscisic acid compared to the untreated ones. These results suggest that ameliorating drought stress through exogenously applied Spd may be associated with increased antioxidant protection capability and after a longer stress treatment with changed IAA and GA(3) accumulation level on account of improved endogenous PA content. In addition, drought tolerance mechanisms related to PA regulation of phytohormones are very complex and deserve further investigation.

However, leptin has also been found to be involved in the regulation of female reproductive system through interactions with pathways in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis and direct action at the ovarian level. In the present study, granulosa cells from goose ovarian preovulatory (F1-F3) follicles were cultured with leptin (0,1,10 or 100 ng/ml). The proliferative and anti-apoptotic actions of leptin in granulosa cells were revealed by CCK-8, BrdU and TUNEL assays. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses further indicated that leptin treatment led to increased expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and bcl-2, and decreased expression of p21 and caspase-3. The effects were involved in the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, as leptin treatment enhanced the expression of PI3K, Akt1, Akt2, Raptor, mTOR, S6K and p-S6K. Moreover, blockade of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway attenuated the influences of leptin on proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells, considering that activated factors by leptin were inhibited in the presence of either 20 mu M LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) or 10 mu M rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor). In addition, leptin had a modulatory effect on the expression of its receptor at the transcriptional and translational levels, and blockade of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibited both basal and leptin-induced Lepr gene and protein expression. These findings suggest that leptin exerts its proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on goose granulosa cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway via interaction with its receptor.

We hypothesized that exercise would affect MRF mRNA and protein abundance in postnatal chicken skeletal muscle driving molecular changes that could ultimately lead to increased muscle fiber diameter. At day (d) 43, twelve hundred chickens with similar body weight were randomly assigned to cage, pen, and free-range groups. The MRF mRNA abundance was measured in the pectoralis major and thigh muscle at d56, d70, and d84, and the protein levels of MRFs were determined from the thigh muscle at d84. The results showed no significant difference in mRNA of the MRFs among the three groups at d56 (P > 0.05). At d84, chicken in the pen and free-range group showed higher MyoD1, MyoG, Myf5, and Mrf4 mRNA abundance compared to the caged chickens (P < 0.05). Free-range chickens had higher Mrf4 and MyoG expression than those in penned ones (P < 0.05). Protein abundances of all four factors were lowest in the caged group, and Mrf4 and MyoG protein quantities were greatest in free-range chickens (P < 0.05), but Myf5 and MyoD1 protein abundance did not differ between penned and caged groups. The results suggested that exercise up-regulated MRF expression in the postnatal skeletal muscles, which led to an increase in muscle fiber diameter, and eventually affected the meat quality of the skeletal muscles in adult chickens.

However, little research has been conducted on the side effects of dietary daidzein, especially in young animals. In this study, the safety of daidzein was evaluated. Results show that ingesting 400 mg/kg of dietary daidzein for 70 days is associated with a lower average daily weight gain (kilogram) (0.47 +/- 0.03 vs 0.54 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05) and a higher splenic damage index (1.00 +/- 1.10 vs 0.00 +/- 0.00, P < 0.05) in young pigs compared with control. Female pigs receiving 200 and 400 mg/kg daidzein showed reduced serum testosterone levels (ng/L) on days 35 and 70 compared with the control group (day 35, 246 +/- 74 and 224 +/- 20 vs 362 +/- 48, P < 0.05; day 70, 252 +/- 38 and 219 +/- 77 vs 374 +/- 38, P < 0.05). Daidzein residue (mu g/kg) in pig livers increased (243 +/- 80 vs 142 +/- 47, P < 0.05, day 70). These results suggest that dietary supplements of 400 mg/kg of daidzein negatively affect the weight gain and splenic morphology of pigs.

The cDNA of goose IFNAR1 consisted of 1616 bp and encoded 406 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 46.4 kDa, while the cDNA of goose IFNAR2 consisted of 1525 bp and encoded 294 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 32.6 kDa. The IFNAR1 shared 85.4% identity in deduced amino acid sequence with duck IFNAR1, while IFNAR2 amino acid sequence showed 86% identity with that of duck IFNAR2. The age-related analysis of gene expression revealed that goose IFN alpha. and IFNARs were all highly transcribed in pancreas, which may due to a reasonable amount of dendritic cells aggregated in pancreas. And goose IFN alpha and its cognate receptors had different structural features and tissue expression patterns during the period from embryonic goose to adult goose, suggesting that IFN alpha and IFNARs may maintain a developmental dynamic immune competence in unstimulated states. The data provided in this study may contribute to future understanding of the interaction between interferon and interferon receptors in immune mechanism. And it also helps us to understand the age-related susceptibility to pathogens in birds better. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, relatively few studies have investigated the molecular characterization, tissue distribution, and potential function of TRIM25 in chickens. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of chicken TRIM25 that is composed of 2706 bp. Sequence analyses revealed that TRIM25 contains a 1902-bp open-reading frame that probably encodes a 633-amino acid protein. Multiple comparisons with deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the RING finger and B30.2 domains of chicken TRIM25 share a high sequence similarity with human and murine TRIM25, indicating that these domains are critical for the function of chicken TRIM25. qPCR assays revealed that TRIM25 is highly expressed in the spleen, thymus and lungs in chickens. Furthermore, we observed that TRIM25 expression was significantly upregulated both in vitro and in vivo following infection with Newcastle disease virus. TRIM25 expression was also significantly upregulated in chicken embryo fibroblasts upon stimulation with poly(I:C) or poly(dA:dT). Taken together, these findings suggest that TRIM25 plays an important role in antiviral signaling pathways in chickens. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, limited information is currently available on the contributions of soil fauna to litter decomposition during winter in such ecosystems. Therefore, a field experiment that included litterbags with two different mesh sizes (0.04 mm and 3 mm) was conducted to investigate the contribution of soil fauna to the loss of foliar litter mass in winter from November 2013 to April 2014 along the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. Two litter types of the dominant species were selected in each ecosystem: cypress (Cupressus chengiana) and oak (Quercus baronii) in ecotone; cypress (Cupressus chengiana) and clovershrub (Campylotropis macrocarpa) in dry valley; and fir (Abies faxoniana) and birch (Betula albosinensis) in montane forest. Over one winter incubation, foliar litter lost 6.0%-16.1%, 11.4%-26.0%, and 6.4%-8.5% of initial mass in the ecotone, dry valley and montane forest, respectively. Soil fauna showed obvious contributions to the loss of foliar litter mass in all of the ecosystems. The highest contribution (48.5%-56.8%) was observed in the ecotone, and the lowest contribution (0.4%-25.8%) was observed in the montane forest. Compared with other winter periods, thawing period exhibited higher soil fauna contributions to litter mass loss in ecotone and dry valley, but both thawing period and freezing period displayed higher soil fauna contributions in montane forest. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the contribution of soil fauna was significantly correlated with temperature and soil moisture during the winter-long incubation. These results suggest that temperature might be the primary control factor in foliar litter decomposition, but more active soil fauna in the ecotone could contribute more in litter decomposition and its related ecological processes in this region.

Lam] ranks among the top seven most important food crops cultivated worldwide and is hexaploid plant (2n=6x=90) in the Convolvulaceae family with a genome size between 2,200 to 3,000 Mb. The genomic resources for this crop are deficient due to its complicated genetic structure. Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast (cp) genome of sweet potato, which is a circular molecule of 161,303 bp in the typical quadripartite structure with large (LSC) and small (SSC) single-copy regions separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs). The chloroplast DNA contains a total of 145 genes, including 94 protein-encoding genes of which there are 72 single-copy and 11 double-copy genes. The organization and structure of the chloroplast genome (gene content and order, IR expansion/contraction, random repeating sequences, structural rearrangement) of sweet potato were compared with those of Ipomoea (L.) species and some basal important angiosperms, respectively. Some boundary gene-flow and gene gain-and-loss events were identified at intra-and inter-species levels. In addition, by comparing with the transcriptome sequences of sweet potato, the RNA editing events and differential expressions of the chloroplast functional-genes were detected. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on 77 protein-coding genes from 33 taxa and the result may contribute to a better understanding of the evolution progress of the genus Ipomoea (L.), including phylogenetic relationships, intraspecific differentiation and interspecific introgression.

Notwithstanding, such potentials have not been well defined in duck nutrition. Giving China being the largest duck producing country, we conducted this study to establish adequate specifications of major nutrients along with multi-enzyme complex to meat duck from day-old to slaughter, focusing on performance, utilization of nutrients and bone mineralization. Five dietary treatments were: Positive control (PC, T1): the nutrients concentration of diet for 1 to 14 d of age were apparent metabolizable energy(AME) 2,800 kcal/kg, crude protein (CP) 19.39%, Ca 0.85%, available phosphorus (avP) 0.42%; for 15 to 35 d of age these parameters were AME 2,900 kcal/kg, CP 16.47%, Ca 0.76%, avP 0.38%; Negative control 1(NC1, T2), the AME and digestible amino acids (DAA) were reduced by 70 kcal/kg and 2.0%, avP and Ca by 1.0 g/kg from PC diet; Negative control 2(NC2, T4), the down-spec from PC diet was AME 100 kcal/kg, DAA 2.5%, avP 1.5 g/kg and Ca 1.2 g/kg; The enzyme complex was added at the same dosage (200 mL/1,000 kg) on NC1 (T3) and NC2 (T5) diets. Results: Comparing with the ducks fed on T1, T3 and T5 diets, the birds fed on NC2 diet showed the lowest (P < 0.05) body weight (d 14 and 35), feed intake (d 35), tibia ash, Ca and P contents (d 14 and 35), and the utilization of nutrients (P < 0.05). The supplementation with the enzyme complex to the NC diets restored growth rate, utilization of nutrients and bone mineralization to the level of the PC diet, and increased AME by 60 kcal/kg and 117 kcal/kg, respectively for the NC1 and NC2 diets. Conclusion: These results suggest that down-spec AME by 100 kcal/kg, DAA by 2.5%, avP by 1.5 g/kg and Ca by 1.2 g/kg caused detrimental effects on duck performance compared with those fed on the PC diet, and these performance losses can be compensated by the addition of the multiple-enzyme complex.

The effects of medium composition and incubation conditions on the Gls content in fermented rapeseed cake (FRSC) were investigated, and chemical composition and amino acid in vitro digestibility of RSC substrate fermented under optimal conditions were determined. Results: After 72 h of incubation at 34 degrees C, a 76.89% decrease in Gls of RSC was obtained in solid medium containing 70% RSC, 30% wheat bran at optimal moisture content 60% (w/w). Compared to unfermented RSC, trichloroacetic acid soluble protein (TCA-SP), crude protein and ether extract contents of the FRSC were increased (P < 0.05) 103.71, 23.02 and 23.54%, respectively. As expected, the contents of NDF and phytic acid declined (P < 0.05) by 9.12 and 44.60%, respectively. Total amino acids (TAA) and essential amino acids (EAA) contents as well as AA in vitro digestibility of FRSC were improved significantly (P < 0.05). Moreover, the enzyme activity of endoglucanase, xylanase, acid protease and phytase were increased (P < 0.05) during SSF. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the solid state fermentation offers an effective approach to improving the quality of proteins sources such as rapeseed cake.

'Ladino' and drought-resistant cv. 'Haifa') under controlled drying conditions for 10 days. The results show that the application of Spm effectively alleviates negative effects caused by drought stress in both cultivars. Exogenous Spm led to accumulation of more water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), sucrose, fructose and sorbitol in both cultivars under drought stress, and also significantly elevated glucose content in leaves of drought-resistant cv. 'Haifa', but had no effect on drought-susceptible cv. 'Ladino'. Accordingly, the key enzyme activities of sucrose and sorbitol metabolism changed along with the application of Spm under drought stress. Spm induced a significant increase in sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) or sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, but decrease in sucrose synthetase (SS) activity when two cultivars were subjected to drought. In addition, the improved accumulation of dehydrins induced by exogenous Spm coincided with three genes expression which was responsible for dehydrins synthesis. But Spm-induced transcript level of dehydrin genes increased earlier in cv. 'Ladino' than that in cv. 'Haifa'. Thus, these results suggest that ameliorating drought stress through exogenously applied Spm may be associated with increased carbohydrate accumulation and dehydrins synthesis. There are differences between drought-susceptible and - resistant white clover cultivars related to Spm regulation of WSC metabolism and dehydrins expression.

Resveratrol improved serum lipid profiles, and decreased visceral adipose tissue weight and serum leptin level. In adipose tissue, permasome proliferator activated receptor gamma(PPARy) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA levels, and FAS and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities were decreased by resveratrol, while hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and camitine palmitoyl transferase-1(CPT-1) mRNA levels, and HSL and CPT-1 activities were increased. In muscle tissue, PPAR gamma, FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and LPL mRNA levels and FAS and ACC activities were decreased by resveratrol, while HSL mRNA levels and CPT-1 activity were increased. Moreover, compared with the control group, LPL activity was decreased, and CPT-1 mRNA levels and HSL activity were increased in the 600 mg resveratrol/kg diet group. This study provides the very first evidence in a pig model that resveratrol could improve serum lipid profiles and decrease body fat deposition, which might be mediated by a reduction in fatty acid uptake and de novo lipogenesis, as well as an increase in fat mobilization and fatty acid oxidation in muscle and adipose tissues.

In wheat spikes, our visual and microscopic observations suggested that the 2DL QTL suppress fungal infection in inoculated spikelets and reduce spread from spikelets to rachis. Transcriptome profiling of infected spikelets showed changes in expression for 487 probe sets between the 2DL-carrying and the null lines. Of 27 transcripts selected for validation, eight candidate genes with similar expression profiles between the two pair of lines were identified. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Because it is prevalent in Sichuan Province, China, knowledge concerning Pm40-mediated wheat powdery mildew resistance is important for understanding hostepathogen interactions. The aim of this study was to understand physiological changes during the hostepathogen interaction, including gene expression, photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, and antioxidant activity, specific to the resistance response to powdery mildew. The Pm40-expressing L693 and Pm40-deficient L1095 wheat lines were employed for comparison analyses. Fifty-eight and 26 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained from forward and reverse suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries constructed from Bgt-infected L693 and L1095 leaves, respectively, and 69% of the ESTs in the forward library were related to photosynthesis- and energy metabolism-related pathways. Our data indicate that photosynthesis and carbon metabolism as well as nitrogen metabolism related to photosynthesis are the main pathways involved in Pm40-mediated wheat powdery mildew resistance and that an acetyl CoA-like gene might be a key regulatory factor in these pathways. This study provides new insight into the physiological and genetic mechanisms of resistance to wheat powdery mildew. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ma, L. X.; Chen, W. Q.; Liu, T.

PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Jatropha curcas; phenology; altitude; water; 100-seeds weight	PHENOLOGY; BIODIESEL; BIOLOGY	Field survey was conducted at three different altitudes in the dry-hot valley of Chin-sha River China. The variances of flowering and fruiting and the quantity of fruit at three different altitudes areas (Low 800m, Middle 1,200m and High 1,700m) were observed and recorded. Data of 100-seeds weight came from 9 experimental groups which classified by three fruiting periods (early, middle and late) at three different altitudes. To ensure single variable, water effect was studied in the cline banks where situated in the 1,200m and controlled by artificial irrigation. The results showed that flowering and fruiting time under different altitude had significant difference, the lower altitude, the earlier flowering. Fruit number in the middle elevation was remarkably higher than the other two altitude areas. Fruit quantity in early and middle fruiting period accounted for 85 percent at 1,200m, which was significantly higher than the late fruiting period. 100-seeds weight between low and middle elevation, early and middle fruiting period had no significant difference respectively, but they were, respectively, higher than the high altitude and late fruiting period. The maximum of the 100-seeds weight was 65.17g while the lightest was only 49.51g. Water promoted flowering earlier, fruiting delayed but open flower and whole fruiting stage extended. Average fruit numbers in the early and middle stages with regularly irrigation were 220.8 per tree and 195.6 per tree respectively, which were 2.26 times as the same period of plant without irrigation. Therefore, in hilly areas, J. curcas optimal elevation is 800 -1,200m and have high demand for water during flowering and fruiting period.

However, few empirical studies have specifically examined whether or not changes in allocation to pollen production actually lead to changes in the number of seeds sired, a more direct measure of male fitness. In pseudogamous apomicts, fitness depends on the number of seeds produced; thus, a contrasting pattern of variation in the pollen-to-ovule (P/O) ratio within inflorescences might be expected. Methods We investigated floral sex allocation and reproductive success within racemes of Hosta ventricosa, a pseudogamous apomictic hermaphrodite possessing flowers that open acropetally. We quantified variations in pollen number, ovule number, the P/O ratio and fruit and seed production, from 2007 to 2011, among flowers within racemes of four populations of H. ventricosa in southwest China. Ecological causes for fruit and seed production were evaluated by observing patterns of pollen deposition, flower removal and supplemental pollination. Important Findings Pollen number, ovule number and the P/O ratio declined from basal-to-distal positions in all sampled populations (years). Fruit and seed production decreased distally in most populations (years). Low fruit and seed set of distal flowers was not due to pollen limitation because pollen deposition never declined distally and the low fruit and seed set of distal flowers remained even after supplementary pollination was provided. The flower-removal experiment indicated that inter-fruit competition for resources among flowers was common. The low P/O ratio of distal flowers in H. ventricosa might be favored because they were unable to obtain fitness by donating pollen and siring seeds on other plants. Our study may help to understand the adaptive significance of sex allocation among flowers within inflorescences of sexually reproducing hermaphrodites.

Previously, we identified HESO1 as the nucleotidyl transferase that uridylates most unmethylated miRNAs in vivo, but substantial 3' tailing of miRNAs still remains in heso1 loss-of-function mutants. In this study, we found that among nine other potential nucleotidyl transferases, UTP:RNA URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 1 (URT1) is the single most predominant nucleotidyl transferase that tails miRNAs. URT1 and HESO1 prefer substrates with different 3' end nucleotides in vitro and act cooperatively to tail different forms of the same miRNAs in vivo. Moreover, both HESO1 and URT1 exhibit nucleotidyl transferase activity on AGO1-bound miRNAs. Although these enzymes are able to add long tails to AGO1-bound miRNAs, the tailed miRNAs remain associated with AGO1. Moreover, tailing of AGO1-bound miRNA165/6 drastically reduces the slicing activity of AGO1-miR165/6, suggesting that tailing reduces miRNA activity. However, monouridylation of miR171a by URT1 endows the miRNA the ability to trigger the biogenesis of secondary siRNAs. Therefore, 3' tailing could affect the activities of miRNAs in addition to leading to miRNA degradation.

One hundred and fifty-six one-day-old healthy Cobb broilers were randomly divided into control group (0 mg/kg AFB(1)) and AFB(1) group (0.6 mg/kg AFB(1)) with three replicates per group and 26 birds per replicate for 21 days, respectively. At 7, 14, and 21 days of age, the duodenum, jejunum and ileum were sampled for analyzing T cell subsets (CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+)) by flow cytometry as well as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN- and TNF- mRNA expression by qRT-PCR. The percentages of T-cells in the intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) of duodenum, jejunum and ileum in the AFB(1) group showed a decreased tendency in comparison to the control group. The mRNA expression of cytokines in the three intestinal segments in the AFB(1) group presented a general decline compared with the control groups. Our data demonstrated that 0.6 mg/kg AFB(1) in the broilers diet could reduce the percentages of T-cell subsets and the expression level of cytokine mRNA in the small intestine, implying that the immune function of the intestinal mucosa might be affected. The reduction of cytokines mRNA expression may be closely associated with the decreased proportions of T cells subsets induced by AFB(1).

The causative agent of JE is Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), in which the predominant genotype has changed from genotype III (G III) to genotype I (G I). However, a method for the rapid differentiation between JEV G I and G III remains unavailable. This study aimed to establish a rapid JEV genotyping method using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). An Spe I site, which was located in the target sequence (C gene) of JEV G III strains but not in JEV G I strains, was selected as the RT-LAMP target. After testing 64 specimens, results showed that RT-LAMP can detect and differentiate JEV G I and G III specifically. Thus, a novel RT-LAMP system for the rapid detection and differentiation of JEV G I and G III was developed successfully.

However, heteroplasmy was absent in thousands of equine mtDNA sequences deposited in GenBank. To address whether heteroplasmy widely exists in mitochondria of Chinese indigenous horses, we generated the data set of the target sites in Cytb region with Sanger sequencing and PCR-RFLP method as well. In this study, 23 heteroplasmic individuals were detected in 430 Chinese local horses. Both site and length heteroplasmy were identified in horse Cytb, especially in Xinihe and Ujumqin breeds. Our data provide evidence that the forward and reverse primers seem to produce a similar approximation to the proportion of mutation base call. However, locations of primers affected the proper detection of mtDNA heteroplasmy. The data obtained in this study highlight the importance of the primers in the accurate detection of heteroplasmy.

Effect of initial pH (4.50, 3.00, 2.75, 2.50) on growth and fermentation performance of 3 S. cerevisiae strains Freddo, BH8, No.7303, different tolerance at low pH, chosen from 12 strains, was studied. The values of yeast growth (OD600, colony forming units, cell dry weight), fermentation efficiency (accumulated mass loss, change of total sugar concentration), and fermentation products (ethanol, glycerol, acetic acid, and l-succinic acid) at different pH stress were measured. The results showed that the initial pH of must was a vital factor influencing yeast growth and alcoholic fermentation. Among the 3 strains, strain Freddo and BH8 were more tolerant than No.7303, so they were affected slighter than the latter. Among the 4 pH values, all the 3 strains showed adaptation even at pH 2.50; pH 2.75 and 2.50 had more vital effect on yeast growth and fermentation products in contrast with pH 4.50 and 3.00. In general, low initial pH showed the properties of prolonging yeast lag phase, affecting accumulated mass loss, changing the consumption rate of total sugar, increasing final content of acetic acid and glycerol, and decreasing final content of ethanol and l- succinic acid, except some special cases. Based on this study, the effect of low pH on wine products would be better understood and the tolerance mechanism of low pH of S. cerevisiae could be better explored in future.

The experiment was conducted for 60 days. The results showed that final weight, average daily gain, average backfat thickness, (testicles+kidney+pelvic) fat percentage and subcutaneous fat percentage in the high and medium energy groups were significantly higher than in the low-energy group but that the feed conversion ratio was significantly lower. The glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein in the high-energy group were significantly higher than in the low-energy group. With dietary energy increasing the activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) significantly increased, whereas hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) significantly diminished. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), LPL, FAS, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), ACC, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and adipocyte-fatty acid binding proteins (A-FABP) gene expression were significantly increased by dietary energy increasing, and HSL and CPT-1 gene expression were significantly decreased. These results indicated that with dietary energy increasing, the subcutaneous fat accumulation mainly increased due to adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression and decreased lipolytic gene expression.

Lee) is a well-known rare tree species in China that is valued as an ornamental garden plant and for its high timber quality. Recently, the cultivation of nanmu has gained attention for use in tree resource conservation and ecological restoration projects. Drought is a major environmental factor that affects the growth and development of plants. In this study, the drought tolerance and post-drought recovery of nanmu, which is associated with antioxidative enzymes and osmotic adjustment, were examined by exposing nanmu saplings to drought for 30 days followed by 10 days of re-watering in a greenhouse. Drought stress resulted in increased levels of osmolytes, sugars and proteins in nanmu leaves compared with the well-watered controls as well as higher concentrations of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, leading to lipid peroxidation and significantly higher activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase and higher levels of ascorbic acid. After re-watering for 5 days, most of the antioxidant enzymes and ascorbic acid were restored to their original levels, whereas the activity of guaiacol peroxidase and the levels of soluble sugar and soluble protein remained markedly high. Moreover, nanmu saplings maintained normal turgor pressure under mild and moderate drought conditions, indicating the presence of a mechanism that affects osmotic adjustment and growth restriction, thus enabling the plant to adjust to drought stress. These results suggested that an antioxidant defence system and osmolytes play important roles in nanmu during drought stress and recovery.

However, the direct effects (on current fine root decomposition) and indirect effects (on root quality and subsequent decomposition) of N deposition on fine root decomposition are poorly understood. We conducted a 5-year field experiment in a Pleioblastus amarus bamboo forest in southwestern China. In the first 3 years of the experiment, N-treated sites (0, 50, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively) and fine roots under two N regimes (0 and 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1); 0 N-Root/+N-Root, respectively) were prepared. Next, these two fine root treatments were applied to a 2-year decomposition experiment in the N-treated sites under continuous N treatment. Nitrogen additions increased fine root density, concentrations of N, P, and lignin in fine roots, and concentrations of TOC, TN, NH4 (+)-N and NO3 (-)-N in the soil, and decreased the soil pH. The decomposition constant k decreased under N addition treatments, and the decomposition rate of + N-Root was lower than that of 0 N-Root, suggesting that both the direct and indirect effects of N additions on fine root decomposition rates were negative. Both N addition and root substrate changes led to an increase in the residual lignin content during decomposition. Nitrogen additions significantly decreased the loss of C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg during decomposition. The changes in the soil environment and increased root lignin concentration as a result of N additions may be the mechanism underlying the negative direct and indirect effects observed. Elevated fine root biomass input and slower degradation rates may be a potential mechanism explaining the increase in soil TOC and TN under N treatment.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of 48 h of different DON treatments (0 mu g/mL, 0.2 mu g/mL, 0.8 mu g/mL, 3.2 mu g/mL, 12.5 mu g/mL, and 50 mu g/mL) on the secretion and the mRNA expressions of some cytokine genes, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), IL-1RI, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 beta, and IFN-gamma in chicken splenic lymphocytes. The concentrations of IL-1RI, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma were increased with the DON concentrations increasing (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, the concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 beta were decreased with the DON concentrations increasing (P < 0.05 or P <0.01). Except IL-1 beta, the mRNA expressions of the other cytokines were up-regulated by DON. The highest mRNA expressions values of IL-1RI, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 beta, and IFN-gamma were at 50 mu g/mL DON treatment groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while the highest mRNA expressions values of IL-2 and IL-6 were at 12.5 mu g/mL DON treatment groups (P <0.05 or P <0.01).

Lanthanum tolerance and accumulation characteristics of two Eucalyptus species	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Eucalyptus; Lanthanum; Tolerance; Accumulation; Bioconcentration factor; Translocation factor	RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; GROWTH; PLANTS	Because of extensive mining of rare earth elements (REEs) and overuse of REE-containing fertilizers, the remediation of soils polluted with REEs such as lanthanum (La) has become an international concern. In this study, pot and plot experiments were conducted to investigate the La tolerance and accumulation of a Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid, Guanglin 9 (Gn9) and E. grandis 5 (Eg5). In the pot experiment, the two species grew normally in soil added La concentrations below 500 mg kg(-1), and shoot biomass showed no significant decrease compared with the control. Peroxidase and catalase activities and glutathione and soluble protein concentrations generally displayed exponential, quadratic or other non-linear increases in response to increasing soil La concentrations. Maximum La accumulations in shoots of Gn9 and Eg5 in the pot experiment were 0.46 and 0.57% of soil La, respectively, with corresponding accumulations in the plot experiment of 87 and 80 mg plant(-1). Most bioconcentration and translocation factors in shoots were less than the critical value (1.0). These findings indicate that the two species may be potentially useful for the remediation of La-polluted soil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, S. R.; Li, L.; Xu, X.

We examined the changes of cell cycle phase, percentages of apoptotic cells, T cell subsets, cytokines, and mRNA expression of apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bax, and caspase-3) in thymocytes by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In the NiCl2-treated broilers, the percentages of thymocytes in G(0)/G(1) phase were increased, whereas thymocytes in the S phase and the proliferation index were decreased. The percentages of apoptotic thymocytes were increased. Also, the mRNA expression levels of bax and caspase-3 were increased, and mRNA expression levels of bcl-2 were decreased. The percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), and CD3(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the thymus and peripheral blood were diminished. Concurrently, thymic cytokine (interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-12 p35 subunit (IL-12p35), interleukin-12 p40 subunit (IL-12p40), interleukin-21 (IL-21), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), thymosin beta 4, thymosin beta 10, and thymosin beta 15) mRNA expression levels were decreased. The abovementioned results showed that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg inhibited thymocyte growth by arresting cell cycle, increasing apoptosis percentage, altering apoptotic protein mRNA expression levels, and downregulating cytokine expression levels.

The cDNAs were 2344- and 2292-bp in length and contained 1950- and 1932-bp open reading frames, encoded proteins of 649 and 643 amino acids, respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that both Sp-HSC70 and Sp-HSP70 contained three signature sequences of HSP70 family, two partial overlapping bipartite nuclear localization signal sequences (an ATP-binding site motif, a bipartite nuclear targeting signal), and a cytoplasmic characteristic motif EEVD. Homology analysis revealed that Sp-HSC70 and Sp-HSP70 shared 77.5 % identity and Sp-HSC70 shared more than 81.1 % identity with the known HSC70s of other vertebrates, while Sp-HSP70 shared more than 77.5 % identity with the known HSP70s of other vertebrates. Fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that Sp-HSC70 and Sp-HSP70 mRNAs were found in all tested tissues, including blood, brain, heart, liver, spleen, head kidney, white muscle, skin, gonad, hypophysis, red muscle, and gill. The Sp-HSC70 and Sp-HSP70 mRNA expression level in blood and head kidney displayed a significant increase in vibrio-challenged group with the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila at 24 h post-infection compared to a control group. Temporally, there was a clear time-dependent expression pattern of Sp-HSC70 or Sp-HSP70 gene after bacterial challenge, and the expression of Sp-HSC70 and Sp-HSP70 mRNAs reached a maximum level at 12 and 6 h post-challenge, respectively. Both returned to control level after 7 x 24 h. The results suggest that Sp-HSC70 and Sp-HSP70 genes may play important roles in mediating the immune responses of A. hydrophila-related diseases in the Prenant's schizothoracin.

Methods and ResultsFour kinds of pao cai were selected. A total of 122 isolates exhibited typical LAB characteristics: Gram-positive and catalase negative, among which 104 (8524%) colonies showed antibacterial activity against Salmonella by the well diffusion assay. Four colonies showing maximum antibacterial radius against Salmonella were selected to co-inoculate with Salmonella on fresh-cut apple and stored at 10 degrees C, further identified as three strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and one strain of Lactobacillus brevis by 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis. The modified Gompertz model was employed to analyse the growth of the micro-organisms on apple wedges. Two of the four selected strains showed antagonistic activity against Salmonella on fresh-cut apple, one of which, RD1, exhibited best inhibitory activity (Salmonella were greatly inhibited when co-inoculated with RD1 at 10 degrees C at 168h). No deterioration in odour or appearance of the apple piece was observed by the triangle test when fresh-cut apple was inoculated with RD1. ConclusionsThe mathematical modelling method is essential to select LAB with outstanding inhibitory activity against Salmonella associated with fresh-cut apple. LAB RD1 holds promise for the preservation of fresh-cut apple. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study provided a new method on fresh-cut product preservation. Besides, to make the LAB isolating procedure a more correct one, this study first added the mathematical modelling method to the isolating procedure.

In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on early gestation in a mouse model. During early gestation, the expression of the melatonin's rate-limiting enzyme, AANAT, gradually increased - in the uterus while the MT2 melatonin receptor was only expressed at day 2 of gestation and no MT1 was detected. Based on these findings, we conducted a melatonin injection experiment which demonstrated that 15mg/kg melatonin significantly improved the number of implantation sites and the litter size. Also, the blastocyst and uterus were collected to identify the local action of melatonin. In the melatonin-treated mice, the endometrium was thicker than in the control mice; melatonin also caused an increase in density of uterine glands, and the uterine gland index (UGI) was significantly elevated over that of the control. Serum steroid hormone measurements revealed that at day 6 of gestation (postimplantation), melatonin significantly downregulated the E-2 level, with no obvious effects on progesterone. Gene expression assay revealed that melatonin significantly upregulated expression of HB-EGF, a crucial gene involved in implantation as well as its receptor ErbB1 in the blastocyst. In addition, PRA, an important gene which influences the decidual response and luminal cell differentiation, p53, which regulates uterine through leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), were both increased after melatonin treatment. These data suggest that melatonin and its MT2 receptor influence early gestation. Exogenous melatonin treatment can improve mouse embryo implantation and litter size, which may have important applications in human reproductive health and animal husbandry.

A race of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal pathogen of stem rust of wheat, known as Ug99, and its variants, are virulent to plants carrying stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in most wheat cultivars worldwide. Therefore, identification, mapping and deployment of effective resistance genes are critical to reduce this threat. Resistance gene Sr21 identified in diploid wheat T. monococcum can be effective against races from the Ug99 race group, but both susceptible and partial resistant reactions have been reported in previous studies. To clarify this conflicting information we screened four monogenic lines with Sr21 and four susceptible controls with 16 Pgt isolates including five isolates of the Ug99 race group under three different temperatures and three different photoperiods. We observed that, temperature influences the interaction between monogenic lines with Sr21 and Ug99 race group isolates, and may be one source of previous inconsistencies. This result indicates that, although Sr21 confers partial resistance against Ug99, its effectiveness can be modulated by environmental conditions and should not be deployed alone. Using two large diploid wheat-mapping populations (total 3,788 F-2 plants) we mapped Sr21 approximately 50 cM from the centromere on the long arm of chromosome 2A(m) within a 0.20 cM interval flanked by sequence-based markers FD527726 and EX594406. The closely linked markers identified in this study will be useful to reduce the T. monococcum segments introgressed into common wheat, accelerate Sr21 deployment in wheat breeding programs, and facilitate the map-based cloning of this gene.

The aim of the present study was to examine the induction and mechanism of HeLa cell apoptosis by euptox A. The apoptosis-inducing effect of the euptox A on HeLa cells was examined by MTT assay. The underlying mechanism was analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. Flow cytometry results suggested that euptox A effectively inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells, arrested the cell cycle transition from S to G2/M phase, did not continue to complete the cell cycle activity (mainly from 4 times and mitosis), and induced cell proliferation. The RT-qPCR detection results showed that euptox A induced apoptosis by improving the gene expression level of apoptotic proteases such as caspase-10 in HeLa cells. Its mechanism of action was associated with the upregulation of apoptotic gene expression and arresting of the cell cycle.

The results showed that resveratrol not only increased m. longissimus dorsi (LM) pH(24 h), a*, crude protein and myoglobin content but also decreased L*(24 h), shear force, drip loss, glycolytic potential, as well as backfat depth, LM lactate dehydrogenase activity and mRNA level. Meanwhile, LM total antioxidative capacity, glutathione peroxidase activity and its mRNA level were increased by resveratrol, while malonaldehyde content was decreased. In addition, resveratrol increased myosin heavy chain (MyHC)IIa mRNA level and decreased MyHCIIb mRNA level, along with decreased myofiber cross-sectional area. In conclusion, these results suggest that resveratrol is an effective feed additive to improve pork quality, and the underlying mechanism may be partly due to the changed muscle fiber characteristics and antioxidative capacity induced by resveratrol.

J	Li, HB; Chen, GD; Yan, W				Li, Haobing; Chen, Guangdeng; Yan, Wei			Molecular Characterization of Barley 3H Semi-Dwarf Genes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; HORDEUM-VULGARE L.; DWARFING GENES; PLANT HEIGHT; BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1; ELONGATION; HOMOLOG; CHINA	The barley chromosome 3H accommodates many semi-dwarfing genes. To characterize these genes, the two-rowed semi-dwarf Chinese barley landrace 'TX9425' was crossed with the Australian barley variety 'Franklin' to generate a doubled haploid (DH) population, and major QTLs controlling plant height have been identified in our previous study. The major QTL derived from 'TX9425' was targeted to investigate the allelism of the semi-dwarf gene uzu in barley. Twelve sets of near-isogenic lines and a large NILF2 fine mapping population segregating only for the dwarfing gene from 'TX9425' were developed. The semi-dwarfing gene in 'TX9425' was located within a 2.8 cM region close to the centromere on chromosome 3H by fine mapping. Molecular cloning and sequence analyses showed that the 'TX9425'-derived allele contained a single nucleotide substitution from A to G at position 2612 of the HvBRI1 gene. This was apparently the same mutation as that reported in six-rowed uzu barley. Markers co-segregating with the QTL were developed from the sequence of the HvBRI1 gene and were validated in the 'TX9425'/'Franklin' DH population. The other major dwarfing QTL derived from the Franklin variety was distally located on chromosome 3HL and co-segregated with the sdw1 diagnostic marker hv20ox2. A third dwarfing gene, expressed only in winter-sown trials, was identified and located on chromosome 3HS. The effects and interactions of these dwarfing genes under different growing conditions are discussed. These results improve our understanding of the genetic mechanisms controlling semi-dwarf stature in barley and provide diagnostic markers for the selection of semi-dwarfness in barley breeding programs.

Here, based on muscle transcriptome analysis in Texel (Myostatin mutant) and Ujumqin (wild type) sheep across the five fetal stages, we constructed and examined the Myostatin-Pax7 pathways in muscle. Then we validated the signals by RNAi in the proliferating and differentiating sheep myoblasts in vitro at mRNA, protein, and cell morphological levels. We reveal that Myostatin signals to Pax7 at least through Ezh2, Src, and Akt during the sheep myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Other signals such as p38MAPK, mTOR, Erk1/2, Wnt, Bmp2, Smad, Tgfb1, and p21 are most probably involved in the Myostatin-affected myogenic events. Myostatin knockdown significantly reduces the counts of nucleus and myotube, but not the fusion index of myoblasts during cell differentiation. In addition, findings also indicate that Myostatin is required for normal myogenic differentiation of the sheep myoblasts, which is different from the C2C12 myoblasts. We expand the regulatory network of Myostatin-Pax7 pathways and first illustrate that Myostatin as a global regulator participates in the epigenetic events involved in myogenesis, which contributes to understand the molecular mechanism of Myostatin in regulation of myogenesis.

In this study, a LAMP assay for rapid detection of Chinese giant salamander ranavirus (CGSRV) was developed from culture isolates and clinical samples. The LAMP assay was developed by designing one set of four specific primers, targeting the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of CGSRV. Reaction time and temperature were optimal for 40 min at 62 degrees C. The developed LAMP assay is specific and highly sensitive for CGSRV detection, the detection limit could reach about 5 copies of cloned viral genomic fragments. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was about 1000 and 10-fold higher than that of both conventional and nested PCR, respectively. The LAMP amplification produces a typical ladder-like pattern of products on an agarose gel that can be visually inspected after addition of ethidium bromide. The LAMP assay was evaluated further with clinical samples, and the results indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a rapid diagnostic tool for the detection of CGSRV.

However, little is known about the gut microbiota in rex rabbit, especially regarding their relationship with different fecal types and growth of the hosts. We characterized the microbiota of both hard and soft feces from rex rabbits with high and low body weight by using the Illumina MiSeq platform targeting the V4 region of the 16S rDNA. High weight rex rabbits possess distinctive microbiota in hard feces, but not in soft feces, from the low weight group. We detected the overrepresentation of several genera such as YS2/Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidales and underrepresentation of genera such as Anaeroplasma spp. and Clostridiaceae in high weight hard feces. Between fecal types, several bacterial taxa such as Ruminococcaceae, and Akkermansia spp. were enriched in soft feces. PICRUSt analysis revealed that metabolic pathways such as "stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, gingerol biosynthesis'' were enriched in high weight rabbits, and pathways related to "xenobiotics biodegradation'' and "various types of N-glycan biosynthesis'' were overrepresented in rabbit soft feces. Our study provides foundation to generate hypothesis aiming to test the roles that different bacterial taxa play in the growth and caecotrophy of rex rabbits.

The results showed that the critical value of K-release rate and leaf K concentration was 3.30 g kg(-1) h(-1) and 30.64 g (kg dry matter)(-1), respectively under the experimental conditions. According to this critical value, the maximum amount of released K that could be utilized by a plant with no K deficiency symptoms was from biotite (27.80 g kg(-1)) and vermiculite (5.58 g kg(-1)), followed by illite, smectite and muscovite with 2.76, 0.88 and 0.49 g kg(-1), respectively. Ryegrass grown on phlogopite showed K deficiency symptoms during the overall growth period. It is concluded that biotite and vermiculite can be directly applied as a promising and sustainable alternative to the use of classical K fertilizers, illite can be utilized in combination with soluble K fertilizers, whereas muscovite, phlogopite and smectite may not be suitable for plant growth. Further field experiments are needed to assess the use of these phyllosilicate minerals as sources of K fertilizer.

Here, we report a genome-wide transcriptional profile analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of maize leaf development after inoculation with B. zeicola. We performed High-Throughput Digital Gene Expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in resistant inbred Mo17 lines after infection with B. zeicola at four successive disease development stages-CP (contact period), PP (penetration period), IP (incubation period), and DP (disease period); the expression of the genes was compared with those in a CK (mock-treatment) control. In addition, a sensitive maize line (Zheng58) was used for the comparisons with the Mo17. Among all tested genes, 466 differentially expressed genes were identified in all libraries, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these genes suggested that they are involved in many biological processes related to systemic symptom development, such as plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis. Our systematic analysis provides comprehensive transcriptomic information regarding systemic symptom development in fungal-infected plants. This information will help in furthering our understanding of the detailed mechanisms of plant responses to fungal infection.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may be involved in the mammalian immune response. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miR-Base 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs displayed significant differentially expression between the normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 44 were significantly down-regulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples, and the results were consistent with those of sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes demonstrated that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report of the identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, which revealed the miRNA molecular regulatory mechanisms for the viral infection, expression of viral genes and the expression of immune-related genes. The results presented here will aid research on the prevention and treatment of viral diseases.

To accelerate the development and application of molecular markers and identify the QTLs affecting the flowering time-related trait in pepper, a total of 1,038 pairs of InDel and 674 SSR primers from different sources were used for genetic mapping using the F-2 population (n = 154) derived from a cross between BA3 (C. annuum) and YNXML (C. frutescens). Of these, a total of 224 simple PCR-based markers, including 129 InDels and 95 SSRs, were validated and integrated into a map, which was designated as the BY map. The BY map consisted of 13 linkage groups (LGs) and spanned a total genetic distance of 1,249.77 cM with an average marker distance of 5.60 cM. Comparative analysis of the genetic and physical map based on the anchored markers showed that the BY map covered nearly the whole pepper genome. Based on the BY map, one major and five minor QTLs affecting the number of leaves on the primary axis (Nle) were detected on chromosomes P2, P7, P10 and P11 in 2012. The major QTL on P2 was confirmed based on another subset of the same F2 population (n = 147) in 2014 with selective genotyping of markers from the BY map. With the accomplishment of pepper whole genome sequencing and annotations (release 2.0), 153 candidate genes were predicted to embed in the Nle2.2 region, of which 12 important flowering related genes were obtained. The InDel/SSR-based interspecific genetic map, QTLs and candidate genes obtained by the present study will be useful for the downstream isolation of flowering time-related gene and other genetic applications for pepper.

This study investigated the performance changes of the largest sewage treatment plant, i.e. Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant in Beijing, China, before and after a cleaner production measure being implemented using emergy and money based indicators. This cleaner production measure redesigned the original primary clarifier to raise the ratio of C/N through strengthening its function of hydrolytic acidification and then realized the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously in the following biological reactors without supplement of external carbon resource and no reagent use for removal of phosphorus, compared to the original craft. However, the investment and energy consumption is also enhanced slightly. The results show that the resource efficiency and environmental performance are all improved to different degree after the cleaner production measure was implemented. Therefore, cleaner production practice should be also advocated in wastewater treatment field. Furthermore, some suggestions are put forward to further strengthen the sustainability of this sewage treatment plant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it has not previously been evaluated for safety through systematic toxicological studies. In the present study, acute and subchronic oral toxicity studies and safety pharmacology evaluation of Galla chinensis solution (GCS) were conducted in specific pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Acute administration of GCS was done as single dose from 3333 mg to 6912 mg per kg/bodyweight (bw) and subchronic toxicity study for 30 days was done by daily oral administration of GCS at doses of 500, 1500 and 2500 mg/kg body weight in SPF SD rats. The acute toxicity study showed the LD50 of GCS was greater than 5000 mg/kg. The results of sunchronic toxicity study showed that the no-observed effect level of GCS was lesser than 1500 mg/kg bw day, which suggested three times higher than that of recommended dose for clinical applications (500 mg/kg bw day). The dose at 2500 mg/kg bw day of GCS may slow down the growth of rats and lead to degeneration and necrosis of tissue cells to some extent. In the safety pharmacology study, GCS did not produce any side effects to rats in central nervous system, cardiovascular system and respiratory system. Therefore, from the results of the study presented herein, it could be concluded that the use of appropriate levels (one to three times of recommended dose for clinical applications) of GCS as a topical preparations is considered safe.

Because of its complex genome, it is difficult to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the growth and development. Thus high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of Ananas comosus var. bracteatus is necessary to generate large quantities of transcript sequences for the purpose of gene discovery and functional genomic studies. Results The Ananas comosus var. bracteatus transcriptome was sequenced by the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. We obtained a total of 23.5 million high quality sequencing reads, 1,555,808 contigs and 41,052 unigenes. In total 41,052 unigenes of Ananas comosus var. bracteatus, 23,275 unigenes were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 23,134 unigenes were annotated in the Swiss-Port database. Out of these, 17,748 and 8,505 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. Functional annotation against Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database identified 5,825 unigenes which were mapped to 117 pathways. The assembly predicted many unigenes that were previously unknown. The annotated unigenes were compared against pineapple, rice, maize, Arabidopsis, and sorghum. Unigenes that did not match any of those five sequence datasets are considered to be Ananas comosus var. bracteatus unique. We predicted unigenes encoding enzymes involved in terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Conclusion The sequence data provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for Ananas comosus var. bracteatus. To our knowledge; this is the first report on the de novo transcriptome sequencing of the Ananas comosus var. bracteatus. Unigenes obtained in this study, may help improve future gene expression, genetic and genomics studies in Ananas comosus var. bracteatus.

Previous studies show that translocated genes could undergo elevated rates of evolution and recombination frequencies around these genes can be altered. Based on the recently released genome sequences of Triticum urartu, Aegilops tauschii, Brachypodium distachyon and bread wheat, an analysis of interchromosomal translocations in the hexaploid wheat genotype 'Chinese Spring' ('CS') was conducted based on chromosome shotgun sequences from individual chromosome arms of this genotype. Results: A total of 720 genes representing putative interchromosomal rearrangements was identified. They were distributed across the 42 chromosome arms. About 59% of these translocated genes were those involved in the well-characterized translocations involving chromosomes 4A, 5A and 7B. The other 41% of the genes represent a large numbers of putative interchromosomal rearrangements which have not yet been described. The number of the putative translocation events in the D subgenome was about half of those presented in either the A or B subgenomes, which agreed well with that the times of interaction between the A and B subgenomes almost doubled that between either of them and the D subgenome. Conclusions: The possible existence of a large number of interchromosomal rearrangements detected in this study provide further evidence that caution should be taken when using synteny in ordering sequence contigs or in cloning genes in hexaploid wheat. The identification of these putative translocations in 'CS' also provide a base for a systematic evaluation of their presence or absence in the full spectrum of bread wheat and its close relatives, which could have significant implications in a wide array of fields ranging from studies of systematics and evolution to practical breeding.

With allocating a relatively higher proportion of its biomass in roots, maize could be a potential important model to study the phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated soil. Here we analyzed the maize root transcriptome of inbred lines 9782 under heavy metal lead (Pb) pollution, which was identified as a non-hyperaccumulator for Pb in roots. In the present study, more than 98 millions reads were mapped to define gene structure and detect polymorphism, thereby to qualify transcript abundance along roots development under Pb treatment. A total of 17,707, 17,440, 16,998 and 16,586 genes were identified in maize roots at four developmental stages (0,12 h, 24 h and 48 h) respectively and 2,825, 2,626, 2161 and 2260 stage-specifically expressed genes were also identified respectively. In addition, based on our RNA-Seq data, transcriptomic changes during maize root development responsive to Pb were investigated. A total of 384 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log2Ratio >= 1, FDR <= 0.001) were identified, of which, 36 genes with significant alteration in expression were detected in four developmental stages; 12 DEGs were randomly selected and successful validated by qRT-PCR. Additionally, many transcription factor families might act as the important regulators at different developmental stages, such as bZIP, ERF and GARP et al. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in maize root development and provide a foundation for future study on root development in maize under heavy metal pollution and other cereal crops.

It is based on the selective adsorption of low pressure ion chromatography column to Fe(II) and Fe(III), the online reduction reaction of Fe(III) and the reaction of Fe(II) in sodium acetate With phenanthroline, resulting in an intense orange complex with a suitable absorption at 515 nm. Various chemical (such as the concentration of colour reagent, eluant and reductive agent) and instrumental parameters (reaction coil length, reductive coil length and wavelength) were studied and were optimized. Under the optimum conditions calibration graph of Fe(II)/Fe(III) was linear in the Fe(II)/Fe(III) range of 0.040-1.0 mg/L. The detection limit of Fe(III) and Fe(II) was respectively 3.09 and 1.55 mu g/L, the relative standard deviation (n = 10) of Fe(II) and Fe(III) 1.89% and 1.90% for 0.5 mg/L of Fe(II) and Fe(III) respectively. About 2.5 samples in 1 h can be analyzed. The interfering effects of various chemical species were studied. The method was successfully applied in the determination of water samples.

The main targets of the toxic effects of Metacavir, in rhesus monkeys, were gastrointestinal tracts, liver, blood, and kidneys, which were not related to mitochondrial effects. In this study, the maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal developmental toxicity and teratogenicity were studied in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats after intragastric administration of Metacavir (200, 100, 50, 0 mg/kg body weight) during the first 6-15 days of pregnancy. Slower weight gain was observed in 5 out of 21 rats subjected to a 200 mg/kg dose, as well as 2 out of 20 subjected to a 100 mg/kg dose. Compared with the solvent control group, the calibration weight gain in the 200 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg dosage groups respectively, during first 6-20 pregnant days were significantly different (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Significant dose related adverse effects to other reproductive parameters were not seen in F0 and F1, but the number of stillbirths in high dose group showed notably difference compared with the control group (P < 0.05), while the litter incidence showed no difference. No Metacavir-associated pathological changes were observed. The present research indicated that at a dose of 200 mg/(kg.d) (i.e., 40 times the effective dose in rats), Metacavir shows some maternal toxicity to SD rats. The embryotoxicity in the 200 mg/kg group encompass decreased fetal body weight, and higher fetal mortality rates, compared with the control group. However, the litter incidence showed no statistical difference. All the treated rats displayed normal bone development, no teratogenicity and without adverse effects on fetal development, thus indicating that below a dose of 200 mg/(kg.d) there is no teratogenic side effects.

We previously developed an elite hybrid rice restorer line with high resistance to rice blast, Yahui2115 (YH2115). To identify the blast resistance genes in YH2115, we first performed expression profiling on previously reported blast resistance genes and disease assay on monogenic lines, and we found that Pi2, Pi9, and Pikm were the most likely resistance candidates in YH2115. Furthermore, RNA interference and linkage analysis demonstrated that silencing of Pi2 reduced the blast resistance of YH2115 and a Pi2 linkage marker was closely associated with blast resistance in an F-2 population generated from YH2115. These data suggest that the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene Pi2 contributes greatly to the blast resistance of YH2115. Thus, YH2115 could be used as a new germplasm to facilitate rice blast resistance breeding in hybrid rice breeding programs.

All inoculated samples were irradiated with a series of dosages. The efficacy of irradiation to inactivate pathogens was investigated. The results showed that irradiation at doses 4.00 kGy and 5.00 kGy was appropriate for eliminating almost all E. coli and S. Typhimurium in two peppers, respectively. A. niger was undetectable in chili and Sichuan pepper at doses 1.50 kGy and 1.00 kGy radiation. The D10-values of E. coli, S. Typhimurium and A. niger in Sichuan pepper were 0.81, 0.93 and 0.20 kGy,, and 0.82, 0.69 and 0.49 kGy in chili pepper. The results indicated that irradiation at appropriate doses is a promising approach for producing safe and pathogen-free peppers for consumers.

Recently, potassium-dependent transcriptome analysis has been reported in Arabidopsis, rice and soybean. Alligator weed is well known, particularly for its strong ability to accumulate potassium. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies potassium starvation responses has not yet been described. In this study, we used Illumina (Solexa) sequencing technology to analyse the root transcriptome information of alligator weed under low potassium stress. Further analysis suggested that 9253 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, and 2138 DEGs were downregulated after seven days of potassium deficiency. These factors included 121 transcription factors, 108 kinases, 136 transporters and 178 genes that were related to stress. Twelve transcription factors were randomly selected for further analysis. The expression level of each transcription factor was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, and the results of this secondary analysis were consistent with the results of Solexa sequencing. Enrichment analysis indicated that 10,993 DEGs were assigned to 54 gene ontology terms and 123 KEGG pathways. Approximately 24% of DEGs belong to the metabolic, ribosome and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite KEGG pathways. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the gene regulatory network of alligator weed under low potassium stress, and afford a valuable resource for genetic and genomic research on plant potassium deficiency.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article							ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES; ESSENTIAL OILS; FRUIT JUICES; IN-VITRO; PLANTS	Urena lobata has been used as a traditional medicinal plant in India and China. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity and isolated the active compound from the leaves of U. lobata. The 80% ethanol extract from U. lobata leaves showed an effective anti-yeast activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) strains. Using a combination of chromatographic methods, (-)-trachelogenin (1) and clematoside-S (2) were isolated from this plant for the first time, and their chemical structure was identified by mass spectrometry (MS) and extensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data analysis. In addition, 1 was found to be inactive against all of the test microorganisms in the antimicrobial assay, whereas 2 exhibits a specific anti-yeast activity against S. cerevisiae strains with diameter of inhibition zones in the range from 11 to 20 mm. Furthermore, the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) values of 2 against S. cerevisiae strains were detected to be in the ranges of 0.61 to 9.8 mu g/mL and 2.42 to 9.8 mu g/mL, respectively. This is the first report of 2 with a specific anti-yeast activity. The above result suggests the potential application of U. lobata to be used as a natural anti-yeast agent in food preservation.

After being purified by chromatography, the structure characteristics of DOTP-80 were established. Based on the calibration curve obtained with standard dextrans, the molecular weight of the polysaccharide fraction DOTP-80 was calculated to be 123 kDa. The results of Infrared spectrum (FT-IR) indicated that the polysaccharide contained the alpha-configuration of sugar units. GC-MS analysis revealed that DOTP-80 was mainly composed of mannose and glucose. Alloxan-induced diabetic rats and mice models were developed to evaluate the in vivo hypoglycemic activity of the polysaccharide. The results indicated that a high dose DOTP-80 (400 mg/kg) had strong hypoglycemic activity. Moreover, DOTP-80 could increase the level of antioxidant enzymes (SOD) activity in alloxan-induced diabetic mice and stimulate an increase in glucose disposal in diabetic rats. Therefore, the polysaccharide DOTP-80 should be evaluated as a candidate for future studies on diabetes mellitus.

The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of changing climate variables on litter decomposition. By synthesizing data from multiple terrestrial ecosystems, we quantified the response of the litter decomposition rate to the independent effects of warming, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), elevated ozone (O-3), and the combined effects of elevated CO2+elevated O-3. Across all case studies, warming increased the litter decomposition rate significantly by 4.4%, but this effect could be reduced as a result of the negatively significant effects of elevated CO2 and elevated CO2+elevated O-3. The combined effects of elevated CO2+elevated O-3 decreased the litter decomposition rate significantly, and the magnitude appeared to be higher than that of the elevated CO2 per se. Moreover, the study type (field versus laboratory), ecosystem type, and plant litter identity and functional traits (growth form and litter form) were all important moderators regulating the response of litter decomposition to climate warming and elevated CO2 and O-3. Although litter decomposition rate may show a moderate change as a result of the effects of multiple changing climate variables, the process of litter decomposition would be strongly altered due to the differing mechanisms of the effects of each climate change variable, suggesting that the global carbon cycle and biogeochemistry could be substantially affected.

Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) is a cool-season annual grass cultivated worldwide for its high yield and quality. With the areas of saline soil increasing, investigation of the molecular mechanisms of annual ryegrass tolerance under salt stress has become a significant topic. qRT-PCR has been a predominant assay for determination of the gene expression, in which selecting a valid internal reference gene is a crucial step. The objective of present study was to evaluate and identify suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR in annual ryegrass under salt stress. The results calculated by RefFinder indicated that eEF1A(s) was the most stable reference gene in leaves, whereas EF1-a was the least stable; meanwhile, TBP-1 was the most optimal in roots and in all samples, and the eIF-5A shouldn't be utilized for normalization of the gene expression. eEF1A(s) is more suitable than TBP-1 as reference gene in leaves when verified with P5CS1 and Cyt-Cu/Zn SOD genes. We should choose optimal reference genes in specific tissues instead of the most stable one selected from different conditions and tissues.

The results showed that the mating duration is shorter when the temperature is higher, with the optimal temperature range for P.orienta reproduction being 22-27 degrees C. The sex ratio had an effect on the male mating capacity, which significantly increased when the sex ratio was f:o 3:1. The average number of matings was 2.44 for males, while female P.orienta mated only once in a lifetime. Males were more attracted to virgin females than to mated females, and the temperature and light period had an effect on the release of sex pheromones by females. Field trap tests using virgin females supported the results obtained in the laboratory, showing that the release of sex pheromones by P.orienta follows a distinct circadian rhythm.

Recurrent selection for wider seedling leaves increases early biomass and leaf area in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Breeding; early vigour; gene action; heritability	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; EARLY VIGOR; SPRING WHEAT; GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; TEMPERATE CEREALS; STAND ESTABLISHMENT; COLD TOLERANCE; GRAIN-YIELD; GROWTH	The breeding of wheat with greater early vigour has potential to increase water- and nutrient-use efficiency, as well as to improve weed competitiveness to raise crop yields profitably. Given that wheat is inherently conservative in its early growth, a sustained breeding effort was initiated to increase genetically seedling leaf area in developing novel high vigour germplasm. A recurrent selection programme was initiated by intercrossing a genetically diverse set of 28 vigorous wheat lines identified globally. These were intercrossed at random and S-1:2 progeny with the largest leaf 1 and 2 widths were intermated to develop new populations for assessment of early growth. This procedure was repeated for up to 60 segregating families per cycle across six cycles over 15 years. Thirty random S-1:2 progeny were retained from each cycle and seed-increased together to produce seed for early vigour assessment in multiple sowings. The most vigorous wheat seedlings were identified in later cycles, with some lines producing more than double the leaf area and biomass of elite commercial wheat varieties. Phenotypic selection for greater leaf width was associated with a realized significant (P < 0.01) linear increase per seedling of 0.41mm per cycle (+7.1%) for mean leaf width, and correlated linear increases in total leaf area and biomass of 4.48cm(2) per cycle (+10.3%) and 10.8mg per cycle (+5.3%), respectively. Genetic gains in widths of leaves 2 (+8.4%) and 3 (+11.5%) were significantly (P < 0.01) greater than for leaf 1 (+5.3%). Selection for greater leaf width was associated with linear increases in coleoptile tiller leaf area, small curvilinear increases in leaf 1 length, and reductions in numbers of leaves and mainstem tillers. Genetic variances were large and heritabilities high for leaf width and total leaf area in each cycle, but reduced linearly in size with selection across cycles. Coupling diverse germplasm with a simple, inexpensive, and repeatable selection process has confirmed the value of recurrent selection in developing uniquely vigorous wheat germplasm for use as parents in commercial breeding.

Twenty growing barrows (LandracexYorkshire) were randomly assigned to four groups according to the PRRS vaccination and TTS. Serum samples were collected from all pigs at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 49 post-vaccination (day 0 defined as the day of vaccination). Pigs were euthanized and samples collected at day 49 post-vaccination. The results showed that TTS tended to increase weight gain and average daily gain (ADG) of pigs (P<0.1). PRRS vaccine enhanced serum PRRSV-specific antibody, serum virus neutralizing (SVN) antibody and interferon-, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1 concentrations (P<0.05). The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA in lymph nodes were higher in TTS than in the control group after PRRS vaccine inoculation (P<0.05). TTS diet mitigated lung damage which is induced by PRRS vaccination from microscopic evaluation.

MicroRNAs are a type of single strand small non- coding RNA molecule and are implicated in the regulation of many crucial pathways during cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Here, we present a comprehensive comparison of miRNA expression profiling in three main stages during porcine spermatogenesis using high-throughput sequencing. We built three small RNA libraries for the testis, the epididymis and the ejaculated sperm from a Landrace boar, and in total obtained 3821 precursor hairpins encoding for 4761 mature miRNAs, of which 23 are miRNA*. Notably, 940 precursor miRNAs produced both the 5'- and 3'- strands as sister pairs, indicating the distinctive expression patterns of germ cell miRNAs. Additionally, 418 out of 710 co-expressed miRNAs were identified as being differentially expressed between libraries (P < 0.001). Apart from the sexual specific X chromosome, many miRNAs were found to be located on chromosome 12, which may play potential roles in spermatogenesis according to the result of synteny analysis with human and mouse. The Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of co-expressed miRNAs were highly involved in the cell cycle process, metal ion binding, modification of plasma membrane, and the p53 signal pathway.

Resistant cultivars are the most effective, economical and environmentally friendly means of controlling the disease. Chinese wheat cultivar Mianmai 37 is resistant at all growth stages to all prevalent Chinese Pst races including v26, a new Pst race virulent to resistance genes Yr24/Yr26. Genetic analysis of the F1, F2 and F2: 3 populations from a cross between Mianmai 37 and susceptible line Mingxian 169 indicated that resistance to Pst race v26 was conferred by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated yrMY37. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker analysis placed yrMY37 on chromosome 7BL near the centromere. Eight co-dominant genomic SSR markers, Xgwm400, Xwmc758, Xwmc476, Xgwm297, Xbarc267, Xwmc364, Xwmc696 and Xwmc396, were linked with yrMY37. The closest SSR loci Xbarc267 and Xgwm297 flanked the resistance gene at 0.38 and 0.78 cM, respectively. A seedling test with 22 Pst races indicated that the reaction patterns of Mianmai 37 were different from those of lines carrying resistance genes Yr2, Yr6, Yr67 and YrZH84 on chromosome 7B. As there is no recessive stripe rust resistance gene reported on 7BL so far, we believe that yrMY37 is most likely a new stripe rust resistance gene.

Effect of dietary energy and protein content on growth and carcass traits of Pekin ducks	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						carcass traits; crude protein; duck; metabolizable energy; standardized ileal digestibility	AMINO-ACID BALANCE; BROILER-CHICKENS; BODY-COMPOSITION; CRUDE PROTEIN; MEAT YIELD; PERFORMANCE; AGE; LEVEL; STARTER; DENSITY	A study was conducted to determine the influence of dietary energy and protein concentrations on growth performance and carcass traits of Pekin ducks from 15 to 35 d of age. In experiment 1, 14-d-old ducks were randomly assigned to 3 dietary metabolizable energy (11.8, 12.8, and 13.8 MJ/kg) and 3 crude protein concentrations (15, 17, and 19%) in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement (6 replicate pens; 66 ducks/pen). Carcass characteristics were evaluated on d 28, 32, and 35. In Experiment 2, 15-d-old ducks (6 replicate cages; 6 ducks/cage) were randomly allotted to the 9 diets that were remixed with 0.5% chromic oxide. Excreta were collected from d 17 to 19, and ileal digesta was collected on d 19 to determine AME(n) and amino acid digestibility. In Experiment 1, there were interactions (P < 0.05) between dietary metabolizable energy and crude protein (CP) on body weight (BW) gain and feed intake, wherein BW gain increased more to increasing dietary CP as dietary metabolizable energy increased. However, feed intake was only influenced by dietary crude protein at 11.8 MJ ME/kg and not 12.8 or 13.8 MJ/kg. As dietary CP increased from 15 to 19%, breast meat yield increased by 10.8% on d 35 (P < 0.01). Conversely, increasing metabolizable energy from 11.8 to 13.8 MJ/kg increased dressing percentage, breast skin, and subcutaneous fat, but decreased breast meat yield (% but not weight) on d 35 (P < 0.01). In Experiment 2, the determined AMEn for diets formulated to contain 11.8, 12.8, or 13.8 MJ ME/kg were 11.66, 12.68, and 13.75 MJ/kg, respectively; determined standardized ileal digestible Lys was 0.95, 1.00, and 1.21% for diets formulated to contain 15, 17, or 19% crude protein, respectively. The best body weight gain and feed conversion ratio was obtained when ducks were fed a high dietary AMEn (13.75 MJ/kg) and high CP (19%, 1.21% SID Lys). These results provide a framework for subsequent modeling of amino acid and energy inputs and the corresponding outputs of growth performance and carcass components.	[Zeng, Q.

Identification and genetic mapping of the putative Thinopyrum intermedium-derived dominant powdery mildew resistance gene PmL962 on wheat chromosome arm 2BS	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							STRIPE RUST; COMMON WHEAT; CONFERRING RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR MARKERS; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; DRAFT GENOME; BREAD WHEAT; WILD EMMER; MAP; DISEASES	Powdery resistance putatively derived from Thinopyrum intermedium in the wheat line L962 is controlled by a single dominant gene designated PmL962 and mapped to chromosome arm 2BS. Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a destructive disease affecting the production of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Powdery mildew resistance was putatively transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium to the common wheat line L962, which conferred resistance to multiple Chinese Bgt isolates. Genetic analysis of the powdery mildew response was conducted by crossing the resistant line L962 with the susceptible line L983. Disease assessments of the F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 populations from the cross L983/L962 indicated that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. A total of 373 F-2:3 lines and 781 pairs of genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were employed to determine the chromosomal location of the resistance gene. The gene was linked to four publicly available and recently developed wheat genomic SSR markers and seven EST-STS markers. The resistance gene was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS based on the locations of the linked markers. Pedigree, molecular marker and resistance response data indicated that the powdery mildew resistance gene in L962 is novel. It was temporarily designated PmL962. It is flanked by Xwmc314 and BE443737at genetic distances of 2.09 and 3.74 cM, respectively, and located in a 20.77 cM interval that is co-linear with a 269.4 kb genomic region on chromosome 5 in Brachypodium distachyon and a 223.5 kb genomic region on rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 4. The markers that are closely linked to this gene have potential applications in marker-assisted breeding.	[Shen, X. K.; Chen, W. Q.; Zhou, Y. L.; Luo, P.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae can in situ detoxify furfural to the less toxic furan methanol (FM) via the activities of multiple dehydrogenases/reductases. In this study, we report that an uncharacterized gene, YML131W, was highly induced under furfural stress conditions and that the transcription factors Yap1p, Msn2/4p, and/or Hsf1p likely controlled its upregulated expression. The induced transcription of YML131W led to higher concentrations of its encoded protein. Enzyme activity assays showed that YML131W is an aldehyde reductase that plays a role in detoxifying furfural to FM. YML131W also showed activity toward other aldehydes, suggesting that it is involved in detoxifying endogenous toxic aldehydes generated via the degradation of misfolded and damaged proteins. This detoxification role would help to maintain cell viability under furfural stress conditions. A S. cerevisiae strain overexpressing YML131W showed increased tolerance to furfural. YML131W was able to catalyze the conversion of formaldehye, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and butyaldehyde to their corresponding alcohols, indicating that it has potential applications in producing fuels such as butanol and isobutanol. A phylogenetic analysis grouped YML131W into the leukotriene B4 dehydrogenases (LTD) family, but its amino acid sequence substantially differed from those of other proteins in the LTD family. We identified 15 proteins from 14 yeast species that showed sequence similarities to YML131W. These other proteins likely have similar functions to that of YML131W and may have potential to confer tolerance to aldehyde inhibitors derived from the lignocellulosic biomass conversion process.

However, our knowledge of Schizothorax prenanti GSK-3 is very limited. In this study, we cloned and characterized the S. prenanti GSK3 beta gene. Using qPCR, we found that the GSK3 beta gene was widely expressed in eleven tissues of S. prenanti and had especially high expression levels in the liver and brain. Moreover, we screened and sequenced more than 100 positive clones to identify the alternative transcripts of GSK3 beta. Five novel isoforms of GSK3 beta were identified in different S. prenanti tissues; these were different from the GSK3 beta isoforms previously reported in the other species.

Optimization for microwave-assisted direct liquefaction of bamboo residue in glycerol/methanol mixtures	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Bamboo residue; Microwave; Liquefaction; Glycerol	WOOD LIQUEFACTION; POLYURETHANE FOAM; FEEDSTOCKS; PRODUCTS	Bamboo residues were liquefied in a mixture of glycerol and methanol in the presence of sulfuric acid using microwave energy. We investigated the effects of liquefaction conditions, including glycerol/methanol ratio, liquefaction temperature, and reaction time on the conversion yield. The optimal liquefaction conditions were under the temperature of 120 A degrees C, the reaction time of 7 min, the glycerol-methanol-bamboo ratio of 8/0/2 (W/W), and the microwave power of 300 W. Maximum conversion yield was 96.7 %. The liquid products were separated into two contents (water soluble part and precipitate part) by addition of a sufficient amount of water. By Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), the water soluble content mainly contained glycerol and its derivate and carbohydrate degradation products, and the precipitate content was mainly lignin derivatives.

Although several studies have attempted to validate reference miRNA genes in the porcine testis, spermatozoa, and other tissues, no validation studies have been carried out on ciyopreserved boar spermatozoa. In this study, 15 commonly used reference miRNA genes (5S, let-7c-5p, ssc-miR-16-5p, ssc-miR-17-5p, ssc-miR-20a, ssc-miR-23a, ssc-miR-24-3p, ssc-miR-26a, ssc-miR-27a-3p, ssc-miR-92a, ssc-miR-103-3p, ssc-miR-106a, ssc-miR-107-3p, ssc-miR-186, and ssc-miR-221-3p) were selected to evaluate the expression stability of target miRNAs in boar spermatozoa under different experimental conditions and concentrations. The stability of the expression of these reference miRNAs across each sample was evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software. The results showed that ssc-miR-186 (mean rank value = 5.00), ssc-miR-23a (5.33), and ssc-miR-27a (5.33) were the most suitable reference genes using three different statistical algorithms and comprehensive ranking. The identification of these reference miRNAs will allow for more accurate quantification of the changes in miRNA expression during cryopreservation of boar spermatozoa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Peripubertal Tibetan rams (n = 30) were randomly and equally allocated into three groups: control (no treatment); surgically castrated; or immunized against 100-mu g D-Lys6-GnRH-tandem-dimer peptide conjugated to ovalbumin in Specol adjuvant at 24 weeks of age (with a booster 8 weeks later). Blood samples (for antibody titers and hormone concentrations) were collected at 4-week intervals until rams were killed (40 weeks). Immunization triggered a good antibody response in all immunized rams (P < 0.01). Compared with intact controls, anti-GnRH immunization reduced (P < 0.01) serum concentrations of testosterone, inhibin A, LH, and FSH, and it induced testicular atrophy (suppression of spermatogenesis). Androstenone concentrations in fat tissues of GnRH-immunized rams were also rendered nondetectable (P < 0.001). Furthermore, mRNA expressions of GnRH receptor, LH-beta, and FSH-beta in the pituitary and of LH receptor, FSH receptor, and inhibin alpha and beta(A) subunits in the testes were decreased in immunized rams compared with intact controls (P < 0.05). This was apparently the first report that active immunization against GnRH-tandem-dimer-ovalbumin conjugate in Specol adjuvant was an effective alternative to surgical castration for Tibetan rams under practical Tibetan plateau conditions.

J	Xiao, X; Li, T; Zhang, RR				Xiao, Xin; Li, Tao; Zhang, Ruirui			An immune optimization based real-valued negative selection algorithm	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Anomaly detection; Artificial immune system; Negative selection algorithm; Detector generation; Immune optimization	SYSTEMS	Negative selection algorithms are important for artificial immune systems to produce detectors. But there are problems such as high time complexity, large number of detectors, a lot of redundant coverage between detectors in traditional negative selection algorithms, resulting in low efficiency for detectors' generation and limitations in the application of immune algorithms. Based on the distribution of self set in morphological space, the algorithm proposed in this paper introduces the immune optimization mechanism, and produces candidate detectors hierarchically from far to near, with selves as the center. First, the self set is regarded as the evolution population. After immune optimization operations, detectors of the first level are generated which locate far away from the self space and cover larger non-self space, achieving that fewer detectors cover as much non-self space as possible. Then, repeat the process to obtain the second level detectors which locate close to detectors of the first level and near the self space and cover smaller non-self space, reducing detection loopholes. By analogy, qualified detector set will be obtained finally. In detectors' generation process, the random production range of detectors is limited, and the self-reaction rate between candidate detectors is smaller, which effectively reduces the number of mature detectors and redundant coverage. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the time complexity is linear with the size of self set, which greatly reduces the influence of growth of self scales over the time complexity. Experimental results show that IO-RNSA has better time efficiency and generation quality than classical negative selection algorithms, and improves detection rate and decreases false alarm rate.

However, the genetic determinants of these traits remain unknown. An HPT restorer line, HP, which is derived from multiple hybridizations between indica and japonica rice cultivars, was used in this study. Two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs), qGNPP1-1 and qFLW1-1, which control grain number per panicle and flag leaf width, respectively, were detected by QTL analysis on the same interval of chromosome 1 between markers RM3521 and RM8111 using an F-2 population derived from the cross HP x Nipponbare. Thus, a single QTL, designated qLG1 (Leaf width and grain number 1), was presumed to control both traits. The locus qLG1 showed segregation as a single locus in the BC5F2 line, which was obtained by backcrossing, molecular marker-assisted selection, and confirmation with the BCnF2 population. Location of the locus was narrowed down to the 1,137-kb region between the markers InDel13 and InDel18. It is hypothesized that qLG1 is a non-cloned locus, on the basis of published QTLs, located in the interval between InDel13 and InDel18. The locus qLG1 provides novel genetic material suitable for use in molecular-assisted breeding of HPT rice and may be useful to elucidate the molecular basis of high yield in HPT hybrid rice and in future research on crosstalk among genes involved in panicle development.

In this study, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), i.e., Funneliformis mosseae, isolated from Populus euphratica distributed in a tailing of Pb/Zn ore, was introduced to investigate its effects on sex-specific responses of P. cathayana in morphology, physiology, and Pb phytoremediation capacity, when exposed to a diffused level of Pb pollution (100 mg Pb2+ kg(-1) dry soil). Symbiosis with exotic AMF did not significantly affect growth of both sexes and biomass allocation. However, when inoculated with AMF, both sexes absorbed more P, but not N in the roots, especially when exposed to the exogenous addition of Pb. The improvement of nutrient status under such conditions might be associated with a further increase in activity of antioxidant enzymes (particularly for superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)), and the mitigation of oxidation stress induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also observed that exotic AMF could promote the uptake and accumulation of Pb in roots of females, but not in that of males. Therefore, under this diffused pollution level, the infected females might be more suitable for remediation of this metal than infected males, due to the higher capacity of HM accumulation without obvious negative effects on growth and physiological traits. Moreover, field surveys are needed to testify our experimental results, due to diversity of soil microbial community and complexities of their interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A set of indicator system based on energy and money and quality were proposed to describe these complex interactions between them. The results show that (I) Productivity of crop production system in China has been obviously enhanced through limited manpower inputs. However, this case leads to increasing share of fossil energy related agricultural supplies in the total agricultural investment. Moreover, fossil energy has an increasing contribution to the total energy use, which makes pollution emissions derived from fossil energy production and use become the largest contributor to the total emissions, especially thermal power production. Meanwhile, direct emissions from fuel energy use should be also emphasized. In terms of emission amount, thermal power and fertilizers production has the largest impact on atmospheric environment; thermal power production also contributes the largest to solid wastes; fuel oil production has the largest effect on the water environment; (2) the emission intensity of energy consumption in China's crop production system has risen; (3) the structure coordination degree of crop production system in China has been greatly enhanced; however, its scale harmony degree has no obvious changes. Therefore, the sustainability of China's crop production system is being challenged by unreasonable energy mix, high emission intensity of energy consumption and bad scale harmony degree. Finally, the related issues are discussed and some beneficial suggestions are put forward. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Immune inhibitory receptors, particularly programmed death 1/programmed death-ligands (PD-1/PD-Ls) are presumably involved in the immunopathogenesis of PMWS. The aim of this investigation was to examine the relationship of immune inhibitory receptors and immunocompromised by PMWS. Nine 45-day-old conventional pigs were selected from a farm where pigs exhibited typical signs of PMWS (wasting and respiratory disorders) and tested positive for PCV2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Six pigs were selected as controls due to their notably healthy state and absence of PCV2 infection. Heparinized blood samples were taken from each pig for pathogen detection and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), from which mRNA expression of immunomodulatory molecule (PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, PTEN, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and Foxp3) and cytokines (IL-10, IL-2, and IFN-gamma) was determined. Proliferation of PBMCs was also assessed by flow cytometry utilizing cellular labeling dilutions for detection. The mRNA levels of PD-L1 (p<0.01), PD-L2 (p<0.05), and PTEN (p<0.01) were remarkably increased in the PBMCs of diseased pigs compared to healthy pigs, whereas no change was observed for PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and Foxp3 expression. Cytokine IL-10 mRNA levels were significantly elevated (p<0.01), while IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels tended to be only slightly increased in the PBMCs of affected pigs compared to healthy controls. The proliferation of PBMCs was also decreased in diseased pigs. These data suggest that overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA is one mechanism by which immunosupression of PMWS pigs occurs, supporting a new therapeutic strategy focused on PD-Ls for pigs suffering from PMWS.

We studied mass losses, humic substances, humic acid, fulvic acids, as well humification degrees and humification ratios in six foliar litters with a field litterbag experiment from the gap center, canopy gap and expanded gap to the closed canopy in winter and the growing season in an alpine forest of the east Tibetan Plateau. Humification degrees of 18%45% for birch, 15%-40% for fir, 8%-30% for willow, 14%-26% for cypress, 9%-25% for larch and 7%-19% for azalea foliar litter were observed in forest gaps and the closed canopy over one year of incubation. Small amounts of humic substances accumulated in winter, whereas considerable humic acid accumulated, but fulvic acid mineralized during the growing season. Compared with the closed canopy, foliar litter humification in forest gaps was lower in winter but greater in the growing season, implying a dual role of forest gaps in carbon sequestration between winter and the growing season. Carbon sequestration could be accelerated in forest gaps. Reduced snow cover under a scenario of winter warming would stimulate soil carbon storage in these alpine forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, eighteen cross-bred (Landrace x Yorkshire) primiparous sows were fed a control (CON), DLM or HMTBA diet (n 6 per diet) from 0 to 14 d post-partum. At postnatal day 14, piglets in the HMTBA group had higher body weight (P=0.02) than those in the CON group, tended (P=0.07) to be higher than those in the DLM group, and had higher (P<0.05) mRNA abundance of jejunal fatty acid-binding protein 2, intestinal than those in the CON and DLM groups. Compared with the CON diet-fed sows, milk protein, non-fat solid, and lysine, histidine and ornithine concentrations decreased in the DLM diet-fed sows (P<0.05), and milk fat, lactose, and cysteine and taurine concentrations increased in the HMTBA diet-fed sows (P<0.05). Plasma homocysteine and urea N concentrations that averaged across time were increased (P<0.05) in sows fed the DLM diet compared with those fed the CON diet. Metabolomic results based on H-1 NMR spectroscopy revealed that consumption of the HMTBA and DLM diets increased (P<0.05) both sow plasma methionine and valine levels; however, consumption of the DLM diet led to lower (P<0.05) plasma levels of lysine, tyrosine, glucose and acetate and higher (P<0.05) plasma levels of citrate, lactate, formate, glycerol, myo-inositol and N-acetyl glycoprotein in sows. Collectively, neonatal growth and milk synthesis were regulated by dietary methionine levels and sources, which resulted in marked alterations in amino acid, lipid and glycogen metabolism.

However, its productivity is challenged by various biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal diseases, insects, drought, salinity, and cold. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in different tissues and at various developmental stages in plants and animals, and they can be identified and classified into families according to their structural and specialized DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Transcription factors are important regulatory components of the genome, and are the main targets for engineering stress tolerance. Results: In total, 2407 putative TFs were identified from wheat expressed sequence tags, and then classified into 63 families by using Hmm searches against hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles. In this study, 2407 TFs represented approximately 2.22% of all genes in the wheat genome, a smaller proportion than those reported for other cereals in PlantTFDB V3.0 (3.33%-5.86%) and PlnTFDB (4.30%-6.46%). We assembled information from the various databases for individual TFs, including annotations and details of their developmental stage-and tissue-specific expression patterns. Based on this information, we identified 1257 developmental stage-specific TFs and 1104 tissue-specific TFs, accounting for 52.22% and 45.87% of the 2407 wheat TFs, respectively. We identified 338, 269, 262, 175, 49, and 18 tissue-specific TFs in the flower, seed, root, leaf, stem, and crown, respectively. There were 100, 6, 342, 141, 390, and 278 TFs specifically expressed at the dormant seed, germinating seed, reproductive, ripening, seedling, and vegetative stages, respectively. We constructed a comprehensive database of wheat TFs, designated as WheatTFDB (http://xms.sicau.edu.cn/wheatTFDB/). Conclusions: Approximately 2.22% (2407 genes) of all genes in the wheat genome were identified as TFs, and were clustered into 63 TF families. We identified 1257 developmental stage-specific TFs and 1104 tissue-specific TFs, based on information about their developmental-and tissue-specific expression patterns obtained from publicly available gene expression databases. The 2407 wheat TFs and their annotations are summarized in our database, WheatTFDB. These data will be useful identifying target TFs involved in the stress response at a particular stage of development.

In this study, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, nucleotide contents and effective number of codon (ENC) values were calculated and compared among open reading frames (ORFs) of 53 DuCV genomes. The results reveal that most of the codons are ended with C and the overall bias is not remarkable in DuCV. A comparative analysis of codon contents and ENC values indicates that mutation pressure is the most significant factor responsible for the evolutional processes of codon usage bias in DuCV. However, other factors, such as composition constraints, translation selection, hydrophobicity and aromaticity should not be ignored. Finally principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering method were performed based on RSCU. The significant difference of codon usage bias exists in DuCV-1 and DuCV-2 genotypes, but codon usage pattern of DuCV from the different epidemic areas or subtypes fails to influence the formation of codon usage bias. Analysis of the relationship of synonymous codon usage variation based on the two genotypes suggests that DuCV-2 is more conservative than DuCV-1, which may because of recombination events. Moreover, there are distinct differences in the degree of codon usage pattern evolution in different function genes, rep and cap. Therefore, the genotypes, subtypes and different functional genes also relate to the pattern of synonymous codon usage. The main objective of this study is to provide some sight into synonymous codon usage characteristics and the evolutionary relationship of DuCV. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we cloned a cDNA and the genomic locus of the porcine GPIHBP1 gene, and investigated its tissue expression pattern and its genetic effects on adipose traits. Porcine GPIHBP1 exhibits a four-exon/three-intron structure, including a 543 bp open reading frame that encodes 180 amino acids. The porcine GPIHBP1 protein shows 49%-65% homology and shares the major conserved structural domains of GPIHBP1 proteins in other mammals. Porcine GPIHBP1 mRNA levels were high in the adipose tissue, muscle and lung, and higher mRNA levels were observed in sows compared to boars in adipose tissues of the inner and outer layers of subcutaneous fat, abdominal fat, and suet fat. The mRNA expression pattern of porcine GPIHBP1 and LPL genes was similar in most tissues except for the lung. Thirty six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the porcine GPIHBP1 gene. Association analyses showed that the g.-255G>C and g.-6261>G SNPs are associated with intramuscular fat content, and that the g.-1557T>C and g.-1948G>A SNPs are associated with back fat thickness. In conclusion, porcine GPIHBP1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue, muscle and lung, and gender affects GPIHBP1 mRNA expression levels; furthermore, four GPIHBP1 SNPs are genetic factors affecting adipose traits.

Wheat hybrid necrosis is an interesting genetic phenomenon observed frequency and it is lethal or semi lethal, resulting in gradual death or loss of productivity. However, the molecular basis and mechanisms associated with hybrid necrosis in wheat are still not well understood. Here, we report the population and expression profiles of miRNAs in wheat hybrid necrosis. We identified a total of 57 conserved miRNA families as well as 182 putative novel miRNAs. Expression profiling revealed that expression of 49 known miRNAs and 165 novel miRNAs was changed in hybrid necrosis. And the expression levels of some miRNAs and their predicated targets have been confirmed by qRT-PCR. These results indicate that these miRNAs, especially miR159, miR166, miR167 and miR5072 could be involved in the extensive regulation of gene expression in response to hybrid necrosis.

Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis Provides Novel Insights into Myostatin Regulation at Three Different Mouse Developmental Timepoints	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MUSCLE-FIBER-TYPE; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION; THYMOSIN BETA-4; MICROARRAY DATA; PROBE LEVEL; SKELETAL; GROWTH; EXPRESSION; CELLS; MICE	Myostatin (Mstn) knockout mice exhibit large increases in skeletal muscle mass. However, relatively few of the genes that mediate or modify MSTN effects are known. In this study, we performed co-expression network analysis using whole transcriptome microarray data from MSTN-null and wild-type mice to identify genes involved in important biological processes and pathways related to skeletal muscle and adipose development. Genes differentially expressed between wild-type and MSTN-null mice were further analyzed for shared DNA motifs using DREME. Differentially expressed genes were identified at 13.5 d.p.c. during primary myogenesis and at d35 during postnatal muscle development, but not at 17.5 d.p.c. during secondary myogenesis. In total, 283 and 2034 genes were differentially expressed at 13.5 d.p.c. and d35, respectively. Over-represented transcription factor binding sites in differentially expressed genes included SMAD3, SP1, ZFP187, and PLAGL1. The use of regulatory (RIF) and phenotypic (PIF) impact factor and differential hubbing co-expression analyses identified both known and potentially novel regulators of skeletal muscle growth, including Apobec2, Atp2a2, and Mmp13 at d35 and Sox2, Tmsb4x, and Vdac1 at 13.5 d.p.c. Among the genes with the highest PIF scores were many fiber type specifying genes. The use of RIF, PIF, and differential hubbing analyses identified both known and potentially novel regulators of muscle development. These results provide new details of how MSTN may mediate transcriptional regulation as well as insight into novel regulators of MSTN signal transduction that merit further study regarding their physiological roles in muscle and adipose development.

However, so far most detection methods rely on antibody-based immunoassays and are usually laborious and time-consuming with poor sensitivity. Here, we developed a simple and ultra-sensitive method to detect a biomarker protein-thrombin by taking advantage of the fluorescent probe Perylene tetracarboxylic acid diimide (PTCDI) derivatives and thrombin aptamer. The water-soluble dye PTCDI shows strong fluorescence in buffer solution for the existence of free dye monomer, but becomes weak after aggregation through self-assembly on nucleic acid aptamer. In the presence of thrombin, it specifically binds to thrombin aptamer which causes the conformational transition between aptamer and PTCDI and results in a significant fluorescence recovery. The results showed that as low as 40 pM of thrombin could be detected by this method. The high sensitivity of the developed sensing system mainly attributes to the ultra-sensitivity of the fluorescence intensity changes of PTCDI. With the specificity of aptamer, the assay exhibited high selectivity for thrombin against three other proteins (bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, mouse IgG) and 1% diluted fetal bovine serum. The detection method might be extended to sensitive detection of a variety of proteins for its advantages of isothermal conditions required, simple and rapid without multiple separation and washing steps.

We previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene Pid2, which encodes a transmembrane receptor-like kinase containing an extracellular B-lectin domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. However, little is known about Pid2-mediated signaling. Results: Here we report the functional characterization of the U-box/ARM repeat protein OsPUB15 as one of the PID2-binding proteins. We found that OsPUB15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of PID2 (PID2K) in vitro and in vivo and the ARM repeat domain of OsPUB15 was essential for the interaction. In vitro biochemical assays indicated that PID2K possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate OsPUB15. We also found that the phosphorylated form of OsPUB15 possessed E3 ligase activity. Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPUB15 was constitutively expressed and its encoded protein OsPUB15 was localized in cytosol. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsPUB15 at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains. We also observed that, along with plant growth, the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype. Conclusions: These results reveal that the E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance.

By applying the Infinium iSelect 9K SNP assay, we have constructed a high-density genetic linkage map with 269 F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed between a Chinese cornerstone wheat breeding parental line Yanda1817 and a high-yielding line Beinong6. The map contains 2431 SNPs and 128 SSR & EST-SSR markers in a total coverage of 3213.2 cM with an average interval of 1.26 cM per marker. Eighty-eight QTLs for thousand-grain weight (TGW), grain length (GL), grain width (GW) and grain thickness (GT) were detected in nine ecological environments (Beijing, Shijiazhuang and Kaifeng) during five years between 2010-2014 by inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) (LOD >= 2.5). Among which, 17 QTLs for TGW were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4A, 4D, 5A, 5B and 6B with phenotypic variations ranging from 2.62% to 12.08%. Four stable QTLs for TGW could be detected in five and seven environments, respectively. Thirty-two QTLs for GL were mapped on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3B, 3D, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5A, 5B, 6B, 7A and 7B, with phenotypic variations ranging from 2.62% to 44.39%. QGl. cau-2A. 2 can be detected in all the environments with the largest phenotypic variations, indicating that it is a major and stable QTL. For GW, 12 QTLs were identified with phenotypic variations range from 3.69% to 12.30%. We found 27 QTLs for GT with phenotypic variations ranged from 2.55% to 36.42%. In particular, QTL QGt. cau-5A. 1 with phenotypic variations of 6.82-23.59% was detected in all the nine environments. Moreover, pleiotropic effects were detected for several QTL loci responsible for grain shape and size that could serve as target regions for fine mapping and marker assisted selection in wheat breeding programs.

Nicotianamine (NA) is considered as the chelate substance in the transport of Fe. In the present study, a gene encoding putative nicotianamine synthase (NAS) is isolated from Malus xiaojinensis and designated as MxNAS2. The MxNAS2 gene encodes a protein of 325 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 36.2 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.18. Subcellular localization reveals that MxNAS2 is preferentially localized in vesicles and cytoplasmic membrane. The expression of MxNAS2 is more enriched in leaf, root, and phloem than xylem, which is highly affected by Fe stress and indoleacetic acid (IAA) treatment, whereas, weakly affected by abscisic acid (ABA) treatmentin M. xiaojinensis seedlings. When MxNAS2 was introduced into tobacco, it promotes the synthesis of NAS and increases NA and chlorophyll contents. Overexpression of MxNAS2 improves the tolerance to Fe stress in transgenic tobacco, but leads to delayed flowering. Higher levels of MxNAS2 expression in transgenic tobacco contribute to misshapen flowers and increased levels of Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in leaf and flower. In addition to its role in metal transport in plants, NA may be involved in the regulation of metal transfer within cells. These results suggest that NA excess influences the functions of metal-requiring proteins, including some of the transcription factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As an excellent producer of several enzymes and vitamins, Bacillus subtilis imparts various advantages to animals. In our previous study, we determined that several strains of B. subtilis isolated from pandas exhibited good cellulose decomposition ability, and we hypothesized that this bacterial species can survive in and adapt well to a high-fiber environment. To evaluate this hypothesis, we employed RNA-Seq technology to analyze the differentially expressed genes of the selected strain B. subtilis HH2, which demonstrates significant cellulose hydrolysis of different carbon sources (cellulose and glucose). In addition, we used bioinformatics software and resources to analyze the functions and pathways of differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, comparison of the cellulose and glucose groups revealed that the up-regulated genes were involved in amino acid and lipid metabolism or transmembrane transport, both of which are involved in cellulose utilization. Conversely, the down-regulated genes were involved in non-essential functions for bacterial life, such as toxin and bacteriocin secretion, possibly to conserve energy for environmental adaptation. The results indicate that B. subtilis HH2 triggered a series of adaptive mechanisms at the transcriptional level, which suggests that this bacterium could act as a probiotic for pandas fed a high-fiber diet, despite the fact that cellulose is not a very suitable carbon source for this bacterial species. In this study, we present a model to understand the dynamic organization of and interactions between various functional and regulatory networks for unicellular organisms in a high-fiber environment.

P assimilation characteristics and the related mechanisms of Polygonum hydropiper were investigated in hydroponic media containing various concentrations of Po (1-8 mmol L-1) supplied as phytate. The mining ecotype (ME) showed significantly higher biomass in both shoots and roots compared to the non-mining ecotype (N ME) at 4, 6, and 8 m mol L-1. Shoot P content of both ecotypes increased up to 4 mmol L-1 while root P content increased continually up to 8 mmol L-1 for the ME and up to 6 mmol L-1 for the NME. Root P content of the ME exceeded 1% dry weight under 6 and 8 mmol L-1. The ME had significantly higher P accumulation in both shoots and roots compared to the N ME supplied with 6 and 8 mmol L-1. The ME showed higher total root length, specific root length, root surface area, root volume, and displayed significantly greater root length, root surface area, and root volume of lateral roots compared to the NME grown in all Po treatments. Average diameter of lateral roots was 0.17-19 mm for the ME and 0.18-0.21 mm for the NME. Greater acid phosphatase and phytase activities were observed in the ME grown under different levels of Po relative to the NME. This indicated fine root morphology, enhanced acid phosphatase and phytase activities might be adaptations to high Po media. Results from this study establish that the ME of P hydropiper is capable of assimilating P from Po media and is a potential material for phytoremediation of polluted area with high Po.

The objective of this work was to elucidate rDNA disrtibution pattern and investigate genomic composition of polyploids in 16 Rubus taxa (2n = 2x, 3x, 4x, 8x) of two subgenera Idaeobatus and Malachobatus by ISH method. Results: The basic Rubus genome had one 45S rDNA locus, and all the polyploids (except R. setchuenensis) had the expected multiples of this number. Diploid and tetraploid Rubus taxa carried two 5S rDNA, whereas the triploid and octoploid species only had three. The duplicated 45S rDNA sites tended to be conserved, whereas those of 5S rDNA tended to be eliminated after polyploidization. The accession R03-20 was an autotriploid R. parvifolius, while R03-27 and R03-57 were naturally-occurred triploid hybrids between R. parvifolius and R. coreanus. GISH results suggested that R. parvifolius had close relationship with polyploids from Malachobatus. Conclusions: The polyploids from Malachobatus were probable allopolyploid. In addition, Rubus parvifolius might be involved in hybridization, polyploidization and speciation of some Idaeobatus and Malachobatus species.

However, SCA may cause several adverse effects, including reproductive toxicity. The present study was designed to assess the mechanism by which SCA cause reproductive toxicity in female mice. The general reproductive toxicity testing was accomplished in female Kunming mice. The animals were divided into four groups: three groups that were treated by oral gavage with 135, 270, and 540 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) of SCA prepared in physiological saline, respectively, and one vehicle control group that was treated with physiological saline only. The gestational toxicity tests were conducted at 540 mg.kg(-1).d(-1). The general reproductive toxicity results showed that the pregnancy rate of the SCA-treated group decreased with the pregnancy rate being decreased by 70% at 540 mg.kg(-1).d(-1). SCA elicited maternal toxicity in the ovary and the uterus, but no fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed. The rates of implantation in the early, middle, and late pregnancy were all decreased, with stillbirths and maternal deaths being observed. Histopathological changes showed that SCA adversely affected the ovary and the uterus, hi conclusion, SCA-induced reproductive toxicity in female mice is most likely caused by its damage to the ovary and the uterus.

The full-length coding sequence of kerD consists of 1,251 bp and encodes a protein with 416 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 43,831 Da. A DNA fragment encoding mature kerD without its signal sequence was inserted into the expression vector pET30a(+) and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified to approximately 100% purity using Ni-IDA affinity chromatography, and identified by Western blot. The recombinant enzyme had an optimal pH of 8.0 and was stable at pH 7.0-9.0. It exhibited an optimal temperature for activity of 70 degrees C and was stable at 30-50 degrees C. It was highly inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium dodecyl sulphate, but activated by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Mg2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, dithiothreitol, Triton X-100, dimethyl sulfoxide and isopropyl alcohol. The recombinant enzyme could hydrolyse a broad range of protein substrates.

Variation in chloroplast DNA sequence was used to obtain information regarding the genetic diversity and structure of populations of M. sirzensis in southwest China. Chloroplast DNA, trnL-F and rp120-rps12 sequences from seventy-five individuals representing 14 populations of M. sinensis were used to study the sequence variation. Seven haplotypes and 16 polymorphic sites (2.7%) were identified. Five substitutions, 6 indels, and 5 existing substitutions and indels sites, were detected through splicing these two gene segments. The genetic diversity within the studied populations (diversity of haploids, h = 0.561, nucleotide diversity, pi = 0.00504) was low, this may be affected by the relatively larger effect of genetic drift on the chloroplast DNA, reflecting smaller effective populations than nuclear DNA. Genetic variance within the populations was higher than that between the populations, suggesting that higher gene flow may exist within these populations. The results of parsimony network in seven haplotypes indicated that H1 and H2 may be ancient haplotypes, which may help guide future research on the origin of M. sinensis. Our results provide information on the genetic diversity and structure of M. sinensis and may assist future studies on the phylogeography of M. sinensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

POACEAE; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; SPECIES TRITICEAE; SIBIRICUS POACEAE; RAPD VARIATION; DIVERSITY; CANINUS; CONSERVATION; POLYMORPHISM	Elymus breviaristatus, a short-lived perennial grass species with ecological importance and forage value, is narrowly distributed in a few locations in the natural grassland of southeast of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Its populations are declining due to habitat loss and grassland degradation. This project is aim to investigate genetic diversity and genetic structure of this species for its conservation and management, using SSR data obtained from seven natural populations sampled from southeast of QTP. Seventeen selected primer pairs generated a total of 166 polymorphic bands. The Shannon diversity was comparably low within populations (0.115), but higher at the species level (0.251). An obvious population structure and high level of genetic differentiation (AMOVA-derived Phi(ST) = 0.48, G/(ST) = 0.54 from Shannon index) were detected by clustering, principle coordinate analysis and STRCTURE. All clustering approaches supported a demarcation of the seven populations into four major clades which failed to correspond to their geographical origin. The Mantel test revealed no significant isolation by distance (IBD) when used pairwise-Phi(ST) (r = 0.149) as genetic distance, which indicating that geographical separation do not act as barriers for gene flow. Self-fertilization is considered to be the major factor contributing to high genetic divergence within this species. Furthermore, habitat destruction and limited seed dispersal due to increasing anthropogenic pressure on the species may play an important role in shaping present distribution of genetic diversity. Suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Four degrees of active burrow densities were classified to evaluate pika populations and biomass allocation interactions. Our results showed that plant composition, overall vegetation height and cover, dominant species were significantly different among four sites. Additionally, plant functional groups, above ground, below ground and total biomass, root:shoot ratios and the living roots proportion were the greatest at the zero-density site, and those at the medium-density site were the lowest. We postulate that pika activities may not be the cause of the differences, but a symptom of grassland degradation. Further, pika population fluctuations should be monitored, and when the population exceeds the economic threshold of low-density (110 pikas or/and 512 active burrows ha(-1)) or reaches high-density (200 pikas or/and 1360 active burrows ha(-1)), integrated management strategies should be implemented to protect damage.

The results from the serial kinetics demonstrated that MA could directly inactivate the enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner and a typical non-competitive type, as well as in a fast inactivate process without detectable time course. The tertiary conformation study with an application of spectrofluorimetry showed that MA modulated the tertiary structural conformation of alpha-glucosidase both on the overall and on regional active site pocket, which monitored by red-shift intrinsic fluorescence peak with decreases intensities, and the significant intensity increasing of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS)-binding fluorescence, respectively. To have more insight, we also adapted the computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that MA was located in the entrance of active pocket for the catalytic reaction and blocked the passage of substrate. It confirmed that MA inhibits as a non-competitive type, not direct docking to the glucose binding site. Our study provides important molecular mechanisms to figure out alpha-glucosidase inhibition that might associate to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus drug.

Fluctuations of the ecogeographical environment and major hydrographic formations might have promoted the formation of new subspecies or species. In order to understand the impact of plateau uplift on freshwater fish evolutionary history, we estimated the genetic diversity and population structure in two subspecies of Schizopygopsis chengi (S. c. chengi and S. c. baoxingensis) in upper Yangtze River in Tibetan Plateau area using mitochondrial DNA control region and eight microsatellite markers, which suggested that there was a close genetic relationship. S. chengi showed some significant genetic structure that did not correlate with geographic distance. Bayesian assignment tests indicated that S. chengi samples in the study could be divided into four populations: upstream population, midstream population, tributary population and S. c. baoxingensis population. S. c. chengi and S. c. baoxingensis showed significant genetic divergence. However, phylogenetic analysis, population structure analysis and historical gene flow estimation suggested that there was close genetic relationship between S. c. baoxingensis and the Dawei population which belongs to populations of S. c. chengi. The time that Dawei population suffered from a bottleneck and S. c. baoxingensis underwent population expansion was congruent with the last glacial period on the Tibetan Plateau. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the Dawei River and Baoxing River were once connected, and the Dawei and Baoxing populations originated from a single population, but were isolated into separate populations because of crustal movements and the Baoxing population evolved as S. c. baoxingensis.

Our findings showed that Mn stress could decrease plant growth, cause serious chlorosis and injury the photosynthetic apparatus. An increase of Mn accumulation and the inhibition of the K and Ca absorption and the Mg, Fe and Zn translocation were observed under Mn stress. Also, there was a considerable increase in H2O2 and TBARS (thiobarbituric acidreactive substances) content in both the roots and leaves under Mn condition. The combination of SA and Mn treatment decreased the transport of Mn, Fe and Zn from roots to shoots and increased the Ca absorption and Mg translocation. In antioxidant system, such as CAT, APX, GR, DHAR, GSH and AsA, the combined treatment significantly increased the antioxidant content and antioxidative enzyme activities compared to the Mn stress alone. The level of ROS and lipid peroxidation significantly decreased under the combination of SA and Mn. These results suggested that SA-induced Mn tolerances in polish wheat are mainly by inhibiting Mn translocation, enhancing enzymatic activities and nonenzymatic antioxidants contents, and regulating nutrient absorption and distribution in plants.

In this study, we found that porcine Akirin2 (pAkirin2) mRNA level was significantly higher in fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and longissimus lumborum (LL) muscles than in slow soleus (SOL) muscle of pigs. Overexpression of pAkirin2 increased the number of myosin heavy chain (MHC)-positive cells, indicating that pAkirin2 promoted myoblast differentiation. We also found that overexpression of pAkirin2 increased the mRNA expressions of MHCI and MHCIIa and decreased the mRNA expression of MHCIIb. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) are the major downstream effectors of calcineurin. Here we also observed that the mRNA expressions of MEF2C and NFATc1 were notably elevated by pAkirin2 overexpression. Together, our data indicate that the role of pAkirin2 in modulating MHCI and MHCIIa expressions may be achieved through calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling pathway.

Here, we cloned the full-length cDNA of goose TLR7 and carried out a molecular characterization of goose TLR7. The goose TLR7 gene is 3900 bp and encodes a 1045 amino acid protein with high homology to poultry (93% to duck and 83% to chicken). Similar conclusions were made by phylogenetic analysis. The predicted protein secondary structure of goose TLR7 contained a conserved Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain and characteristic leucine-rich repeat regions, which has also been reported for duck TLR7. Additionally, the tissue distribution of goose TLR7 suggests that immune-associated tissues, especially the cecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius, have high goose TLR7 expression levels. Goose TLR7 is abundantly expressed in lung tissues, which is distinct from its expression in chickens. Similar to duck TLR7, goose spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) exposed to the mammalian TLR7 agonists R848 and Imiquimod showed significant induction of the production of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-alpha. New type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) infection resulted in high mRNA expression levels of goose TLR7 in the spleen. By contrast, no direct interaction between NGVEV and goose TLR7 was detected after infecting goose spleen MNCs with NGVEV in vitro. However, triggering of goose TLR7 resulted in the rapid up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-viral molecules, suggesting that goose TLR7 plays an important role in anti-viral defense.

Due to factors such as morphological stasis, convergent morphological evolution, and disjunct distributions, relationships within Saxifragaceae have historically been troublesome. The family occurs primarily in mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest generic and species diversity in western North America, but disjunct taxa are known from southern South America. Here, we integrate broad gene (56 loci) and taxon (223 species) sampling strategies, both the most comprehensive to date within Saxifragaceae, with fossil calibrations and geographical distribution data to address relationships, divergence times, and historical biogeography among major lineages of Saxifragaceae. Two previously recognized main clades, the heucheroids (eight groups + Saniculiphyllum) and saxifragoids (Saxifraga s.s.), were re-affirmed by our phylogenetic analyses. Relationships among the eight heucheroid groups, as well as the phylogenetic position of Saniculiphyllum within the heucheroids, were resolved with mostly high support. Divergence time estimates indicate that Saxifragaceae began to diversify ca. 38.37 million years ago (Mya; 95% HPD = 30.99-46.11 Mya) in the Mid-Late Eocene, and that the two major lineages, the heucheroids and saxifragoids, began to diversify approximately 30.04 Mya (95% HPD = 23.87-37.15 Mya) and 30.85 Mya (95% HPD = 23.47-39.33 Mya), respectively. We reconstructed ancestral geographic areas using statistical dispersal-vicariance (S-DIVA). These analyses indicate several radiations within Saxifragaceae: one in eastern Asia and multiple radiations in western North America. Our results also demonstrate that large amounts of sequence data coupled with broad taxon sampling can help resolve clade relationships that have thus far seemed intractable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Although vaccines are widely applied to control the infection, outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) repeatedly happen. Currently, there are no alternative control measures available for ND. In the present study, we found that sulfated Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharide (sCVPS) were potent inhibitors of NDV in specific pathogen free chickens infected with a virulent strain. With sCVPS treatment, the survival rate increased by almost 20% and virus titers in test organs, including brain, lung, spleen and thymus, were significantly decreased. The sCVPS also exhibited the ability to prevent viral transmission by reducing the amount of virus shed in saliva and feces. Higher concentrations of interferon alpha and gamma in serum were detected in chickens treated with sCVPS, indicating that one of the antiviral mechanisms may be attributed to the property of immunoenhancement. Histopathological examination showed that sCVPS could alleviate the tissue lesions caused by NDV infection. These results suggest that sCVPS are expected to be a new alternative control measure for NDV infection and further studies could be carried out to evaluate the antiviral activity of sCVPS against other paramyxoviruses.

JIAN; OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; GENE-EXPRESSION; JUVENILE JIAN; BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS	The muscle is the main portion of fish that is consumed by humans. Copper (Cu) can induce oxidative damage in fish muscle. However, the effects of Cu exposure on the muscle antioxidant system and molecular patterns and preventive measures against these effects remain unclear. In this study, ROS production, enzymatic and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling-related molecules, antioxidant response element (ARE) binding ability, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activities were analyzed in fish muscle following Cu exposure or myo-inositol (MI) pre-administration. The results indicated that contamination due to copper exposure caused an approximately three-fold increase in ROS production, induced lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, and resulted in depletion of the glutathione (GSH) content of fish muscle. Moreover, Cu exposure caused decreases in the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZnSOD, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) that were accompanied by decreases in CuZnSOD, GPx1a, GPx1b and signaling factor protein kinase C delta mRNA levels. The decreases in the antioxidant enzyme gene mRNA levels were confirmed to be partly due to the reduced nuclear Nrf2 protein levels, poor ARE binding ability and increased caspase-3 signaling-modulated DNA fragmentation in the fish muscle. Interestingly, MI pre-treatment prevented fish muscle from Cu-induced oxidative damages mainly through increasing the GSH content, and increasing the CuZnSOD and GPx activities and corresponding mRNA levels and ARE binding ability. Taken together, our results show for the first time that Cu exposure caused oxidative damage to the muscle by decreasing the antioxidant enzyme activities via the down-regulation of the expression of genes related to the disruption of the Nrf2/ARE signaling, and this down-regulation was partially caused by caspase-3-regulated DNA fragmentation. Finally, MI protects fish against Cu toxicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of 8 elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Ca, K, and Na were the most abundant elements. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to reduce the dimensionality of the multielement data from 8 to 2 while retaining the highest possible variance. Using PCA and LDA, 69.66% and 91.30%, respectively, of the pomelo origins were classified correctly using multielement variables, along with 67.06% and 83.40% for soil multielement analysis. Results indicated that the LDA method was more effective for geographical origin classification than PCA. The results of the multielement component test demonstrated its capability to screen pomelo origins rapidly. Practical Application This paper reports that multielement fingerprinting coupled with multivariate statistics can be an effective tool for pomelo authentication, and that applying multielement testing to the discrimination of pomelo origins is possible.

A case study in juvenile hybrid catfish Silurus meridionalis-asotus and the progenitors	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Cannibalism; Heritability; Cannibalistic polyphenism; Food quantity; Size heterogeneity; Silurus	ORANGE-SPOTTED GROUPER; PREY SIZE-SELECTIVITY; SIBLING CANNIBALISM; CLARIAS-GARIEPINUS; INTRACOHORT CANNIBALISM; GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; DEPENDENT CANNIBALISM; EPINEPHELUS-COIOIDES; LATES-CALCARIFER; GROWTH	The occurrence of cannibalism in teleosts is well documented, yet the role and extent of genotype in determining this behavior have not been determined clearly. We investigated sibling cannibalism among juvenile hybrids of southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis) female x Chinese catfish (Silurus asotus) male and within the two parental species, under varying levels of (i) food availability (satiated with 200% body mass versus restricted feeding with 10% body mass) and (ii) size distribution (homogeneity in experiment 1 versus heterogeneity in experiment 2). Two types of cannibalism were documented during the experiments: type I (incomplete predation), and type II (complete swallow). For the hybrids, cannibalism rates in the satiated and restricted feeding treatments were 5.6 +/- 4.2% and 15.6 +/- 6.3%, respectively. Both measures were intermediate between those for the pure progenitors (0% and 13.4 +/- 4.7% in S. meridionalis; 58.9 +/- 12.3% and 72.5 +/- 3.7% in S. asotus) in trials with uniformly-sized conspecifics (experiment 1). In contrast, cannibalism rates of hybrids with heterogeneous size distributions (experiment 2) in the satiated and restricted feeding treatments were 12.2 +/- 11.9% and 86.7 +/- 8.2% respectively, both of which were significantly higher than those in the two pure species (p < 0.05). That is, restricted feeding enhanced cannibalism significantly in all populations. Hence, we inferred that cannibalistic behavior in fish is genetically-based to a great extent, and interactions between genotype and environment (including intrinsic and extrinsic factors) play a vital role in the expressions of cannibalism. In trials with fish of uniform size, only type I cannibalism was observed, while both types were identified in trials with fish of heterogeneous size distributions-this indicated that transition from type I to type II of cannibalism was largely associated with heterogeneity in the growth of fish. Adequate food provisioning and size-sorting are effective ways to mitigate cannibalism in the larviculture of hybrid and S. meridionalis, while providing larval forage fish may be more feasible for S. asotus.

P accumulation potentials in a mining ecotype (ME) and a non-mining ecotype (NME) of Polygonum hydropiper were investigated in high P media. A field survey revealed that biomass, P concentration, and accumulation in shoots of ME were significantly greater than that of NME. ME and NME grown in hydroponic media with a series of P supplies ranging from 50 to 800mgPL(-1) showed significant increases in shoot biomass, P concentration, and P accumulation with ascending P supplied level. In manure wastewater media, shoot biomass, and P accumulation of ME increased with the growth period prolonged and revealed significant advantages compared to NME at day 45. Acid phosphatase and phytase of both ecotypes at P-sufficient media were superior to those at 50mgPL(-1), but NME was higher than ME in the hydroponic media. The activities of acid phosphatase and phytase in ME grown in high concentration wastewater were greater in comparison with that in low concentration wastewater. These results indicate that P. hydropiper can be able to extract P from high P media, and P accumulation potential of ME performs better than that of NME in the media where organic P exists.

Jian) in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro. Firstly, inflammatory response was established by exposing enterocytes to different concentrations of LPS for 24 h. Secondly, the protective effects of Arg against subsequent LPS exposure were studied in enterocytes. Finally, we investigated whether dietary Arg supplementation could attenuate immune challenge induced by LPS in vivo. The result indicated that 10 mg/L LPS could induced inflammatory response in enterocytes. Cells exposed to LPS (10-30 mg/L) alone for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH) (P < 0.05). The cell viability, protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity were decreased by LPS (P < 0.05). Moreover, LPS exposure significantly increased TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 mRNA expression in vitro (P < 0.05). However, pre-treatment with Arg remarkably prevented the increase of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 by inhibiting the excessive activation of TLR4-Myd88 signaling pathway through down-regulating TLR4, Myd88, NF kappa B p65, and MAPK p38 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the experiment in vivo showed that Arg pre-supplementation could attenuate immune challenge induced by LPS via TLR4-Myd88 signaling pathway, and thus protect fish against LPS-induced inflammatory response. In conclusion, all of these results indicated pre-supplementation with Arg decreased LPS induced immune damage and regulated TLR4-Myd88 signaling pathway in juvenile Jian carp in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro.

SP APICOMPLEXA; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; BOS-TAURUS; CATTLE; PROVINCE; HUMANS	Cryptosporidium is a global epidemic parasite and one of the most important intestinal pathogens causing diarrhea in animals and humans. Despite extensive research on this parasite group, little is known about rates of Cryptosporidium infection in lesser pandas. In this study, we use molecular diagnostic tools to detect Cryptosporidium infections and identify Cryptosporidium species in the lesser panda. Using a PCR approach, we sequenced the 18S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected from 110 captive lesser pandas held throughout China (approximately one third of the captive population). We determined Cryptosporidium species via a BLAST comparison of our sequences against those of published Cryptosporidium sequences available in GenBank and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. We report that captive lesser pandas were infected with a single Cryptosporidium species, Cryptosporidium andersoni, at a prevalence of 6.36 % (7/110). The present investigation revealed the existence of C. andersoni infection in captive lesser panda and suggested that proper control measures should be taken carefully to protect the welfare of zoo workers and visitors.

Based on the known plant PSR genes, 161 candidate PSR genes were identified. Of these genes, 138 genes contained at least one intron and were then used to develop 606 PSR-ILP markers by designing PCR primers to the intron-flanking exonic regions. PCR evaluation was performed on 43 randomly selected PSR-ILP markers in 30 maize inbred lines. Of the primers, 88.4% amplified stable and pure products in all maize inbred lines, and 53.5% of the markers showed ILP, with PIC values ranging from 0.06 to 0.80. The result of clustering analysis of the 30 maize inbred lines, based on the polymorphism of 23 ILP markers, suggests that the ILP markers developed in this study are not only efficient for genetic diversity analysis but also potentially useful for marker assisted selection for tolerance to low phosphorus.

In this work, we have systematically investigated the mono-protein adsorption kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and fibrinogen (Fg) adsorbed on the four different surface topographies (nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods (NRs), nanosheets (NSs) and nanobeams (NBs) of Zinc oxide (ZnO), respectively. The competition of multi-protein adsorbed on them has been studied as well. Results showed that each protein had a singular process of adsorption that fitted well by Spreading Particle Model (SPM). It confirmed that ZnO NRs compared with other samples had more adsorption sites, which could provide more opportunities for the interaction between material and protein molecules. In addition, the Fg compared to the BSA could be more tightly adsorbed to the surface, both of which existed slight conformational changes by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and circular dichroism spectra (CD). Taken together, all these consequences well demonstrated that NRs may have wider applications in designing biomaterial surfaces and the biocompatibility for implanted biomaterials.

Antibody is a key factor for immunoassay against toxic stuff like AFB(1), and single-chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) has become a popular format of genetically engineered antibody. In this study, four hybridoma cell lines against AFB(1) were obtained, and then scFvs 2E6 derived from hybridoma cell line 2E6 were constructed in different V-H/V-L orientations. Subsequently, scFvs 2E6 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) mainly in the form of inclusion body. SDS-PAGE, Western blot and ELISA were employed to characterize scFvs 2E6. The results revealed that the yield of inclusion body of scFvs 2E6 in either V-H/V-L orientation was similar; however, only the scFv in V-H-linker-V-L orientation showed anti-AFB(1) bioactivity after refolding. The present study underscores the importance of choosing optimal V-H/V-L orientation for scFv construction, and scFv may be favorable for immunoassays in food industry.

J	Xu, ZF; Zhao, CZ; Yin, HJ; Liu, Q				Xu, Zhenfeng; Zhao, Chunzhang; Yin, Huajun; Liu, Qing			Warming and forest management interactively affect the decomposition of subalpine forests on the eastern Tibetan Plateau: A four-year experiment	GEODERMA			English	Article						Litter decomposition; Experimental warming; Reforestation; Plantation; Natural forest; Tibetan Plateau	LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION; CONTRASTING LIGHT CONDITIONS; SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; ABIES-FAXONIANA; LOBLOLLY-PINE; COLD BIOMES; CLIMATE; RATES; RESPONSES	Increased rates of litter decomposition due to climatic warming have great potential to modify the carbon balance in forest soils, with consequent feedbacks to climate change. Reforestation could affect responses of litter decomposition to warming by altering litter type and soil conditions. However, less is known about the interactive impacts of forest management and climate change on litter decomposition. Here, we conducted a 4-year field experiment to investigate the effects of experimental warming on the decomposition of dragon spruce (Picea asperata Mast.) and red birch (Betula albo-sinensis Burk.) foliar litter in two contrasting sites (a dragon spruce plantation and a natural forest) using litter-bag method on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. During the four years of decomposition in the field, a clear pattern of faster mass loss was observed in red birch litter compared to dragon spruce needle. Additionally, regardless of warming regimes and litter types, mass loss rates were higher in the natural forest site than in the plantation site. Warming did not affect mass loss of dragon spruce litter during the early decomposition stage, but increased it over the later decomposition stage. In contrast, warming had enhanced mass loss of red birch litter on most sampling days. Red birch litter was more sensitive to warming compared with dragon spruce needle. Our results clearly indicated that reforestation can alter litter quality and soil conditions, and further affect the litter decomposition of subalpine forest ecosystem to projected climatic warming. This calls for incorporating forest management practice in climate-carbon models to better understand carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems under climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To date, few studies have addressed the differences in the protein profiles of yak colostrum and milk. We used quantitative proteomics to compare the protein profiles of whey from yak colostrum and milk. Milk samples were collected from 21 yaks after calving (1 and 28 d). Whey protein profiles were generated through isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-labelled proteomics. RESULTSWe identified 183 proteins in milk whey; of these, the expression levels of 86 proteins differed significantly between the whey from colostrum and milk. Haemoglobin expression showed the greatest change; its levels were significantly higher in the whey from colostrum than in mature milk whey. Functional analysis revealed that many of the differentially expressed proteins were associated with biological regulation and response to stimuli. Further, eight differentially expressed proteins involved in the complement and coagulation cascade pathway were enriched in milk whey. CONCLUSIONThese findings add to the general understanding of the protein composition of yak milk, suggest potential functions of the differentially expressed proteins, and provide novel information on the role of colostral components in calf survival.

Study of the genetic variation in emerging CPV strains is important for disease control strategy. The antigenic property of CPV is connected with specific amino acid changes, mainly in the capsid protein VP2. This study was carried out to characterize VP2 gene of CPV viruses from two provinces of China in 2011. The complete VP2 genes of the CPV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced. Genetic analysis based on the VP2 genes of CPV was conducted. All of the isolates screened and sequenced in this study were typed as CPV-2a except GS-K11 strain, which was typed as CPV-2b. Sequence comparison showed nucleotide identities of 98.8-100% among CPV strains, whereas the Aa similarities were 99.6-100%. Compared with the reference strains, there are three distinctive amino acid changes at VP2 gene residue 267, 324 and 440 of the strains isolated in this study. Of the 27 strains, fourteen (51.85%) had the 267 (Phe-Tyr) and 440 (Thr-Ala) substitution, all the 27 (100%) had 324 (Tyr-Ile) substitution. Phylogenetically, all of the strains isolated in this study formed a major monophyletic cluster together with one South Korean isolate, two Thailand isolates and four Chinese former isolates.

In this study, green roofs composed of 6 small green segments with two different substrates, mixed-sewage-sludge substrate (MSSS, volume ratio of sewage sludge and local-natural soil 1:1), and local-natural soil (LNS), three different substrate depths (20 cm, 25 cm and 30 cm), and three types of native plants (Ligustrum vicaryi, Neottia auriculata, and Liriape spicata) in Chengdu City were established to determine carbon sequestration from July 2012 to July 2013 through assessment of the carbon storage and sequestration. Results show that the average carbon storage of MSSS and LNS on green roofs was respectively 13.15 kg C m(-2) and 8.58 kg C m(-2), and the average carbon sequestration followed the order of LNS (3.89 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) > MSSS (3.81 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Thus MSSS could be considered as a potential material for carbon sequestration. The carbon storage and carbon sequestration by native plants on the green roofs followed the order of L. vicaryi > L. spicata > N. auriculata. The whole green roof had a mean carbon storage of 18.28 kg C m(-2) and average carbon sequestration of 6.47 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the combined biomass and substrate organic matter. The best green roof configuration was L. vicaryi together with MSSS substrate, with a middle-high level of carbon sequestration It will be feasible and worthwhile to scale-up the adaptable green roof configurations in Chengdu World Modern Garden City.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of swine manure application on plant growth, P uptake, and rhizosphere characteristics of two ecotypes of Polygonum hydropiper. A mining ecotype (ME) and a non-mining ecotype (NME) were grown for 8 weeks in soils added with a series of swine manure (0-100 g kg (1)). In the study, plant P content and soil properties were analyzed. Biomass and P accumulation in P. hydropiper were significantly higher at 100 g kg (1) compared to the control. Besides, biomass and P accumulation of the ME were higher than the NME's. Swine manure application increased the levels of various P fractions. H2O-, NaHCO3- and NaOH-Pi (Pi, inorganic P) could be utilized efficiently by both ecotypes. Significant depletions of NaHCO3- and NaOH-Po (Po, organic P) were observed in the rhizosphere of the ME compared to the NME. No statistical changes of HCl- and residual-P were observed in the rhizosphere. Acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities were enhanced by both swine manure application and rhizosphere processes. In conclusion, P. hydropiper can utilize various P fractions from manure impacted soil and the ME shows a higher ability than the NME to mobilize Po. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JN967621-24) and their expression patterns characterized at five postnatal stages (3, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days). Association analysis was then applied regarding MEF2 expression levels and myofiber diameter and density. MEF2B was shown to be weakly homologous with other species, the distant branches with other members and the lowest expression levels, suggesting that it is distinct from other family members. Expression of the other three MEF2 genes was widely distributed, but this was largely accumulated in the skeletal muscle and myocardium compared with the viscera at all developmental stages. MEF2A and MEF2D expression levels were higher overall than MEF2B and MEF2C in six tissues, and were significantly positively correlated with the myofiber diameter of the longissimus dorsi. These findings suggest that goat MEF2 genes mainly function in the skeletal muscle and myocardium, and that MEF2A and MEF2D are likely to effectively promote muscular growth and development during postnatal stages. MEF2A expression was highest in the myocardium, where MEF2C expression increased with age, implying that both gene products are related to the growth and development of postnatal myocardium.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are versatile enzymes that can affect parasite survival and parasite-host interactions and, are therefore, potential targets for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines. Methods: In this study, we identified a full-length cDNA that encoded a novel, secretory sigma-like GST (Bsc-GST sigma) from a B. schroederi-omic dataset. Following cloning and sequencing, sequence and structural analyses and comparative modeling were performed using online-bioinformatics and proteomics tools. The recombinant Bsc-GSTs (rBsc-GST sigma) protein was prokaryotically expressed and then used to detect antigenicity and reactivity using immunoblotting assays. In addition, the native protein in female adult B. schroederi was located via immunofluorescence techniques, while the preliminary ELISA-based serodiagnostic potential of rBsc-GSTs was assessed in native and infected mouse sera. Results: Bsc-GSTs contained a 621-bp open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 206 amino acids with two typical sigma GST domain profiles, including a GST_N_Sigma_like at the N-terminus and a GST_C_Sigma_like at the C-terminus. The presence of an N-terminal signal sequence indicated that Bsc-GSTs was a secretory protein. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses showed that Bsc-GSTs was a nematode-specific member of the Sigma class GSTs and shared the closest genetic distance with its homologue in Ascaris suum. Further comparative structure analyses indicated that Bsc-GSTs possessed the essential structural motifs (e.g., beta alpha beta alpha beta beta alpha) and the consensus secondary or tertiary structure that is typical for other characterized GST sigma s. Immunolocalization revealed strong distributions of native Bsc-GSTs in the body hypodermis, lateral chords, gut epithelium, gut microvilli, oviduct epithelium, and ovaries of adult female worms, similar to its homologue in A. suum. Building on good immunogenic properties, rBsc-GST sigma-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 79.1% and a specificity of 82.0% to detect anti-B. schroederi IgG antibodies in the sera of experimentally infected mice. Conclusion: This study presents a comprehensive demonstration of sequence and structural-based analysis of a new, secretory sigma-like GST from a nematode, and its good serodiagnostic performance suggests that rBsc-GSTs has the potential to detect B. schroederi and, therefore, could be used to develop an ELISA-based serological test to diagnose baylisascariasis in giant pandas.

Previous work has proposed three functions for the pregenome/C RNA: it can serve as the pregenome and be packaged into the core protein during the process of replication, and it encodes the mRNA for both the capsid protein and the viral polymerase. However, little is known about the timing of these functions during the different stages of viral infection. In this study, a reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed to analyze the dynamic transcription process of the pregenome/C RNA. The dynamic expression of the core protein was investigated using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and by western blot analysis. The generation of pregenome/C RNA began at 12 h post infection and peaked at 20 h post infection; however, the core protein was not detectable until 24 h post infection. These results demonstrate that the core protein appeared approximately 12 h later than the pregenome/C RNA. These results suggest that the DHBV pregenome/C RNA is not used for the translation of the viral core protein during the early stages of infection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The selenium-containing proteins present in selenium-enriched mycelia (Se-MC) were identified using size-exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS). The selenium-containing amino acids liberated by hydrolysis of these proteins were identified using anion exchange-ICP-MS. Se-MC was found to contain selenoproteins with molecular weights ranging from 1.7 to 60.5 kDa. The main selenium-containing amino acids within them were selenomethionine and selenocysteine. Furthermore, Se-MC possessed excellent antihyperglycemic and antioxidant properties. Se-MC normalized biochemical parameters like insulin level, blood glucose level, body weight, and antioxidant enzyme activity in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. It also inhibited the a-amylase and a-glucosidase activities present in in vitro gastric and intestinal models. In conclusion, Se-MC has the potential to serve as a dietary supplement of selenium, an antioxidant, or an ingredient for the formulation of nutraceuticals.

Ninety-two fresh fecal specimens were collected from a pet market in Ya'an City, China. One Cryptosporidium isolate from an asymptomatic host and two isolates from separate hosts with diarrhea were obtained by using Sheather's sucrose flotation technique and modified acid-fast staining. The Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped by nested PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA), 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), oocyst wall protein (COWP), and actin genes: isolates were identified as Cryptosporidium parvum with minor nucleotide differences at all four loci. Further subtyping was performed by PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene: two subtype families were detected, including a novel C. parvum subtype IIpA9 and a rare subtype II0A13G1 (only reported in diarrheal patients of Sweden). Our results suggest that the bamboo rat is a reservoir host of C. parvum. Significantly, we discovered that the rare C parvum subtype family no is also a zoonotic subtype and confirmed C. parvum subtype IIpA9 as a novel subtype family. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Muscle protein, lipid and nitric oxide contents, shear force, hydroxyproline concentration, and pH were significantly improved by appropriate arginine. Cooking loss, lactate content, cathepsins activities, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents exhibited an opposite tendency. Additionally, optimum arginine significantly enhanced glutathione content and the activities and gene expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in muscle. Moreover, the expression levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase, target of rapamycin, ribosome protein S6 kinase 1, casein kinase 2 and NF-E2-related factor 2 in muscle were significantly elevated by appropriate arginine. However, optimum arginine significantly decreased Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 mRNA levels in muscle. In conclusion, arginine improved the flesh quality and muscle antioxidant capacity and regulated antioxidant-related signalling molecule expression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With recent investigations examining the role of microRNA (miRNA) in regulating ovarian function we used a lentiviral approach to over express miR-378 in cultured primary porcine granulosa cells to study the role this miRNA may play in granulosa cell development. We revealed that miR-378-3p decreased protein levels and mRNA levels of PGR via targeting its 3'UTR. We observed that this regulation of PGR by miR-378-3p resulted in a corresponding decrease in gene transcripts of ADAMTS1, CTSL1, and PPARG, all known to be regulated by PGR and important for follicular maturation and remodeling. Our study provides the first evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of PGR and further elucidates the role of miR-378-3p in the ovary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Planting vegetation in gully beds has proven to be an effective measure in controlling the development of gullies. However, the inner mechanism for this process remains unclear. In this paper, in situ scouring experiments were performed to reveal the influence of grass belt position on the hydraulic properties of runoff in gully beds. The results demonstrate that (1) grass belt position can have a significant effect on reducing runoff erosivity (runoff shear stress, stream power) and sediment content in gully beds, and that the reduction may be strengthened as the distance between the gully headwall and grass belt (DHG) decreases; (2) grass belts could play a positive role in enhancing the surface resistance and increasing flow energy consumption, as resistance and flow energy consumption increase as DHG increases; and (3) there were similar trends in the temporal variations within the hydraulic properties, which changed sharply in the early stage of the experiment and then tended to stabilize, with their time to stability continuously increasing as DHG decreased.

The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of AFB(1) on the number of IgA(+) cell and immunoglobulin mRNA expression in the intestine of broilers. One hundred and fifty six one-day-old healthy Cobb broilers were randomly divided into the control group (the dosage of 0 mg/kg AFB(1)) and AFB(1) group (the dosage of 0.6 mg/kg AFB(1)) with three replicates per group and 26 birds per replicate for 21 days, respectively. After necropsy at 7, 14 and 21 days of age, duodenum, jejunum and ileum samples were taken for analyzing IgA(+) cell by immunohistochemistry and IgA, pIgR, IgM and IgG mRNA expression by qRT-PCR. IgA(+) cells were mainly distributed in the lamina propria of small intestinal mucosa in both groups at 14 and 21 days of age. A significant decrease in the number of IgA(+) cells in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum was revealed in the AFB(1) group compared with that of the control group. The expression levels of IgA, pIgR, IgM and IgG mRNA in the intestinal mucosa were lower in the AFB(1) group than those in the control group at 14 and 21 days of age. Our data demonstrated that the dosage of 0.6 mg/kg AFB(1) in broiler diet reduced the number of IgA(+) cell and the expression of IgA, pIgR, IgM and IgG mRNA in the small intestine.

The growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene has been widely proposed to significantly associate with critical economic traits in cattle. In the present study, we comparatively studied the genetic diversity of GHR in Tibetan cattle (a traditional unselected breed, n = 93) and Chinese Holstein cow (the intensively selected breed, n = 94). The Tibetan yak (n = 38) was also included as an outgroup breed. A total of 21 variants were detected by sequencing 1279 bp genomic fragments encompassing the largest exon 9. Twelve haplotypes (H1 similar to H12) constructed by 15 coding SNPs were presented as a star-like network profile, in which haplotype H2 was located at the central position and almost occupied by Tibetan yaks. Furthermore, H2 was also identical to the formerly reported sequence specific to African cattle. Only haplotype H5 was simultaneously shared by all three breeds. Tibetan cattle showed higher nucleotide diversity (0.00215 +/- 0.00015) and haplotype diversity (0.678 +/- 0.026) than Holstein cow. Conclusively, we found Tibetan cattle have retained relatively high genetic variation of GHR. The predominant presence of African cattle specific H2 in the outgroup yak breed would highlight its ancestral relationship, which may be used as one informative molecular marker in the phylogenetic studies.

Molecular cloning and evolutionary analysis of captive forest musk deer bitter taste receptor gene T2R16	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Forest musk deer; Bitter taste receptor; T2R16; Structure analysis; Phylogenetic analysis	MOUSE; CELLS; CONSERVATION; VERTEBRATES; CHIMPANZEES; FAMILIES; HUMANS; SWEET; CHINA; RAT	Sensing bitter tastes is crucial for most animals because it can prevent them from ingesting harmful food. This process is mainly mediated by the bitter taste receptors (T2R) that are largely expressed in the taste buds. Previous studies have identified some T2R gene repertoires. Marked variation in repertoire size has been noted among species. However, research on T2Rs is still limited and the mechanisms underlying the evolution of vertebrate T2Rs remain poorly understood. In the present study, we analyzed the structure and features of the protein encoded by the forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) T2R16 and submitted the gene sequence to NCBI GenBank. The results showed that the full coding DNA sequence (CDS) of musk deer T2R16 (GenBank accession No. KP677279) was 906 bp, encoding 301 amino acids, which contained ATG start codon and TGA stop codon, with a calculated molecular weight of 35.03 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.56. The T2R16 protein receptor had seven conserved transmembrane regions. Hydrophobicity analysis showed that most amino acid residues in T2R16 protein were hydrophobic, and the grand average of hydrophobicity (GRAVY) was 0.657. Phylogenetic analysis based on this gene revealed that forest musk deer had the closest association with sheep (Ovis aries), as compared to cow (Bos taurus), Tursiops truncatus, and other species, whereas it was genetically farthest from humans (Homo sapiens). We hope these results would complement the existing data on T2R16 and encourage further research in this respect.	[Zhao, G. J.; Zeng, D. J.; Chen, Q.; Feng, X. L.; Zhang, C.

Detection of soluble expression and in vivo interactions of the inner membrane protein OppC using green fluorescent protein	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Oligopeptide permease; Protein-protein interaction; Inner membrane protein; Green fluorescent protein	OLIGOPEPTIDE PERMEASE OPP; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI; BINDING-PROTEINS; TRANSPORT-SYSTEM; PURIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; ADHERENCE; PEPTIDES; PATHOGEN	In this study, the in vivo interaction system of oligopeptide permease (Opp) proteins was analyzed, and a high expression system of inner membrane protein OppC was constructed by flexible usage of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The Escherichia coli OppC gene, which encodes a transmembrane component of oligopeptide transporter, was cloned into different vectors. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into different E. coli strains, and the expression conditions were optimized. The effect of plasmids and expression strains on OppC production was evaluated by in-gel and western blot analyses. OppC produced by the pWaldo-GFPe vector, harboring the GFP reporter gene, transformed into E. coli C43(DE3) provided sufficient functional protein for biochemical and biophysical studies. In vivo protein-protein interactions were detected among oligopeptide permease proteins using a GFP fragment reassembly protocol. The substrate binding protein OppA showed no interaction with the other components, while the ATP-binding component OppD did not interact with OppF. OppD and OppF interacted with the transmembrane components OppB and OppC. OppB also showed direct interaction with OppC. In vivo OppC functionality was determined by constructing an OppC gene deletion strain. OppC was shown to be essential for peptide uptake, and non-essential for cell viability. These results could help in elucidating the oligopeptide transport mechanism in bacteria.	[Zhai, J.

SNPs in the 5 '-regulatory region of the tyrosinase gene do not affect plumage color in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Duck; Tyrosinase gene; Promoter; SNP; Plumage color	ALBINISM; MUTATION; TYR; CDNA; SKIN; MICE	Tyrosinase, encoded by the TYR gene, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of melanin pigment. In this study, plumage color separation was observed in Cherry Valley duck line D and F1 and F2 hybrid generations of Liancheng white ducks. Gene sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were applied to the 5'-regulatory region of TYR, to explore the connection between TYR sequence variation and duck plumage color. Four SNPs were found in the 5'-regulatory region. The SNPs were in tight linkage and formed three haplotypes. However, the genotype distribution in groups with different plumage color was not significantly different, and there were no changes in the transcription factor binding sites between the different genotypes. In conclusion, these SNP variations may not cause the differences in feather color observed in this test group.	[Zhang, N. N.; Hu, J. W.; Liu, H. H.; Xu, H.

This study aimed to investigate cytosine methylation profiles in different tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cultivars grown in China. Methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism was used to analyze genome-wide global methylation profiles in four tobacco cultivars (Yunyan 85, NC89, K326, and Yunyan 87). Amplicons with methylated C motifs were cloned by reamplified polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and analyzed. The results show that geographical location had a greater effect on methylation patterns in the tobacco genome than did sampling time. Analysis of the CG dinucleotide distribution in methylation-sensitive polymorphic restriction fragments suggested that a CpG dinucleotide cluster-enriched area is a possible site of cytosine methylation in the tobacco genome. The sequence alignments of the Nia1 gene (that encodes nitrate reductase) in Yunyan 87 in different regions indicate that a C-T transition might be responsible for the tobacco phenotype. T-C nucleotide replacement might also be responsible for the tobacco phenotype and may be influenced by geographical location.

Proteome analysis of tobacco leaves reveals dynamic changes in protein expression among different cultivation areas	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Flue-cured tobacco; Proteome; Ecology; Leaf quality; Two-dimensional electrophoresis	BINDING	The leaves of tobacco plants were used to analyze differences in protein content of tobacco grown in the four main flue-cured tobacco-producing areas of Sichuan Province, China. An improved protein extraction method, isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation, was used to extract and separate total protein from tobacco leaves. Proteomic maps with relatively high resolution and repeatability were produced. At isoelectric points 4 to 7 and molecular weight ranging from 20-100 kDa, we detected 1032, 1030, 1019, and 1011 clearly visible protein spots in tobacco leaves from the four study areas. Proteome comparison between these protein spots showed that 119 spots with a greater than 2 -fold change in expression quantity contributed to the variation in expression. Of which, 115 were successfully identified and annotated. According to the annotation results, these proteins participate in photosynthesis. energy metabolism, mineral nutrition, terpene metabolism, defensive reaction, and other physiological and biochemical processes. This study preliminarily explains the effects of ecological conditions on the physiological metabolism of tobacco leaves and how such effects directly or indirectly contribute to tobacco leaf quality.

Cloning and characterization of up-regulated HbSINA4 gene induced by drought stress in Tibetan hulless barley	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Barley; Drought stress; Gene cloning; Gene expression; HbSINA4; Hordeum vulgare	HORDEUM-VULGARE L.; RESPONSES	Hulless barley is an important crop cereal in Tibetan, China. Drought is a major abiotic stress in barley production. In this study, we cloned the drought-related HbSINA4 gene from the variety 'Himalaya 10' and analyzed its expression patterns under different drought and rehydration conditions. The cDNA of HbSINA4 was 1052 bp long, including an open reading frame of 771 bp that encoded a protein of 256 amino acids. The molecular weight of HbSINA4 protein was predicted to be 29.53 kDa and the theoretical pI was 8.32. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the HbSINA4 gene contained a protein kinase domain profile family signature motif, with high similarity to that of Oryza sativa and Brachypoditan distachyon. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays revealed that gene expression declined rapidly with increasing drought stress; in contrast, its expression increased after rehydration treatment. Therefore, the HbAINA4 gene responds to the drought stress and plays an important role in barely drought resistance. Furthermore, our results provide information which may be useful in other temperate crop studies and in aiding resistance to drought.	[Yuan, H. J.; Nyima, T. S.; Wang, Y. L.; Xu, Q. J.; Zeng, X.

However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in tobacco root development in response to drought stress are not well-known. To gain insight into the transcriptome dynamics associated with drought resistance, genome-wide gene expression profiling of roots from a tobacco cultivar (Honghua Dajinyuan, a major flue-cured tobacco cultivar in Southwest China) under 20% PEG6000 treatment for 0, 6 h and 48 h were conducted using Solexa sequencing (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Over five million tags were generated from tobacco roots, including 229,344, 221,248 and 242,065 clean tags in three libraries, respectively. The most differentially expressed tags, with either log2FC > 2.0 for up-regulated genes or log2FC < -2.0 for down regulated genes (p < 0.001), were analyzed further. In comparison to the control, 1476 up-regulated and 1574 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, except for unknown transcripts, which were grouped into 43 functional categories involved in seven significant pathways. The most enriched categories were those that were populated by transcripts involved in metabolism, signal transduction and cellular transport. Many genes and/or biological pathways were found to be common among the three libraries, for example, genes participating in transport, stress response, auxin transport and signaling, etc. Next, the expression patterns of 12 genes were assessed with quantitative real-time PCR, the results of which agreed with the Solexa analysis. In conclusion, we revealed complex changes in the transcriptome during tobacco root development related to drought resistance, and provided a comprehensive set of data that is essential to understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms involved. These data may prove valuable in future studies of the molecular mechanisms regulating root development in response to drought stress in tobacco and other plants.

Identification of conserved microRNAs in peripheral blood from giant panda: expression of mammary gland-related microRNAs during late pregnancy and early lactation	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Giant panda; miRNA; Mammary gland; Lactation	CELL-PROLIFERATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; GROWTH; DIFFERENTIATION; TRANSCRIPTOME; INHIBITION; INSIGHTS; MIR-30	The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is one of the world's most endangered mammals, and it has evolved several unusual biological and behavioral traits. During puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and involution, the mammary gland undergoes profound morphological and functional changes. A large number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to be involved in mammary gland development and lactation. In this study, we identified 202 conserved mature miRNAs, corresponding to 147 pre-miRNAs, in giant panda peripheral blood using a small RNA-sequencing approach. In addition, 27 miRNA families and 29 miRNA clusters were identified. We analyzed the arm selection preference of pre-miRNAs and found that: 1) most giant panda pre-miRNAs generated one-strand miRNAs, and the 5p-arm only miRNAs have a higher expression level than 3p-arm only miRNAs; 2) there were more 5p-arm dominant miRNAs than 3p-arm dominant miRNAs; and 3) 5p-arm dominant miRNAs have a larger fold change within miRNA pairs than 3p-arm dominant miRNAs. Expression of 12 lactation-related miRNAs was detected across late pregnancy and early lactation stages by qPCR, and seven miRNAs were identified as clustered in one significant model. Most of these clustered miRNAs exhibited inhibitory roles in proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Functional analysis highlighted important roles of the seven as signed miRNAs in mammary development and metabolic changes, including blood vessel morphogenesis, macromolecule biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation, and protein transport.

Detection of quantitative trait loci for ear row number in F-2 populations of maize	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Maize; QTL; Ear row number; Grain yield	YIELD COMPONENTS; GRAIN-YIELD; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE; MORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES; MAJOR QTL; TEOSINTE; DOMESTICATION; INHERITANCE; IDENTIFICATION	Ear row number (ERN) is not only a key trait involved in maize (Zea mays L.) evolution but is also an important component that is directly related to grain yield. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ERN were detected across two F-2 populations that were derived from a same cross between B73 with 16 rows (N = 233) and SICAU1212 with four rows (N = 231). As a result, 33 QTLs were associated with 12 agronomic traits: three plant traits, four ear-related traits, and five kernel-related traits. The total phenotypic variation explained by the QTLs for each trait ranged from 8.60 to 72.67%, and four QTLs were identified for ERN in the two populations. Each QTL explained between 6.78 and 36.76% of the ERN variation. Notably, three of the four QTLs (qERN2-1, qERN4-2, and qERN8-1) were associated with ERN, and qERN8-1 simultaneously influenced grain yield, plant diameter, ear diameter, and kernel length. In addition, only one significant epistatic interaction was detected in all 33 QTLs. This study should provide a foundation for further fine-mapping and map-based cloning of these consistent QTLs, and for controlling maize ERN by marker-assisted breeding.	[Yang, C.; Liu, J.; Rong, T.

Effects of muscle fiber type on glycolytic potential and meat quality traits in different Tibetan pig muscles and their association with glycolysis-related gene expression	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Glycolytic potential; Mitochondria; Muscle fiber type; Meat quality; Tibetan pigs	MYOSIN HEAVY-CHAIN; LONGISSIMUS-DORSI MUSCLE; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PORK QUALITY; MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; ENERGY-METABOLISM; LARGE WHITE; CAPACITY; GLYCOGEN	The myosin heavy chain (MyHC) composition, glycolytic potential, mitochondrial content, and gene expression related to energy metabolism were analyzed in eight muscles from Tibetan pigs, to study how meat quality develops in different muscle tissues. The muscles were classified into three clusters, based on MyHC composition: masseter, trapezius, and latissimus dorsi as 'slow-oxidative-type'; psoas major and semimembranosus as 'intermediate-type'; and longissimus dorsi, obliquus externus abdominis, and semitendinosus as 'fast-glycolytic-type'. The 'slow-oxidative-type' muscles had the highest MyHC I and MyHC IIA content (P < 0.01); 'intermediate-type' muscles, the highest MyHC IIx content (P < 0.01); and 'fast-glycolytic-type' muscles, the highest MyHC IIb content (P < 0.01). The pH values measured in 'slow-oxidative-type' muscles were higher than those in the other clusters were; however, the color of 'fast-glycolytic-type' muscles was palest (P < 0.01). Mitochondrial content increased in the order: fast-glycolytic-type < intermediate-type < slow-oxidative-type. In the 'slow-oxidative-type' muscles, the expression levels of genes related to ATP synthesis were higher, but were lower for those related to glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Mitochondrial content was significantly positively correlated with MyHC I content, but negatively correlated with MyHC IIb content. MyHC I and mitochondrial content were both negatively correlated with glycolytic potential. Overall, muscles used frequently in exercise had a higher proportion of type I fibers. 'Slow-oxidative-type' muscles, rich in type I fibers with higher mitochondrial and lower glycogen and glucose contents, had a higher ATP synthesis efficiency and lower glycolytic capacity, which contributed to their superior meat quality.

Avian sarcoma and leukosis virus gag gene in the Anser anser domesticus genome	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						ASLV gag; Endogenous retroviruses; Goose	ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRAL SEQUENCES; CHICKEN GENOME; IDENTIFICATION; VERTEBRATES; CELLS; BIRDS; DNA	Endogenous retroviruses are regarded as ideal genetic markers for evolutionary analyses. Birds were some of the initial vertebrates found to contain endogenous retroviruses. However, few studies have investigated the presence and distribution of endogenous retroviruses in goose. In this study, we detected the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus gag gene in the genomic DNA of 8 Chinese native breeds using polymerase chain reaction method. The results indicated that a 1.2-kb avian sarcoma and leukosis virus gag sequence was integrated into all 8 goose breeds. The mean genetic pairwise distance was 0.918% among the investigated geese. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of the endogenous retroviruses in the domestic goose genome. The genetic structure should be further examined in the domestic goose.	[Zhu, F.; Chen, S. Y.; Liu, Y.

Dynamic comparison of genetic diversity in a Small Tail Han sheep population using meta-analysis	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Small Tail Han sheep; Diversity; Microsatellite; Inbreeding; Genetic resource conservation	LITTER SIZE; HAIR SHEEP; BREEDS; POLYMORPHISM; ASSOCIATION; MUTATIONS; REGION	The aim of this research was to identify the dynamic diversity of Small Tail Han sheep in its main producing areas between different years, and provide a basis for a breeding and genetic resources conservation strategy. For this purpose, 15 microsatellites were genotyped for Small Tail Han Sheep sampled in 2014 from Heze, China, and a comparative analysis of these data with those from a previous study was undertaken using meta-analysis. The results reveal that inbreeding has caused a reduction in diversity of Small Tail Han Sheep from 2008 to 2014. Overall, our results are helpful in understanding the dynamic change in diversity, as well as providing information for a conservation strategy for this population.	[E, G. X.; Huang, Y. F.; Zhao, Y.

In this study, the Morus nigra flavonoids were extracted by ultrasonic and antioxidant activities both in vitro and in vivo were measured. The results showed that hydroxyl radicals clearance rate and superoxide radical anion clearance rate in vitro increased with the concentration of the total flavonoids in the range of 0-1.05 mg/mL and the maximum clearance rate was 80.33% and 87.69%, respectively. After mice were treated with flavonoids, the content of malonaldehyde (MDA) in serum and liver decreased; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum and liver, catalase (CAT) in liver and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in blood and liver increased; Langhans cells increased in spleen. These results revealed that the Morus nigra flavonoids possessed strong antioxidant activity.

Liquid doubling dilution, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SDS-PAGE and 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining were employed to elucidate the antibacterial activity and mechanism of berberine. The minimal inhibitory concentration of berberine was 0.3125 mg/mL, and time-kill curves showed concentration and time dependence. The TEM micrographs displayed damaged cell wall, concentrated cytoplasm, cytoplasmic content leakage and cell death. SDS-PAGE and DAPI assays revealed that berberine can restrain DNA and protein syntheses. Berberine inhibited the synthesis of proteins associated with the growth and cleavage of bacteria and then blocked the division and development of bacteria. The compound ultimately induced cytoplasm pyknosis and bacterial death.

Thirty varieties were subjected to two treatments (sole and maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system) with three replications in a complete randomized block design. Light environment characteristics in two cropping systems were measured. At the beginning of the bloom stage of soybean when maize was mature, the soybean stem morphology characteristics stem length, node number, hypocotyl length, internode length, stem diameter, stem breaking strength and stem biomass were measured. The results revealed that the intercropped soybean could capture 13.8% photosynthetic active radiation at the vegetative stage, as compared with the sole crop soybean, with longer soybean main stem, internode and hypocotyl, and lower stem diameter at this stage. The relative value of agronomic traits in the sole and intercropping system could be used to calculate the vining severity index (VI) and the weighted vining index (WVI), and the latter could be used as the comprehensive index of the degree of soybean vining in the relay strip intercropping system. Based on the values of WVI, through the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, the soybean varieties were divided into the 5 clusters, normal, mild, moderate, severe and extreme vining. Eight of the 30 varieties of soybean were normal vining grade and could be used as the parent plants to breed special varieties for intercropping.

Two hundred forty female Cobb-500 broiler chickens at the age of one day (body weight (BW) = 46 +/- 4 g) were fed a corn soybean meal based diet containing 5% CO (LC), 3.75% CO + 1.25% FO (FO1), 2.5% CO + 2.5% FO (FO2) or 5% FO (FC). Chickens fed FO1 diet had better BW gain (P = 0.049) and gain/feed ratio (P = 0.006) than those fed LC and FC diets during days 1-21 of age. However, for the whole experimental period (1-42 days of age), the dietary lipid source had no effect on the growth performance. On day 42 of age, the hepatic percentages of 18: 3n-3 (P = 0.001) and 20: 5n-3 (P < 0.001) were higher in FC than in LC group, which led to a higher content of total n-3 PUFA and lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. The contents of 18: 2n-6 (P < 0.05) and S n-6 PUFA (P = 0.009) were lower in FC than in LC group. Chickens fed FO1 and FO2 diets had higher Ca2+-ATPase activity and lower lipoprotein lipase activity than those fed LC and FC diets, whereas activities of lactate dehydrogenase and Na+,K+-ATPase were increased by FO2 than by LC diet (P < 0.05). The relative mRNA expression level of lipin 1 in chickens fed FO2 and FC was higher (P < 0.01) than in those fed LC and FO1 diets. Our results demonstrated that higher levels of FO led to hepatic enrichment of n-3 PUFA content and lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios in liver and increased the expression of lipin 1 whereas the expression of lipin 2, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2,Delta-6 fatty acid desaturase, WD and tetratricopeptide repeats 1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was not affected.

To detect the relationship between polymorphisms of the MyD88 gene and Salmonella Pullorum disease, we screened the coding region (CDS) of the MYD88 gene by DNA pool construction and sequencing based on case-control study. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sequenced fragment (5 exons), 7 known loci and one novel mutation named G4810372T (SNP8), were found in the fifth exon. In addition, we found 7 nonsynonymous substitutions. The allele frequency of only one SNP, g.4810191C > T (SNP1), was significantly different (P < 0.05) between case and control groups. The genotype frequencies of SNP1 (g.4810191C > T) and SNP3 (g.4810257G > T) were of significant difference between the case and the control groups (P < 0.05).

However, there is little understanding of the direct application and evaluation the safety of REEs on edible vegetables. In this study, Cerium (Ce), a light rare earth element and Yttrium (Y), a heavy rare earth element, were selected as the REEs; the crucifer Pak choi was selected as the experimental material. The physiological characteristics of Pak choi and accumulation of REEs in the plants were investigated. In a pot experiment, plants were sprayed with 50, 150, 300, 600, and 1,000 mg/L concentrations Ce(NO3)(3).6H(2)O and Y(NO3)(3)-6H(2)O. The results showed that spraying Ce3+ and Y3+ both significantly impacted the physical characteristics of Pak choi, with a low-promoting but high-repressing pattern. The dry weight, chlorophyll content, net photosynthesis rate, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities peaked when the concentration of Ce3+ and Y3+ both were 300 mg/L. In addition, at the same spraying concentration, the effect of Ce3+ on Pak choi was greater than Y3+. The leaf cumulative amount of Ce and Y in Pak choi increased with increasing spray concentration. The leaf Ce/Y levels exceed the Chinese safety limit when the spraying concentrations of Ce3+ and Y3+ were over 300 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L, respectively. The results indicate that the appropriate concentration of exogenous REEs can be used to promote the growth of Pak choi, and the effect of Ce were better than those of Y.

In this study, pot and field experiments were conducted to confirm this. In the pot experiment, the biomass, resistance index, plant height, branch number, tolerance index and root length of cleavers decreased, while the root/shoot ratio increased with increasing Cd concentration in the soil. The Cd contents in the roots and shoots of cleavers increased with increasing Cd concentration in the soil. The Cd content in shoots reached 139.63 mg kg(-1) at a soil Cd concentration of 75 mg kg(-1), which exceeded the critical value for a Cd-hyper-accumulator (100 mg kg(-1)). The maximal Cd content and extraction in shoots were 184.43 mg kg(-1) and 32.46 mu g plant(-1), respectively, at 100 mg kg(-1) Cd in the soil. The shoot bio-concentration factor of cleavers were greater than 1.0, while the translocation factor was less than 1.0 for all treatments. In the field experiment, the total Cd extraction in cleavers' shoots was 2.81-3.69 mg m(-2) at soil Cd levels of 2.04-2.89 mg kg(-1). Therefore, cleavers is a Cd-accumulator that could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil.

Four pairs of primers were used to detect five viruses. Specific primers were designed for classical swine fever virus (CSFV), African swine fever virus (ASFV) and pseudorabies (PRV). A pair of primers was designed prudently for two different types of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus that respectively were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV). The detection limits of the mPCR were 1.09x10(4), 1.50x10(3), 2.10x10(3), 1.30x10(3) and 8.97x10(2) copies/reaction for CSFV, ASFV, HP-PRRSV, PRRSV and PRV, respectively. A total of 49 clinical specimens were tested by the mPCR, and the result showed that co-infection by two or three viruses was 51%. In conclusion, the PCR is a useful tool for clinical diagnosis of not only single infections but also mixed infections in swines.	[Hu, L.; Lin, X. Y.; Yang, Z. X.; Yao, X. P.; Li, G. L.; Peng, S.

These two paralogs have quite different introns and nearly the same exons and were predicted to encode membrane protein with chloroplast transit peptide. The deduced PTOX protein encoded by both paralogs were proposed to be functional, since the existence of highly conserved amino acid sites necessary for a typical PTOX, including six iron-binding sites and Exon 8 domain. Moreover, soybean PTOX also exhibit clear sequence similarity to alternative oxidase (AOX). Organ-specific expression analysis showed high transcript levels of soybean PTOX in stems, leaves and flowers, while the levels in pods and roots were relatively low. In addition, a light-inducible character was also suggested for soybean PTOX in the present study.

In this study, we identified the complete coding sequences of IGFBP-1 to -6 in the Nanjiang brown goat, and assessed gene tissue expression patterns by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression of mRNA for the six gene targets was detectable in liver, heart, and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. Expression levels of IGFBP-1, -2 and -5 mRNA were higher in liver than in heart and LD muscle (P < 0.01), while IGFBP-6 expression was highest in LD muscle, and IGFBP-3 and -4 were predominantly expressed in LD muscle and liver. Higher IGFBP-2, -3, -4, and -6 mRNA levels were observed in LD, compared to triceps brachii muscle (P < 0.01). Additionally, the target genes had different temporal expression profiles during postnatal development. Histological assessment of muscle sections revealed a constant increase in muscle fiber diameter with aging. These results suggest that IGFBPs may be important for liver and skeletal muscle development, and may contribute to the biological function of these tissues in goats.	[Zhan, S.

The results of acute toxicity test showed that the granules' LD50 was more than 5000 mg/kg, which indicated that the "Huhezi" belonged to actually non-toxic drug. Subchronic toxicity study showed that non-toxic reaction were detected in high (1000 mg/kg), medium (500 mg/kg) and low dose (250 mg/kg) of "Huhezi" groups by measuring rat body weight, organ coefficient, blood physiological indexes and blood biochemical indexes. Pathological examination showed that no tissue lesions were observed in test organs except liver (mild granular degenerationand reversible vesicular degeneration), spleen (Langerhans cells infiltrating) and kidney (homogeneous red staining of renal tubule). Safety pharmacology study found that "Huhezi" had no effects on the central nervous system, respiratory system and cardiovascular system.

In this study, comparison was made between the novel one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of grass carp reovirus. The result indicated that RT-LAMP had x 10 higher sensitivity comparable to RT-PCR. The specificity of the two methods for GCRV detection were both developed successfully by other three aquatic viruses. In the field trial, both RT-PCR and RT-LAMP methods were applied to detect the samples from different infected organs and tissues. The result demonstrated that RT-LAMP had a high accuracy to confirm the diagnosis as well as the RT-PCR. This study showed that the RT-LAMP, compared to the RT-PCR, was simple, time-saving, convenient, but required specificity primers and possibly generated false positive product. Its products, unlike RT-PCR, could not be direcly used in further molecular research after purification. Thus RT-LAMP might be an optimal diagnostic method for rapid and preliminary diagnosis of GCRV infection in resource-limited setting situation.

To elucidate the function of DEV US2, US2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into pET-32a(+); this was expressed, the recombinant US2 protein was purified, and a polyclonal antibody generated. In addition, the kinetics and localization of the US2 gene and protein were determined by quantitative real-time fluorescent PCR, ganciclovir (GCV), and cycloheximide (CHX) treatment, western-blot, and indirect immunofluorescence assay. The packaging of US2 into DEV virions was revealed by a protease protection assay. US2 was found to be transcribed 24 h post-infection (pi) and peaked at 72 h pi; the US2 protein was detected 48 h pi, except in the presence of GCV or CHX. US2 was packed into virions and also localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm in infected cells. The results showed that the DEV US2 is a late gene, and that its encoding protein could be a tegument component localized mainly in the cytoplasm. This study provides useful data for the further analysis of DEV US2, including an explanation for the genetic conservation among alphaherpesviruses.	[Gao, J.; Cheng, A. G.; Wang, M. S.; Jia, R.

Echinococcus granulosus, the causative agent of CE, exhibits different genotypes in different locations. In order to identify its genotypes and analyze its genetic structure on the Tibetan Plateau, we collected 72 hydatid cysts from different intermediate hosts and amplified and sequenced their mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox2) genes. Seventy isolates were identified as the E. granulosus G1 genotype, while two isolates belonged to the G6 genotype. There were 18 haplotypes among the 70 E. granulosus isolates, which exhibited a star-like network pattern and shared a common haplotype (H-1). There was little difference between geographical sub-populations. Our results suggest that a recent E. granulosus population expansion occurred on the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that E. granulosus was introduced into China. This study increases the basic molecular data needed for the molecular diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention, and control of Echinococcus diseases.

All of the compounds were isostructural, and had a two-dimensional wave-like structure based on centrosymmetric [LnO(2)Co]-Co-[LnO(2)Co] motifs. The results of the magnetic measurements displayed that ferromagnetic interactions occurred in the frameworks (3-7) containing "heavy" lanthanide ions (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er), which should be ascribed to the coupling between the Ln(III) and Co-II ions. Furthermore, compound 5, containing Dy-III ions, displayed field-induced slow magnetic relaxation.

In this study, the full length of the cry1Hc1 gene was cloned from the strain. The cry1Hc1 gene was inserted into a shuttle vector (pSTK) and expressed in an acrystalliferous mutant Bacillus thuringiensis HD73(-). In this transformant, cry1Hc1 was expressed and diamond-shaped parasporal crystals were formed. The resulting insecticidal activity showed that the Cry1Hc1 protein exhibited high larvicidal activity against larvae of Plutella xyllostella and Ostrinia furnacalis with lethal concentration 50 of 55.21 and 118.44 mu g/ml, respectively. Sequence analysis of the gene was also performed; the Cry1Hc1 protein retained eight conserved regions commonly found in the existing Cry proteins.

The results showed that treatment of Cu and Cr for 72h (100 mu M concentration) significantly increased the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, while total chlorophyll (CM) content decreased and a decline in peroxidase (POD) activities. However, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities exposed different patters after short-term exposure to different concentrations of Cu and Cr. Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m, qP and NPQ) indicated that heavy metal treatment decreased photosystem II functions. The ultrastructural studies showed no significant ultrastructural changes at the high concentrations (100 mu M) of Cu and Cr in treatment solutions. These experiments suggest that oxidative stress parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence could be used as an effective indicator in moss biomonitoring and T taxirameum might have a potential tolerance to heavy metals.

Dynamic QTL analysis of protein content and glutamine synthetase activity in recombinant inbred wheat lines	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Wheat; Protein content; Conditional QTL; Glutamine synthetase; Dynamic QTL mapping	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; TRAIT LOCI ANALYSIS; DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIOR; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; TILLER NUMBER; BREAD WHEAT; GRAIN; RICE; YIELD	Protein content (PC) is a crucial factor that determines the end-use and nutritional quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Glutamine synthetase (GS), which is a major participant in nitrogen metabolism, can convert inorganic nitrogen into organic nitrogen. Although many studies have been conducted on PC and GS, a dynamic analysis of all of the filling stages has not been conducted. Therefore, 115 F9-10 recombinant inbred wheat lines of 'R131/R142' were used to analyze PC and GS activity during different developmental stages, using the conditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping method. Twenty-two and six conditional QTL were detected for PC and GS activily, respectively. More QTL in leaf PC were detected during the early filling stages than in the later filling stages. Grain PC QTL displayed different dynamic variations to leaf PC QTL during the entire grain-filling stages. All of the QTL were expressed differently over time, and nine conditional QTL were detected across two filling stages. QTL with similar functions may have tended to group in specific locales. This study provides dynamic genetic information on protein accumulation during grain-filling stages.	[Li, H. M.; Liang, H.; Li, Z.; Tang, Z. X.; Fu, S. L.; Yan, B. J.; Ren, Z.

Analysis of alterations to the transcriptome of Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) under low temperature stress via de novo sequencing	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Loquat; Illumina sequencing; Low temperature stress; Transcriptome	GENE-EXPRESSION; POSTHARVEST QUALITY; SALT STRESS; COLD STRESS; RNA-SEQ; FRUIT; ARABIDOPSIS; GENOMICS; DROUGHT; INHIBITION	Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), which originates from the cooler hill regions of southwestern China, is a typical subtropical evergreen tree. Loquat is one of the most important economic crops in China, but the available genomic information is very limited. Here, we present the first deep transcriptomic analysis of loquat. De novo assembly generated 116,723 contigs and 64,814 unigenes using Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 45,739 unigenes were annotated by Nr, GO, and COG datasets. In addition, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of loquat fruit under low temperature stress and 4017 differential expressed genes were identified. We found that the unigenes involved in the brassinosteroid biosynthesis and phosphatidylinositol signaling systems were upregulated, indicating that they have an important role in the resistance of plants to low temperature. Our results provide an invaluable resource for identification of specific genes and proteins involved in loquat development and response to low temperatures.	[Gong, R.

Melatonin receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. The hormone melatonin is secreted primarily by the pineal gland, with highest levels occurring during the dark period of a circadian cycle. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of monochromatic light on chicken egg reproduction and expression of melatonin receptors in chicken ovarian follicles. A total of 552 19-week-old hens were randomly divided into 4 groups with 138 birds in each group. Each group was randomly divided into 3 replicates with 46 birds in each replicate. Feed and water were provided for ad libitum. Light treatments were: control cool white (400-760 nm), blue (480 nm), green (560 nm), and red (660 nm). The short wavelength (blue light) group produced a greater total number of eggs at 300 days of age than did the long wavelength (red light) group, and the red light group showed higher melatonin receptor type 1A and melatonin receptor type 1C mRNA and protein expression. These results suggest that the wavelength of light is closely related to chicken egg number at 300 days of age; there is no effect of monochromatic light on melatonin receptor type 1B.	[Li, D.

At 2 weeks of age, the RNA expression of paired box 7 (Pax7), paired box 3 (Pax3), myogenic differentiation antigen (MYOD), and myogenin (MYOG) genes were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Pax3 and Pax7 protein levels were detected by western blot assay. Myofiber morphology was investigated using paraffin-embedded muscle sections. At 8 weeks of age, 30 ducks of each breed were slaughtered for meat quality determination. The results revealed that Pax3 and Pax7 expression levels at both the RNA and protein levels were high in the Pekin duck. In addition, MYOG expression levels in the Jianchang duck were significantly higher than in the other two duck breeds (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in MYOD expression levels between the breeds (P > 0.05). Myofiber diameter and cross-sectional area were the largest in the Pekin duck and the smallest in the Heiwu duck. There were significant differences in slaughter data between these breeds, and muscle content was greatest in the Pekin duck. The results indicate that the muscle content of three different duck breeds is associated with the expression of satellite-cell marker genes.	[Wang, Y.; Zhang, R. P.; Zhao, Y. M.; Li, Q. Q.; Yan, X.

Hypoxia-related gene expression in porcine skeletal muscle tissues at different altitude	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Hypoxia; Gene expression; Pig; Muscle	FIBER-TYPE COMPOSITION; RAT SOLEUS MUSCLE; HYPOBARIC HYPOXIA; ADAPTATION; METABOLISM; TIBET	Hypoxia influences many physiological processes, such as respiration, cardiovascular, neurophysiology, and digestion. Skeletal muscle is an important motor organ, which relies on oxygen of oxidation; however, the study of hypoxia in skeletal muscle is lacking. In order to understand the effect of hypoxia on skeletal muscle, we determined the expression level of four hypoxia-related genes (ADAM17, ARG2, MMP, and HIF1A) in two distinct skeletal muscle tissues from Tibetan pigs that live at different altitudes (500 and 3650 m). Consistent with the well-characterized role of four hypoxia-related genes in the adaptation to high altitude, we found that, compared with the plain pigs, the plateau pigs had higher mRNA abundances of the four genes and lower myofiber ratio in skeletal muscle. The negative correlation between the myofiber ratio and mRNA abundance of the four hypoxia-related genes highlights their critical roles in skeletal muscle. These findings may be important for understanding skeletal muscle adaptation to high altitude and hypoxia-related muscle diseases in humans.

J	Tan, B; Wu, FZ; Yang, WQ; Xu, ZF; Zhang, L; Liu, Y				Tan, Bo; Wu, Fuzhong; Yang, Wanqin; Xu, Zhengfeng; Zhang, Li; Liu, Yang			Soil fauna significantly contributes to litter decomposition at low temperatures in the alpine/subalpine forests	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						litter decomposition; soil fauna; freeze-thaw cycle; winter ecology	ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAF-LITTER; RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEM; QUALITY	Decomposition of litter is a crucial process in terrestrial ecosystems, determining global carbon budget and nutrient turnover. Soil faunas have been shown to accelerate the rates of litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Litter decomposition has recently been observed in winter in alpine/subalpine ecosystems, but the contribution of soil fauna to the decomposition process is not clear. Field experiment using litterbags was conducted in order to quantify the contributions of soil fauna to mass losses of fir (Abies faxoniana) and birch (Betula albosinensis) litters during a freeze-thaw season in three representative alpine/subalpine forests. The litterbags of mesh sizes 0.02 mm, 0.125 mm, 1.0 mm and 3.0 mm were placed on the forest floor in October 2010, and collected after each of the three stages of the freeze-thaw season: OF, the onset of freezing stage (26 October to December 31); DF, the deeply frozen stage (1 January to 4 March 2011); and TS, the thawing stage (5 March to 30 April 2011) over the entire 2010/2011 winter. Over the whole freeze-thaw period, the mass losses of fir litter were 11-12% (0.02 mm), 12-13% (0.125 mm), 14-15% (1.0 mm) and 17-19% (3.0 mm), and that of birch litter were 10-13% (0.02 mm), 12-15% (0.125 mm), 13-18% (1.0 mm) and 17-22% (3.0 mm), respectively, depending on the altitude. The mass losses caused by microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna for the fir litter accounted for 6-9, 12-13 and 22-25%, respectively and that for the birch litter accounted for 8-11, 13-15 and 25-27%, respectively. Furthermore, the contributions of soil fauna to mass loss showed an increasing trend with increasing body size regardless of species at three stages of the freeze-thaw period. These results suggest that soil fauna contributes strongly to litter decomposition during the freeze-thaw period in alpine/subalpine regions.

The capsid composed by viral structural proteins packs the RNA genome. It is becoming apparent that structural proteins of enteroviruses play versatile roles in the virus-host interaction in the viral life cycle, more than just a shell. Furthermore, structural proteins to some extent may be associated with viral virulence and pathogenesis. Better understanding the roles of structural proteins in enterovirus infection may lead to the development of potential antiviral strategies. Here, we discuss recent advances from studies on the role of structural proteins in enterovirus infection and antiviral therapeutics targeted structural proteins.

Effects of sex and age on chicken TBC1D1 gene mRNA expression	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Age; Chicken; Fatty acids; Sex; TBC1D1	FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MEAT QUALITY; TISSUES; OBESITY	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of sex and slaughter age of chickens on fatty acid composition and TBC1D1 gene expression in 4 different tissues: breast muscle, thigh muscle, abdominal fat, and subcutaneous fat. Sixty Erlang mountainous chickens (hybrid SD02 x SD03) were raised under the same conditions and slaughtered at 8, 10, and 13 weeks of age. The results showed that the sex of the animal significantly affected the content of arachidic acid (C20: 0), sinapic (C22:1), linoleic (C18:2n-6), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acids (C22:6n-3), whereas other fatty acid contents were not affected. Age had a significant effect on most monounsaturated fatty acids, except for octadecenoic acid (C18:1). TBC1D1 mRNA was abundant in all tissues at all 3 ages of slaughter. Cocks exhibited higher TBC1D1 mRNA levels than hens in the thigh muscle and abdominal fat at 10 and 13 weeks, respectively.	[Peng, Y. D.; Xu, H. Y.; Ye, F.; Lan, X.; Peng, X.; Yin, H. D.; Liu, Y.

In addition, we analyzed the distribution of these seven identified loci in four Chinese indigenous chicken breeds, Caoke chicken, Jiuyuan chicken, Sichuan mountain chicken, and Tibetan chicken, using DNA direct sequencing methods, and analyzed the data using bioinformatic methods. Based on the results, we suggest that Caoke chicken could be developed for meat production, while Jiuyuan chicken could be developed for egg production. As Sichuan mountain chicken and Tibetan chicken exhibited large polymorphisms, these breeds could be improved by changing their living environment.	[Lan, D.; Hu, Y. D.; Zhu, Q.; Li, D. Y.; Liu, Y.

Promoter and first exon methylation regulate porcine FASN gene expression	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Pig; FASN; DNA methylation; MassArray; Adipocyte	FATTY-ACID SYNTHASE; DNA METHYLATION; FOOD-INTAKE; ASSOCIATION; ADIPOSE; OBESITY; ENZYME; TISSUE	DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark mediating gene expression. Methylation is crucial for diverse biological processes, including aging and embryo development. FASN (fatty acid synthase) plays an important role in de novo lipogenesis, through catalyzing the reductive synthesis of long-chain fatty acids. In this study, we investigated the FASN gene expression pattern and corresponding DNA methylation status in the inner layer of backfat from Jinhua pigs at different developmental stages. Our results showed that FASN gene expression increases with age and is positively associated with adipocyte volume (r = 0.98, P < 0.01). In addition, the DNA methylation level for the first exon (0.11, CGI 3) of the FASN gene is approximately 8-fold lower than levels for its promoter (0.94, CGI 1&2) (two-way ANOVA, P-CGI < 0.01). The association analysis revealed that both promoter (r = -0.944, P < 0.01) and first exon methylation (r = -0.774, P < 0.01) are significantly and negatively correlated with FASN gene expression. Our results will benefit future investigations of the epigenetic mechanism underlying FASN gene expression.	[Long, K. R.; Ma, J. D.; Chen, L.; Wang, P. J.; He, D. F.; Li, M. Z.; Li, X.

It was found that aerobically pretreated OFMSW presented higher pH and alkalinity of 7.89 and 1300 mg CaCO3 center dot L-1 compared to not pre-treated OFMSW. After the aerobic pretreatment, the C/N ratio in OFMSW was 34.81, which was lower than the original OFMSW, and more beneficial to anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion results indicated that the total biogas production rates of pre-treated OFMSW were higher than those of untreated OFMSW, by 14.20, 349.81 and 22.36% for the loading rates of 20, 50 and 30 g VS center dot L-1, respectively, when the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) of activated sludge was at 15000, 30000 and 45000 mg L-1. The pre-treated OFMSW could also shorten the technical digestion time by 3-11 days, in contrast to the original OFMSW. Based on these results, it could be concluded that fast aerobic fermentation pretreatment could be regarded as one of the efficient methods to improve anaerobic digestion of OFMSW.

However, knowledge of the effects of spermine supplementation and its duration extension on intestinal growth and antioxidant capacity is lacking. The present work aims to investigate the effects of spermine administration and its extended supplementation on the morphology, digestive enzyme activities, and antioxidant status of the jejunum in suckling rats. The rats received 0.2 mu mol g(-1) body weight of either spermine or saline solution via intragastric ingestion for 3 or 7 d, and jejunum samples obtained 24 h after the last spermine supplementation were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the specific activity of maltase and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in rat jejunum were significantly increased by 105.5% and 11.1%, respectively; in contrast, lactase activity was significantly decreased by 34.8% (spermine group versus the control group). Time extension of spermine administration (7 d) significantly increased the villus height, villus width, surface area, and crypt depth in rat jejunum by 11.2%, 18.2%, 5.9%, and 50%, respectively, but significantly decreased the specific activities of lactase, maltase, alkaline phosphatase, and malondialdehyde content by 26.8%, 36.4%, 41.3%, and 26.0% (P < 0.05), respectively. Protein content, sucrase, catalase, T-SOD, and anti-superoxide anion activities were also increased by 23.1%, 424.2%, 45.7%, 11.7%, and 26.4% (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to the levels observed during spermine administration for 3 d. Taken together, the results suggest that spermine administration and extension of its supplementation duration can accelerate gut development and enhance antioxidant properties.

Forty 3-month-old weaned yaks were selected and assigned to four dietary groups (Control, 17, 19 and 21% CP). Dietary CP supplements had a significant effect on average daily gain (ADG), crypt depth (CD) (duodenum, jejunum and ileum), villous height (VH) (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and CD/VH (jejunum and ileum). Average daily gain, CD (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and VH (ileum) showed quadratic increases as the dietary CP increased, whereas CD/VH (jejunum and ileum) ratios showed quadratic decreases. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose (GLU), immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma concentrations increased significantly, whereas albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decreased significantly with dietary CP supplements. Dietary CP supplements significantly increased the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and the nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor (NFAT) for gene expression. As the dietary CP supplements increased, IL-6, IFN-gamma and NF-AT gene expression showed quadratic increases. These results showed that the appropriate dietary CP supplementation improved the growth performance and intestinal development of early-weaned yaks and thus that the CP supplements were beneficial and enhanced the humoral immunity response of yaks.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary lysine concentration on carcass and meat quality traits, and serum parameters in two lines SD02 and SD03 - which originated from a Chinese local breed, the Erlang Mountainous chicken. Live body weight, carcass traits, meat quality traits (myofibre diameter and density), and serum metabolic markers were measured in high and low dietary lysine groups (HL and LL, respectively) at the end of the starter (1-28 days), grower (29-49 days) and finisher (50-70 days) periods. The results showed that mortality, live weight (LW), myofibre diameter of leg muscle (LFDM) and serum cholesterol (CHO) were greater in HL than LL (P<0.05). The chickens from HL had reduced subcutaneous fat thickness and heart weight than LL (P<0.05). The chickens from line SD02 had greater leg muscle weight, myofibre diameter in breast, and LFDM than line SD03 (P<0.05). The chickens from line SD02 had more serum urea nitrogen and less total proteins than line SD03 (P<0.05). In conclusion, high lysine diets improved slaughter performance and muscle fibre diameter, and SD02 chickens had greater carcass yield and superior meat quality compared with chickens from line SD03.

The treatments were organized in three different carbohydrate composition diets: the wheat fibre rich diet (WF) (67.2% wheat bran and 25.7% corn grain in concentration), mixed diet (MD) (45.1% wheat bran and 34.3% corn grain) and corn starch rich diet (CS) (2.1% wheat bran and 63.8% corn grain), respectively (n=6). The results showed that consumption of CS diet led to a decrease in NH3-N (ammonia nitrogen) concentration (P<0.05), and microbial protein concentration were increased (P<0.05). They indicated more efficient ruminal NH3-N utilization and microbial protein (MCP) synthesis with increasing corn starch proportion. Compared with WF diet, concentrations of acetate, propionate and TVFA (total volatile fat acid) were increased in MD and CS diets (P<0.01). The results of Real-time PCR technique indicted that the microbes in rumen were sensitive to dietary carbohydrate composition, and the consumption of CS diets increased Protozoa population, as well as Streptococcus bovis (P<0.05). Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens population of WF and MD (8 h) was higher than that of CS (P<0.01), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens population (24 h) got lower within WF treatment (P<0.01). These results indicated that the microbial community structure and improved ruminal fermentation are affected by the composition of dietary carbohydrate. Maximizing nitrogen utilization and MCP synthesis could be obtained when non-structural carbohydrate rich diet (2.1% wheat bran and 63.8% corn grain) was used.

In this study, in order to scale up the production of the active recombinant porcine PID1 (pPID1) protein, we reported the expression and purification of a His-tagged version of pPID1 in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The pPID1 cDNA was cloned into the pPICZ alpha A vector and was expressed in methylotrophic yeast (P. pastoris X33) under control of the alcohol oxidase promoter. The intracellularly expressed recombinant protein was purified by Ni-IDA affinity chromatography, yielding over 95% purity and about 1.8 mg/L. The recombinant protein was identified by Western blot. In addition, the tissue distribution of pPID1 protein was investigated, and expression of pPID1 protein was mainly detected in the skeletal muscles and liver. This study provides a simple and efficient method for yielding a large amount of active recombinant pPID1, which can be useful for further study of the pPID1 protein.

Here, goose IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 were cloned and identified for the first time. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that relatively high levels of goose IFN gamma mRNA transcripts were detected in immune tissues, including the harderian gland, cecal tonsil, cecum, and thymus. Relatively high expression levels of both IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 were detected in the cecal tonsil, which implicated an important role of IFN gamma in the secondary immune system of geese. No specific correlation between IFN gamma, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 expression levels was observed in the same tissues of healthy geese. IFN gamma and its cognate receptors showed different expression profiles, although they appeared tomaintain a relatively balanced state. Furthermore, the agonist R848 led to the upregulation of goose IFN gamma but did not affect the expression of goose IFNGR1 or IFNGR2. In summary, trends in expression of goose IFN gamma and its cognate receptors showed tissue specificity, as well as an age-related dependency. These findings may help us to better understand the age-related susceptibility to pathogens in birds.

A lectin was purified from the rhizomes of Aspidistra elatior Blume, named A. elatior lectin (AEL). In vitro experiments showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of AEL against the vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus were all the same at about 4 mu g/mL. However, AEL was ineffective against the Sindbis virus and reovirus-1. AEL also showed significant in vitro antiproliferative activity towards Bre-04, Lu-04, HepG2, and Pro-01 tumor cell lines by increasing the proportion of their sub-G(1) phase. However, AEL failed to restrict the proliferation of the HeLa cell line. Western blotting indicated that AEL induced the upregulation of cell cycle-related proteins p53 and p21. The molecular basis and species-specific effectiveness of the anti-proliferative and anti-viral potential of AEL are discussed.

In order to select parents that are highly heterozygous for genetic mapping, the heterozygosity (H-S) of 24 tea cultivars (Camellia sinensis) was analyzed with 72 simple sequence repeat markers. In total, 359 alleles were obtained with an average of 4.99 per marker. The H-S varied greatly from 37.5 to 71.0% with an average of 51.3%. On average, tea cultivars from Fujian Province showed a higher level of heterozygosity (59.8%) than those from Zhejiang (48.5%) and Yunnan (44.5%), and the 12 national tea cultivars were generally more heterozygous than the 12 provincial cultivars. Unweighted pair-group analysis using the arithmetic average grouping divided the 24 cultivars into 2 groups that are consistent with the morphological classification. All dual combinations of the 24 cultivars were studied to calculate the percentage of mappable markers when using pseudo-testcross mapping strategy, and results showed that this value also varied greatly from 51.4 to 90.3%. The genetic relationships and H-S differences among different cultivars were discussed, and tea cultivars with high H-S were recommended as cross parents for genetic mapping programs.	[Tan, L.

To date, no comprehensive study has been conducted to examine mtDNA copy number variations in pigs. In the current study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the mtDNA copy number in 15 pig tissue types at 5 growth stages from embryo to adult. Observable differences in mtDNA content were detected in the tissues, including a 6-fold greater mtDNA content in the heart compared with the lung of 180-day-old samples. mtDNA content in the heart, longissimus dorsi muscle, psoas major muscle, kidney, brain, ovary, and subcutaneous adipose increased with growth. Expression of the replicative mitochondrial helicase (TWINKLE), which regulates mtDNA turnover, was significantly associated with changes in mtDNA copy numbers across tissues during growth (r = 0.33, P = 0.01). We demonstrated that the expression levels of mitochondrial genes were positively correlated with mtDNA copy number.	[Xie, Y. M.; Jin, L.; Chen, X. J.; He, M. N.; Wang, Y.; Liu, R.; Li, M. Z.; Li, X.

Its synthesis is closely related to sucrose metabolism. In our previous study, we found that the expression of most of the genes involved in starch synthesis might be regulated by sugars and hormones in the maize endosperm. However, little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in sucrose metabolism. Thus, in this study, maize endosperms were treated with different sugars and hormones and the expression of genes involved in sucrose metabolism (including synthesis, degradation, and transport) were evaluated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found that genes affected by different sugars and hormones were primarily regulated by abscisic acid. Sucrose and abscisic acid showed an additive effect on the expression of some genes. Differences in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis were observed.	[Ren, X. D.; Liu, H. M.; Zhang, J.

Assessment of genetic diversity of bermudagrass germplasm from southwest China and Africa by using AFLP markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						AFLP marker; Bermudagrass; Genetic structure	CYNODON SPP.; DNA ANALYSIS; CULTIVARS; GENOTYPES	Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. var. dactylon (common bermudagrass) is widely distributed geographically between approximately 45 degrees N and 45 degrees S latitude, penetrating to approximately 53 degrees N latitude in Europe. The extensive variation of morphological and adaptive characteristics of the taxon has been substantially documented, but information is lacking on DNA molecular variation in geographically disparate forms. The genetic diversity of 51 wild accessions of bermudagrass from southwest China (Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet) and 8 African bermudagrass was analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism molecular markers. A total of 670 polymorphic bands were detected with 11 primer combinations, of which 663 (98.74%) bands were found to be polymorphic. The genetic similarity among the accessions ranged from 0.64-0.96 with an average of 0.78. All 59 wild accessions were clustered into 5 ecogeographic groups, and nearly all accessions from the same area were classified into the same group and were found to be associated with their geographical distributions. Therefore, complex geographical and ecological environments are important factors for the genetic structure and geographical distribution of C. dactylon.	[Ling, Y.; Yan, H.

Sequence characterization and phylogenetic analysis of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 gene in the Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Innate immunity; Macaca thibetana; Phylogenetic analysis; Toll-like receptor; TLR4 gene	CONTROL REGION SEQUENCES; EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS; CHINA; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM; RECOGNITION; DIVERSITY; PRIMATES; PROTEIN	In this study, the complete coding region sequence of an innate immune-related TLR4 gene was obtained from the Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana) genome via PCR and direct sequencing. The sequence had a total length of 2481 bp, contained 3 complete exons, and encoded 826 amino acids (AAs); its isoelectric point was 5.703, and the molecular weight was 94.72 kDa. The high structure prediction showed that the protein was comprised of one extracellular region, one transmembrane region, and one intracellular region. There were 48 potential functional sites in the protein, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation sites. A homology analysis among 9 primate species, including the Tibetan macaque, human, chimpanzee, gibbon, rhesus macaque, cynomolgus monkey, pig-tailed monkey, squirrel monkey, and small-eared galago, showed that the homology of the nucleotide and AA sequences ranged from 60.9-99.5% and 51.4-99.0%, respectively. Higher variability was identified in the extracellular region of the TLR4 protein, and its variable sites accounted for 88.79% (AA) of the total variable sites. Additionally, the number of AAs at the 3' end of the intracellular region was notably different among the primate lineages. The phylogenetic tree based on TLR4 gene exons of 9 primate species showed that the Tibetan macaque clustered with the rhesus macaque, cynomolgus monkey, and pig-tailed monkey; it was most distant from the small-eared galago. This study will provide an important basis for further study on the expression, regulation, and polymorphism of the TLR4 gene and the relationship between polymorphisms and host disease susceptibility.

Estimation of the growth curve and heritability of the growth rate for giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) cubs	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Growth; Chapman model; Feeding program; Lactation; Survival rate	WOLONG NATURE-RESERVE; BODY-SIZE; DEGRADATION; BATCH; CHINA	Giant panda cubs have a low survival rate during the newborn and early growth stages. However, the growth and developmental parameters of giant panda cubs during the early lactation stage (from birth to 6 months) are not well known. We examined the growth and development of giant panda cubs by the Chapman growth curve model and estimated the heritability of the maximum growth rate at the early lactation stage. We found that 83 giant panda cubs reached their maximum growth rate at approximately 75-120 days after birth. The body weight of cubs at 75 days was 4285.99 g. Furthermore, we estimated that the heritability of the maximum growth rate was moderate (h(2) = 0.38). Our study describes the growth and development of giant panda cubs at the early lactation stage and provides valuable growth benchmarks. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for more detailed research on increasing the survival rate of giant panda cubs. Feeding programs for giant panda cubs need further improvement.

Analysis of carcass and meat quality traits and nutritional values of hybrid wild boars under different crossing systems	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Wild boars; Hybrid system; Carcass; Meat quality; Nutritional value	LONGISSIMUS-DORSI MUSCLE; AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; PORK QUALITY; FATTY-ACID; FEED-EFFICIENCY; WHITE COMPOSITE; EATING QUALITY; BODY-WEIGHTS; MINZHU PIGS; DUROC	The aim of this study was to analyze the results of two crossing systems between wild boars and different domesticated pig breeds. Hybrid wild boars were produced by crossing captured wild boars with Meishan pigs and LY sows according to the traditional production system. The resultant commercial hybrids were black and white in coat color, respectively. Significant differences were found in the carcass and meat quality traits and nutritional values between these two hybrid wild boars. Compared with the white hybrid wild boars, at the age of 300 days, the body weight of black hybrid wild boars was 9.41 kg lower, while percent lean was 2.51% less and percent fat 2.45% higher (P < 0.05). The black hybrid wild boars had higher pH(2) (6.17 vs 6.09) and intramuscular fat (3.34 vs 2.52%), lower drip loss (2.21 vs 2.68%) and shear force (44.00 vs 52.23) (P < 0.05), and more unsaturated fatty acids and essential amino acids (P < 0.05). In conclusion, cross breeding was shown to be an effective method to improve the overall production performance of wild boars, but crossing with different dam line breeds caused different responses. Compared with the white hybrid wild boars, the black hybrid wild boars had worse growth rate and carcass traits, but better meat quality traits and nutritional values.

Urbanization dramatically altered the water balances of a paddy field-dominated basin in southern China	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; LAND-USE CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGICAL SIMULATION; IMPERVIOUS COVER; UNITED-STATES; ANNUAL RUNOFF; RIVER-BASIN; TIME-SERIES; IMPACT	Rice paddy fields provide important ecosystem services (e.g., food production, water retention, carbon sequestration) to a large population globally. However, these benefits are diminishing as a result of rapid environmental and socioeconomic transformations, characterized by population growth, urbanization, and climate change in many Asian countries. This case study examined the responses of stream flow and watershed water balances to the decline of rice paddy fields due to urbanization in the Qinhuai River basin in southern China, where massive industrialization has occurred during the past 3 decades. We found that stream flow increased by 58% and evapotranspiration (ET) decreased by 23% during 1986-2013 as a result of a threefold increase in urban areas and a reduction of rice paddy fields by 27%. Both high flows and low flows increased significantly by about 28% from 2002 to 2013. The increases in stream flow were consistent with the decreases in ET and leaf area index monitored by independent remote sensing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. Attribution analysis, based on two empirical models, indicated that land-use/land-cover change contributed about 82-108% of the observed increase in stream flow from 353 +/- 287 mm yr(-1) during 1986-2002 to 556 +/- 145 during 2003-2013. We concluded that the reduction in ET was largely attributed to the conversion of cropland to urban use. The effects of land-use change overwhelmed the effects of regional climate warming and climate variability. Converting traditional rice paddy fields to urban use dramatically altered land surface conditions from an artificial wetland-dominated landscape to an urban land-use-dominated one, and thus was considered an extreme type of contemporary hydrologic disturbance. The ongoing large-scale urbanization of the rice paddy-dominated regions, in humid southern China and East Asia, will likely elevate storm-flow volume, aggravate flood risks, and intensify urban heat island effects. Understanding the connection between land-use/land-cover change and changes in hydrological processes is essential for better management of urbanizing watersheds in the rice paddy-dominated landscape.

The antibacterial susceptibility test result indicated minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of berberine against Streptococcus agalactiae was 78 mu g/mL and the time-kill curves showed the correlation of concentration-time. After the bacteria was exposed to 78 mu g/mL berberine, the fragmentary cell membrane and cells unequal division were observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicating the bacterial cells were severely damaged. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) study demonstrated that berberine could damage bacterial cells through destroying cellular proteins. Meanwhile, Fluorescence microscope revealed that berberine could affect the synthesis of DNA. In conclusion, these results strongly suggested that berberine may damage the structure of bacterial cell membrane and inhibit synthesis of protein and DNA, which cause Streptococcus agalactiae bacteria to die eventually.

Beauv.; Ustilago spp.; rice false smut	USTILAGINOIDEA-VIRENS; PANICLES; BALLS	Rice false smut is caused by ascomycete Villosiclava virens, whose potential alternative hosts have been assumed previously. Here its potential alternative hosts were surveyed and identified from 2008 to 2013 in the main rice-growing regions in China. Two common weeds in paddy fields, Digitaria sanguinalis Scop. and Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv., were found to present the similar symptoms to smut diseases in a few individuals in 2012 and 2013 in Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces of China, respectively. After the examinations of the spore morphology, their infection and extension mode in hosts, pathogen cell wall components, and molecular identification, the two pathogens were identified to be the Basidiomycetes, Ustilago syntherismae and Ustilago trichophora, respectively. So far there has been no alternative host of V. virens to be identified in China. These suggest that the alternative hosts of V. virens, if they do exist, are not possible to play an important role in the pathogen life cycle and the disease epidemics.

We find that the tetrahedral isomer adsorbed on the studied tubes, with a triangular face on the SWNT, is predominantly favored. The metal-SWNT interaction in the zigzag tube-supported Ir-4 systems is significantly stronger than that in the armchair-supported systems. A strong hybridization between the p orbital of the SWNT and the d orbital of the Ir atoms is formed when the Ir-4 cluster is adsorbed on the SWNT surface. The charge density difference also shows that a substantial concentration of electrons accumulates as Ir-C bonds. The CO/NO adsorption on the SWNT-supported Ir-4 cluster is also investigated. All of the zigzag tube-supported Ir-4 clusters possess lower adsorption energies relative to the free-and armchair-supported Ir-4 clusters. Our investigation indicates that the zigzag-type SWNTs not only stabilize the Ir clusters, but also enhance their catalytic performance.

Batch chemical soil washing experiments were conducted to optimize Pb removal efficiency from contaminated soil by two biodegradable chelants, citric acid (CA) and [S, S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS). The influences of chelant concentration, pH and contact time were evaluated. In a single factor test, a maximum Pb removal efficiency of 77.84% was achieved with 100 mM CA solution and pH 2.0 for 60 min, while it reached 81.49% with 400 mM EDDS solution and pH 4.0 for 60 min. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to optimize the experimental conditions. The interactions between selective factors were significant (P < 0.05). Polynomial models were developed for the experimental response and optimal conditions were obtained with high determination coefficients (R-2 >= 0.90, P < 0.05). Furthermore, Pb removal efficiencies by CA and EDDS washing were 70.08 and 80.26%, respectively, under optimal conditions, and close to the predicted values (74.49 and 83.95%) from RSM. The results confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the optimization process using RSM. Therefore, response surface methodology is a suitable approach to determine the optimal parameters for chemical soil washing to remediate heavy metal polluted soil using biodegradable chelants.

A suitable SCoT-PCR system for D. glomerata was established; the 20 mu L reaction volume contained 3.0 mM Mg2+, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.0 U Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mu M primer, 20 ng template DNA, and 2 mu L 10X buffer. Each factor had a different effect on the amplification reaction, and the concentration of dNTPs had the largest effect on the SCoT-PCR system. We tested 10 orchardgrass samples to determine and verify the stability of the reaction system. The results showed that amplified bands from diverse materials were clear, stable, and rich in polymorphisms, indicating that the optimized system was very stable.	[Zeng, B.; Yan, H.

Four treatment groups were used, including a negative control group, VD3-injection group, LPS-injection group, and both VD3-injection and LPS-injection group. At 4, 24, and 48 h post-injection, intestines were collected and RNA was isolated to measure the chicken beta-defensin genes with putative vitamin D responsive elements using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expressions of all 7 chicken beta-defensin genes was detectable in the intestines. Significant increases in GAL-6, -7 and -9 were found following LPS injection treatment at 4, 24, and 48 h post-injection, respectively, whereas VD3 injection did not affect the expression of any investigated genes under normal conditions. However, the expression of GAL-4, -5, -6, and -10 were synergistically upregulated by VD3 in combination with LPS. These results suggest that VD3 enhances the immune immunity during LPS challenge by inducing the expression of chicken beta-defensin genes when birds are exposed to immune stressors.

Health and production traits in bovine are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NOD2 gene	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Bovine mastitis; NOD2 gene; Somatic cell score	NF-KAPPA-B; CLINICAL MASTITIS; CROHNS-DISEASE; SOMATIC-CELL; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDES; PATHOGENS; VARIANTS; FAMILY	The NOD2 gene plays a fundamental role in initiating the inflammatory and subsequent immune response. NOD2 was previously identified as a susceptibility locus for inflammatory bowel diseases in humans. In this study, we detected 2 mutations in exon 12 (A -> T, G -> A) among 5 cattle breeds (N = 315) and analyzed their associations with production traits and genetic resistance against bovine mastitis in Chinese Holstein and Chinese Simmental breeds (N = 218). The transitions (A -> T) at position 114 bp were associated with somatic cell score (P < 0.01). The G -> A at position 1594 bp plays a critical role in increasing 305-day milk yields. In Chinese Holstein and Chinese Simmental breeds, the BB genotype may contribute to disease susceptibility. Compared to all genotypic combinations, the A, B, andFF genotypes are beneficial not only for reducing somatic cell score but also for increasing production.	[Wang, W.; Lai, S.

Molecular cloning and expression analysis of TRAF3 in chicken	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Chicken; Cloning; Gene expression; Newcastle disease virus; Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3	NECROSIS-FACTOR RECEPTOR; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; KAPPA-B ACTIVATION; ANTIVIRAL RESPONSE; RIG-I; CYTOPLASMIC DOMAIN; MDA5; SPECIFICITY; INVOLVEMENT; PATHWAYS	Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is a crucial regulator that suppresses c-Jun N-terminal kinase and non-canonical nuclear factor-kappa B signaling, but facilitates type I interferon production. To determine TRAF3 function in innate immune responses among birds, particularly chicken, we cloned and characterized the chicken TRAF3 gene (chTRAF3) and detected its tissue expression profile in chicken. We also detected the differential expression of chTRAF3 and its downstream gene interferon-beta (IFN-beta) upon different stimuli in primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells. Two chTRAF3 gene products, chTRAF3-1 and chTRAF3-2, can be produced by alternative splicing. The full-length coding sequence of chTRAF3 (chTRAF3-1) was 1704 base pairs and encoded a protein of 567 amino acids with high identity to TRAF3 homologs from mammals and other birds. The deduced amino acid sequence showed typical characteristics of TRAFs, with a RING finger domain, 2 zf-TRAF motifs, and a MATH domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed broad expression of chTRAF3 in all detected tissues, with abundant expression in the spleen, thymus, lung, and small intestine. Expression of chTRAF3 was significantly upregulated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in chicken embryo fibroblast cells challenged with poly I:C or poly dA-dT. Furthermore, chTRAF3 and IFN-beta mRNA expression from chicken embryo fibroblast cells challenged with Newcastle disease virus F48E9 suffered intense suppression compared with Newcastle disease virus Mukteswar infection. Our results indicate that chTRAF3 plays important roles in defending against both RNA and DNA virus infection.	[Yang, H. L.; Feng, Z. Q.; Zeng, S. Q.; Zhu, Q.; Liu, Y.

Genetic relationships analysis of olive cultivars grown in China	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Olea europaea L.; Cultivar identification; SSR, ISSR, Genetic similarity; Genetic diversity	OLEA-EUROPAEA L.; SEQUENCE REPEATS SSRS; MEDITERRANEAN BASIN; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; MORPHOLOGICAL MARKERS; ANCIENT CULTIVARS; MOLECULAR MARKERS; AFLP MARKERS; IDENTIFICATION; TREE	The olive tree is an iconic tree of the Mediterranean, and is used extensively to produce high-quality olive oil. Although the China olive industry has just begun to be valued, there were also existed mislabeling and synonyms in introduced cultivars. The aim of this study was to analyze genetic similarities among olive cultivars in China using SSR and ISSR techniques. Thirty-two samples were collected from Xichang. Five of these cultivars were issued from a Chinese breeding program. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from young leaves and PCR was used to generate SSR and ISSR markers. A total of 107 polymorphic bands were detected on thirteen SSR loci, with an average of eight alleles per locus. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.785 (DCA03) to 0.990 (GAPU47), and the expected heterozygosity varied between 0.782 (DCA03) and 0.940 (GAPU103A). The discrimination power ranged from 0.57 to 0.83, while the polymorphism information content values ranged from 0.768 (DCA03) to 0.934 (GAPU103A). Nine ISSR primers generated 85 reproducible bands of which 78 (91.8%) were polymorphic. Based on our data, genetic similarity between cultivars ranged from 0.57 to 0.83. Cluster analysis revealed that 32 cultivars were clustered into six groups, which supports similar morphology such as use, oil content and fruit weight but not similar geographical origins. Our data also allow the identification of unknown cultivars and cases of synonyms.	[Zhan, M. M.; Cheng, Z. Z.; Chen, H. P.; Huang, Q. M.] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Sci, Yaan, Peoples R China; [Su, G.

Molecular cloning and bioinformatic analysis of the Streptococcus agalactiae neuA gene isolated from tilapia	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Cloning; Bioinformatic analyses; Streptococcus agalactiae; neuA gene; NeuA amino acid sequences	GROUP-B STREPTOCOCCI; CAPSULAR POLYSACCHARIDE; PROTEIN; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; GLYCOSYLATION; PHOSPHORYLATION; REGIONS; SERVER	Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) synthetase, which is encoded by the neuA gene, can catalyze the activation of sialic acid with CMP, and plays an important role in Streptococcus agalactiae infection pathogenesis. To study the structure and function of the S. agalactiae neuA gene, we isolated it from diseased tilapia, amplified it using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers, and cloned it into a pMD19-T vector. The recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion, and identified by sequencing. Molecular characterization analyses of the neuA nucleotide amino acid sequence were performed using bioinformatic tools and an online server. The results showed that the neuA nucleotide sequence contained a complete coding region, which comprised 1242 bp, encoding 413 amino acids (aa). The aa sequence was highly conserved and contained a Glyco_ tranf_ GTA_ type superfamily and an SGNH_ hydrolase superfamily conserved domain, which are related to sialic acid activation catalysis. The NeuA protein possessed many important sites related to post-translational modification, including 28 potential phosphorylation sites and 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, had no signal peptides or transmembrane regions, and was predicted to reside in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the protein had some B-cell epitopes, which suggests its potential in development of a vaccine against S. agalactiae infection. The codon usage frequency of neuA differed greatly in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens genes, and neuA may be more efficiently expressed in eukaryotes (yeast). S. agalactiae neuA from tilapia maintains high structural homology and sequence identity with CMP-NeuNAc synthetases from other bacteria.	[Wang, E. L.; Wang, K. Y.; Chen, D. F.; Geng, Y.; Huang, L.

Dynamic changes of virus load in supernatant of primary CEK cell culture infected with different generations of avian infectious bronchitis virus strains Sczy3 as revealed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Chick embryo kidney cells; Dynamic changes; Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Infectious bronchitis virus	RT-PCR; CHICKENS	Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can multiply effectively in chick embryo kidney (CEK) cells after adapting to the chick embryo. To investigate the dynamic changes in IBV load in the supernatant of primary CEK cells, we developed an SYBR Green I-based real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to quantify nucleic copy numbers of the IBV-Sczy3 strain. The 20, 54, and 87th generations of CEK-adapted IBV-Sczy3 strains were used to infect CEK cells, and then nucleic copy numbers in the samples of supernatant collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h were detected. The results showed that the rapid growth period of the virus load of all the 3 generations was approximately 12-36 h post-infection; the peak of the virus load appeared at 36 h post-infection and then decreased gradually in the order of 20th > 54th > 87th for the 3 generations of CEK-adapted strains; the dynamic change curve of the IBV load in the supernatant of primary CEK cells showed a single peak. The results of this study provide a useful reference for CEK-adapted IBV field strains and the production of CEK-attenuated IBV vaccine.	[Wei, Z. J.; Wang, F. Y.; Guo, M. P.; Duan, Z. Z.; Zou, N.

Association between FTO polymorphism in exon 3 with carcass and meat quality traits in crossbred ducks	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Crossbred duck; Fat mass and obesity-associated gene; Carcass and meat quality trait; Single nucleotide polymorphism	MUSCLE-FIBER CHARACTERISTICS; INTRAMUSCULAR FAT-CONTENT; BEEF-CATTLE; BODY-WEIGHT; GENE; OBESITY; MASS; EXPRESSION; LEPTIN; GROWTH	The fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) is an excellent candidate gene that affects energy metabolism. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FTO are associated with carcass and meat quality traits in pigs, cattle, and rabbits. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between novel SNPs in the FTO coding region and carcass and meat quality traits in 95 crossbred ducks, using DNA sequencing. We found two transitions G/A (SNP 387 and 473) within exon 3. SNP 387 was a synonymous mutation, whereas SNP 473 was a missense mutation. Association analysis suggested that SNP g.387G>A was significantly associated with all of the carcass traits measured, the intramuscular fat content (IMF), cooking yield (CY), pH values 45 min after slaughter (pH45m), drip losses from the breast muscle, and the leg muscle (P < 0.05). For SNP g.473G>A, the genotype AA exhibited greater leg muscle weight than the genotypes GG or AG (P < 0.05). The D value suggested that the two SNPs exhibited strong linkage disequilibrium. Three haplotypes (G(1)G(2), G(1)A(2), and A(1)A(2)) were significantly associated with IMF, CY, the a* value, and all of the carcass traits measured (P < 0.05). The results suggest that FTO is a candidate locus that affects carcass and meat quality traits in ducks.	[Gan, W.; Song, Q.; Zhang, N. N.; Xiong, X. P.; Wang, D. M.

Effects of antibacterial peptide on cellular immunity in weaned piglets	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						antimicrobial peptide; apoptosis; lymphocyte cycle; lymphocyte proliferation; T cell subset; weaned piglets	ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE; ASTRAGALUS POLYSACCHARIDE; T-CELL; APOPTOSIS; PIGS; PROLIFERATION; PERFORMANCE; VACCINATION; CHICKENS; BROILERS	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of antibacterial peptide (ABP) sufficiency on cellular immune functions by determining the spleen cell cycle and apoptosis, peripheral blood T cell subsets, and T cell proliferation function in weaned piglets. A total of 90 piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) of both sexes were randomly allotted to 5 dietary treatments. Each treatment consisted of 3 replicates with 6 piglets per replicate. The dietary treatments consisted of the negative control (NC; basal diet), positive control (PC; basal diet supplemented with 400 mg/kg Astragalus polysaccharide), and ABP (basal diet mixed with 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg ABP). The experimental lasted for 28 d. Two piglets from each replicate were selected randomly for blood samples extraction from the jugular vein to obtain peripheral blood T cell subsets, and T cell proliferation function analysis was performed on d 32, 39, 46, and 53. Two piglets from each replicate were selected and euthanized to observe the spleen cell cycle and apoptosis on d 39 and 53. In ABP-sufficient piglets, the G(0)/G(1) phase of the spleen cell cycle was much lower (P < 0.05) and the S and G(2) + M phases and proliferation index (PI) were greater (P < 0.05) than in NC piglets. The percentage of apoptotic cells in the spleen significantly decreased under ABP sufficiency (P < 0.05). The proliferation function of peripheral blood T cells increased (P < 0.05) in ABP-sufficient piglets. Percentages of CD3+ and CD3+CD4+ ratios (d 39, 46, and 53) and CD4+CD8+ ratios (d 32, 39, 46, and 53) increased remarkably (P < 0.05) under ABP sufficiency compared with NC. These results suggest that ABP sufficiency could increase the T cell population and proliferation function of T cells and could induce decreased percentages of apoptotic cells. Overall, the cellular immune function was evidently improved in weaned piglets. We suggest optimal dosages of 500 mg/kg ABP for 4-wk addition and 1,000 mg/ kg ABP for 2-wk addition.	[Ren, Z.

The transcripts of specific carotenoid biosynthetic genes are probably important for the formation of different colors of flower petals. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) enzyme activity is important for the high content of carotenoids in petals. In the present study, the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene in Brassica napus L. (BnZEP) was cloned and bioinformatically analyzed. The expression levels of the BnZEP gene in different plant organs and petals of different colors were investigated and compared in Brassica napus. The results showed that the full-length cDNA sequence of BnZEP was 2228 bp, containing an open reading frame of 2010 bp and encoding a putative protein of 669 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 73.8 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.16. The full-length genomic DNA sequence of BnZEP was 3268 bp, containing 16 exons and 15 introns, the same as in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtZEP). The predicted amino acid sequence of BnZEP revealed a close phylogenetic relationship among the cruciferous species, including Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression levels of BnZEP were remarkably different in different organs and in petals of different colors. Obviously higher expression levels of BnZEP were found in flower petals than in leaves and buds. Yellow petals had markedly higher expression levels of BnZEP than white petals. The results showed that the expression level of BnZEP was positively correlated with yellow petal color in Brassica napus L. However, the highest expression level of BnZEP was observed in the pale yellow flower petals of the F-1 hybrid (HW243 x ZHONGYOU 821). This implied that the expression level of BnZEP was not completely related to the degree of yellow petal color in Brassica napus L. Based on the roles of ZEP enzyme in the xanthophyll cycle, it was suggested that the yellow flower color in Brassica napus L. was probably associated with the accumulation of antheraxanthin and violaxanthin in the petals. However, further studies are necessary to identify the specific key carotenoid(s) for the yellow color in the petals of Brassica napus L.

Previous studies have shown a marked variation in the number of beta-defensins among species, but the underlying reason is unclear. To address this question, we performed comprehensive computational searches to study the intact beta-defensin genes from 29 vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis of the beta-defensin genes in vertebrates identified frequent changes in the number of beta-defensin genes and multiple species-specific gene gains and losses that have been occurring throughout the evolution of vertebrates. The number of intact beta-defensin genes varied from 1 in the western clawed frog to 20 in cattle, with numerous expansions and contractions of the gene family throughout vertebrates, especially among tetrapods. The beta-defensin gene number in a species is relevant to the ever-changing microbial challenges from the environment that they inhabit. Selection pressure analysis shows there exist three amino acid sites under significant positive selection. Protein structural characteristics analysis suggests that structural diversity determines the diverse functions of beta-defensins. Our study provides a new perspective on the relationships among vertebrate beta-defensin gene repertoires and different survival circumstances, which helps explain how beta-defensins have evolved.

Rats were intragastrically administered with 0.2 mu mol g(-1) body weight of either spermine or saline for 3 or 7 days. The ileum samples taken 24 h after the last spermine ingestion were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics. The results showed that the villus width, surface area, and crypt depth of the rat ileum were increased by 18.0%, 33.3%, 15.7%, respectively, and the specific activities of sucrase and maltase in the rat ileum were also significantly increased by 789.4%, 44.9%, respectively, but the activity of lactase and alkaline phosphatase were decreased by 49.9%, 35.5%, respectively (spermine group relative to control group) and the villus width, surface area, and crypt depth of the rat ileum were increased by 15.1%, 33.3%, 26.3%, respectively [duration extension of spermine (7 days) relative to 3 days] (P < 0.05). Spermine also increased ileum choline, amino acids, inosine, lactate, myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, and trimethylamine-N-oxide levels and decreased the level of lysine (P < 0.05). The ileum levels of a-glucose, aspartate, creatine, D-galactose, formate, glutathione, glycerolphosphocholine, lipid, and tyrosine were also significantly affected by spermine supplementation (P < 0.05). Collectively, spermine ingestion induces the morphological and common systemic metabolic modifications characterizing the ileum postnatal maturation suggesting the important role of spermine. The metabolic variations could be attributed to functional variations in lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, gut microbial activity, osmoregulation, and oxidative protection.

Type III interferon (IFN-lambda) was a newly identified member of IFN family, which plays IFN-like antiviral activity. Towards a better understanding of the type III interferon system in birds, type III interferon lambda receptor (IFNLR1) was first identified in the Chinese goose. In this paper, we had cloned 1952 bp for goose IFNLR1 (goIFNLR1), including an ORF of 1539 bp, encoding a 512-amino acid protein with a 20 aa predict signal peptide at its N terminal and a 23 aa transmembrane region. The predicted amino acid sequence of goIFNLR1 has 90%, 73%, and 34% identity with duck IFNLR1 (predicted sequence), chicken IFNLR1, and human IFNLR1, respectively. And the age-related tissue distribution of goIFNLR1 was identified by Real Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we found that the goIFNLR1 has a mainly expression in epithelium-rich tissues similar to other species', such as small intestinal, lung, liver, and stomach. Moreover, a relatively high expression of goIFNLR1 was also observed in the secondary immune tissues (harderian gland and cecal tonsil). The identification and tissue distribution of goIFNLR1 will facilitate further study of the role of IFN-lambda in goose antiviral defense.

Association of a synonymous mutation of the PGAM2 gene and growth traits in rabbits	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						SNPs; body weight; average daily weight gain; association analysis; candidate gene	PORCINE SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MEAT QUALITY TRAITS; CANDIDATE GENES; PHOSPHATASE; PIGS; LINKAGE; PROTEIN; CATTLE; BREEDS; QTL	Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM2) catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate into 2-phosphoglycerate and releases energy during glycolysis in muscle tissues. PGAM2 has been considered as a candidate gene to influence growth, development, and carcass traits in livestock. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between polymorphisms of PGAM2 and growth traits in rabbits. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by direct sequencing in 20 random individuals from three breeds, including c.-10C> T, c. 195C> T, and c. 414+ 17C> T. The c. 195C> T was genotyped by PCR-RFLP in a total of 222 rabbits of three breeds (Tianfu black, 53 animals; Ira, 91 animals; Champagne, 78 animals). The average allele frequency among the breeds was 0.52 for allele T and 0.48 for C. The heterozygosity and effective number of alleles were 0.4992 and 1.996, respectively. The association results revealed the CT genotype of c. 195C> T was associated significantly (P < 0.05) with greater body weight at 84 days of age (BW84) and with average daily weight gain (ADG). However, association of the genotypes with other production traits was not observed. The results of this study suggested PGAM2 is one of the candidate genes affecting BW84 and ADG in the rabbit.

Uneven evolutionary rate of the melatonin-related receptor gene (GPR50) in primates	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						GPR50 gene; Melatonin-related receptor; Primate; Molecular evolution; Sichuan snub-nosed monkey; Tibetan macaque	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; AMINO-ACID SITES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; FOSSIL EVIDENCE; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; CLONING; CLOCK; MOUSE; MT1	The melatonin-related receptor GPR50 plays an important role in mammalian adaptive thermogenesis in response to calorie intake. The evolutionary history of the GPR50 gene is poorly understood in primates; however, it has been reported that GPR50 is the mammalian ortholog of Mel1c, which has been well characterized. In this study, the complete coding sequences of the GPR50 gene in the Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) and Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) were sequenced, and the orthologous nucleotide acid sequences of the GPR50 gene in 11 other primate species were downloaded from GenBank. Thirteen species representing 6 major primate lineages (human, great ape, lesser ape, Old World monkey, New World monkey, and prosimian monkey) were subjected to statistical analyses. A selective test showed that the entire GPR50 gene sequence is under strong purifying selection in these primates but has a significantly different evolutionary rate among the 6 major primate lineages. Notably, both the Homo and Pan branches exhibited an. ratio >1, indicating accelerated evolution of the two lineages. Further analysis of different domains revealed that the acceleration trend was more significant in the C-terminal domain (CTD). Interestingly, in the alignment of 13 primate GPR50 nucleotide acid sequences, numerous insertions or deletions were only found in the CTD region, implying that this region may play a key role in the process of primate GPR50 evolution. The results provide deeper insight into the functional evolution of GPR50 in mammals at the molecular level.	[Zhang, Y.; Yao, Y. F.; Liu, W.; Ni, Q. Y.; Zhang, M. W.; Xu, H.

The objective of the current experiment was to evaluate the effects of different raising systems on fat-related traits and mRNA levels of liver lipogenesis genes in Erlang Mountainous chicken. Each of 10 birds (91 day old) from caged, indoor-floor housed, and free-range housing systems was slaughtered, and fat-related traits, live body weight (BW), subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), abdominal fat weight (AFW), abdominal fat percentage (AFP), and intramuscular fat content were determined. The mRNA levels of liver X receptor a, carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1), and fatty acid synthase were detected. The caged chicken exhibited significantly higher BW, SFT, and AFW than those of free-ranged chicken (P < 0.05). All the 4 genes had a similar expression pattern, and they showed the highest level in caged chicken, while the lowest level was found in free-ranged chicken. Association analysis indicated that there were significant (P < 0.05) or highly significant (P < 0.01) positive correlations between the mRNA levels of ChREBP, SREBP1, and fat traits of SFT, AFW, and AFP. Thus, we deduced that increased fat deposition in caged chicken was probably induced by increased gene expression of ChREBP and SREBP1 in the liver.	[Li, Q.; Zhao, X. L.; Liu, Y.

Parental exclusion relying on polymorphic microsatellites has been used worldwide in parentage determination, while the low mutation rate and genotyping error rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) make them another important marker for pedigree tracing. Here, we compared the effectiveness of microsatellites and SNP markers in European pigs. We also measured and presented the minimum and optimal criteria for SNP markers to be used in paternity and identity analysis. Our findings may contribute to the development of techniques for future molecular evolution and conservation studies, as well as breeding programs.	[Yu, G. C.; Tang, Q. Z.; Long, K. R.; Che, T.

Results indicated that the biochar yields were relatively high throughout this temperature range, but it decreased from 78.1% to 70.6% as the pyrolysis temperature increased to 700 degrees C. The mineral nutrients and heavy metals in the biochars were also condensed as the pyrolysis temperature increased. Additionally, the pyrolysis temperature also positively affected the formation of total basic functional groups (TBFGs) and pore development. The biochars generated from vermicompost were characterized by alkalinity, high stability, high buffering ability and high apparent density. When the biochars were employed as an adsorbent for removing heavy metal ions, dyes and organic contaminants, the biochars generated at higher temperatures possessed better adsorption abilities of these contaminants, and the maximum adsorption capacity of the biochar at 700 degrees C was 36.4 mg g(-1), 29.5 mg g(-1), 12.4 mg g(-1), 12.3 mg g(-1), 17.8 mg g(-1), and 8.2 mg g(-1) for Cu2+, Cd2+, methyl orange, rhodamine B, naphthalene, and nitrobenzene, respectively.

In this study, we aim to initiate and study gene flow between maize and Z. perennis via a special aneuploid plant (MDT) derived from an interspecific hybrid of the two species. The chromosome constitution and morphological characters of MDT as well as certain backcross progenies were examined. Results from genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) indicate that aneuploid MDT consisted of nine maize chromosomes and 30 Zea perennis chromosomes. The backcross progenies of MDTxmaize displayed significant diversity of vegetative and ear morphology; several unusual plants with specific chromosome constitution were founded in its progenies. Some special perennial progeny with several maize chromosomes were obtained by backcrossing MDT with Zea perennis, and the first whole chromosome introgression from maize to Zea perennis was detected in this study. With this novel material and method, a number of maize-tetraploid teosinte addition or substitution lines can be generated for further study, which has great significance to maize and Zea perennis genetic research, especially for promoting introgression and transferring desirable traits.

Results showed that sheep fescue and perennial ryegrass had better SO2 tolerance than rough bluegrass and colonial bentgrass. Chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents were significantly higher in the SO2-tolerant turfgrass species (sheep fescue and perennial ryegrass) than in the SO2-sensitive turfgrass species (rough bluegrass and colonial bentgrass). Relatively lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde, and electrolyte leakage (EL) were observed in SO2-tolerant turfgrass species. Gradually increased antioxidant enzyme activities and proline content in SO2-tolerant turfgrass species could counteract such damages and harmful effects caused by ROS and EL, respectively. Sulfite reductase played an important role in sulfur metabolism and subsequently reduced oxidative pressure on SO2-tolerant turfgrass species.

The V-O-N-TiO2 (A/R) nanofilm showed a three-dimensional pine branched-like structure and a disordered lattice structure, which consisted of V-O, N-doping and an anatase/rutile phase, was built in the V-O-N-TiO2 (A/R) nanofilm. The experimental results show that the band gap of the V-O-N-TiO2 (A/R) nanofilm can be narrowed to 0.72 eV and 2.4 eV and that it exhibited excellent optical absorption capacity in the 200-2500 nm region. Using the V-O-N-TiO2 (A/R) nanofilm to degrade methyl orange, the removal efficiency could reach 96% within 150 min under sunlight, which shows its high photoelectrocatalytic activity and stability.

The morphology, crystal structure, chemical state, and optical properties of the TiO2 film were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The results showed that the film had a unique lower layer DWNT/upper layer coral structure with a mixed phase of anatase and rutile. The XPS results proved that the interstitial nitrogen atoms doped in the TiO2 crystal lattice as a Ti-O-N bond. The coral/DWNT TiO2 film exhibited evident absorption in the range of 400 nm to 800 nm and significant photo-electrocatalytic activity under sunlight.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the evolutionary impacts on diversity functions of PPAR members and the regulatory differences on gene expression patterns. 63 homology sequences of PPAR genes from 31 species were collected and analyzed. The results showed that three isolated types of PPAR gene family may emerge from twice times of gene duplication events. The conserved domains of HOLI (ligand binding domain of hormone receptors) domain and ZnF_C4 (C4 zinc finger in nuclear in hormone receptors) are essential for keeping basic roles of PPAR gene family, and the variant domains of LCRs may be responsible for their divergence in functions. The positive selection sites in HOLI domain are benefit for PPARs to evolve towards diversity functions. The evolutionary variants in the promoter regions and 3' UTR regions of PPARs result into differential transcription factors and miRNAs involved in regulating PPAR members, which may eventually affect their expressions and tissues distributions. These results indicate that gene duplication event, selection pressure on HOLI domain, and the variants on promoter and 3' UTR are essential for PPARs evolution and diversity functions acquired.

Herein, we propose for the first time that non-noble Ni-Al2O3 catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like compounds can efficiently and selectively convert HMF into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) and 2,5-dihydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF). Homogeneous elemental distributions of the hydrotalcite-like precursor facilitate good dispersion of Ni and Al2O3 species and strong interaction between them over the resulting catalysts. The catalysts therefore exhibited superior reactivity. Through fine modulation of surface metal-acid bifunctional sites and control of reaction conditions, high yields of DMF (91.5%), DMTHF (97.4%) and DHMTHF (96.2%) can be diversely achieved. The results demonstrate the feasibility of Ni catalysts for selective hydrogenation of C=O, C=C and C-O bonds, which have great potential for biomass utilization.

Our data demonstrated that sRCPS significantly promoted the rHBsAg-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers, the activities of natural killer cells (NK) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), T cells proliferation, and phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, sRCPS increased the levels of IL-4, IL-2, and IFN-gamma in CD4(+)T cells and the level of IFN-gamma in CD8(+)T cells. In addition, sRCPS enhanced the expression of CD40(+), CD80(+), CD86(+), MHC I and MHC II in dendritic cells (DCs) and upregulated the mRNA levels of MHC I, MHC II. sRCPS downregulated the frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells. sRCPS increased both cellular and humoral immune responses by upregulating DC maturation, and suppressing the frequency of Treg cells.

No. GP-971, PI 672537), L693 (Reg. No. GP-972, PI 672538), L696 (Reg. No. GP-973, PI 672539), and L699 (Reg. No. GP-974, PI 672540), were developed at the Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Sichuan Agricultural University of China from the cross 'MY11'/YU25, the latter of which was derived from a cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) and Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey (2n = 6x = 42; JJJ(s)J(s)SS). The four wheat lines have high levels of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) (mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) similar to those of the FHB-resistant genotypes 'Sumai 3' and 'Wangshuibai' based on results of experiments conducted in three different years in three different areas. In addition to FHB resistance, these lines also have strong resistance to both stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici), with infection type (IT) = 0 or 0;, and powdery mildew (caused by Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici), with IT = 0. The results obtained in the Henan Province of China also show that these lines have suitable agronomic and morphological traits. These results indicate that the novel resistant wheat lines L658, L693, L696, and L699 could play an important role in wheat genetic improvement, especially for FHB, stripe rust, and powdery mildew resistance.

This paper presents a novel head pose estimation method which utilizes the shape model of the Basel face model and five fiducial points in faces. It adjusts shape deformation according to Laplace distribution to afford the shape variation across different persons. A new matching method based on PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm is applied both to reduce the time cost of shape reconstruction and to achieve higher accuracy than traditional optimization methods. In order to objectively evaluate accuracy, we proposed a new way to compute the pose estimation errors. Experiments on the BFM-synthetic database, the BU-3DFE database, the CUbiC FacePix database, the CMU PIE face database, and the CAS-PEAL-R1 database show that the proposed method is robust, accurate, and computationally efficient.

In this study, a putative WOX2 homolog was isolated and characterized from Aegilops tauschii, the donor of D genome of Triticum aestivum. The sequence consisted of 2045 bp, and contained an open reading frame (ORF), encoded 322 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence contained a highly conserved homeodomain and the WUS-box domain, which is present in some members of the WOX protein family. The full-length ORF was subcloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a, and an approximately 34-kDa protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells with IPTG induction. The molecular mass of the expressed protein was identical to that predicted by the cDNA sequence. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ae. tauschii WOX2 is closely related to the rice and maize orthologs. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that WOX2 from Ae. tauschii was primarily expressed in the seeds; transcription increased during seed development and declined after the embryos matured, suggesting that WOX2 is associated with embryo development in Ae. tauschii.

Comparison of jejunal digestive enzyme activities, expression of nutrient transporter genes, and apparent fecal digestibility in weaned piglets fed diets with varied sources of fiber	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						dietary fiber; piglet; digestive enzymes; nutrient transporters; digestibility	GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; GROWING-PIGS; AMINO-ACIDS; NUTRITION; ENERGY; ILEAL; OLD	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different fiber sources on jejunal digestive and absorptive physiology in weaned piglets. One hundred weaned piglets were allotted according to body weight, gender and litter to four dietary treatments. Each treatment was replicated in 5 pens of 5 pigs each. The experimental diets contained 10% of a fiber source: wheat bran (WB), maize fiber (MF), soyabean fiber (SF), or pea fiber (PF). Piglets were fed ad libitum for 30 d. Reduced villus height and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) were observed in pigs fed diet MF compared with pigs fed diet WB. In the mid-jejunal mucosa, lower activities of sucrase (P < 0.05) were found in pigs fed diets MF and SF compared with WB. In mid-jejunal digesta, inclusion of SF and PF decreased the activities of trypsin and lipase (P< 0.05) compared with inclusion of WB. Supplementation with PF resulted in higher facilitated glucose transporter 2 (P< 0.05) and lower excitatory amino acid carrier 1 mRNA levels compared with supplementing WB. The apparent faecal digestibility of gross energy, dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber declined in the following order: diet SF > PF > MF > WB. Our study indicates that SF and PF could promote apparent faecal digestibility in piglets, but this is not accompanied by better jejunal morphology or digestive enzyme activities as compared with WB.

The effects of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentration and induction time on the expression of recombinant pFTO were assessed. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the molecular mass of the recombinant pFTO protein was about 56 kDa, and the recombinant protein could be induced efficiently in E. coli BL21 by the addition of 0.75 mM IPTG for 4 h at 30 degrees C. The recombinant pFTO fusion protein was purified using Ni-IDA affinity chromatography with a yield of about 1.8 mu g/mL protein. The protein was further confirmed by western blot analysis. An in vitro biological activity assay demonstrated that the refolded purified 2 mu g/mL recombinant pFTO protein increased 3T3-L1 preadipocyte proliferation. The present work should be useful for the production of sufficiently large amounts of recombinant pFTO protein for further functional analysis.

The resulting recombinant plasmid, pPIC9K-MAN, was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115. One strain (GSKM-1) having the highest beta-mannanase activity of 26.6 U/mL was obtained. In order to increase the secretion of beta-mannanase in P. pastoris, we constructed a double recombinant yeast and made it coexpress protein disulfide isomerase. One strain (GSKZ alpha M2) with the highest beta-mannanase activity of 40 U/mL was then obtained and used to optimize expression conditions. When the GSKZ alpha M2 strain was induced under the optimized conditions (methanol concentration 1.5%, induction time 7 days), beta-mannanase activity reached 222.8 U/mL. SDS-PAGE and deglycosylation assays demonstrated that the recombinant A. niger beta-mannanase, a glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa, was secreted into the culture medium. It displayed maximum activity at pH 4.4 and 60 degrees C, and it was stable in a pH range of 2.4-8.0 and at a temperature of 60 degrees C or below. Our results suggested that coexpression chaperones could improve the yield of beta-mannanase.

This study carried out preliminary and further Cd concentration gradient experiments and field experiment using Y. erythrocarpa to confirm this fact. The results showed that the biomass and resistance coefficient of Y. erythrocarpa decreased, but the root/shoot ratio and the Cd content in roots and shoots increased with the increase in soil Cd concentration. The Cd content in shoots of Y. erythrocarpa exceeded 100 mg/kg when the soil Cd concentration was 25 mg/kg in the two concentration gradient experiments, up to the maxima of 293.25 and 317.87 mg/kg at 100 mg/kg soil Cd. Both the bioconcentration factor of the shoots and the translocation factor exceeded 1 in all Cd treatments. In the field experiment, the total Cd extraction by shoots was 0.934-0.996 mg/m(2) at soil Cd levels of 2.04-2.89 mg/kg. Therefore, Y. erythrocarpa is a Cd hyperaccumulator that could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil efficiently.

Therefore, the heavy metal output, and the concentrations and contents of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) from stream head to end were investigated in twelve headwater streams of a typical alpine forest in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The output rates of per square meter from streams and watersheds were 0.5191 mg/d m(2) and 0.065 mg/d m(2) for Zn, 0.1640 mg/d m(2) and 0.0025 mg/d m(2) for Cu, 0.0944 mg/d m(2) and 0.0118 mg/d m(2) for Pb, and 0.0201 mg/d m(2) and 0.0205 mg/d m(2) for Cd, respectively. Although the output rates of these four heavy metals displayed increase tendencies with the increase of stream length, but the output rates of Cd, Pb and Cu were statistically related to stream flow velocity. Both the concentrations and contents of Zn and Pb generally decreased from stream head to end, but those of Cu and Cd showed relative steady trends in all streams. This indicated an obvious self-purification capacity for Zn and Pb in these head water streams, showing that the shorter streams have the higher self-purification capacity. The results provided efficient data and new idea in controlling river heavy metal contamination.

Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit 1-D chain structures and the structures are further connected by hydrogen bonding interactions to form the 3-D packing structures, while compound 3 shows a discrete Cd-4 structure, which is expanded to a 3-D framework through hydrogen bonds with the CsCl-like eight-connected topology. Fluorescence properties indicate that 1 and 2 yield good luminescence and have potential applications in optical materials. Three Cd(II) coordination complexes based on two different pyridine dicarboxylic acids (pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H(2)PDA) and its derivative 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (chelidamic acid, H(3)CAM)), [Cd-2(PDA)(2)(H2O)(3)](n) (1), {[Cd-2(HCAM)(2)(H2O)(4)]3H(2)O}(n) (2), and [Cd-4(HCAM)(4)(H2O)(8)] (3) have been isolated under hydrothermal conditions. Compound 1, with H(2)PDA and Cd(NO3)(2)4H(2)O, exhibits a 1-D chain structure. Compound 2, obtained by using H(3)CAM instead of H(2)PDA, contains a different 1-D chain from that of 1. When using CdCl(2)2.5H(2)O and H(3)CAM, a discrete tetranuclear Cd-4 compound (3) was obtained, and the isolated molecules are expanded to a eight-connected CsCl-like topology with point symbol (4(24)6(4)) through hydrogen bonding interactions. Furthermore, the photoluminescent properties of 1-3 were investigated.

The electrocatalytic activity of BP-NF is higher than that of single nitrogen or fluorine doped carbon materials (BP-N, BP-F), with an onset potential of E = 0.2 V (BP-NF), E = 0.1 V (BP-N), and a limiting current density of I = 4.5 mA cm(-2) (BP-NF), I = 0.31 mA cm(-2) (BP-F), respectively. The results demonstrated a synergistic ORR catalytic effect in N and F co-doping carbon material.

Comparison of the meat quality, post-mortem muscle energy metabolism, and the expression of glycogen synthesis-related genes in three pig crossbreeds	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						gene expression; energy metabolism; energy status; meat quality; pig	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; PORK QUALITY; RN GENOTYPES; CARCASS; TRAITS; AMP; PH; STIMULATION	Post-mortem muscle energy metabolism plays an important role in pork quality. To analyse the differences of meat quality and energy metabolism, three commercial pig crossbreeds frequently used in China were studied, they were DT (Duroc x Taihu; n = 16), PIC (five-way crossbreed from Pig Improvement Co., UK; n = 29) and DLY (Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire); n = 19) pigs. The results showed that DT pigs had a higher post-mortem pH(45min) and pH(24 h), lower shear force and drip loss, higher muscle free-glucose and glycogen contents, and lower lactic acid content than did PIC and DLY pigs. Post-mortem muscle free-glucose content of these three pig crossbreeds changed little, from 45 min to 96 h post-mortem. The expression levels of PRKAG3 (encoding a regulatory subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase) and GYS1 (encoding muscle glycogen synthase) genes of DT pigs were significantly lower than those of PIC and DLY pigs. DT pigs had a higher expression level of glycogenin-1-like (encoding glycogenin) gene than did PIC and DLY pigs. In conclusion, DT pigs had better meat quality than did the other two pig crossbreeds. We deduced that the post-mortem muscle energy status and metabolism of DT pigs might be an important reason for their good meat quality, and future research should focus on the molecular and physiological mechanism of post-mortem muscle energy metabolism to find ways to improve meat quality.

Chicken splenic lymphocytes treated with 0-50 mu g/mL DON for 48 h inhibited growth of splenic lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) bioassay. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining indicated that the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells were significantly higher compared with the control (P < 0.01). DON treatment induced ROS accumulation, resulting in reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as detected by flow cytometry and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein acetate and rhodamine 123 labeling, respectively. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the concentrations of p53, Bax, Bak-1, and Caspase-3 increased with increasing DON concentration (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), whereas the concentrations of Bcl-2 decreased (P < 0.01) compared with the control. These data suggest that DON induces apoptosis in splenic lymphocytes via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Somitogenesis is controlled by the "segmentation clock", which contains multiple oscillator genes that must be tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels for proper clock function. However, how the segmentation clock governs the formation of the somites at post-transcriptional level, remains unclear. In this work, we develop an integrated model with three modules for the segmentation clock and explore the mechanism for somite segmentation based on the dynamics of the network. By numerical simulations, we find that the amplitude and period of the somite segmentation clock are sensitive to Notch activity, which is fine-tuned by Lunatic fringe (Lfng) and microRNA (miRNA), and Lfng and miRNA are essential for forming the proper segmentation during somitogenesis. Moreover, miRNA is found to have a crucial role in minimizing the fluctuation period and amplitude to maintain coherent oscillation. Introduction of stochasticity in the model enables us to explain the available experimental data with dampening of oscillations. These findings uncover a fresh mechanism for regulation of the segmentation clock at a post-transcriptional level and provide important insights into how the relatively subtle effects of miRNAs on target genes can have broad effects in developmental situations that have critical requirements for tight posttranscriptional regulation.

Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat. Chinese wheat cultivar Mianmai 41 showed high resistance against most of the prevailing Pst races in China. Genetic analysis of the F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations from a cross between Mianmai 41 and a susceptible line Mingxian 169 indicated that resistance to Pst race CYR32 was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrMY41. Molecular marker analysis placed the gene on chromosome 1B near the centromere. Six co-dominant genomic SSR markers Xwmc329, Xwmc406, Xgwm18, Xgwm131, Xgwm413, and Xbarc312, and one STS marker Xwe173 linked with the resistance gene. The two closest flanking SSR markers were Xgwm18 and Xwmc406, with genetic distances of 2.0 and 4.9 cM, respectively. A seedling test with 29 Pst isolates indicated the reaction patterns of Mianmai 41 were different from those of lines carrying Yr3, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr26, and YrCH42 on chromosome 1B. Allelic tests indicated that YrMY41 is likely a new allele at Yr26 locus.

In order to optimize the network coverage, different coverage formulations have been proposed. Recently, a newly emerging coverage scheme in wireless sensor networks, sweep coverage, which uses mobile sensors to monitor certain points of interest (POIs), is proposed. However, the data delivery to sink, an important problem in WSN, is not considered in original sweep coverage and many of the existing works did not consider it yet. In this work, a novel algorithm named ACOSC (ACO-based sweep coverage) to solve the sweep coverage problem considering periodical coverage of POIs and delivery of data simultaneously is proposed. The evaluation results show that our algorithm has better performance than existing schemes.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of postnatal nutrition restriction on the oxidative status of IUGR neonates. Methods: A total of twelve pairs of piglets, of normal birth-weight (NBW) and with IUGR (7 days old), respectively, were randomly allocated to have adequate nutritional intake (ANI) and restricted nutritional intake (RNI) for a period of 21 days, respectively. This design produced 4 experimental groups: NBW-ANI, IUGR-ANI, NBW-RNI and IUGR-RNI (n = 6 per group). Serum, ileum and liver samples were analyzed for antioxidant parameters and the mRNA expression of genes with regard to oxidative status. The data were subjected to general linear model analysis and Duncan's test with a 5% significance level. Results: Irrespective of nutritional intake, the IUGR pigs had markedly lower activity of glutathione peroxidase (GP(x)), gene expressions of liver mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and ileum cytoplasmic copper/zinc (CuZn)-SOD and, accordingly, there was a markedly higher malondialdehyde concentration in the liver of these pigs compared to in the NBW pigs. Irrespective of body weight, pigs receiving ANI treatment had significantly lower activities of antioxidant enzymes in the serum (total antioxidative capability, CuZn-SOD and GP(x)) and liver (total SOD and glutathione reductase) and decreased gene expression of liver CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD compared to the pig's receiving RNI. In addition, the IUGR pigs had a markedly lower concentration of liver reduced glutathione (GSH), ratio of GSH to oxidized glutathione, gene expression of ileum CuZn-SOD and extracellular SOD than the NBW pigs when receiving ANI, but not all of these differences were observed in those receiving RNI. Conclusion: IUGR neonates may have poor antioxidant defense systems, and postnatal nutrition restriction has the potential to prevent oxidative stress. (C) 2014 S.

Meanwhile, the releases of readily soluble NH4+ NO3- and PO43- from biochars and the adsorption of NH4+, NO3- and PO43- by biochars were investigated. Results indicated that the involvement of LaCl3 in pyrolysis could advance the temperature of maximum mass loss by 10 degrees C compared with oak sawdust (CK), and potentially promoted biochar yield. Overall, the releases of readily soluble NH4+, NO3- and PO43- from biochars were negatively related to pyrolysis temperature, and the releases were greatly weakened by La-biochars. Additionally, the adsorption to NH4+ can be promoted by the biochars produced at low temperature. On the contrary, the NO3- adsorption can be improved by increasing pyrolysis temperature. The highest PO43- adsorption was achieved by the biochars produced at 500 degrees C. According to the results of adsorption isotherms, the maximum adsorption capacity of NH4+, NO3- and PO43-, can be significantly promoted by 1.9, 11.2, and 4.5 folds using La-biochars. Based on the observations of FT-IR, SEM-EDS, and surface functional groups, the improvement of NH4+ adsorption was potentially associated with the existing acidic function groups (phenolic-OH and carboxyl C=O). The increased basic functional groups on La-biochars were beneficial to improve NO3- and PO43- adsorption. Besides, PO43- adsorption was also potentially related to the formed La2O3.

The mice in one group were injected with physiological saline as the normal control group. The mice in the other four groups were injected with physiological saline, sulfated Chuanminshen violaceum polysaccharides (SCVP), Chuanminshen violaceum polysaccharide (CVP) and astragalus polysaccharide (AP) once daily for 7 d and then with cyclophosphamide (CY) in the last 3 d. The serum cytokine level, apoptosis protein expressions, spleen lymphocyte proliferation, changes in peripheral blood T-cell subsets, and immune organ index were then measured. Results showed that SCVP and CVP can overcome CY-induced immunosuppression by promoting spleen lymphocyte proliferation, raising serum IFN-gamma and IL-2 levels, enlarging immune organ indexes, and decreasing excessive apoptosis. Moreover, SCVP and CVP showed the potential to treat autoimmune diseases based on CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios. Results suggested that SCVP and CVP exhibited the potential to treat autoimmune and immunosuppression diseases.

The dietary treatments were: a control diet; control diet + 3 g/kg TMFP; control diet + 0.3 g/kg colistin sulfate (ANT). The results showed that supplementation with TMFP increased (P < 0.05) villus height at duodenum, jejunum at 3 time points, increased (P < 0.05) crypt depth at duodenum, jejunum at day 14, improved villus height: crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) in jejunum at day 21 as compared with ANT. Supplementation of TMFP and ANT had lower (P < 0.05) E. coli counts in the ileum, cecum and colon at day 7 as compared with control. Supplementation of TMFP had higher (P < 0.05) bifidobacteria counts in the ileum, cecum and colon compared with ANT, except for colon at day 21. No effect (P > 0.05) on lactobacilli in colon has been seen with supplementation of TMFP and ANT at 3 time points, while both of supplementations showed increased the number of lactobacilli in cecum at day 14 and day 21. Analysis of DGGE fingerprints indicated that a highest similarity was observed for profiles from samples taken 14 d, 21 d from TMFP. The diversity of DGGE fingerprints of TMFP was higher than those of ANT and control. The results suggest that TMFP is potential to enhancing intestinal morphology and microbiota of weaning pigs, and can be served as an effective and safe dietary additive for weaning pigs.

In this study, we cloned the cDNA sequences of goat FABP family genes and their expression patterns were detected by semi-quantitative RTPCR and quantitative real time RT-PCR. Expression analysis showed that goat FABP1 gene was predominantly expressed in liver, kidney and large intestine. While FABP4 was widely expressed in many tissues with a high expression level was observed in the fat, skeletal muscle, stomach and lung. Notably, FABP2 gene was expressed specifically in small intestine. Moreover, goat FABP3 was expressed at 60 day with the highest level, then significantly (p < 0.01) decreased at the 90 day. No significant expression differences were observed in longissimus dorsi muscles among 3 day, 30 day and 60 day. Goat FABP4 was expressed at 3 day with the lowest level, then significantly (p < 0.01) increased to a peak at the 60 day. In addition, a significant relationship between FABP3 mRNA expression levels and intramuscular fat (IMF) content was observed. These results suggest that the FABP3 and FABP4 may be important genes for meat quality and provides useful information for further studies on their roles in skeletal muscle IMF deposit.

The results indicated that exposure to 0.7 mg/L (11.01 mu mol/L) Cu for 96h induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby increasing protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in the gills of fish. However, these oxidative effects were prevented by arginine supplementation. Arginine also prevented the toxic effects of Cu on the activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and the glutathione (GSH) content (P<0.05). However, Cu induced an adaptive increase in the activity of catalase (CAT), and arginine supplementation further increased CAT activity (P<0.05). Moreover, Cu induced increases in the relative mRNA expressions of SOD1, CAT, GPx, GST, caspase-3, caspase-9, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein la (Keap1a), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-8 (IL-8), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65) in the gills of grass carp (P< 0.05). In contrast, the relative mRNA expression levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin b, claudin 3, claudin 12, target of rapamycin (TOR) and inhibitor factor kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) in the gills were decreased by Cu (P< 0.05). However, pre-treatment of fish with arginine prevented Cu-induced relative mRNA expression decrease. Interestingly, Cu exposure resulted in increases in claudin 15a mRNA expression (P< 0.05) but could not induce claudin c, caspase-8 and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA expression changes in the gill of fish (P>0.05). These results indicated that Cu exposure induced apoptosis and antioxidant system and tight junction mRNA changes in the fish gills, which could be completely blocked by dietary arginine pre-supplementation.

This enhancement is typically achieved by altering particle size and surfaces as well as charge density and ionic strength. We demonstrate a novel route for promoting DNA loading on amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ASMNPs) by prior condensation of elongated DNA to a compact globule before adsorption. The enhanced DNA-loading capacity, as demonstrated by a reduction in the number of ASMNPs needed to achieve complexation, was presumably due to the elimination of DNA wrapping around nanoparticles and substantially reduced electrostatic interactions of DNA with nanoparticles because the compacted DNA globule conformation decreases its exposed surface charge. The maximum loading capacity of ASMNPs for condensed DNA was 4.4 times greater than that for elongated coiled DNA, achieving the highest ever reported value of 385 mu g mg(-1). Practical applications for plasmid DNA isolation from cleared lysate confirmed the reliability of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that are important modulators of the intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. However, our knowledge of the changes that occur in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the level of posttranscriptional regulation, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in the infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Overall, 132 miRNAs were expressed significantly differently after challenge with JEV: 78 were upregulated and 54 downregulated. The sequencing results for selected miRNAs were confirmed with RT-qPCR. GO analysis of the host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including the metabolic pathway, inflammatory response and immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the comparative expression of miRNAs in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our findings will underpin further studies of miRNAs' roles in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for antiviral therapies against JEV.

The feasibility of enhancing FCR resistance by gene pyramiding was investigated by generating and assessing two populations segregating for three large-effect QTL located on the long arms of chromosomes 1H, 3H and 4H, respectively. Significant effects were detected for each of the three QTL in both of the populations assessed. Lines with any combination of two resistant alleles from the three QTL gave, on average, significantly better resistance than those with a single resistant allele only, and lines with resistant alleles from all three of the QTL gave the least FCR symptom. However, wide variations in FCR severity were detected for lines belonging to each of the groups with different numbers of resistant alleles. Significant effects of plant height on FCR were detected in both populations, and a significant association between heading date and FCR severity was detected in one of the two populations assessed. Results from the current study also showed that the effects of a given allele of resistance decreased with the increase in the number of resistant alleles an individual group possessed. Overall, results from this study demonstrate that gene pyramiding can be an effective approach in improving FCR resistance and those lines with resistant alleles from all of the three QTL could be valuable for breeding programs.

However, pepper molecular marker technologies are still mainly focusing on the simple sequence repeats derived from public database or genomic library. The development and application of the third generation marker system such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, structure variations as well as insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels) is still in its infancy. In the present study, we developed InDel markers for pepper genetic mapping with the convenience of two whole-genome re-sequenced inbred lines BA3 (C. annuum) and B702 (C. annuum). A total of 154,519 and 149,755 InDel (1-5 bp) sites were identified for BA3 and B702, respectively, by the alignment of resequencing reads to Zunla-1 reference genome. Then, 14,498 InDel sites (only 4 and 5 bp) that are different between BA3 and B702 were predicted. Finally, within a random set of 1,000 primer pairs, 251 InDel markers were validated and mapped onto a linkage map using F-2 population derived from the intraspecific cross BA3 x B702. The first InDel-based map, named as BB-InDel map, consisted of 12 linkage groups, covered a genetic distance of 1,178.01 cM and the average distance between bin markers was 5.01 cM.

Molecular markers have become an important genetic tool for understanding genome dynamics and facilitating molecular breeding of drought resistance. Here, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers dhnC397 and rspC1090 were identified based on the SNP A/G polymorphisms in the drought-resistance genes dhn1 and rsp41. The two alleles of both genes were easily and rapidly discriminated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as functional markers. By validation of an integrated selection criterion for drought resistance, the average SI (selection index for drought resistance) of lines with superior drought-resistance genotypes was higher than those with opposite, less drought-resistant genotypes, and the SI of heterotic group B was higher than that of heterotic group A for both genes. Integrating the results of CAPS analysis and evaluation of drought resistance indicated that the SNPs in these two genes partly participate in conferring drought resistance in these maize lines of interest. Breeders can thus use the CAPS markers identified here as functional markers for the improvement of drought resistance in these maize lines and possibly others.

In order to precisely detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for wheat growth duration and its timing components, and dissect their genetic relationship, we performed QTL mapping and conditional analysis in a recombinant inbred line population. A total of 17 conditional QTLs and 30 unconditional QTLs were identified in this study, which explained 3.3-34.7 % of the phenotypic variation. Of them, 17 explained more than 10 % of the phenotypic variation and eight were environment-independent. Eight common QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1D, 2A, 2D, 3D, 4A, 5A, 7A and 7D, and explained significant phenotypic variation for two to eight traits. Notably, the QTL on chromosome 2D (genetic region of wPt-7149-wPt-667843) explained major phenotypic variation for emergence time (ET), heading time (HT), maturity time (MT) and growth duration (GD). The QTL on chromosome 3D (wPt-741816-wPt-732611) accounted for significant phenotypic variation for ET, TT and FT. Conditional analysis and unconditional analysis suggested that utilizing the genetic region of wPt-7149-wPt-667843 on chromosome 2D can modify ET, HT, MT and GD simultaneously, whereas the genetic region of wPt-741816-wPt-732611 on chromosome 3D can modify GD components individually to avoid change to the whole GD. This QTL mapping study and genetic relationship analysis between growth duration and its component traits should be of great practical and theoretical value for wheat breeding.

The objective of the study was to determine the corresponding taxol yield. The structure of the taxol produced by the fungus was evaluated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR and C-13-NMR), and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), with standard taxol as a control. The results demonstrated that the P. hainanensis fungus produced taxol, which had the same structure as the standard taxol and yield of 1,466.87 mu g/L. This fungal taxol yield from the dermatitic giant panda was significantly greater than those of fungus from non-animal sources. The taxol-producing fungus may be a potential candidate for the production of taxol on an industrial scale.

By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, a 391 bp repetitive DNA fragment ('A336') isolated from oat chromosome 18D was predominantly localized in centromeric regions of mitotic metaphase chromosomes of oat accession 'CN64226'. Assays of simultaneous and sequential co-hybridizations with the C genome-specific repetitive DNA probe 'pAm1' isolated from tetraploid A. murphyi Ladiz. (AACC) and the application of different concentrations of the A336 probe revealed that the A336 DNA segment is more abundant in chromosomes of the A- and D-genomes than in chromosomes belonging to the C-genome.

In this study, the granule morphology, composition and physicochemical properties of oat starch, as well as the expressions of starch synthesis genes were investigated during oat endosperm development. Under the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we observed that the unique compound granules were developed in oat endosperms at 10 days post anthesis (DPA) and then fragmented into irregular or polygonal simple granules from 12 DPA until seed maturity. The amylose content, branch chain length of degree of polymerization (DP=13-24), gelatinization temperature and percentage of retrogradation were gradually increased during the endosperm development; whereas the distribution of short chains (DP=6-12) were gradually decreased. The relative expressions of 4 classes of 13 starch synthesis genes characterized in this study indicated that three expression pattern groups were significantly different among gene classes as well as among varied isoforms, in which the first group of starch synthesis genes may play a key role on the initiation of starch synthesis in oat endosperms.

Two different field experiments were conducted in 2012-2013 to analyze how different planting geometries in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay strip intercropping systems at 2:2 maize-to-soybean affect yields. Maize plants were planted in narrow-row planting patterns, whereas soybean was planted in wide rows. The effects of bandwidth, row spacing, plant spacing, and the distance between maize and soybean rows on crop yields were studied. Total intercrop yields were higher than those of sole crop maize and soybean, and the land equivalent ratios of the intercropping systems were above 1.3. The yield of the intercropped maize increased with bandwidth reduction at the same plant density, and similar results were found with increased maize narrow-row spacing at the same bandwidth. Plant spacing had a dominant function when the bandwidth of the intercropped soybean was >200 cm. By contrast, the distance between maize and soybean rows had a dominant function when bandwidth was <200 cm. The optimum bandwidth and maize narrow-row spacing in maize soybean relay intercropping systems were 200 and 40 cm, respectively. These results suggest that the appropriate reduction in the spacing of the narrow maize rows and increase in the distance between maize and soybean rows could be used to achieve high yields in maize soybean intercropping.

The average of molecular weight (M-w) of PSRC was 182 kDa. The majority of monosaccharide components of PSRC was glucose (relative mass 48.8%) with lower levels of mannose, rhamnose, galactose, fructose and arabinose (relative mass of 15.7, 14.3, 10.6, 6.1 and 4.5%, respectively). In vitro assays revealed that RSRC possessed potent scavenging activities against DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals. Oral administration of PSRC significantly enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (including total superoxide dismutase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase and catalase (CAT)) and capacities of scavenging superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, markedly lowered lipid peroxidation formation of malondialdehyde and significantly up-regulated mRNA expressions of Cu,Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT, glutathione peroxidase 1, thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin 2, in a D-galactose-induced aging mouse model. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PSRC could be used as a novel promising source of natural antioxidants and antiaging drugs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During October 2011-April 2012, the concentrations of Hg in water, suspended particulate matter, and sediment of the three experimental fish ponds located in Sha Tau Kok Organic Farm were monitored, and the results were similar to or lower than those detected in commercial fish ponds around the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region (by comparing data of previous and present studies). Health risk assessments indicated that human consumption of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), a herbivore which fed food waste feed pellets would be safer than other fish species: mud carp (Cirrhina molitorella), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), and largemouth bass (Lepomis macrochirus). Due to the lower species diversity and substantially shorter food chains of the polyculture system consisting of only three fish species, the extent of Hg biomagnification was significantly lower than other polyculture ponds around PRD. Furthermore, the use of food waste instead of fish meal (mainly consisted of contaminated trash fish) further reduced the mercury accumulation in the cultured fish.

However, the functional characterization of goose CD8 alpha is still unclear. The immunobiological characterization of goose CD8 alpha in goose spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) was examined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). It was shown that CD8 alpha mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by in vitro treatment of MNCs with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA), and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) in a dose-dependent way, but lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) did not have this same effect. Moreover, the time-course effect of CD8 alpha expression in response to mitogens (PHA, ConA, and poly I:C) was evaluated in MNCs. A significant increase in the transcriptional levels of CD8 alpha was detected in new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV)-infected goose MNCs at 48 h postinfection (PI) and in goose parvovirus (GPV)-infected MNCs at 72 h PI. Also, the number of CD8 alpha(+) cells was significantly increased during viral infection from 72 h on. The seminal changes in mRNA profiles of antiviral cytokines (IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-18) were observed and were significantly increased during late phases of NGVEV and GPV infection. Accordingly, our data not only contribute to the understanding of the immune characteristics of goose CD8 alpha, but they also provide new insight into the innate antiviral immunity of geese.

This study investigated soil bacterial and archaeal communities by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons across a permafrost thaw gradient at different depths in Alaska with thaw progression for over three decades. Over 4.6million passing 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from a total of 97 samples, corresponding to 61 known classes and 470 genera. Soil depth and the associated soil physical-chemical properties had predominant impacts on the diversity and composition of the microbial communities. Both richness and evenness of the microbial communities decreased with soil depth. Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Alpha- and Gamma-Proteobacteria dominated the microbial communities in the upper horizon, whereas abundances of Bacteroidetes, Delta-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes increased towards deeper soils. Effects of thaw progression were absent in microbial communities in the near-surface organic soil, probably due to greater temperature variation. Thaw progression decreased the abundances of the majority of the associated taxa in the lower organic soil, but increased the abundances of those in the mineral soil, including groups potentially involved in recalcitrant C degradation (Actinomycetales, Chitinophaga, etc.). The changes in microbial communities may be related to altered soil C sources by thaw progression. Collectively, this study revealed different impacts of thaw in the organic and mineral horizons and suggests the importance of studying both the upper and deeper soils while evaluating microbial responses to permafrost thaw.

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the contribution of the major fiber components to the health-promoting effects of wheat bran on intestinal mucosal barrier function and to elucidate the involvement of microbiota changes in weaned piglets. Methods: Thirty freshly weaned male piglets were assigned to 5 dietary treatment groups (n = 6) according to litter and weight. The piglets consumed synthetic diets ad libitum for 30 d, including a basal control diet (CON) without fiber components, a wheat bran diet (WB) as reference diet (10% wheat bran), and 3 other diets containing amounts of fiber components equivalent to those in the WB, i.e., an arabinoxylan diet (AX), a cellulose diet (CEL), and a combined arabinoxylan and cellulose diet (CB). Results: The groups consuming diets containing arabinoxylans (i.e., the WE, AX, and CB groups) had increased intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A concentrations, goblet cell number and cecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations, and reduced branched-chain fatty acid concentrations and pH values compared with the CON group. In the WB group, the stimulated secretion of Cl was suppressed (60.8% and 47.5% change in short-circuit current caused by theophylline and carbachol, respectively) in the distal small intestine compared with the CON group. The AX and CB groups also had increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase activities and reduced intestinal transcellular permeability (by 77.3% and 67.2%, respectively) compared with the CON group. Meanwhile, in the WB group, cecal Bacteroidetes and Enterobactenaceae populations were lower, and the growth of Lactobacillus was higher in the AX and CB groups than in the CON group, whereas no positive effect on intestinal barrier function was observed in the CEL group. Conclusion: Arabinoxylan in wheat bran, and not cellulose, is mainly responsible for improving various functional components of the intestinal barrier function and the involvement of microbiota changes.

Furthermore, intramuscular fat content is an important trait of meat intended for consumption. Here, we examined differences in the expression of factors related to myogenesis, adipogenesis and skeletal muscle growth during fetal muscle development of lean (Yorkshire) and obese (Chenghua) pig breeds. At prenatal days 50 (d50) and 90 (d90), muscles and sera were collected from pig fetuses. Histology revealed larger diameters and numbers of myofibers in Chenghua pig fetuses than those in Yorkshire pig fetuses at d50 and d90. Yorkshire fetuses had higher serum concentrations of myostatin (d90), a negative regulator for muscle development, and higher mRNA expression of the growth hormone receptor Ghr (d90), myogenic MyoG (d90) and adipogenic LPL (d50). By contrast, Chenghua fetuses exhibited higher serum concentration of growth hormone (d90), and higher mRNA expression of myogenic MyoD (d90) as well as adipogenic PPARG and FABP4 (d50). Our results revealed distinct expression patterns in the two pig breeds at each developmental stage before birth. Compared with Chenghua pigs, development and maturation of fetal skeletal muscles may occur earlier in Yorkshire pigs, but the negative regulatory effects of myostatin may suppress muscle development at the later stage.

Relationship between kernel drydown rate and resistance to gibberella ear rot in maize	EUPHYTICA			English	Article						Maize; Gibberella ear rot; Fusarium graminearum; Kernel drydown rate; Indirect selection efficiency; Genotypic correlation	FUSARIUM-GRAMINEARUM INFECTION; EARLY EUROPEAN MAIZE; INBRED LINES; GRAIN-YIELD; SILK; INOCULATION; DEOXYNIVALENOL; VERTICILLIOIDES; CONTAMINATION; SELECTION	Development of gibberella ear rot (GER) resistant genotypes in maize is important to reduce yield loss and most importantly to avoid mycotoxin contamination of food and feed. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of kernel drydown rate (KDD) on GER disease development and to test whether using KDD as an indirect selection trait could warrant selection gains for GER resistance. Six inbred lines with various levels of disease resistance were evaluated for GER silk and kernel resistance and KDD as line per se and testcrosses in one location over three consecutive years. From our results, the genotypes showed significant differences (P < 0.05) to GER and KDD. Heritability estimates were high for GER and were consistently higher than estimates for KDD. Genotypic correlation estimates between GER and KDD, which were averaged over the 3 years were significant (P < 0.01, 0.05) only for kernel inoculated plots and the strength of correlations increased when kernels progress towards maturity. The indirect selection efficiency of KDD as compared to direct selection for GER was less than one but was substantially higher for kernel inoculated plots. Our overall result demonstrated that fast KDD was among the factors that contribute to kernel resistance to GER however its use as an indirect selection trait was less promising. Thus, screening for GER resistance using disease inoculated nurseries still remain to be the most effective method for GER breeding.	[Kebebe, A. Z.; Reid, L.

Cd accumulated to a greater degree in roots than in shoots and resulted in oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde. In addition, Cd exposure markedly hindered root and shoot elongation and biomass production, reduced the activities of H+-ATPase in the plasma membranes (PMs) and tonoplasts (V), and inhibited the absorption of mineral nutrition. However, the addition of various SNP doses alleviated the inhibitory effects on plant growth caused by Cd, elevated the activity of the PM H+-ATPase in both shoots and roots, enhanced the activity of V-H+-ATPase in roots, and partially enhanced the uptake of minerals (shoots: Mg and Cu; roots: Ca, Mg, and Fe) in Cd-treated plants. Shoot and root Cd accumulation significantly diminished when plants were subjected to Cd plus SNP treatments, though the level of root Cd accumulation was not dependent on the SNP dosage level. Moreover, the addition of SNP considerably upregulated ascorbate peroxidases (APX), catalases and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in shoots under Cd stress, but downregulated APX and SOD activity in roots. The addition of SNP did not influence glutathione reductase (GR) activity in roots, but markedly increased its activity in shoots. Similar to root GR levels, shoot ascorbate content experienced no significant change between Cd plus SNP treatment and Cd treatment alone; however, root ascorbate and glutathione levels decreased in plant tissues in the treatments with Cd and SNP. The results obtained in this work indicate that SNP applied exogenously, particularly at lower doses, can effectively deplete the detrimental effects on white clover growth, likely by reducing oxidative damage, modulating mineral absorption, and re-establishing the levels of ATPases.

To better understand the structures and functions of Akirin2 gene, the cDNA of the Tianfu goat Akirin2 gene was cloned. Sequence analysis showed that the Tianfu goat Akirin2 cDNA full coding sequence (CDS) contains 579 bp nucleotides that encode 192 amino acids. A phylogenic tree of the Akirin2 protein sequence from the Tianfu goat and other species revealed that the Tianfu goat Akirin2 was closely related with cattle and sheep Akirin2. RT-qPCR analysis showed that Akirin2 was expressed in the myocardium, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, leg muscle, abdominal muscle and the longissimus dorsi muscle. Especially, high expression levels of Akirin2 were detected in the spleen, lung, and kidney whereas lower expression levels were seen in the liver, myocardium, leg muscle, abdominal muscle and longissimus dorsi muscle. Temporal mRNA expression showed that Akirin2 expression levels in the longissimus dorsi muscle, first increased then decreased from day 1 to month 12. Western blotting results showed that the Akirin2 protein was only detected in the lung and three skeletal muscle tissues. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The effects of optimized nitrogen management (ONM) and polyaspartic acid urea treatment (PAU) on rice dry matter production and grain yield under different soil conditions in Sichuan, China, were studied in 2013. When the different N management regimes were applied there were differences in the rice tiller number, dry matter production, and yield observed. At Shehong, ONM3 (a 15% increase in the N rate over the farmer's fertilizer practice) had the highest grain yield, and significantly (P < 0.05) increased the percentage of effective tillers, biomass yield, the ratio of leaf lamina at anthesis and maturity stages, amount of post-anthesis transfer of accumulated dry matter into the grain (APA), and panicles per meter square. ONM2 (a 15% reduction in the N rate over the farmer's fertilizer practice) significantly (P < 0.05) increased the percentage of effective tillers, panicles per meter square, and grain yield at Wenjiang, as the rice plants had a reasonable amount of pre-anthesis stored dry matter from the vegetative organs to redistribute to the grain and APA. At both sites, PAU3 (polyaspartic acid urea (PASP-urea) spilt-applied in four stages) improved the grain yield due to an increase in APA, panicles per meter square, and spikelets per panicle. It was shown through correlation analysis that at both sites the grain yield was correlated positively with the panicles per meter square and APA (P < 0.01). Therefore, it can be concluded that the increase in panicles per meter square and APA were the causes of the improved grain yields. PASP-urea promoted rice production, and PAU3 was suitable for use with different soils. Based on these results, the effect of spilt-applied N during the middle and later stages largely depended on the soil fertility, and the spilt-applied N being used at a suitable rate that was beneficial for improving the rice yield.

The obtained yeast-MnO2 composites were utilized as adsorbents to adsorb Cd2+ in aqueous solution. Various influencing parameters on Cd2+ adsorption by yeast-MnO2 composites, such as initial pH, contact time and initial Cd2+ concentration, were studied. The mechanism of Cd2+ binding by yeast-MnO2 composites was investigated by a number of techniques. SEM, EDX and AFM tests revealed that the yeast cell walls were destructed and the nano-MnO2 particles were successfully deposited on yeast surface. XRD measurement showed the nano-MnO2 particles were at a non-stoichiometric and amorphous phase. Zeta potential analysis showed that KMnO4 treatment resulted in the change of yeast surface charge. Evidence from FTIR spectra confirmed that the exposed functional groups (such as hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl and phosphate groups) and nano-MnO2 particles on yeast surface could be available for synergetic adsorption of Cd2+. Besides, XPS analysis further demonstrated that the Mn2+ ions attached on yeast-MnO2 composites surface were also involved in the adsorption of Cd2+ via ion-exchange behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to isolate and identify ZEA-resistant bacteria from rumen in order to develop some strategies for detoxifying ZEA-contaminated food and feed. A bacterial strain was isolated from the rumen contents for its ability to utilize ZEA as the sole carbon and energy source. The isolate was an aerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium with single polar flagellum and was named Pseudomonas otitidis TH-N1 based on the morphology and 16S rRNA gene sequence. Meanwhile, the present study investigated that how various influence factors of P. otitidis TH-N1 could remove ZEA from a liquid medium. The optimal temperature, pH value, and concentrations of bacteria for the biodegradation of ZEA were 37 degrees C, 4.5, and 10(9) cfu/ml, respectively. These results suggest that P. otitidis TH-N1 is a new bacterium found from the rumen and exhibited remarkable degradation activity of ZEA. It is probably a new bacterial resource to detoxify ZEA from ZEA-contaminated food and feed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to express and characterize a partial codon optimized porcine pancreatic lipase (opPPL). A 537 bp cDNA fragment encoding N-terminus amino acid residue of the mature porcine pancreatic lipase was synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris and ligated to the full-length porcine pancreatic lipase cDNA fragment. The codon optimized PPL was cloned into the pPICZ alpha A (Invitrogen, Beijing, China) vector. After the resultant opPPL/pPICZ alpha A plasmid was transformed into P. pastoris, the over-expressed extracellular opPPL containing a His-tag to the C terminus was purified using Ni Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), and was characterized against the native enzyme (commercial PPL from porcine pancreas, Sigma). The opPPL exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa, and showed optimal temperature (40 degrees C), optimal pH (8.0), K-m (0.041 mM), and V-max (2.008 mu mol.mg protein(-1).min(-1)) similar to those of the commercial enzyme with p-NPP as the substrate. The recombinant enzyme was stable at 60 degrees C, but lost 80% (P<0.05) of its activity after exposure to heat >= 60 degrees C for 20 min. The codon optimization increased opPPL yield for ca 4 folds (146 mg.L-1 vs 36 mg.L-1) and total enzyme activity increased about 5 folds (1900 IU.L-1 vs 367 IU.L-1) compared with those native naPPL/pPICZ alpha A tranformant. Comparison of gene copies and mRNA profiles between the two strains indicated the increased rePPL yields may partly be ascribed to the increased protein translational efficiency after codon optimization. In conclusion, we successfully optimized 5-terminal of porcine pancreatic lipase encoding gene and over-expressed the gene in P. pastoris as an extracellular, functional enzyme. The recombination enzyme demonstrates a potential for future use as an animal feed additive for animal improvement.

Rats were assigned randomly to one of three dietary groups and were given a basal diet containing 15% PF, 15% WF, or no supplemental fiber. Urine and plasma samples were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics. PF significantly increased the plasma levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, and myo-inositol as well as the urine levels of alanine, hydroxyphenylacetate, phenylacetyglycine, and a-ketoglutarate. However, PF significantly decreased the plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, lactate, and pyruvate as well as the urine levels of allantoin, bile acids, and trigonelline. WF significantly increased the plasma levels of acetone, isobutyrate, lactate, myo-inositol, and lipids as well as the urine levels of alanine, lactate, dimethylglycine, N-methylniconamide, and alpha-ketoglutarate. However, WF significantly decreased the plasma levels of amino acids, and glucose as well as the urine levels of acetate, allantoin, citrate, creatine, hippurate, hydroxyphenylacetate, and trigonelline. Results suggest that PF and WF exposure can promote antioxidant activity and can exhibit common systemic metabolic changes, including lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, glycogenolysis and glycolysis metabolism, protein biosynthesis, and gut microbiota metabolism. PF can also decrease bile acid metabolism. These findings indicate that different fiber diet may cause differences in the biofluid profile in rats.

Mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences of parasites can unveil their genetic diversity and depict their likely dynamic evolution and therefore may provide insights into parasite survival and responses to host changes, as well as parasite control. Methods: Based on previous studies, the present study further annotated the genetic variability and structure of B. schroederi populations by combining two different mtDNA markers, ATPase subunit 6 (atp6) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1). Both sequences were completely amplified and genetically analyzed among 57 B. schroederi isolates, which were individually collected from ten geographical regions located in three important giant panda habitats in China (Minshan, Qionglai and Qinling mountain ranges). Results: For the DNA dataset, we identified 20 haplotypes of atp6, 24 haplotypes of cox1, and 39 haplotypes of atp6 + cox1. Further haplotype network and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that B. schroederi populations were predominantly driven by three common haplotypes, atp6 A1, cox1 C10, and atp6 + cox1 H11. However, due to low rates of gene differentiation between the three populations, both the atp6 and cox1 genes appeared not to be significantly associated with geographical divisions. In addition, high gene flow was detected among the B. schroederi populations, consistent with previous studies, suggesting that this parasite may be essentially homogenous across endemic areas. Finally, neutrality tests and mismatch analysis indicated that B. schroederi had undergone earlier demographic expansion. Conclusions: These results confirmed that B. schroederi populations do not follow a pattern of isolation by distance, further revealing the possible existence of physical connections before geographic separation. This study should also contribute to an improved understanding of the population genetics and evolutionary biology of B. schroederi and assist in the control of baylisascariasis in giant pandas.

From this screening, we isolated a rice mutant that exhibits hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves and designated it as the Leaf Starch Excess 1 (LSE1) mutant. Here, we report two other rice LSE mutants, LSE2 and LSE3. Results: Unlike lse1 plants, lse2 and lse3 plants displayed retarded growth; lse2 showed an extremely dwarf phenotype and rarely survived in paddy fields; lse3 showed inhibited growth with pale green leaf blades, low tiller numbers, reduced height, and low grain yield. In lse2 and lse3 plants, the mature source leaves contained larger amounts of starch and sucrose than those in wild-type and lse1 plants. Furthermore, microscopic observations of leaf transverse sections indicated that hyperaccumulation of starch in chloroplasts of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells occurred in lse2 and lse3 plants, while that in vascular cells was noticeable only in lse3 leaves. Conclusions: The distinct phenotypes of these three LSE mutants suggest that the LSE2 and LSE3 mutations occur because of disruption of novel genes that might be involved in the path of sucrose transport from mesophyll cells to phloem sieve elements in rice leaves, the mechanism for which has not yet been elucidated.

Chemical drugs have been widely used to treat and control this kind of disease. But many chemicals control could increase resistance in target species, toxicity and environmental hazards. We found that the 9-oxo-10, 11-dehydroageraphorone (euptox A) extracted from E. adenophorum has strong toxicity against P. cuniculi in vitro, but the in vivo acaricidal actions of euptox A have yet to be investigated. Results: A 14-day experiment was performed using rabbits that were naturally infested with P. cuniculi on a farm. Rabbits were randomly divided into five groups; animals in groups A, B and C were treated in each ear topically with 4.0 ml of 2.0 and 1.0 g/L (w/v) euptox A, respectively. Animals in groups D and E were treated with ivermectin (by injection; positive controls) and glycerol with water only (by embrocation; negative controls), respectively. Each rabbit was treated twice with separate treatments on days 0 and 7. Rabbits were observed daily and detailed examinations were performed on days 0, 7 and 14, to inspect the presence or absence of mites and scabs/crusts. Seven days after the initial treatment, the mean clinical scores (presence of scabs/crusts) decreased from 3.48, 3.37, 3.43 and 3.45 to 0.37, 0.42, 0.78 and 0.38 in the ears of animals in groups A, B, C and D, respectively, which were similar to the observations recorded in the positive control rabbits. However, the clinical score for negative control rabbits did not increase significantly (P > 0.05) during the experiment, and this changed from 3.32 to 3.37 in the ears, and there were no significant differences in clinical efficacy between left and right ears. After two treatments (0 and 7 d), the rabbits in groups A, B, C and D had recovered completely 14 days after the last treatment and no recurrences of infection were observed. Conclusions: These results indicate that euptox A was potent compounds for the effective control of animal P. cuniculi in vivo.

Grass carp (weighing 256.8 +/- 3.5 g) were fed diets containing six graded levels of Ile (3.8, 6.6, 9.3, 12.5, 15.2 and 18.5 g/kg) for eight weeks. The results indicated that compared with Ile deficiency (3.8 g/kg diets) and excess (18.5 g/kg diets) groups, 9.3-15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations promoted fish growth and muscle fat deposition, whereas 6.6-15.2 g Ile/kg diets supplementation enhanced muscle nutrients (protein and total EAAs) deposition. Furthermore, muscle shear force, pH value, and hydroxyproline concentration were improved by 9.3-12.5, 9.3 and 9.3 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. However, muscle cooking loss, lactate content, and activities of cathepsin B and L were decreased by 6.6-15.2, 9.3-12.5, 9.3-12.5 and 9.3-15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. Additionally, 6.6-15.2 and 6.6-12.5 g Ile/kg diet supplementations attenuated malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents, respectively. The activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione content were enhanced by 6.6-9.3, 6.6-12.5 and 6.6-15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. Moreover, the relative mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzymes, including Cu/Zn-SOD (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets) and GPx (12.5 g/kg diets), as well as antioxidant-related signaling molecules, including NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets), target of rapamycin (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets), ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (9.3-12.5 g/kg diets) and casein kinase 2 (6.6-12.5 g/kg diets), were up-regulated when Ile diet supplementations were administered at these levels, respectively, whereas the relative mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 was downregulated with 9.3 g Ile/kg diet supplementations. Collectively, the present study indicated that optimum isoleucine improved flesh quality, partly due to the activation of antioxidant defense through the Nrf2 signaling pathway.

METHODS: We extracted essential oils from different parts of Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri Chinensis) using a steam distillation method. The essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Data were collected in full scan mode (m/z 60-600). Volatile components were identified based on their retention indices and by comparing their mass spectra with those in the National Institute of Standards and Technology 2005 database, assisted by tandem mass spectrometry information. The relative content of each constituent was determined by area normalization. RESULTS: We identified 111 components, of which 12 were common to all 5 parts, 30 were found only in roots, 14 were found only in flowers, 6 were found only in leaves, 4 were found only in stems, and 17 were found only in fruits. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the stems, flowers, leaves, and fruits of Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri Chinensis) contain a high concentration of essential oils, and that the exact composition of the essential oils differs among the plant parts. To develop new medicines and make full use of the Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri Chinensis) resource, it is important to characterize the essential oils from different parts of the plant. In future research, it will be im portant to determine the pharmacological effects of the various components and the essential oil mixtures. (C) 2014 JTCM. All rights reserved.

The objective of the present study was to identify the stable reference genes in orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L), a principal cool-season forage grass in the world. Ten candidate reference genes were selected in this study including ATP-binding [ABC], actin [ACTIN], cyclophilin [CYP2], glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], beta-amylase 4 [BAM4], zeitlupe [ZTL], MAP Kinase 4 [MPK4], ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme [UBC], S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase [SAMDC], and translationally controlled tumor protein [TCTP]. The candidate genes were assessed in orchardgrass leaves and roots under conditions of drought, high salinity, heat, waterlogging, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. We used GeNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and RefFinder for qRT-PCR normalization and validation to determine that the expression of these reference genes was stress-dependent. ACTIN, CYP2, and ABC were found to be the most stably expressed genes for drought stress while ACTIN, TCTP, and ABC were the most stable under salt stress. ACTIN, CYP2, and ABC were all found to be good reference genes for studying heat stress. Likewise, CYP2, MPK4, and ABC were most suitable to study waterlogging, and ACTIN, CYP2, and MPK4 were determined as the three best reference genes for ABA studies.

In the pot experiment, mulching with M. japonicus straw increased the root biomass, stem biomass, leaf biomass, shoot biomass, plant height and activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase) of G. parviflora compared with the control, whereas mulching with straws of R. sieboldii, C. confine and P. asiatica decreased these parameters. Straws of the four Cd-tolerant plants increased the Cd content in roots of G. parviflora compared with the control. However, only straws of M. japonicus and P. asiatica increased the Cd content in shoots of G. parviflora, reduced the soil pH, and increased the soil exchangeable Cd concentration. Straw of M. japonicus increased the amount of Cd extraction in stems, leaves and shoots of G. parviflora by 21.11%, 29.43% and 24.22%, respectively, compared with the control, whereas straws of the other three Cd-tolerant plants decreased these parameters. In the field experiment, the M. japonicus straw also increased shoot biomass, Cd content in shoots, and amount of Cd extraction in shoots of G. parviflora compared with the control. Therefore, straw of M. japonicus can be used to improve the Cd extraction ability of G. parviflora from Cd-contaminated soil.

It is well-known that surface immunogenicity protein (Sip) is an effective vaccine against GBS. Experimental design: Since Sip was not expressed in either E. coli BL21 or E. coli Rosetta, we removed the N-terminal signal peptide and LysM of the virus to produce purified truncated Sip (tSip(1)), which multiplied easily in an E. coli host. The antibody's ability to recognize and combine with GBS was determined by Western-blot and specific staining in vitro. The relative percentage of survival (RPS), antibody titers, bacterial recovery, and pathologic morphology were monitored in vivo to evaluate the immune effects. Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) plus tSip and aluminum hydroxide gel (AH) plus tSip were also evaluated. Results: It revealed that tSip mixed with FIA was an effective vaccine against GBS in tilapia, while AH is toxic to tilapia. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Brittle rachis and hard threshing are two important characters of Tibetan semi-wild wheat. A whole-genome linkage map of T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum was constructed using a recombinant inbred line population (Q1028 x ZM9023) with 186 lines, 564 diversity array technology markers, and 117 simple sequence repeat markers. Phenotypic data on brittle rachis and threshability, as two quantitative traits, were evaluated on the basis of the number of average spike rachis fragments per spike and percent threshability in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping performed using inclusive composite interval mapping analysis clearly identified four QTLs for brittle rachis and three QTLs for threshability. However, three loci on 2DS, 2DL, and 5AL showed pleiotropism for brittle rachis and threshability; they respectively explained 5.3%, 18.6%, and 18.6% of phenotypic variation for brittle rachis and 17.4%, 13.2%, and 35.2% of phenotypic variation for threshability. A locus on 3DS showed an independent effect on brittle rachis, which explained 38.7% of the phenotypic variation. The loci on 2DS and 3DS probably represented the effect of Tg and Br1, respectively. The locus on 5AL was in very close proximity to the Q gene, but was different from the predicted q in Tibetan semi-wild wheat. To our knowledge, the locus on 2DL has never been reported in common wheat but was prominent in T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum accession Q1028. It remarkably interacted with the locus on 5AL to affect brittle rachis. Several major loci for brittle rachis and threshability were identified in Tibetan semi-wild wheat, improving the understanding of these two characters and suggesting the occurrence of special evolution in Tibetan semi-wild wheat.

Here, we show that the virulent SH strain and the attenuated FC64 strain induced varied pathogenicity, apoptosis and immune responses in the livers of 1-day-old ducklings. SH infection caused apoptosis and visible lesions in the liver; serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and total bilirubin activities were markedly upregulated; and ducklings died at 36 h post-infection (p.i.). However, FC64 infection did not induce significant symptoms or impair liver function, and all of the infected ducklings remained healthy. In addition, both virus strains replicated well in the liver, spleen and intestine, whilst the SH strain replicated more efficiently than FC64. IFN-gamma, IL-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide were strongly induced by SH infection, and may be associated with the pathogenicity of the SH strain. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-stimulated transmembrane protein 1, IFN-stimulated gene 12, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like and IL-6 were moderately induced by SH infection at 24 h p.i., and dramatically induced by FC64 infection at 36 h p.i. The intensive induction of cytokines by FC64 may be involved in restriction of virus replication and stimulation of adaptive immune responses. Ducklings inoculated with FC64 produced high levels of antiviral antibodies within 45 days p.i. The low virulence and strong immune response of FC64 rendered this strain a good vaccine candidate, as confirmed by a protective assay in this study.

Casein supplementation does not affect true phosphorus digestibility and endogenous phosphorus loss associated with soybean meal for broiler chickens determined by the regression method	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Broiler chicken; casein; endogenous loss; phosphorus; soybean meal; true digestibility	AMINO-ACID DIGESTIBILITY; GROWING PIGS; MICROBIAL PHYTASE; ILEAL DIGESTIBILITY; CORN; FEEDSTUFFS; OUTPUTS; CALCIUM; RATIOS; DIET	Cornstarch-based semi-purified diets impair growth performance of birds when using the regression method to estimate phosphorus (P) digestibility in assay feed ingredient. Therefore, casein is usually supplemented in the basal diet to improve dietary amino acid profile. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of dietary casein supplementation on regression-derived estimates of true phosphorus digestibility and endogenous phosphorus loss (EPL) associated with soybean meal (SBM) in broiler chickens. Four hundred thirty-two male Ross 708 broilers were allocated to nine diets in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement of three diet types (with casein at moderate dietary P, without casein at moderate dietary P, or without casein at low dietary P) and three SBM levels (low, medium, or high). There were six birds per cage and eight replicate cages per diet in a randomized complete block design. The birds were fed experimental diets from day 12 to 20 post-hatching. Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker to calculate P digestibility and retention. The results indicated that body weight gain and feed efficiency linearly increased (P < 0.01) and dry matter retention was linearly decreased (P < 0.01) with the addition of SBM, regardless of diet type. The apparent prececal P digestibility and excreta P retention were increased by casein supplementation (P < 0.01). The prececal and excreta P output linearly increased (P < 0.01) with graded inclusion of SBM in each diet type. Regression of P output against dietary P intake showed that the type of diets (with casein at moderate dietary P, without casein at moderate dietary P, or without casein at low dietary P) had no effect on true prececal P digestibility and excreta P retention, or EPL associated with SBM for broiler chickens (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that adding casein, which is high in P digestibility, to cornstarch-based basal diets does not affect the estimation of EPL or true P digestibility and retention associated with SBM for broiler chickens using the regression method.

'Schwabenland Red' mutants induced by ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS), we investigated the incidence and severity of stem rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn, and their morphological changes. In this study, we obtained three mutants with highly resistant disease after two rounds of screening when the inoculated amount was 3 sheets/plant. The severity scale was 0 and there were no obvious symptoms of stem rot in highly resistant Begonia x hiemalis. However, most of EMS mutagenized plants were susceptible to stem rot caused by R. solani under this inoculated amount. In addition, these resistant mutants had different phenotypes as compared with the uninfected control plants. The color of leaves of the R. solani-resistent mutants was different with the control plants and their leaves were bigger than that of the control. The shape and number of their flowers were obviously different, as compared to the control plants.

The aim of this work was to compare the disinfection efficiency of continuous and pulsed UV light at different frequencies. A tunable frequency UV system was designed to allow indicator bacteria to be exposed to continuous or pulsed UV light with a same low pressure mercury lamp, which can emit UV light with a wavelength of 253.7 nm, and the pulse frequency was adjustable. The germicidal ability against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. of pulsed UV light at frequencies 0 (represented continuous irradiation), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Hz was compared. The results showed that pulse frequency is a factor influencing the ultimate inactivation ability of pulsed UV light and at specific frequencies pulsed UV light was more bactericidal than continuous UV. Industrial relevance: Pulsed UV light for microbial inactivation has been applied for more than 30 years. As a very important factor, pulse frequency has been ignored for a long time. We have demonstrated that at some specific frequencies, pulsed UV light was more bactericidal than continuous UV using low pressure mercury lamp. And if further studies could come to the similar results in inert-gas flash lamps and/or medium-pressure UV lamps and figure out the optimal pulse frequency, it might improve the sterilization efficiency of the existing pulsed UV system.

The A-type and B-type granules were separated and purified from each wheat genotype. Starch size, distribution, amylose content, distribution of amylopectin chain lengths, gelatinization, and retrogradation were analyzed in different wheat genotypes. Our results indicate that Aegilops speltoides (BB genome) has a significantly higher percentage of large A-type granules. The A-type granules contained significantly higher amylose content than the B-type granules in all accessions. Amylopectin exhibited more B2 and B3 chains (DP 25 and up) but less A chains (DP 6-12) in the A-type than the B-type granules. The extent of enthalpy changes during starch gelatinization was greater and retrogradation rates were higher in the A-type than the B-type granules. However, the B-type granules have broader ranges of gelatinization temperatures (Tc-To) than the A-type granules. Additionally, the B-type granules of wild diploid species (AA and BB genome) consistently exhibit lower onset (To) and higher peak (Tp) and conclusion (Tc) temperatures. Thus, starch structure is closely related to functionality, and granule size and distribution are significantly correlated to starch thermal properties.

In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the tolerance mechanisms of the eucalyptus to lanthanum and cerium. Cell walls stored 45.40-63.44% of the metals under lanthanum or cerium stress. Peroxidase and catalase activities enhanced with increasing soil La or Ce concentrations up to 200 mg kg(-1), while there were no obvious changes in glutathione and ascorbate concentrations. Non-protein thiols concentrations increased with increasing treatment levels up to 200 mg kg(-1), and then decreased. Phytochelatins concentrations continued to increase under La or Ce stress. Therefore, the two eucalyptus species are La and Ce tolerant plants, and the tolerance mechanisms include cell wall deposition, antioxidant system response, and thiol compound synthesis.

Results showed that significant promotion on Pb-removal with the mixed solutions of LMWOA and nZVI (p < 0.05). The Pb removal efficiencies reached 64% and 83% for mine and farmland soil by addition of 0.2 M citric acid and 2.0 g L-1 nZVI, respectively. They decreased with increasing pH from 3 to 9. The mixed solutions of LMWOA and nZVI induced Pb(II) releases processes including a rapid desorption within 4 h and a slow desorption in the following hours. The second-order model was the most appropriate for describing the kinetic processes of Pb(II) desorption. The main fractions of Pb removal were exchangeable and reducible. Compared with LMWOA, the loss rates of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium decreased after washing with the mixed solutions. Our study suggests that combining of LMWOA and nZVI would be a promising alternative approach for remediation Pb-contaminated soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we characterized the pattern of LD in three sheep populations (Sunite, German Mutton Merino, and Dorper) and subsequently estimated persistence of phase among them using the Illumina Ovine SNP50k Chip. In addition, we calculated the corresponding effective population sizes using the metric r(2) estimated. The results showed that the extent of LD was highest in Dorpers, followed by German Mutton Merinos and Sunites. Average r(2) values were 0.13, 0.20, and 0.22 at adjacent marker distances of 57.28, 59.01, and 59.93 kb for Sunite, German Mutton Merino, and Dorper sheep, respectively. The average r(2) values at the same genomic distance in German Mutton Merino and Dorper sheep were similar and higher than that in Sunite sheep, and the rate of LD decay over distance was faster than the rates in the other two sheep breeds. The correlation of phase for different breed comparisons ranged from 0.784 to 0.825. The effective population sizes in Sunite, German Mutton Merino, and Dorper sheep 7 generations ago were approximately 207, 74, and 67, respectively. We also detected a bottleneck in the effective population size for Sunite sheep that was consistent with the timing for the origin of the domestication of Chinese sheep. Our findings provide a theoretical reference for future genome marker-assisted evaluation and selection in sheep. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A mining ecotype (ME) and a non-mining ecotype (NME) of Pilea sinofasciata were grown in soils amended with swine manure (0-50 gkg(-1) soil) to investigate P uptake characteristics and the potentials of their use for P removal. Amendments of swine manure increased the biomass and P accumulation of P. sinofasciata, and the ME demonstrated greater shoot P accumulation (36.12-184.84 mg pot(-1)) than the NME (27.42-160.73 mg pot(-1)). Shoot and root P contents of P. sinofasciata were positively correlated with soil available P. Shoot P extraction ratio of the ME reached 13.40% when seedlings were grown in the presence of 25 g kg(-1) soil, which increased by 31.73% compared with that of the NME. Both ecotypes of P. sinofasciata showed high P removed from the soil, maximum potential yield and P removal after the addition of swine manure. This study establishes that both ecotypes of P. sinofasciata show great abilities of P uptake and P removal from soils contaminated by swine manure, and thus P. sinofasciata is a worthy candidate for phytoextraction.

However, can growth in energy consumption, economic output and environmental protection be achieved simultaneously in China? To solve the problem, this paper presents an analysis of the long-run and causal relationship between energy consumption, economic growth and environmental pollution in China from 1983-2010. The methodology uses is the Johansen cointegration test and Granger causality test based on a multivariate vector error correction model. Empirical results show that there are correlations between energy consumption, economic growth and environmental pollution in the long-term. The results of causality test indicate that economic growth is the cause for both energy consumption and environmental pollution, while energy consumption is the cause of environmental pollution and vice versa. The policy implication would be that energy conservation and pollution reduction policies may be undertaken without impeding economic growth.

Jian). A total of 1200 juvenile jian carp with average initial weight 6.9 +/- 0.03 g were fed semi-purified isonitrogenous diets containing 4.2 (unsupplemented control group), 7.0, 9.5, 11.9, 13.9 and 16.9 g Ile kg(-1) diet for 60 days. Results indicated that Ile supplementation decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content, and the amounts of Escherichia coli and Aeromonas in the intestine (P < 0.05), and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione content and the amounts of Lactobacillus and Bacillus in the intestine (P < 0.05). Furthermore, real time polymerase chain reaction revealed that relative mRNA expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), CAT, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) in the intestine were increased with increasing of dietary Ile up to a certain point (P < 0.05). Conversely, the relative mRNA expression of occludin, claudin-3, daudin-7, TNF-alpha, IL-10, Kelch-like-ECH- associated protein 1 (Keap1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) in the intestine showed a downward trend (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary Ile improves intestinal immune function, antioxidant capacity and microbial population, and regulates gene expression of antioxidant enzyme, tight junctions, Nrf2, Keap1, p38 and ERK1 in the intestine of Jian carp.

Compared with the control group, decreased relative weight of bursa of Fabricius and contents of serum immunoglobulin, more vacuoles and debris in the bursal lymphoid follicle, and increased percentage of apoptotic bursal cells were observed in the AFB1 group. Sodium selenite, however, could increase the relative weight of bursa of Fabricius and contents of serum immunoglobulin, and ameliorate histopathological lesions. The percentages of apoptotic bursal cells, through flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method, in the three +Se groups were lower than those in the AFB I group. Compared with the AFB 1 group, moreover, the mRNA expressions of Bax and Caspase-3 by qRT-PCR in the three +Se groups were decreased, while the expression of Bcl-2 was increased. The results indicate that sodium selenite in diet can protect chicken from AFB 1-induced impairment of humoral immune function by reducing bursal histopathological lesions and percentages of apoptotic bursal cells.

The informativeness of markers was also estimated using various parameters. Using 25 highly reproducible primer sets, 368 discernible fragments were generated. Of these, 282 (77.21%) were polymorphic. The number of alleles per locus ranged from five to 21, and the genetic variation indices varied. The polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.358, the Shannon diversity index (H) was 0.534, the marker index (MI) was 4.040, the resolving power (RP) was 6.108, and the genotype index (GI) was 0.782. Genetic similarity coefficients (GS) between the accessions ranged from 0.563 to 0.872, with a mean of 0.685. Their patterns observed in a dendrogram constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis (UPGMA) based on GS largely confirmed the results of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). PCoA was further confirmed by Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis, which revealed no direct association between genetic relationship and geographical origins as validated by Mantel's test (r = 0.2268, p = 0.9999). In addition, high-level genetic variation within geographical groups was significantly greater than that between groups, as determined by Shannon diversity analysis, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and Bayesian analysis. Overall, SCoT analysis is a simple, effective and reliable technique for characterizing and maintaining germplasm collections of whipgrass and related species.

Tillage and residue management effects on temporal changes in soil organic carbon and fractions of a silty loam soil in the North China Plain	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Soil organic carbon; labile; non labile organic carbon; light; heavy fraction carbon; particulate; non particulate organic carbon; conservation tillage; plow tillage	NO-TILLAGE; MATTER; SEQUESTRATION; PARTICULATE; IMPACTS; AGGREGATION; CULTIVATION; ROTATION; PASTURE; SYSTEMS	Soil degradation and associated depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) have been major concerns in intensive farming systems because of the subsequent decline in crop yields. We assessed temporal changes in SOC and its fractions under different tillage systems for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - maize (Zea mays L.) cropping in the North China Plain. Four tillage systems were established in 2001: plow tillage (PT), rotary tillage (RT), no-till (NT), and plow tillage with residues removed (PT0). Concentrations of SOC, particulate organic carbon (POC), non-POC (NPOC), labile organic carbon (LOC), non-LOC (NLOC), heavy fraction carbon (HFC) and light fraction carbon (LFC) were determined to assess tillage-induced changes in the top 50cm. Concentrations of SOC and C fractions declined with soil depth and were significantly affected by tillage over time. The results showed that SOC and its fractions were enhanced under NT and RT from 0 to 10cm depth compared with values for PT and PT0. Significant decreases were observed below 10cm depths (P<0.05) regardless of the tillage system. The SOC concentration under NT for 0-5cm depth was 18%, 8%, and 10% higher than that under PT0 after 7, 9, and 12yr of NT adoption, respectively. Apparent stratification of SOC occurred under NT compared with PT and PT0 for depths >10cm. All parameters were positively correlated (P<0.01); linear regressions exhibited similar patterns (P<0.01). Therefore, to maintain and improve SOC levels, residue inputs should be complemented by the adoption of suitable tillage systems.	[Dikgwatlhe, S. B.; Kong, F. L.; Chen, Z. D.; Zhang, H.

The study was conducted from lab-scale to pilot-scale, including batch, single-phase and two-phase experiments. The lab-scale experimental results showed that the ratio of FVW to KW at 5:8 presented higher methane productivity (0.725 L CH4/g VS), and thereby was recommended. Two-phase digestion appeared to have higher treatment capacity and better buffer ability for high organic loading rate (OLR) (up to 5.0 g (VS) L-1 d(-1)), compared with the low OLR of 3.5 g (VS) L-1 d(-1) for single-phase system. For two-phase digestion, the pilot-scale system showed similar performances to those of lab-scale one, except slightly lower maximum OLR of 4.5 g (VS) L-1 d(-1) was allowed. The pilot-scale system proved to be profitable with a net profit of 10.173 $/ton as higher OLR (>= 3.0 g (VS) L-1 d(-1)) was used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 240 one-day-old male AA broilers were randomly assigned four dietary treatments containing 0 mg/kg of AFB(1) (control), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) (AFB(1)), 0.4 mg/kg supplement Se (+ Se) and 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg supplement Se (AFB(1) + Se), respectively. Compared with the control broilers, the number of apoptotic cells, the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA were significantly increased, while the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio were significantly decreased in AFB(1) broilers. The number of apoptotic cells and the expression of Caspase-3 mRNA in AFB(1) + Se broilers were significantly higher than those in the control broilers, but significantly lower than those in AFB(1) broilers. There were no significant changes in the expression of Bax mRNA between AFB(1) + Se and control broilers; the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in AFB(1) + Se broilers were significantly lower than those in the control broilers, but significantly higher than those in AFB(1) broilers. In conclusion, 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) in the diet can increase cell apoptosis, decrease Bcl-2 mRNA expression, and increase of Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA expression in broiler's jejunum. However, supplementation of dietary sodium selenite at the concentration of 0.4 mg/kg Se may ameliorate AFB(1)-induced apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 mRNA expression, and decreasing Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA expression.

However, little is known about the associated regulatory mechanisms at the epigenetic level in maize under lead (Pb) stress. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare DNA methylation profiles during the dynamic development of maize roots following Pb treatment to identify candidate genes involved in the response to Pb stress. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was used to investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in maize roots under normal condition (A1) and 3 mM Pb(NO3)(2) stress for 12 h (K2), 24 h (K3) and 48 h (K4). The results showed that the average methylation density was the highest in CpG islands (CGIs), followed by the intergenic regions. Within the gene body, the methylation density of the introns was higher than those of the UTRs and exons. In total, 3857 methylated genes were found in 4 tested samples, including 1805 differentially methylated genes for K2 versus A1, 1508 for K3 versus A1, and 1660 for K4 versus A1. Further analysis showed that 140 genes exhibited altered DNA methylation in all three comparisons, including some well-known stress-responsive transcription factors and proteins, such as MYB, AP2/ERF, bZIP, serine-threonine/tyrosine-proteins, pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, RING zinc finger proteins, F-box proteins, leucine-rich repeat proteins and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins. This study revealed the genome-scale DNA methylation patterns of maize roots in response to Pb exposure and identified candidate genes that potentially regulate root dynamic development under Pb stress at the methylation level.

Questionnaires, statistical analysis and logistic regressions were employed. The results indicate that the higher educated farmers will be more satisfied with the relocation areas. An increase in the number of public facilities and the associated maintenance costs will decrease the resettled farmer's satisfaction. Farmers who have moved to new communities are more satisfied with infrastructure, supporting facilities and property management, especially the living environment. The main tasks completed by farmers are the tillage land and to do work for their new community. The positive factors that contribute to the famer's satisfaction, include land-rights guarantees, compensation for land consolidation, sewage treatment and the living environment. In contrast, public facilities, commercial service networks and resettled area's maintenance are negative factors for farmer's satisfaction. Meanwhile, the key factors to promoting harmony between urban and rural construction are to establish relevant laws and regulations, reasonable operation and management mechanisms, farmer-rights protection mechanisms, and to protect famer household income, as well as to improve agricultural production and farmer's non-agricultural employment opportunity.

Characterization of Intergeneric Hybrid between Common Wheat and Aegilops sharonensis (Eig) and Transfer of Alien High Molecular Weight Glutenin Subunits into Wheat	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Aegilops sharonensis; common wheat; cytology; HMW-GS; SSR marker	BREAD WHEAT; STORAGE PROTEINS; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; MICROSATELLITE; QUALITY; GENES; DIVERSITY; GENETICS; LOCI; MAP	Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) is a valuable source of novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits, resistance to wheat rust, powdery mildew, and insect pests. In this study, we successfully hybridized Ae. sharonensis as the pollen parent to common wheat and obtained backcross derivatives. F1 intergeneric hybrids were verified using morphological observation and cytological and molecular analyses. The phenotypes of the hybrid plants were intermediate between Ae. sharonensis and common wheat. Observations of mitosis in root tip cells and meiosis in pollen mother cells revealed that the F1 hybrids possessed 28 chromosomes. Chromosome pairing at metaphase I of the pollen mother cells in the F1 hybrid plants was low, and the meiotic configuration was 25.94 I + 1.03 II (rod). Two pairs of primers were screened out from 150 simple sequence repeat markers, and primer WMC634 was used to identified the presence of the genome of Ae. sharonensis. Sequencing results showed that the F1 hybrids contained the S-sh genome of Ae. sharonensis. The sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile showed that the alien high molecular weight glutenin subunits of Ae. sharonensis were transferred into the F1 and backcross derivatives. The new wheat- Ae. sharonensis derivatives that we have produced will be valuable for increasing resistance to various diseases of wheat and for improving the quality of bread wheat.	[Zhao, Q.

The inoculants were applied at 2x10(6) colony forming units g(-1). Uninoculated silages served as control. After treatment, the chopped materials were ensiled in 1.5-L anaerobic glass jars. Three jars per treatment were sampled on days 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 45 and 90. After 90days of fermentation, the silages were subjected to an aerobic stability test lasting 5days, in which CO2 production, change in pH and microbial numbers were measured to determine the extent of aerobic deterioration. At the end of the fermentation period 90 days, inoculation with L.buchneri or in combination with L.plantarum significantly resulted in higher levels of acetic acid in the silages than other treatments (P<0.05), thus the activities of yeasts and molds, especially yeasts, were impaired. The application of L.buchneri, alone or in combination of with L.plantarum, improved the aerobic stability of whipgrass silage as reflected by lower pH, CO2 production and yeast and mold counts during aerobic exposure. Combining L.buchneri with L.plantarum or applying L.plantarum alone improved the fermentation characteristics of whipgrass silage in comparison with the control. The application of L.buchneri alone or in combination with L.plantarum improved the aerobic stability of whipgrass silage under laboratory conditions.
