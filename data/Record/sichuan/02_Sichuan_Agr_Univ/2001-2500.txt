An active 1Ay gene was first cloned from wild emmer wheat (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB), the oldest species in emmer wheat. Here, a novel subunit encoded by the 1Ay gene (JF519636) present in T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides line D141 was characterized. The protein had 608 amino acids with six cysteine residues and showed faster electrophoretic mobility than 1Dy12 from common wheat. Compared with previously reported 1Ay subunits, it contained 16 single point mutations (SPMs). Comparative and phylogenetic sequence analyses suggested that this gene was more similar to the 1Ay gene from the diploid species (2n = 2x = 14, AA) T. urartu than from T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides. Its predicted secondary protein structure possessed a different content of motifs relative to the 1Ay gene (AY245578) from T. urartu, which had similar electrophoretic mobility. In the central repetitive domain, JF519636 had more beta-turns and beta-bends than the 1Ay subunit AY245578. These structural characteristics in JF519636 could possibly be associated with specific gluten properties.

In our study, 360 healthy adult female mice were randomly assigned to nine groups for a 12-day study. Mice of all groups were given a 4-day continuous intraperitoneal injection with different concentrations of ZEA alone, DON alone and the mixture of ZEA and DON, individually. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 3, 5, 8 and 12 of the experiment. The experiment results showed that all the experimental groups could cause the dysregulation of the immunoglobulin, thus affecting the humoral immune of mice. The mixture groups, especially in the group with higher concentrations of ZEA and DON (Group D2Z2), showed more obvious effect on the dysregulation of the immunoglobulin.	[Ren, Z.

However, decomposing leaf litter is one of the main sources of allelochemicals in such systems. In this study, lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. angustata) was grown in the soil incorporated with walnut leaf litter to assess its allelopathic activity. Lettuce growth and physiological processes were inhibited by walnut leaf litter, especially during early growth stage (1-2 euphylla period) or with large amount of litter addition. The plants treated by small amount of leaf litter recovered their growth afterwards, while the inhibition for 180 g leaf litter persisted until harvest. Twenty-eight compounds were identified in the leaf litter, and several of them were reported to be phytotoxic, which may be responsible for the stress induced by walnut leaf litter. Thus, for highest economic value of vegetables such as lettuce, excessive incorporation of leaf litter should be discouraged.

After feeding the experimental diets for 21 d, the pigs were intramuscularly vaccinated with PRRS or PBS. Performance data were recorded over a period of 10 weeks and are presented for the pre-challenge period (3 weeks) and the challenge period (7 weeks, where on day 1, pigs were immunologically challenged). During the pre-challenge period, the growth performance was not different between dietary treatments. PRRS vaccination resulted in increased rectal temperature and decreased feed intake and growth rate (p < 0.05). In PRRS-vaccinated pigs, diet TTR enhanced the feed intake, especially during the first 2 weeks after the PRRS vaccination compared with diet CON (p < 0.05). PRRS vaccination also resulted in increased plasma concentration of urea nitrogen, essential and non-essential amino acids (p < 0.05) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus specific antibodies (p < 0.05), but decreased concentration of immunoproteins including alpha-1-acylglycoprotein and immunoglobulin G (p < 0.05). The alleviation of the PRRS vaccination induced decrease in feed intake and growth rate by Thr and Trp supplementation, indicating that the PRRS-vaccinated pigs had a higher Thr and Trp requirement than non-vaccinated pigs.

Novel genetic variations exist in Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii that can be utilized in wheat improvement. We synthesized a hexaploid wheat genotype (SHW-L1) by crossing an Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii accession (AS60) with a tetraploid wheat genotype (AS2255). A population consisting of 171 F-8 recombinant inbred lines was developed from SHW-L1 and Chuanmai 32 to identify QTLs associated with agronomic traits. A new genetic map with high density was constructed and used to detect the QTLs for heading date, kernel width, spike length, spikelet number, and thousand kernel weight. A total of 30 putative QTLs were identified for five investigated traits. Thirteen QTLs were located on D genomes of SHW-L1, six of them showed positive effect on agronomic traits. Chromosome region flanked by wPt-6133-wPt-8134 on 2D carried five environment-independent QTLs. Each QTL accounted for more than 10% phenotypic variance. These QTLs were highly consistent across environments and should be used in wheat breeding.

Two contrasting soils were incubated at five temperatures (-5, 0, 5, 15 and 25 degrees C) for 4 weeks. Rates of N mineralisation and nitrification were insensitive to temperature at lower temperatures (0 degrees C and 5 degrees C) but increased over higher temperatures (15 degrees C and 25 degrees C). Large amounts of ammonium were released for each incubation time in both soils when the incubation temperature was -5 degrees C. Therefore, the rates of mineralisation and ammonification at -5 degrees C were significantly higher than at the other temperatures. Both the accumulations of inorganic N and rates of N transformation were significantly higher in the natural forest than in the plantation. Moreover, temperature sensitivity of net nitrification and N mineralisation were greater in the natural forest than the spruce plantation. Effects of temperature on accumulations of inorganic N and rates of N transformation were dependent on incubation time and forest ecosystem. Our results suggested that -5 degrees C might be a key low temperature for N mineralisation in subalpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau; the effect of projected warming on soil N transformation rate may be less significant in plantation forests than natural forests in this specific region.

Lev. is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant that is distributed mainly in southwestern Sichuan and northern Yunnan. Its characteristic product is blinin, which has, among other properties, antigastric ulcer activity, and can serve as a quality-control standard for such medicine. The problem is that C. blinii only produces low yields of blinin. As a diterpene, blinin is likely formed by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway. While 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in diterpenoid biosynthesis, it is a switch in the pathway. The DXS gene was successfully cloned and characterized from C. blinii by homologous cloning and rapid-amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). It was designated cbDXS and contains a 2190-bp open reading frame encoding 730 amino acids (aa), including a 17-aa signal peptide and a 713-aa mature protein. Semiquantitative RTPCR was used to determine the expression levels of cbDXS in different C. blinii tissues at the seedling stage. The corresponding blinin concentrations were also analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cbDXS gene showed tissue specificity. Moreover, its expression levels were highly correlated to blinin concentrations. In summary, it is suggested that overexpression of this gene may increase flux toward blinin synthesis.

Eighty-nine pairs of soil and 17 main rice cultivars from the slight-moderate Cd-pollution paddy field in Chengdu Plain were randomly collected. The Cd content in brown rice, Cd enrichment, translocation factors, and rice yield were studied for screening rice cultivars with low Cd uptake and accumulation in a slightly moderate Cd-pollution environment. The results showed that cadmium content in different parts of rice varies in a large range. Cadmium content in brown rice ranged from 0.05 mg.kg(-1) to 0.48 mg.kg(-1), specifically from 0.01 mg.kg(-1) to 0.19 mg.kg(-1) in chaff. Among the 17 main rice cultivars, the content of Cd in brown rice of Kyou 817 was 0.46 mg.kg(-1), which lay in the highest level, while the Cd content in brown rice of Aiyou 82, Jinyou 527, Gangyou 22, Fuyou 130, IIyou 906, Yixiangyou 1577, Jinyou 725, and Fuyou 838 were lower than national maximum level (0.2 mg.kg(-1)). Cadmium content in brown rice, chaff, and straw of Aiyou 82 were notably lower than the average value. The Cd content in roots of IIyou 906 reached a relatively high level, but the rest is lower than the average. The enrichment factors of straw in Fuyou 130 and Jinyou 725 (EFs>0.6) were relatively higher than the average. The straw of Fuyou 130, Yixiangyou 1577, and Jinyou 725 had a stronger ability of Cd translocation (translocation factors >0.45, TFs), which exceeded the average. The yield of Aiyou 82 was lower than the average in 90% level, which was remarkably low. In conclusion, IIyou 906 was the most ideal rice cultivar by evaluating the Cd content in brown rice, EFs and TFs in straw, and yield levels. As for Fuyou 130, special attention should be paid to reduce the risk of Cd pollution in straw returning. Gangyou 22, Jinyou 527, and Fuyou 838 presented lower yields or lighter Cd-resistance ability aboveground.

A control group and three experimental groups consisted of randomly selected rats. Rats in each experimental group were orally administered with a mixture of Pb (NO3)(2) and CdCl2 center dot 2.5H(2)O with the following respective doses for 90 consecutive days: 0 mg/kg body weight b.w. (Group I, to serve as a control), 29.96 mg/kg b.w. (Group II, 29.25 + 0.71), 89.88 mg/kg b.w. (Group III, 87.74 + 2.14), and 269.65 mg/kg b.w. (Group IV, 263.23 + 6.42). Serum osteocalcin (OC) and bone-specific alkaline phosphates (BALP) were considered as bone-formation markers, whereas carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) in serum acted as bone resorption markers. Calcitonin (CT) and parathormone (PTH) were tested as calciotropic hormones markers. The (Ca) and phosphorus (Pi) concentrations in the serum and urine were determined. These results were indicated by a significant (P < 0.05 - P < 0.01) increase in BALP, CTX, and PTH concentrations and decrease in CT and OC concentrations. Moreover, the concentrations of Ca and Pi in the serum were decreased, whereas those in urine increased. Results indicated that the administration of Pb and Cd induced bone metabolism disorders by decreasing bone formation and increasing bone resorption to destroy the hormonal regulation of mineral metabolism as a result of Ca and Pi imbalance.

The effect of 1, 8-cineole on the ultrastructural structure of the bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli) was also investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The C. longepaniculatum leaf essential oil and the five chemical constituents showed variable levels of inhibition. Their MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimal bacteriocidal concentration) values were all in the range of 0.781 mu L/mL similar to 6.25 mu L/mL and 0.781 mu L/mL similar to 12.5 mu L/mL respectively except.-terpinene. The MIC values of gamma-terpinene against E. coli and S. aureus were all higher than 50 mu L/mL, but the MIC and MBC values of.-terpinene against S. enteritidis was only 3.125 mu L/mL. Among them, alpha-terpineol possessed the best antibacterial activity. Under the transmission electron microscope, cell size of treated E. coli decreased, cell wall and cell membrane ruptured, and nucleoplasm was reduced and gathered onto the side. After the S. aureus was treated with 1, 8-cineole, the cell size and shape were damaged and nucleus cytoplasm was concentrated or reduced or agglomerated on the side. These results suggest that C. longepaniculatum leaf essential oil and its constituents have excellent antibacterial activities, the antibacterial mechanism of 1, 8-cineole against E. coli and S. aureus might attributable to its hydrophobicity.

A single micropyle, which belonged to type II, was found at the animal pole of an M. anguillicaudatus egg. Several sinistral grooves which originated at the micropyle probably served for sperm guidance. The egg envelope had numerous pores with bud-like fillings and a regular arrangement like honeycomb. Lots of small knobs were situated on the zona radiata at the vegetal pole. Water contact triggered egg stickiness within about 10 seconds. The egg surface became smooth after treatment with trypsin solution. The features of the micropyle, pores and stickiness were correlated with the reproductive strategy of the loach and are important for egg identification.

Protection against Taenia pisiformis larval infection induced by a recombinant oncosphere antigen vaccine	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Taenia pisiformis; Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; Immunization; Vaccine	UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME; SOLIUM CYSTICERCOSIS; IMMUNIZATION; PROTEIN; RABBITS; PIGS; HELMINTHS; PARASITES; HEALTH; CHAINS	Taenia pisiformis larvae cause significant health problems to rabbits. At present, it is not known whether the recombinant antigen from the T. pisiformis oncosphere is able to confer protective immunity against T. pisiformis larval infection. The full-length cDNA was cloned into a pET32a (+) vector, and the recombinant protein was then expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells. Vaccination with the purified rTpUbc2 coupled with QuilA was carried out in New Zealand rabbits to evaluate the immunoprotective effect against T. pisiformis infection. The full-length open reading frame of the TpUbc2 gene was 444 bp, and encoded a 16.63-kDa protein. Finally, rTpUbc2 was used to evaluate the ability to induce immunoprotective responses in rabbits. A 79.3-90.8% reduction (P < 0.01) in the recovery of larvae was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group. Specific anti-rTpUbc2 antibodies from immunized rabbits had significantly higher levels of IgG (P < 0.01) compared to the control group; however, no significant difference in IgA levels was found between groups (P > 0.05). Our data support the use of rTpUbc2 as a potential candidate to develop a vaccine against T. pisiformis larvae.	[Chen, L.; Yang, D. Y.; Xie, Y.; Nong, X.; Huang, X.; Fu, Y.; Gu, X. B.; Wang, S.

However,the development and apoptosis of prehierarchical follicles in geese is insufficiently known. In order to obtain an understanding about the microstructure, development and apoptosis of prehierarchical follicles in geese, firstly, a histological method was used to investigate the morphological structure of prehierarchical follicles. Results showed that the thickness of granulosa cell layers of the follicular wall increased first, then decreased to the lowest when follicles grew to 9 similar to 10 mm in diameter, and the theca layers also thinned to the lowest thickness at the same stage. Moreover, the expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mRNA and the enzyme activity of caspase-3 were analyzed and the results showed that the expression of FSHR was highest when follicles grew to 8 similar to 9 mm in diameter (p<0.05); the enzyme activity of caspae-3 was the highest when follicles grew to 6 similar to 8 mm in diameter (p<0.05). These collective findings suggested that follicles 6 similar to 40 mm in diameter were especially significant, and perhaps represent a turning point from growing follicles to dominant follicles to be selected into a hierarchical sequence or to other follicles to be degenerated during prehierarchical follicle development	[Dong, Xia; Liu, He He; Wang, Ji Wen; Xiao, Qi Hai; Yuan, Xin; Li, Le; Xia, Lu; Li, Liang] Sichuan Agr Univ, Yaan, Peoples R China	Dong, X (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Yaan, Peoples R China.	dongxia88@163.com; liuee1985@gmail.com; 1791666507@qq.com; 411611744@qq.com; nihaoyuanxinjj@sina.com; 253890577@qq.com; 261072567@qq.com; ll457@163.com		Li, Liang/0000-0001-9139-5025	national science and technology support program [2012BAD39B0405]	Funding was provided by the national science and technology support program (2012BAD39B0405).		28	2	2	2	5	POLISH ACAD SCIENCES, INST SYSTEMATICS EVOLUTION ANIMALS	KRAKOW	EDITORIAL OFFICE, SLAWKOWSKA 17, KRAKOW, 31-016, POLAND	0015-5497	1734-9168		FOLIA BIOL-KRAKOW	Folia Biol.-Krakow		2014	62	3					171	177		10.3409/fb62_3.171		7	Biology	Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics	AN0ZU	WOS:000340313300002	25403070

Comparisons among the six nucleotide sequences of three genotypes revealed three base substitutions (G-789-A, C-937-G, and A-2316-C) in the HMGCR gene. The genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphism 1 (SNP1) and SNP3 were significantly associated with the number of eggs (P<0.01), and the different genotypes of SNP2 did not significantly influence the number of eggs. The genotypes of all three SNPs were not related to the hatching rate of fertilized eggs (P>0.05). Of the three SNPs of the HMGCR gene, those genotypes with lower plasma very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) concentrations had higher egg production. The 300-day egg production of the six studied haplotypes showed three levels (P<0.01). The ADE and ACE haplotypes showed lower egg production than the other haplotypes. The ADE haplotype had the highest plasma VLDL concentration, and the ACE haplotype had the lowest plasma VLDL concentration. We concluded that specific variants of the HMGCR gene are associated with chicken egg production, and haplotypes with higher and lower plasma VLDL concentrations showed lower egg production than other haplotypes.

Analysis of diversity and relationships among orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) accessions using start codon-targeted markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Dactylis glomerata; Start codon-targeted markers; Genetic diversity	LOLIUM-PERENNE L.; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; RAPD ANALYSIS; SRAP MARKERS; SSR MARKERS; CULTIVARS; POPULATIONS; PLANTS; TRANSFERABILITY	Orchardgrass, or cocksfoot, is an important perennial forage grass worldwide. The comprehensive understanding of orchardgrass accessions will benefit germplasm collection and breeding progress, and it will enhance efforts to improve forage yield and quality. Therefore, 24 novel, simple, polymorphic, and reliable start codon-targeted (SCoT) markers were used to analyze the diversity and genetic relationships among 95 orchardgrass accessions. In total, 273 polymorphic bands were detected with an average of 11.4 bands per primer. The average polymorphic rate for the species was 83.4%, suggesting a high discriminating ability of the SCoT technique for orchardgrass. The molecular variance analysis revealed that 69.13 and 30.87% of variation resided within and among groups, respectively, demonstrating that the orchardgrass germplasms had a higher level of genetic diversity within groups than among geographical regions and distributions. The distinct geographical divergence of orchardgrass was revealed between North America and Oceania. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean dendrogram revealed a separation of 7 main clusters between 95 accessions according to the geographical origin. Furthermore, each cluster was divided into subgroups mainly according to the origin of its state. The genetic divergence of orchardgrass might be influenced by the ecogeographical conditions, climatic types, breeding systems and gene flow with variations in cultures, bird migration, and breeder selection. These results could facilitate orchardgrass germplasm collection, management, and breeding worldwide.	[Jiang, L. F.; Zhang, X. Q.; Huang, L.

DPV glycoprotein C (DPV-gC) comprises 431 amino acids with a putative molecular mass of 47.35 kDa. Sequence analysis indicated that the protein possesses typical characteristics of type-I membrane glycoproteins, containing an N-terminal signal sequence, an external domain, a C-terminal membrane anchor region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. Comparisons of 22 alphaherpesvirus-gC protein sequences revealed eight conservative Cys-residue sites, which may play a crucial role in the biological functions and structural stabilization of the DPV-gC protein. Estimates of potential antigenic epitopes and secondary structure identified four B cell dominant epitopes, which are located at amino acids 68-71, 8791, 369-352, and 372-374. A model for the structure of DPV-gC was derived by associating its predicted secondary and three-dimensional structures. In conclusion, these results will provide a basis for further functional studies of DPV-gC, establishing novel clinical diagnoses of DPV, and in the development of a new DPV vaccine.	[Sun, K.

The aim of the present study was to clone 3 beta HSD1 and to determine whether this enzyme in the follicular wall has an effect on yolk progesterone in geese (Anser cygnoides). A putative coding sequence of 3 beta HSD1, which was 1134 nucleotides in length, was successfully obtained by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with chicken, quail, zebra finch, cattle, horse, pig, human and mouse 3 beta HSD1 showed 89.7%, 88.4%, 87.3%, 55.6%, 54.0%, 53.5%, 55.3% and 52.9% similarity, respectively. The detection of 3 beta HSD1 mRNA levels in several tissues by quantitative real-time PCR showed that the highest level of 3 beta HSD1 was in the adrenal gland, followed by the ovary, which indicated that the gene we obtained was the adrenal gland/gonad-specific one. We measured the level of 3 beta HSD1 mRNA in the follicular wall and determined the concentration of progesterone in the yolk of these ovarian follicles; the concentration of progesterone in the yolk had a pattern of expression similar to that of 3 beta HSD1 in the follicular wall during follicular development. This result suggests that the expression of 3 beta HSD1 in the follicular wall may be a main factor that contributes to the accumulation of yolk progesterone.

It exploits available heterosis and combines breed differences for specific characteristics. Before application of a crossbreeding system, commercial swine producers should evaluate available crossbreeding systems using existing swine breeds, and choose one that is most beneficial for their own environment, resources, and management. In this study, the latest biological and economic data were collected from commercial producers in south-western China. Three imported swine breeds (Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire) were evaluated with three simulated crossbreeding systems. System 1 used a three-breed terminal cross with Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire). System 2 was based on a three-breed rotational cross of Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire. System 3 was a combined cross system with Duroc x (Landrace, Yorkshire) three-breed rotaterminal. System 1 was predicted to be the most beneficial system ((sic)3895.15/sow), followed by system 3 ((sic)3749.02/sow), and then system 2 ((sic)3317.33/sow). Results of this study suggested that three-breed terminal cross or rotaterminal cross should maximise effective use of heterosis and breed complementarity of three imported breeds in south-western China. Also, the relative economic values of objective traits for these systems were updated using the most up-to-date biological and economic parameters.

The results showed that both the cell proliferation determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium brominde (MTT) assay and cell colony determined by soft agar assay were significantly suppressed by safrole in a dose-time-dependent manner. Characteristic morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis, including cells shrinkage, deformation and vacuolization of mitochondria, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies were observed when treated with safrole for 24 h and 48 h. Cell cycle changes evaluated by flow cytometry analysis showed that the safrole could induce accumulation of cells arrested at G(1) and S phases of the cell cycle. These results demonstrated that safrole is potent anti-hepatoma agent and the underlying mechanism may be attributed to suppress tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis.

The TUNEL assay showed that there were increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Immunohistochemical tests showed increased numbers of positive cells under Bax and caspase-3 protein detection and decreased Bcl-2 protein. Furthermore, mitochondrial injury and increased numbers of apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were observed by TEM. These results suggested that low-dose exposure to Pb and Cd can cause significant hepatic and renal apoptosis and finally impair their function. Hepatic and renal apoptosis induced by low-dose exposure is associated with mitochondrial injury and changes in levels of apoptogenic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3.

To better understand molecular mechanism of maize and identify relevant genes in response to phosphorus deficiency, we used Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) technology to investigate six genome-wide expression profiles of seedling roots of the low-P tolerant maize inbred line 178. DGE studies were conducted at 6, 24 and 72 h under both phosphorus deficient and sufficient conditions. Approximately 3.93 million raw reads for each sample were sequenced and 6 816 genes exhibited significant levels of differential expressions in at least one of three time points in response to P starvation. The number of genes with increased expression increased over time from 6 to 24 h, whereas genes with decreased expression were more abundant at 72 h, suggesting a gradual response process for P deficiency at different stages. Gene annotations illustrated that most of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are involved in different cellular and molecular processes such as environmental adaptation and carbohydrate metabolism. The expression of some known genes identified in other plants, such as those involved in root architecture, P metabolism and transport were found to be altered at least two folds, indicating that the mechanisms of molecular and morphological adaptation to P starvation are conserved in plants. This study provides insight into the general molecular mechanisms underlying plant adaptation to low-P stress and thus may facilitate molecular breeding for improving P utilization in maize.

The results revealed that the aged specimens had lower physical and mechanical properties than the controls. The differences in chemical composition provided evidence that the reduction in physical and mechanical properties was related to the loss of low-molecular weight substances, such as extractives and inorganic matter, and the depolymerization of the carbohydrates cellulose and hemicellulose. Lignin caused the main resistance to the accelerated aging test because the aged specimens had relatively high Klason lignin content. Significant differences (p<0.05) in surface color between the control and aged specimens were observed, and variations in bamboo properties among culm heights were also evaluated in this study. The results showed that basic density and mechanical properties for both the control and aged specimens increased with increasing culm height, while the volume shrinkage showed an inverse trend.

However, the health effects of sweet potato fiber (SF) and sweet potato residue (SR) and the knowledge of their exact mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. This study investigates the effect of SF and SR administration on rat metabolism. Rats were randomly assigned to one of three dietary groups of 11 rats each and given a basal diet containing 15% SF, 15% SR, or no supplemental fiber (control). The groups were observed for 30 days, and urine and plasma samples were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Compared with the rats in the control group, those administered the diet containing SF exhibited significantly increased plasma levels of lipid, lactate, and myo-inositol, as well as urine levels of acetate, citrulline, N-acetylglutamate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate. SF significantly decreased the plasma levels of glutamine, glutamine/glutamate, lysine, phosphorylcholine/glycerolphosphocholine, tyrosine, and glucose, as well as the urine level of allantoin. Moreover, SR significantly increased the plasma levels of acetone, lipid, and lactate, as well as the urine levels of acetamide, alanine, citrulline, ethanol, lactate, methylamine, methylmalonate, N-acetylglutamate, and alpha-hydroxybutyrate, compared with the control group. SR significantly decreased the plasma levels of citrate, glutamate, glutamine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, and glucose, as well as the urine level of isobutyrate. These results suggest that SF and SR supplementation have certain systemic metabolic processes in common, including lipid metabolism, glycogenolysis and glycolysis metabolism, energy metabolism, protein biosynthesis, and gut microbiota metabolism. This study demonstrates the potential for the routine use of metabolomics in nutritional studies to characterize metabolic effects and understand the influence of diet on animal metabotypes.

Meanwhile, according to the different expression levels of RSTK, ISCP, and H+-ATPase between Westag 97 and AC Hime, RSTK may be involved in transporting Cd into stems and leaves; H+-ATPase may be correlated to the capacity of Cd accumulation in roots; and Cd caused some changes of fundamental life process which leaded to the different expression patterns of ISCP between Westag 97 and AC Hime.

The reduction in grain yields has increased the research interest on the soil properties of rice-based cropping systems. Paddy-upland rotation fields are unique from other wetland or upland soils, because they are associated with frequent cycling between wetting and drying under anaerobic and aerobic conditions; such rotations affect the soil C and N cycles, make the chemical speciation and biological effectiveness of soil nutrient elements varied with seasons, increase the diversity of soil organisms, and make the soil physical properties more difficult to analyze. Consequently, maintaining or improving soil quality at a desirable level has become a complicated issue. Therefore, fully understanding the soil characteristics of paddy-upland rotation is necessary for the sustainable development of the system.

The recombinant pPID1 was then purified and identified by western blotting, and was also analyzed in vitro for its function. The recombinant protein was tagged with only a His6 tag at its C-terminus, which could be conveniently purified by affinity column. The protein could be induced for efficient expression with 0.75 mM IPTG for 8 h at 30 degrees C, yielding approximately 3 mg/L. In vitro biological activity assay demonstrated that the refolded purified recombinant pPID1 increased 3T3-L1 preadipocyte proliferation. This study provides a reliable technique for the recombinant expression and purification of pPID1 proteins.

The objective of this study was to understand how the combined variables of the preparation method and natural organic matter modification of nC(60) might affect the mobility and contaminant-mobilizing capability of nC(60), by affecting the physicochemical properties of nC(60). We found that an nC(60) sample prepared by sonicating C60 powder in deionized water (son_nC(60)) was much less mobile in saturated sandy soil columns than an nC(60) sample prepared by solvent-exchanging from toluene to water (tol_nC(60)), because son_nC(60) was considerably larger in size. However, son_nC(60) exhibited greater capability to bind 2,2',5,5'-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), likely because its loosely packed structures rendered more pore spaces, which were favorable adsorption sites for PCB. Forming nC(60) samples in Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) solution (instead of deionized water) only moderately affected the mobility of nC(60), but had very significant effects on the contaminant-binding capability of nC(60), especially when nC(60) was prepared using the solvent exchange method. Adding SRHA after the formation of nC(60) had varied effects on the mobility and contaminant-binding capability of nC(60), but the fundamental mechanism seems to be linked to how and to what extent SRHA had affected the aggregation/packing of C-60 monomers. An important environmental implication is that nC(60) formed under different environmental conditions might have vastly different effects on contaminant transport and risks.

Heterosis was observed for days to length of culm, leaf traits, tiller numbers, etc. Significant differences between obverse and inverse crosses were found for eleven traits. A cytoplasmic effect existed for the agronomic traits considered in this study. The correlations between genetic distance and heterosis were investigated by analyzing the performance of 3 crosses. The results showed that genetic distance was significantly correlated with tiller number (r = 0.834) and negatively correlated with length of culm (r = -0.889). However, there was no significant correlation with heterosis for the other traits, including yield; the correlation coefficient were too small to allow prediction of orchardgrass heterosis from the parental genetics.

The germination energy, germination rate, special characters (secondary tillering, stalk with wax powder, and dwarf), meiotic process, and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) were observed. Different species has different radiation sensibility. With 1 seed germinated (5%), T. dicoccum(PI434999) is the most sensitive to this dose of radiation. With a seed germination rate of 35% and 40%, this dose also affected T. polonicum (As304) and T. carthlicum (As293). Two mutant dwarf plants, T. turgidum (As2255) 253-10 and T. polonicum (As302) 224-14, were detected. Abnormal chromosome pairings were observed in pollen mother cells of both T. dicoccoides (As835) 237-9 and T. dicoccoides (As838) 239-8 with HMW-GS 1Ax silent in seeds from them. Compared with the unirradiated seed of T. polonicum (As304) CK, a novel HMW-GS was detected in seed of T. polonicum (As304) 230-7 and its electrophoretic mobility was between 1By8 and 1Dy12 which were the HMW-GSs of Chinese Spring. These mutant materials would be resources for wheat breeding.

It has been found that nickel (Ni) can affect the immune system in broilers. The purpose of this study was to analyze changes in TLR2-2 and TLR4 mRNA expression levels in the intestinal mucosal immunity system of broilers induced by dietary nickel chloride (NiCl2) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. Two hundred and forty one-day-old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. Results showed that the TLR2-2 and TLR4 mRNA expression levels in the intestinal mucosa and the cecal tonsil were lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups than those in the control group. It was concluded that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg could reduce TLR2-2 and TLR4 mRNA expression levels in the intestinal mucosa and cecal tonsil in broilers, implying that the innate immunity in intestinal mucosal immune system could be impaired by pathways involving injured surface epithelium cells or/and the inhibition of the TLR signal transduction.

The rats were assigned randomly to a control group and three experimental groups that were given the mixture of Pb(NO3)(2) and CdCl2 center dot 2.5H(2)O by gastric gavage at doses of 0 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) (Group I, to serve as a control), 29.96 mg/kg b.w. (Group II, 29.25+0.71), 89.88 mg/kg b.w. (Group III, 87.74+2.14), and 269.65 mg/kg b.w. (Group IV, 263.23+6.42) for at least 90 consecutive days. Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (Pi) contents in the bone were determined. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the tibia and femur region by dual-energy X-ray absorbsiometry. The histopathology of bone was evaluated by light microscope, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. The BMD of rats in the experimental group was significantly lower and the contents of Ca and Pi were decreased than those in the control group. The histopathological evaluation showed that co-induction of Pb and Cd results in bone microstructure damage, especially to trabecular bone, marrow cavity, collagen fiber, and osteoblast. In general, results indicate that combining Pb with Cd induces bone damage and increases the risk of osteoporosis.

The genomic sequences of FABP4 and FABP5 were 3976 and 3962 bp, respectively, which each contained four exons and three introns. Sequence alignment indicated a high degree of homology with reported FABP sequences of other mammals at both the amino acid and DNA levels. Topology prediction revealed seven protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, two N-myristoylation sites, and one cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein signature in the FABP4 protein, and three N-glycosylation sites, three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, one casein kinase II phosphorylation site, one N-myristoylation site, one amidation site, and one cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein signature in the FABP5 protein. The FABP4 and FABP5 genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and they produced the expected 16.8- and 17.0-kDa polypeptides. The results obtained in this study provide information for further in-depth research of this system, which has great value of both theoretical and practical significance.	[Song, B.; Shuai, S.

Construction and expression of a heterologous protein in Lactococcus lactis by using the nisin-controlled gene expression system: the case of the PRRSV ORF6 gene	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Lactococcus lactis; Nisin-controlled expression system; Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV); ORF6	RESPIRATORY SYNDROME; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; NORTH-AMERICAN; ACID BACTERIA; VIRUS; VACCINES; MUCOSAL; OVERPRODUCTION; OPTIMIZATION	The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV) continues to be a threat, exerting significant economic effects on the swine industry worldwide. However, none of the current commercially available vaccines can completely prevent respiratory infection, trans-placental transmission, pig-to-pig transmission of the virus, or maintain immune protection in sows. This study provides information on PRRSV and a review of available options for PRRS control strategies based on its pathogenic characteristics, immune properties, and biological characteristics. In this study, the nisin-controlled expression system of Lactococcus lactis was selected as a vector to express the ORF6 gene of PRRSV. Food-grade recombinant, L. lactis PNZ8149/NZ3900-M/PRRS, which contained the lactose operon, was successfully constructed. The molecular weight of the expressed recombinant protein was approximately 19 kDa. Furthermore, the recombinant protein was located on the surface of L. lactis and showed reactogenicity with the antibody against PRRSV. Results of this study are expected to lay a theoretical foundation for development of genetically engineered L. lactis mucosal vaccines and to provide information related to its immune activity and adjuvant effects.

Higher expression of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase genes in adipose tissues of obese compared to lean pig breeds	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Fat deposition; Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases; Fatty acid oxidation; Obese and lean pigs	LONGISSIMUS-DORSI MUSCLE; ACID BETA-OXIDATION; METABOLISM; BACKFAT	The balance between biosynthesis and oxidation of fatty acids determines adipose deposition in mammals. Obese and lean pigs show obvious differences in total adipose mass and therefore offer an attractive model for comparative studies. We found that obese Rongchang pigs, when compared with lean Landrace pigs, exhibited significantly higher mRNA levels for five genes encoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in mitochondrial fatty-acid ss-oxidation in eight different adipose tissues. These changes in gene expression were positively correlated with adipocyte volume in the eight adipose tissues. Based on these results, we hypothesize that acyl-CoA dehydrogenase genes participate in the regulation of fat mass in pigs.	[Jiang, A. -A.; Li, M. Z.; Liu, H. F.; Bai, L.; Xiao, J.; Li, X.

After acute oral administration, the LD50 value (95% CL) was 3849 mg/kg (3488.8 similar to 4247.1 mg/kg). In the subacute toxicity study, there were no significant differences in body weight and relative organ weight between the control group and 1,8-cineole treatment groups. The histopathological examinations showed that granular degeneration and vacuolar degeneration appeared in liver and kidney tissue after administration of high dose of 1,8-cineole. Under electron microscopy, a series of ultrastructural changes were observed: The electron microscopy assays indicated that the influence of 1,8-cineole on the target organ at the subcellular level were mainly on the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and other membrane type structure of liver and kidney.

Intracellular and extracellular cholesterol concentration, mRNA expression levels of genes related to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) were measured in primary goose hepatocytes. We found that the intracellular cholesterol concentration showed an uptrend manner when the TO901317 concentration was under 1 mu mol/L; compared with 1 mu mol/L TO901317, 10 mu mol/L TO901317 had an inhibiting effect (P<0.05). The regulation mode of SREBP-2 and HMGR gene expression is similar with that of intracellular cholesterol concentration. These data suggested that LXR activation may stimulate the cholesterol biosynthesis by activating expression of SREBP-2 and HMGR. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of genes related with PI3K pathway increased in the presence of TO901317, which suggested that LXR activation could promote PI3K signalling activity.

During the first week, average daily feed intake in piglets fed SDPP diet was markedly higher than piglets fed basal diet (+10%, P<0.05) and YP diet (+12%, P<0.05), but incidence of scour was higher than that in piglets fed YP diet. As a result, average daily gain (ADG) in piglets fed SDPP diet was similar to other groups, but ADG in piglets fed SDPP plus YP diet was higher than that in piglets fed basal diet (+13%, P<0.05). Serum levels of urea nitrogen and triglyceride were significantly decreased in piglets fed diet containing SDPP or YP relative to piglets fed basal diet (16 +/- 54% lower, P<0.05). Moreover, feeding YP diet markedly decreased serum levels of cortisol (relative to basal and SDPP plus YP diet, P<0.05) and C-reactive protein (relative to other groups, P<0.05) at d 7 post-weaning. Based on the results of this experiment, SDPP and partially substituting SDPP by YP are beneficial for growth performance of piglets, which may be ascribed to the improved metabolic status and humoral immune response. Moreover, weaning stress-related parameters were profoundly reduced by feeding YP diet.

In this study, in order to scale up the production of recombinant porcine Akirin2 (pAkirin2), we report the expression and purification of a His-tagged version of recombinant pAkirin2 in Escherichia coli. The pAkirin2 is a polypeptide of 203 amino acids containing 42 rare codons. The recombinant pAkirin2 was expressed as an N-terminal fusion protein with His6 tag in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) host strain. The protein was purified by Ni-IDA affinity chromatography, yielding over 90% highly purified recombinant pAkirin2, with a considerable yield of 4 mg/L. The purified recombinant pAkirin2 was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer analysis. The refolded purified recombinant pAkirin2 significantly promoted the proliferation of C2C12 cells, indicating that it was active.

Expression profiles of muscle genes in postnatal skeletal muscle in lines of chickens divergently selected for high and low body weight	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						chicken; high/low weight select; paired-box Pax transcription factor; myogenic regulatory factor	MYOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; CELL-SIZE; NUMBER; QUAIL; PAX7	Long-term genetic selection for BW has generated high weight select (HWS) and low weight select (LWS) lines of chickens. These lines show an approximate 10-fold difference in BW at selection age (d 56). The objective of this study was to profile the expression of master regulators of early lineage specification (Pax3, Pax7) and myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoD1, MyoG, and Mrf4) on day of hatch and d 7, 28, and 56 in pectoralis major and gastrocnemius muscles. There was a line x age interaction for expression of all 6 genes in both muscles. In pectoralis major muscle, Pax3, MyoD1, and Mrf4 showed greater expression in LWS than HWS at day of hatch, whereas all 6 genes showed greater expression in HWS than LWS at d 28. In gastrocnemius muscle, Pax3, Myf5, MyoD1, and MyoG showed greater expression in LWS than HWS at day of hatch, whereas Pax7, Myf5, MyoD1, and Mrf4 showed greater expression in HWS than LWS at d 28. At day of hatch there was no difference in fiber number in gastrocnemius muscle between HWS and LWS; however, HWS had greater fiber diameter than LWS. These results indicate that in LWS there is enhanced expression of genes that are necessary for proliferation of progenitor muscle cells and muscle cell differentiation at day of hatch compared with HWS, but by d 28 these genes are expressed greater in HWS than LWS. Thus, long-term selection for growth has altered the pattern of muscle gene expression.

Effect of Anatomical Characteristics and Chemical Components on Microwave-assisted Liquefaction of Bamboo Wastes	BIORESOURCES			English	Article						Bamboo; Anatomy; Chemistry; Liquefaction; Microwave	POLYHYDRIC ALCOHOLS; WOOD; FEEDSTOCKS; RESIDUES	The epidermis layer waste (ELW) and the inner layer waste (ILW) were removed from Phyllostachys pubescens bamboo, and the anatomical characteristics and chemical components of these wastes were comparatively investigated. Both the ELW and ILW were subjected to a microwave-assisted liquefaction process to evaluate the relationship between bamboo properties and liquefaction behavior. The results indicated that higher vessel and parenchyma percentages and lower cellulose and lignin contents in ILW contributed to lower residue content, while higher fiber percentage and cellulose or lignin contents in ELW resulted in higher residue content. Recondensation took place during the liquefaction of ELW, which was indicated by small granules appearing on the liquefied residue surface according to SEM images. The intense bands corresponding to hemicellulose and lignin in the FT-IR spectrum of the liquefied ELW residue gave further evidence that the liquefaction of ELW is a complex solvolysis process involving simultaneous reactions of chemical degradation and recondensation.

The fractionated bio-polyols (FBP) were obtained by the removal of lignin derivatives from the crude bio-polyols (CBP) using a simple method. Polyurethane (PU) foams were successfully prepared from both CBP and FBP. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of lignin derivatives in bio-polyols on the physical properties, thermal stability, and microstructure of PU foams. The results revealed that the PU foam made from CBP had a higher density and superior thermal stability compared to that made from FBP; however, they were also much more fragile. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicated that the lignin compounds in the CBP had impact on the structure of the PU foam.

The physicochemical properties of the TiO2/C were characterized by SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption techniques, and UV-vis absorption spectra. The nanosheets have a unique, multi-layer, cross-linked structure with holes. An enhanced absorption capacity of the TiO2/C in the range of 200-800 nm is shown, and the absorption region is extended to the near infrared region. The TiO2/C nanosheets show an amazing photocatalytic capacity, under both UV and sunlight, due to C-doping, as well as a unique morphology, structure and mixed phases of anatase and rutile, with high crystallization.

The spherical aromaticity of the icosahedral Ta-12 (2+) cluster was confirmed by a high symmetry, a short bond length, a high vibrational frequency, a large HOMO-LUMO gap and negative NICS(0) values. The icosahedral Ta-12 (2+) cluster is the first example of a bare metal cluster with a total of 58 valence electrons. The electron density topological analyses (QTAIM and ELF) indicate that three-center shared interactions exist in the icosahedral structure. The IR and absorption spectra were theoretically simulated as a convenient way to confirm the existence of the icosahedral structure in further experiments.

In this study, we sought the genetic basis that may underlie differences in susceptibility to infection among chickens by challenging four groups of broilers with Marek's disease virus (MDV). Over the course of the experiment, lesions began to appear between 21 and 35 days post challenge (dpc), and commercial broilers were not necessarily better than indigenous chickens in terms of disease resistance. The four groups showed neutral resistance to MDV infection validated by challenge results and evolutionary analysis of exons 2 and 3 of the MHC class I region. Several variable sites in exon 2 and exon 3 were exclusively appeared in infected chickens. Exon 3 was likely more crucial than exon 2 in disease resistance. Our observations offered a support for a potential association between promiscuous pathogens and conspicuous genetic diversity in the MHC class I region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EFFECTS OF MATERNAL FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RETARDATION ON EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION OF HEPATIC GENE EXPRESSION AND LIPID METABOLISM IN PIGLETS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						DNA methylation; folic acid; intrauterine growth retardation; lipid metabolism; maternal nutrition	PROTEIN RESTRICTION; DIETARY-PROTEIN; DNA METHYLATION; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; BIRTH-WEIGHT; IN-UTERO; RATS; PREGNANCY; LEPTIN; LIVER	The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal folic acid supplementation and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) on epigenetic modification of hepatic gene expression and lipid metabolism in weanling piglets. Thirty-two primiparous sows were randomly divided into two dietary groups: control group (C, 1.3 mg/kg folic acid) and folic acid supplemented group (FS, 30 mg/kg folic acid) during gestation. Blood and liver samples of piglets were collected at d 28 postnatal. Intrauterine growth retardation pigs had lower plasma triglyceride, liver triglyceride and total fat than that of normal birth weight (NBW) pigs. Although plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) was higher for NBW piglets, the birth weight effect was negated in IUGR piglets born to sows fed a FS diet. Hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) and Acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) activities were lower and higher in IUGR piglets, respectively. Methylation status of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) promoter was lower in IUGR pigs from sows fed a control diet than other groups. Folic acid supplementation reduced the promoter methylation status of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The mRNA expressions of PPAR alpha, AOX, FAS, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and leptin were differentially affected by birth weight. However, mRNA expression of PPAR alpha and FAS in IUGR pigs from sows fed a FS diet was not different from that of NBW pigs. Expression of GR was higher in pigs from mothers fed a FS diet than their counterpart. The present study demonstrated that IUGR changed lipid metabolism and mRNA expression of genes related to this process, and maternal folic acid supplementation was an effective way to prevent the changes by regulating DNA methylation of promoter.

Plasma concentrations of EF and its active metabolite, ciprofloxacin, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence method. Plasma concentrations versus time were analyzed by non-compartmental method. The elimination half-life and area under drug concentration-time curve from zero to infinity of EF after i.v. administration were 3.32 +/- 0.43 h and 45.73 +/- 5.74 mg/L.h, respectively. After p.o. administration, EF was absorbed fast and the maximum plasma concentration of 3.86 +/- 0.36 mg/L reached at 2.14 +/- 1.10 h. The concentration-time profile of EF showed a double peak-shaped curve, indicating the possibility of enterohepatic recirculation of EF in geese. The bioavailability for EF after p.o. administration was 78.09 +/- 25.76%. Seldom ciprofloxacin was detected in the plasma both after i.v. and p.o. administrations, indicating low transformation rate from EF to ciprofloxacin in geese. Taking into account the efficacy indices obtained, a single p.o. dose of 20 mg/kg of EF would be adequate for treating infections caused by highly susceptible bacteria in geese.

Yet, polyploids must overcome the meiotic challenge of pairing, recombining, and segregating more than two sets of chromosomes. Using genomic sequencing of synthetic and natural allopolyploids of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, we determined that dosage variation and chromosomal translocations consistent with homoeologous pairing were more frequent in the synthetic allopolyploids. To test the role of structural chromosomal differentiation versus genetic regulation of meiotic pairing, we performed sequenced-based, high-density genetic mapping in F2 hybrids between synthetic and natural lines. This F2 population displayed frequent dosage variation and deleterious homoeologous recombination. The genetic map derived from this population provided no indication of structural evolution of the genome of the natural allopolyploid Arabidopsis suecica, compared with its predicted parents. The F2 population displayed variation in meiotic regularity and pollen viability that correlated with a single quantitative trait locus, which we named BOY NAMED SUE, and whose beneficial allele was contributed by A. suecica. This demonstrates that an additive, gain-of-function allele contributes to meiotic stability and fertility in a recently established allopolyploid and provides an Arabidopsis system to decipher evolutionary and molecular mechanisms of meiotic regularity in polyploids.

Cloning and sequence analysis of the safflower betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase; Phylogenetic analysis; Safflower; Secondary structure; Subcellular localization	SALT TOLERANCE; PLANTS; GLYCINEBETAINE; PROTEIN; ACCUMULATION; PEROXISOMES; SPINACH; BARLEY; BADH; RICE	In response to salinity or drought stress, many plants accumulate glycine betaine, which is a regulator of osmosis. In plants, the last step in betaine synthesis is catalyzed by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic enzyme. Based on the conserved oligo amino acid residues of the published BADH genes from other higher plant species, a cDNA sequence, designated CtBADH, was isolated from safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) using a polymerase chain reaction approach. The clones were 1.7 kb on average, and contained an open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 503 amino acids with 84.5% identity to that of Helianthus annuus. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a decapeptide, Val-Thr-Leu-Geu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Lys-Ser-Pro and Cys, which is essential for proper functioning of BADH. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CtBADH grouped with other dicotyledonous plant BADH genes, and subgrouped in the composite family. Prediction of secondary structure and subcellular localization suggested that the protein encoded by CtBADH contains 33 coils, 15 alpha helixes, and 21 beta strands, and most likely targets the chloroplast or mitochondria.

CN19 and Aegilops biuncialis was created and reported. 12-5-2 was immune to both powdery mildew and stripe rust and has stable fertility. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and C-banding revealed that 12-5-2 was a 1U(b) disomic addition line (ADL1U(b)). The seed storage protein electrophoresis showed that 12-5-2 presented all high molecular weight glutenin subunits (7 + 8 and 2 + 12) of CN19 and 2 new subunits that were designated Ux and Uy. Additionally, the flour quality parameters showed that the protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, wet gluten content, and grain hardness of 12-5-2 were significantly higher than those of its parent CN19. Moreover, 5 pairs of the chromosome 1U(b)-specific polymerase chain reaction-based landmark unique gene markers, TNAC1021, TNAC1041, TNAC1071, TNAC1-01, and TNAC1-04, were also obtained.

'Mianyang11') x rye (Secale cereale L. 'Kustro'), and some progeny were obtained by the backcrossing of triticale with 'Mianyang11' followed by self-fertilization. In situ hybridization using rye genomic DNA and repetitive sequences pAs1 and pSc119.2 as probes was used to analyze the mitotic chromosomes of these progeny. Three wheat-rye 1R monosomic addition lines and a wheat line (12FT-1685) containing a 1R and a 1BL.1RS translocation chromosome were identified. Abnormal mitosis was observed in the two lines. During mitosis of a 1R monosomic addition line (3-8-20-1R-2), lagging chromosomes, micronuclei, chromosomal bridges, and the one pole segregation of 1R chromosome were observed. Abnormal mitotic behaviour of chromosomes was also observed in some of the self-progeny plants of lines 12FT-1685 and 3-8-20-1R-2. These progeny contained 1R chromosome or 1R chromosome arm. In addition, 4B chromosomes were absent from one of the progeny of 3-8-20-1R-2. This abnormal mitotic behaviour of chromosomes was not observed in two other 1R monosomic addition lines. These results indicate that a single 1R chromosome added to wheat might cause abnormal mitotic behaviour of both wheat and rye chromosomes and different genetic variations might occurr among the sibling 1R monosomic addition lines.

Analyses showed that there was abundant genetic diversity in all species. In the quantitative characters, shattering habit had the highest phenotypic coefficient of variation (140.42%), and wheel layers had the lowest one (17.31%). In qualitative characters, color of glumelle had the highest genetic diversity index (H=1.3), while grain color had the lowest one (H=0.41). Correlation analysis of quantitative characters showed that the plant height (PH) and grain number per panicle (GNP) were the main factors which can increase yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that 89.3% of the total variation of quantitative characters could be explained by the first five components. Comprehensive evaluation of agronomic characters revealed that several accessions, including accessions CN 25766 and CN 25787 (A. hispanica), PI 545459 (A. fatua), CN 21703 (A. hirtula), Ciav 8330 (A. maroccana), PI 636073 and CN 64226 (A. sativa) were to be promising parents in high grain yield and lodging resistance breeding. Based on agronomic characters, diploid species A. lustanica and A. wiestii were different from other diploid As genome species. A. Murphyi was closest to hexaploids in the three AACC tetraploid.

It has been recently reported that the ppGpp level is also inducible by various stresses in the chloroplasts of plant cells. However, the function of the Obg SpoT interaction in plants remains elusive. The results from the present and previous studies suggest that AtRSH1 is a putative bacterial SpoT homolog in Arabidopsis and that its transcription levels are responsive to wounding and salt stresses. In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid analysis to map the regions required for the AtObgC-AtRSH1 interaction. Moreover, protein protein docking simulations revealed reasonable geometric and electrostatic complementarity in the binding surfaces of the two proteins. The data support our experimental results, which suggest that the conserved domains in AtObgC and the N terminus of AtRSH1 containing the TGS domain contribute to their interaction. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that the expression of AtObgC and AtRSH1 exhibit a similar inhibition pattern under wounding and salt-stress conditions, but the inhibition pattern was not greatly influenced by the presence or absence of light. Based on in vivo analyses, we further confirmed that the AtRSH1 and AtObgC proteins similarly localize in chloroplasts. Based on these results, we propose that the AtObgC AtRSH1 interaction plays a vital role in ppGpp-mediated stress responses in chloroplasts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that Pax3 would function in myoblast proliferation and differentiation; therefore, we employed three short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (shRNA1, shRNA2, and shRNA3) that target Pax3 to characterize the function of Pax3 in duck myoblast development. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Pax3 in duck myoblasts were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT and BrdU assays, while cell differentiation was assayed using immunofluorescence labeling with a MyoG antibody. Additionally, folic acid (FA), which is a rescue tool, was added into the medium of duck myoblasts to indirectly examine the function of Pax3 on duck myoblast proliferation and differentiation. The results revealed that one of the shRNA vectors, shRNA1, could significantly and stably reduce the expression of Pax3 (P < 0.05). Silencing Pax3 by shRNA1 significantly reduced the proliferation and differentiation of duck myoblasts (P < 0.05) due to downregulated expression of myogenic regulator factors. These trends could be rescued by adding FA; and Pax7, a paralog gene of Pax3, was involved in those processes. Overall, Pax3 had a positive function in duck myoblast proliferation and differentiation by modulating the expression of myogenic regulation factors, and shRNA targeting of Pax3 might be a new approach for understanding the function of Pax3 in the development of diverse tissues.

We detected 19 haplotypes, which formed a distinct clade with the standard sheep strain (G1). Hence, all 51 isolates were identified as E. granulosus sensu stricto (G1-G3). Genetic relationships among haplotypes were not associated with geographical divisions, and fixation indices (Fst) among sampling localities were low. Hence, regional populations of E. granulosus in the southwest China are not differentiated, as gene flow among them remains high. This information is important for formulating unified region-wide prevention and control measures. We found large negative Fu's Fs and Tajima's D values and a unimodal mismatch distribution, indicating that the population has undergone a demographic expansion. We observed high genetic diversity among the E. granulosus s. s. isolates, indicating that the parasite population in this important bioregion is genetically robust and likely to survive and spread. The data from this study will prove valuable for future studies focusing on improving diagnosis and prevention methods and developing robust control strategies.

Due to its short half-life, the main aim for this pharmacokinetic study is to investigate a newly developed PEG-rHuEPO with large molecular weight in SD rats. After a single intramuscular administration of different doses of 125I-PEG-rHuEPO, pharmacokinetic parameters, tissue distribution, and excretion were analyzed. In in vivo half-life time measured after 125I-PEG-rHuEPO administration at the doses of 1, 2, and 3 mu g/kg, t1/2 alpha was 1.90, 1.19, and 2.50 hours, respectively, whereas t1/2 beta was 22.37, 26.21, and 20.92 hours, respectively; at 8, 24, and 48 hours after intramuscular administration, PEG-rHuEPO was distributed to all of the examined tissues, however, with high concentrations of radioactivity, only in plasma, blood, muscle at the administration site, and bone marrow. Following a 2 mu g/kg single intramuscular administration, approximately 21% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered after almost seven days of study. Urine was the major route of excretion; 20% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine, while excretion in the feces was less than 1.4%. Therefore, this PEG-rHuEPO has potential to be clinically used and could reduce frequency of injection.

Four novel gamma-gliadin genes (Gli-ng1 to Gli-ng4) were cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum) and Aegilops species. The novel gamma-gliadins were much smaller in molecular size when compared to the typical gamma-gliadins, which was caused by deletion of the non-repetitive domain, glutamine-rich region, 3' part of the repetitive domain, and 5' part of the C-terminal, possibly due to illegitimate recombination between the repetitive domain and the C-terminal. As a result, Gli-ng1 and Gli-ng4 only contained two and three cysteine residues, respectively. Gli-ng1, as the representative of novel gamma-gliadin genes, has been sub-cloned into an Escherichia colt expression system. SDS-PAGE indicated that the both cysteine residues of Gli-ng1 could participate in the formation of intermolecular disulphide bonds in vitro. Successful cloning of Gli-ng1 from seed cDNA of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring suggested that these novel gamma-gliadin genes were normally transcribed during the development of seeds. Phylogenic analysis indicated that the four novel gamma-gliadin genes had a closer relationship with those from the B (S) genome of wheat.

A fuzzy random multiobjective bilevel programming model is formulated with the objectives of the retrofit costs and the benefits on two separate levels. After establishing the model, a fuzzy random variable transformation approach and fuzzy variable approximation decomposition are used to deal with the uncertainty. An approximation decomposition-based multi-objective AGLNPSO is developed to solve the model. The results of a case study validate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of XQT on Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC)-infected chickens. The chickens were pretreated with XQT 12 h before being inoculated with 108 colony forming unit (CFU) of APEC by subcutaneous injection, and then the mortality and the indexes of health status of chicken in each group were detected. The results showed that high dosage and middle dosage of XQT could significantly decrease the mortality of the chickens challenged with APEC. We further found that XQT improved the infected chickens' health status through improving the water consumption, feed intake, bodyweight gain, routine blood parameters and decreasing the incidences of pericarditis and perihepatitis. The results of present study suggest that XQT can effectively treat chicken colibacillosis as a potential agent. (C) 2013 PVJ.

Currently, biomass densification is regarded as an acceptable solution to this issue. Herein, briquettes, pellets and their corresponding undensified biomass were pretreated by diluted-NaOH and hydrothermal method to investigate the responses of biomass densification to these typical water-involved pretreatments and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The densified biomass auto-swelling was initially investigated before pretreatment. Results indicated pellets could be totally auto-swollen in an hour, while it took about 24 h for briquettes. When diluted-NaOH pretreatment was performed, biomass briquetting and pelleting improved sugar conversion rate by 20.1% and 5.5% comparing with their corresponding undensified biomass. Pelleting improved sugar conversion rate by 7.0% after hydrothermal pretreatment comparing with the undensified biomass. However, briquetting disturbed hydrothermal pretreatment resulting in the decrease of sugar conversion rate by 15.0%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study aims to investigate the variation of Cd uptake and translocation among rice lines and to screen cadmium-safe cultivars (CSCs). Total of 146 rice lines were grown in artificially Cd pollution hydroponics within 30 day followed by a pot culture in which 17 rice lines were planted and treated with different Cd levels until maturity. The results showed that Cd tolerance and Cd accumulation significantly (p < 0.05) varied among 146 rice lines in the hydroponics experiment as well as among the 17 rice lines in the followed pot culture. Cd contents of brown rice significantly correlated with Cd accumulations in plant and their translocation from vegetative organs to edible parts, implying that extremely attention should paid to Cd translocation and its influence factors for CSCs selection. IRBN95-90 and D26B of maintainer lines and Lu5278-I332, Lu17-T21712, Lu17-I2R60 of restorer lines were detected to be potential CSCs under 2 and 10 mg kg(-1) Cd level, which confirmed the feasibility of selection of CSCs from rice lines. Therefore, the study confirmed the variations of Cd uptake and translocation among rice lines and a combinatorial and recursive selection process is feasible and affordable to screen CSCs to reduce Cd risk for rice consumption.

To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with waterlogging tolerance at early stages of growth, survival rate (SR), germination rate index (GRI), leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI), root length index (RLI), plant height index (PHI), root dry weight index (RDWI), shoot dry weight index (SDWI), and total dry weight index (DWI) were assessed using the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) population W7984/Opata85. Significant and positive correlations were detected for all traits in this population except RLI. A total of 32 QTLs were associated with waterlogging tolerance on all chromosomes except 3A, 3D, 4B, 5A, 5D, 6A, and 6D. Some of the QTLs explained large proportions of the phenotypic variance. One of these is the QTL for GRI on 7A, which explained 23.92% of the phenotypic variation. Of them, 22 alleles from the synthetic hexaploid wheat W7984 contributed positively. These results suggested that synthetic hexaploid wheat W7984 is an important genetic resource for waterlogging tolerance in wheat. These alleles conferring waterlogging tolerance at early stages of growth in wheat could be utilized in wheat breeding for improving waterlogging tolerance.

We isolated twelve bacterial strains showing different degrees of phosphate solubilizing activity from maize rhizosphere. Four isolates solubilized over 300 mu g mL(-1) phosphate from insoluble Ca-3(PO4)2, with isolate SCAUK0330 solubilizing over 450 mu g mL(-1). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis SCAUK0330 was identified as Burkholderia cepacia. SCAUK0330 grew at 10-40 degrees C and pH 4.0-10.0, tolerated up to 5% NaCl, and showed antagonism against nine pathogenic fungi. SCAUK0330 promoted the growth of both healthy and Helminthosporium maydis infected maize plants, indicating that the isolate was a good candidate to be applied as a biofertilizer and a biocontrol agent under a wide range of environmental conditions. The expression of a single SCAUK0330 gene gave E. colt a pH decrease linked ability to solubilize phosphate. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of this phosphate solubilization linked gene showed high degree of sequence identity with B. cepacia E37gabY. The production of gluconic acid is considered as the principle mechanism for phosphate solubilization. In agreement with the proposed periplasmic location of the gluconic acid production, the predicted signal peptide and transmembrane regions implied that GabY is membrane bound.

The cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted at 48 h post infection. Then the mRNAs were purified and reverse transcribed to first-strand cDNAs using oligo (dT) primers (CDS III). Subsequently, long distance-PCR was performed, the double-stranded cDNAs were purified, and a transformation assay was carried out in that order. Eventually, a high qualitative library was successfully established according to an evaluation on quality. The transformation efficiency was about 2.33 x 10(6) transformants/4.34 mu g pGADT7-Rec (> 1.0 x 10(6)). The cell density of the library was 1.75 x 10(9) cells/mL (> 2x10(7) cells/mL). The titer of the primary cDNA library and amplified cDNA library was 6.75 x 10(5) and 2.33 x 10(7) CFU/mL respectively. The numbers for the primary cDNA library and amplified cDNA library were 1.01 x 10(7) and 1.14 x 10(9), respectively, and the recombinant rate was 97.14 %. The sequence results of 27 randomly picked independent clones revealed the insert ranged from 0.323 to 2.017 kb with an average insert size of 0.807 kb. Full-length transcripts of DEV-CHv LORF3, UL26 and UL35 genes were acquired through sequence similarity analysis from the non-redundant nucleic acid or protein database. Five polyA sites were identified in the DEV-CHv genome. Also, a new transcript of 668 bp was found between the IRS gene and US1 gene of the DEV-CHv genome. Thus, we concluded that the constructed cDNA library will be a useful tool in proteomic analysis of interactions between the DEV and host DEFs, and discovery of biomarkers studies on the mechanism of DEV and subsequently exploitation original vaccines and antiviral drugs to prevent or cure diseases.

However, different spatial patterns of maize and soybean can directly affect the light environment of soybean growth under this system through the combined effects of the altered light quality and the reduced light quanta. This work aimed to investigate the differences in the light environment of the soybean canopy in terms of the red:far-red (R/FR) ratio and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as the different rates of soybean seedling growth under maize-soybean relay strip intercropping and soybean sole planting, to analyze the relationship between the morphological characteristics and the light environment, and to assess the relative contributions of the R/FR ratio and PAR transmittance to soybean seedling growth in intercropping conditions. Field experiments were performed in 2011-2013. The intercropping patterns involved the wide-narrow row planting of alternating maize and soybean. The light environment of the soybean canopy and the morphology of the soybean seedlings were estimated in the relay strip intercropping system by changing the distances of the maize and soybean rows as well as the number of maize vs. soybean rows per strip. These parameters of the intercropping system were compared with those of the soybean monocultures. Furthermore, the relationship between the light environment of the soybean canopy and its morphological parameters were analyzed using correlation analysis. Incident light in maize-soybean relay strip intercropping systems was partly reflected and absorbed by maize leaves. Thus, the spectral irradiance, R/FR ratio, and PAR of the soybean canopy were decreased with maize-soybean intercropping as compared to soybean monocropping. Simultaneously, the stem diameter, root length, aboveground biomass, total root biomass, and root-shoot ratio of relay intercropped soybean were reduced significantly, while its seedling height was increased. The correlation relationship between morphological parameters of soybean and the light environment (R/FR ratio and PAR transmittance) in different planting pattern were significant (P < 0.05). Compared to PAR transmittance, the R/FR ratio of the relay intercropped soybean canopy was strongly correlated with morphological parameters of soybean seedling (P < 0.01), and the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.88. The response of soybean seedlings to shading by maize was not solely influenced by the PAR or the R/FR ratio. It may be the summed effects of both parameters under relay strip intercropping systems. Therefore, the results reveal the physiological response mechanisms of soybean seedlings to changes in the quality and amount of light, which may support the building three-dimensional growth model of the responses of plant to light quantity and quality, and guide the identification of suitable population planting patterns in the intercropping system in the future.

Crantz) in ruminant nutrition and to use molecular spectroscopy as a novel technique to quantify the heat-induced changes in protein molecular structures in relation to protein digestive behavior in the rumen and intestine of dairy cattle. In this study, camelina seeds were used as a model for feed protein. The seeds were kept as raw (control) or heated in an autoclave (moist heating) or in an air-draft oven (dry heating) at 120 degrees C for 60 min. The parameters evaluated were (1) chemical profiles, (2) Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System protein subfractions, (3) nutrient digestibilities and estimated energy values, (4) in situ rumen degradation and intestinal digestibility, and (5) protein molecular structures. Compared with raw seeds, moist heating markedly decreased (52.73 to 20.41%) the content of soluble protein and increased (2.00 to 9.01%) the content of neutral detergent insoluble protein in total crude protein (CP). Subsequently, the rapidly degradable Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System CP fraction markedly decreased (45.06 to 16.69% CP), with a concomitant increase in the intermediately degradable (45.28 to 74.02% CP) and slowly degradable (1.13 to 8.02% CP) fractions, demonstrating a decrease in overall protein degradability in the rumen. The in situ rumen incubation study revealed that moist heating decreased (75.45 to 57.92%) rumen-degradable protein and increased (43.90 to 82.95%) intestinal digestibility of rumen-undegradable protein. The molecular spectroscopy study revealed that moist heating increased the amide I-to-amide II ratio and decreased alpha-helix and alpha-helix-to-beta-sheet ratio. In contrast, dry heating did not significantly change CP solubility, rumen degradability, intestinal digestibility, and protein molecular structures compared with the raw seeds. Our results indicated that, compared with dry heating, moist heating markedly changed protein chemical profiles, protein subfractions, rumen protein degradability, and intestinal digestibility, which were associated with changes in protein molecular structures (amide I-to-amid II ratio and alpha-helix-to-beta-sheet ratio). Moist heating improved the nutritive value and utilization of protein in camelina seeds compared with dry heating.

MH II-DAB gene expression in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes) after infection with the ciliate parasite, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES			English	Article						DAB gene; gene expression; grass carp; Ichthyophthirius multifiliis; major histocompability; real-time quantitative PCR	COMPLEX CLASS-II; CYPRINUS-CARPIO; COMMON CARP; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; RAINBOW-TROUT; DISEASE RESISTANCE; BARBUS-INTERMEDIUS; B-GENES; L.; POLYMORPHISM	The grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes), is one of the most extensively aquacultured freshwater fish in China. However, because of the lack of effective control measures and the high-density culture environment, considerable economic losses are caused by infection of C. idella with the parasitic ciliate, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. The major histocompatibility (MH) DAB gene belongs to antigen-presented genes in the class II genomic region, which is associated with parasite resistance. To understand the relationship of the DAB gene with I. multifiliis infection in grass carp, the expression profiles of MH II-DAB were studied in tissues using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that expression of the MH II-DAB gene was up-regulated in head kidney after I. multifiliis infection, and the expression peak appeared earlier in the study (case) group than in the control group. The obvious up-regulation peak of MH II-DAB gene was found at days 2 and 4 in skin; at 12h to day 4 in spleen; at 12h and days 1 and 6 in gill; and at day 10 in blood, whereas the MH II-DAB gene was down-regulated in liver and intestines after I. multifiliis infection. These results have implications for better understanding C. idella resistance to I. multifiliis infection.	[Yu, H.; Wang, Z. B.; Lu, Y.

Thus, it is important to reveal the mechanism of plants coping with heat stress. In this study, a novel gene that we identified from Brassica napus, referred to as BnTR1, was found to play a key role in heat stress response in planta. BnTR1 is a membrane-bound RINGv (C4HC3) protein that displays E3 ligase activity in vitro. We demonstrated that modest expression of BnTR1 is sufficient to minimize adverse environmental influence and confers thermal resistance on development without any detrimental effects in B.napus and Oryza sativa. Our investigation into the action mechanism indicates that BnTR1 is likely to be involved in mediating Ca2+ dynamics by regulating the activity of calcium channels, which further alters the transcripts of heat shock factors and heat shock proteins contributing to plant thermotolerance. Hence, our study identified BnTR1 as a novel key factor underlying a conserved mechanism conferring thermal resistance in plants.

It is documented that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) play significant roles in attenuating saturated fatty acids (SFA)-induced inflammation. This study was therefore conducted to determine whether mammary inflammation could be affected by consumption of diets rich in n-3 PUFA. Methods: Forty-eight rats after mating began to receive diets supplemented with 5% fish oil (FO) or 7% soybean oil (SO). Blood and mammary tissue samples (n = 6) at day 0 and 14 of gestation and day 3 postpartum were collected 9 hours after intramammary infusion of saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to determine free fatty acids (FFA) concentration and FA composition in plasma and inflammation mediators in mammary tissues. Results: At day 14 of gestation and day 3 postpartum, the FO-fed rats had lower plasma concentrations of C18: 2n6, C20: 4n6, total n-6 PUFA and SFA, and higher plasma concentrations of C20: 5n3 and total n-3 PUFA than the SO-fed rats. Plasma C22: 6n3 concentration was also higher in the FO-fed than in the SO-fed rats at day 3 postpartum. Compared with the SO-fed rats, the FO-fed rats had lower mammary mRNA abundance of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and protein level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but had higher mammary mRNA abundances of interleukin (IL)-10 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma at day 14 of gestation. Following LPS infusion at day 3 postpartum, the SO-fed rats had increased plasma concentrations of FFA, C18: 1n9, C18: 3n3, C18: 2n6 and total n-6 PUFA, higher mammary mRNA abundances of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and XOR but lower mammary mRNA abundance of IL-10 than the FO-fed rats. Conclusions: Mammary inflammation around parturition appeared to be attenuated by consumption of a diet rich in n-3 PUFA, which was associated with up-regulated expression of IL-10 and PPAR-gamma.

The experimental solubility data was correlated by the modified Apelblat equation, the General Single model and the Hybrid model. The results show that: the mole solubility of florfenicol in binary 1,2-propanediol + water mixtures increased with increasing temperature and the mole fraction of 1,2-propanediol in the binary solvent system; the values of the solubility calculated by the three models show good agreement with the experimental value; the OMPD from the modified Apelblat equation, the General Single model and the Hybrid model are 2.48, 2.07 and 5.12, respectively. However, compared to the modified Apelblat equation and the Hybrid model, the General Single model can give more accuracy and reliability of the solubility data. In addition, the discussion of the enthalpy and the entropy for florfenicol in different cosolvents indicated that the dissolution process of florfenicol was endothermic and entropy-driven.

However, the roles of the chrysanthemum vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter genes in salt stress response remain obscure. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene DgNHX1 from chrysanthemum. The DgNHX1 sequence contained 1920 bp with a complete open reading frame of 1533 bp encoding a putative protein of 510 amino acids with a predicted protein molecular weight of 56.3 kDa. DgNHX1 was predicted containing nine transmembrane domains. Its expression in the chrysanthemum was upregulated by salt stress, but not by abscisic acid (ABA). To assess roles of DgNHX1 in plant salt stress responses, we performed gain-of-function experiment. The DgNHX1-overexpression tobacco plants showed significant salt tolerance than the wild type (WT). The transgenic lines exhibited more accumulation of Na+ and K+ under salt stress. These findings suggest that DgNHX1 plays a positive regulatory role in salt stress response.

Moreover, gene expression of myozenin is closely related to meat quality. To further understand the functions and effects of myozenin2 (MYOZ2) and myozenin3 (MYOZ3) genes in goat, we cloned them from Tianfu goat longissimus dorsi muscle. Sequence analyses revealed that full-length coding sequence of MYOZ2 consisted of 795 bp and encoded 264 amino acids, and full-length coding sequence of MYOZ3 consisted of 735 bp and encoded 244 amino acids. RT-qPCR analyses revealed that mRNA expressions of MYOZ2 and MYOZ3 were detected in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, leg muscle, abdominal muscle, and longissimus dorsi muscle. Particularly high expression levels of MYOZ2 were seen in abdominal muscle and heart (P<0.01), low expression levels were seen in leg muscle (P<0.01), longissimus dorsi muscle (P>0.05) and very little expression were detected in liver, spleen, lung and kidney (P>0.05). In addition, high expression levels of MYOZ3 were seen in abdominal muscle, leg muscle, lungs and kidney (P<0.01), low expression levels were found in longissimus dorsi muscle and spleen (P<0.01) and very little expression were detected in heart and liver (P>0.05). Temporal mRNA expression results showed that MYOZ2 and MYOZ3 gene expression varied across four muscle tissues with different ages of the goats. Western blotting further revealed that MYOZ2 and MYOZ3 proteins were only expressed in goat muscle, with notable temporal expression differences in specialized muscle tissues from five development age stages. This work provides the first evidence that MYOZ2 and MYOZ3 genes are expressed abundantly in Tianfu goat muscle tissues from different development age stages, and lay a foundation for understanding the functions of MYOZ2 and MYOZ3 genes in muscle fiber differentiation.

Despite the veterinary and health importance of the Ascaridida species, little or no attention has been paid to roundworms infecting wild animals including non-human primates due to the current taxon sampling and survey bias in this order. Importantly, there has been considerable controversy over the years as to whether Ascaris species infecting non-human primates are the same as or distinct from Ascaris lumbricoides infecting humans. Herein, we first characterized the complete mitochondrial genomes of two representative Ascaris isolates derived from two non-human primates, namely, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gibbons (Hylobates hoolock), in a zoological garden of southwest China and compared them with those of A. lumbricoides and the congeneric Ascaris suum as well as other related species in the same order, and then used comparative mitogenomics, genome-wide nucleotide sequence identity analysis, and phylogeny to determine whether the parasites from chimpanzees and gibbons represent a single species and share genetic similarity with A. lumbricoides. Taken together, our results yielded strong statistical support for the hypothesis that the chimpanzee-and gibbon-derived Ascaris represent a single species that is genetically similar to A. lumbricoides, consistent with the results of previous morphological and molecular studies. Our finding should enhance public alertness to roundworms originating from chimpanzees and gibbons and the mtDNA data presented here also serves to enrich the resource of markers that can be used in molecular diagnostic, systematic, population genetic, and evolutionary biological studies of parasitic nematodes from either wild or domestic hosts.

However, due to the shading from maize, soybean plants are thin and have a poor root system. Uniconazole is a plant-growth retardant that could enhance root vigor; increase root length, root volume, and root dry weight; and affect nitrogen (N) metabolism. To understand the effects of uniconazole on the root growth and N-transfer metabolism of soybean seedlings under relay strip intercropping, the changes in some morphological characteristics of root, dry-matter weight, root vigor, nitrate (NO3-)-N, ammonium (NH4+)-N, and amino acid of xylem sap after seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2, 4, and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) were investigated. Main root length, total lateral root lengths, first lateral root numbers, root nodule numbers, root vigor together with bleeding sap, bleeding sap-top ratio, root dry weight, and root/shoot ratio were increased, indicating uniconazole improved soybean root system in relay strip intercropping. Uniconazole powder treatment could increase NO3 (-)-N, NH4+-N, and total amino acid of xylem sap, to increase the potential of leaf and root N reduction and assimilation, and increase of leaf and root N contents. Thus, results suggested that uniconazole treatment can improve root growth and N transfer mechanism of soybean to support its further growth.

To date, there is no fast detection method to identify early infections in rabbits. In the present study, a new dot-ELISA-based on an endogenous antigen fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) was developed for the detection of cysticercosis, and its potential was then evaluated using test serum samples. Immunolocalisation showed that T. pisiformis FABP (TpFABP) localised to the parenchyma of the bladder wall of the cysticercus and perinuclear cytoplasm of parenchyma of the adult parasite. After cloning and expression, recombinant TpFABP (rTpFABP) protein was used for serodiagnosis of T. pisiformis infection in rabbits by dot-ELISA. The antibody was detected 14 days post-infection in rabbits experimentally infected with T. pisiformis. Based on the necropsy results, the sensitivity and specificity of 169 serum samples tested by rTpFABP dot-ELISA were found to be 98.2% (54/55) and 92.1% (105/114), respectively. These data suggest that the dot-ELISA developed in this study has potential for detection of T. pisiformis infection in rabbits.

In this study, MC4R was characterized in S. prenanti (Schizothorax prenanti) and designated as SpMC4R SpMC4R cDNA is composed of 1004 nucleotides with a 978 nucleotide open reading frame encoding a protein of 326 amino acids. The SpMC4R contained predicted regions that were structural features of MCR subtypes of vertebrates. In addition, phylogenetic analyses suggested that S. prenanti MC4R was closely related to fish MC4Rs. The SpMC4R mRNA was detected in embryos at developmental stages. Further, its mRNA was detectable in unfertilized eggs. Using real-time RT-PCR, MC4R is widely expressed, with highest levels of expression in brain and ovary. An experiment was conducted to determine the expression profile of MC4R during short-term and long-term fasting of the brain. The expression level of MC4R in unfed fish was significantly increased at 6, 9 and 24 h post-fasting (hpf) and 14 days fasting than in fed fish, this suggests that MC4R is conserved peptide that might be involved in the regulation of food intake and other physiological function in S. prenanti.

Paraquat resistance in stay-green wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated. Two cultivars, CN12 and CN17, were found to have a higher photo-oxidative resistance than that of common wheat MY 11, as measured with antioxidant indexes and chlorophyll a fluorescence. The flag leaves of both CN12 and CN17 maintained a relatively high antioxidant enzyme activity, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic index and a low level of lipid degradation after 24 h of treatment with 10 mu M paraquat. The Stay-green wheat cultivars CN12 and CN17 had a high resistance to paraquat-induced photo-oxidative stress, which can potentially alleviate some of the damage induced by environment pollution.

Numbers or percentages of apoptotic splenocytes by flow cytometry (FCM) and TUNEL were higher (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups than those in the control group. Results measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA showed that mRNA expression and contents were significantly higher (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in Bax and Caspase-3, and were significantly lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in Bcl-2 of the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups. Also, the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities, and the ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical, and GSH contents were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and MDA contents were increased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in all groups. In conclusion, dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused apoptosis, altered Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 mRNA expression levels and contents, and induced oxidative stress in the spleen. Also, splenocyte apoptosis was closely related to the alternations of Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 mRNA expression, and oxidative damage. The splenic immunity and blood filtration functions were impaired in broilers.

In recent years, knowledge about the proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression that occurs in lung and lymph node of the APP-infected swine has been advanced. However, systematic gene expression profiles on hilar nodes from pigs after infection with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae have not yet been reported. The transcriptional responses were studied in hilar nodes (HN) from swine experimentally infected with APP and the control groupusing Agilent Porcine Genechip, including 43,603 probe sets. 9,517 transcripts were identified as differentially expressed (DE) at the p 0.01 level by comparing the log2 (normalized signal) of the two groups named treatment group (TG) and controls (CG). Eight hundred and fifteen of these DE transcripts were annotated as pig genes in the GenBank database (DB). Two hundred and seventy-two biological process categories (BP), 75 cellular components and 171 molecular functions were substantially altered in the TG compared to CG. Many BP were involved in host immune responses (i.e., signaling, signal transmission, signal transduction, response to stimulus, oxidation reduction, response to stress, immune system process, signaling pathway, immune response, cell surface receptor linked signaling pathway). Seven DE gene pathways (VEGF signaling pathway, Long-term potentiation, Ribosome, Asthma, Allograft rejection, Type I diabetes mellitus and Cardiac muscle contraction) and statistically significant associations with host responses were affected. Many cytokines (including NRAS, PI3K, MAPK14, CaM, HSP27, protein phosphatase 3, catalytic subunit and alpha isoform), mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting survival and vascular permeability, were activated in TG, whilst many immunomodulatory cytokines were suppressed. The significant changes in the expression patterns of the genes, GO terms, and pathways, led to a decrease of antigenic peptides with antigen presenting cells presented to T lymphocytes via the major histocompatibility complex, and alleviated immune response induced APP of HN. The immune response ability of HN in the APP-infected pigs was weakened; however, cell proliferation and migration ability was enhanced.

Recently, habitat destruction and degradation are major threats to this species. To assess the genetic diversity and population structure with this species, we determined the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and tRNA-Phe gene in 13 individuals from two sites in Yunnan, and reanalyzed 58 published samples from 12 sties in Yunnan and Guizhou. Nineteen variable sites were observed and 28 haplotypes were identified. Haplotype diversity was high (0.9364) and nucleotide diversity among all haplotypes was relatively low (0.00219). Bayesian tree and a median-joining network revealed no significant phylogeographic structure. Both the bell-shaped pairwise mismatch distribution and significant negative values of Fu's F-S suggested that red-tail knobby newt have experienced a recent population expansion. Base on the results of this study, several conservation recommendations on this vulnerable species are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have demonstrated that incubation temperature changes could influence muscle development and body weight, which subsequently determine the adult phenotype. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the development of immune organs in ducklings could be influenced by thermal manipulation during the middle stage of incubation. To evaluate this hypothesis, a control group was incubated under a normal temperature from Ell to E24, while the incubation temperature of the experimental group was increased by 1 C. Our results indicated that slight changes in the incubation temperature significantly repressed the bursa of Fabricius index of the duck embryo on E25 (F1, 58=122.51, P <0.0001) and significantly repressed the spleen index of neonatal ducklings (F1, 58=74.38, P <0.0001). At 0 day posthatching (dph) and 14 dph, ducklings hatched from eggs incubated under the higher temperature had a lower percentage of globulin than the control group (F1, 10=19.97, P=0.0111; Fl, 10=9.8, P=0.0352). The IFN-y concentration of ducklings at 14 dph displayed the same trend (Fl, 10=284.49, P < 0.0001). These results suggested that thermal manipulation during the middle stage of incubation had a repressive effect on the development of immune organs and reduced the concentrations of serum globulin and IFN-y. These results demonstrated that the subtle alteration of incubation temperature may weaken ducklings' immunity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

WULIANG; MATE CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; CHINA	Black crested gibbons (Nomascus concolor) are 1 of only 3 gibbon species that have been observed in long-term polygynous groups, but their mating behavior and reproductive characters have never been reported. Based on population monitoring over 7 years and direct observation for 26 months of the study groups in Wuliang Mountain, central Yunnan, we describe for the first time the copulation behavior and breeding pattern of free-ranging western black crested gibbons. The gestation period of black crested gibbons is estimated to be between 6 and 7 months. The average breeding interval is 3.5 years, with infant independence at approximately 2.5 years. We observed 2 intra-group copulations and 5 extra-group copulations. Copulations were initiated when a female gave a solicitation' gesture. When a male made any mating attempt, the female might refuse it. These results demonstrate direct female mate choice. Both male and female gibbons dispersed from their natal groups and sometimes replaced paired adults in other groups. We observed no evidence of infanticide during inter-group conflicts or after replacement of adults. Together with extra-group copulations, these phenomena indicate a flexible social organization and complex mating system. We also observed a male-biased sex ratio among offspring. More genetic work is necessary to describe the effects of inter-group copulation and the genetic diversity of this population.

Plants were sprayed with GA(3) or CCC at rosette stage and coumarin content was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after harvest. Two coumarins in root were detected: isoimperatorin and imperatorin. The root content of imperatorin was not affected by application either GA(3) or CCC, while isoimperatorin was increased to 127% after treatment with CCC (400 mg L-1). The lowest concentrations of GA(3) (50 mg L-1) and CCC (400 mg L-1) increased root yield to 157 and 139%, respectively. We note here that GA(3) and CCC might be used in improving the yield of A. dahurica var. formosana and maintaining the coumarin content.	[Hou, K.; Chen, J. Wen; Li, J.

The obtained EMC was characterized by SEM, XRD, potentiometric titration, and FTIR. The results showed that nano-Fe3O4 with granular morphology were steadily integrated with chitosan and EDTAD was successfully modified on the surface of chitosan. The adsorption properties of EMC for methylene blue (MB) were then evaluated. Factors affecting the uptake behavior such as pH, contact time, initial concentration of MB, and temperature were investigated. The optimal adsorption conditions were determined as pH 6.0, MB concentration 300mg L-1, contact time 30min, and temperature 35 degrees C. The adsorption capacity in the optimal condition was 113.257mgg(-1). The adsorption process followed the Sips isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Desorption and regeneration experiments were conducted and the adsorption/desorption cycles of MB were repeated three times. The EMC regeneration efficiency and the MB recovery efficiency were 82.82% and 80.72%, respectively, in the third cycle by using HCl as the eluent solution.

However, the available orchardgrass varieties have low summer survival rates and are susceptible to rust caused by Puccinia graminis Pers., resulting in lower yields and poor quality growth in subtropical regions of China. The summer survival rate, degree of rust resistant, and the correlation of rust resistance with summer survival rate of 242 germplasm resources of D.glomerata, from five continents of the world, were investigated in a field screening for 2years (2011 and 2012) at the southern part of China. Results showed that 13 accessions were scored high disease resistance for the 2years, and 36 were scored a summer survival rate of 100%. Thirteen accessions of orchardgrass were screened for disease resistance and high summer survival rate (80%), including two accessions named PI325293 and PI308794 with a high disease resistance and summer survival rate of 100% in the 2-year studies. The correlation between rust resistance and summer survival rate was low (r=0.111 P=0.295 in 2011, r=0.112 P=0.674 in 2012). These two accessions may serve as potential genetic materials to plant breeders for developing orchardgrass varieties that contain high rust resistance and summer survival rate. These results will also contribute to the conservation and utilization of orchardgrass germplasm.

An in-depth questionnaire was developed to evaluate a series of biosecurity practices, environmental factors, and management factors at the farm level. Fish samples with clinical hemorrhagic signs were also collected from each pond to assess the clinical disease of Grass Carp reovirus by using reverse transcription (RT) PCR assay. The association between the incidence of Grass Carp hemorrhagic disease (GCHD) and risk factors was analyzed using logistic regression. Of the 215 ponds, 144 showed GCHD-positive responses to RT-PCR assay. In addition, survey results revealed that inferior environmental conditions occurred in most ponds with an incidence of GCHD; such conditions included a thick mud layer; no cleansing and restoration practices (CRPs) before culture; and poor water quality (i.e., high ammonia nitrogen and nitrite concentrations and low transparency). Logistic regression model results suggested that decreased risks were associated with fry vaccination, a safe water source, and deepening of the water level, whereas increased risk factors mainly included no CRPs, excessive rearing density, disease history, and inferior water quality. Presently, control efforts are restricted to immunization of Grass Carp as the best management option for farms. Deepening the water levels and improving water sources can also effectively reduce the incidence of GCHD by diluting the pond rearing densities.

We characterized genetic diversity, population structure and patterns of evolution. We searched for genomic regions under selection, which includes genes that are involved in hypoxia, olfaction, energy metabolism and drug response. Comparing the genome of Tibetan wild boar with those of neighboring Chinese domestic pigs further showed the impact of thousands of years of artificial selection and different signatures of selection in wild boar and domestic pig. We also report genetic adaptations in Tibetan wild boar that are associated with high altitudes and characterize the genetic basis of increased salivation in domestic pig.

Ingested F initially acts locally on the intestines. The small intestine plays a critical role in the digestion, absorption, and defense. In this study, therefore, we investigated the effects of fluorine on the intestinal development by light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and histochemistry. A total of 280 one-day-old avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet (fluorine, 22.6 mg/kg) or the same basal diet supplemented with 400, 800, and 1,200 mg/kg fluorine (high fluorine groups I, II, and III) in the form of sodium fluoride for 42 days. The results showed that the intestinal gross, histological, and ultrastructural changes were observed in the high fluorine groups II and III. Meanwhile, the intestinal length, weight, viscera index, villus height, crypt depth, villus height to crypt depth ratio, diameter, muscle layer thickness, and goblet cell numbers were significantly lower (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05), and the intestinal diameter to villus height ratio was markedly higher (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) in the high fluorine groups II and III than those in control group. In conclusion, dietary fluorine in the range of 800-1,200 mg/kg obviously altered the aforementioned parameters of the intestines, implying that the intestinal development was suppressed and the intestinal functions, such as digestion, absorption, defense, or osmoregulation were impaired in broilers.

Here we determined the sequences of the complete mitochondrial DNA control region (1,014 bp) of 19 Sumatran-serow individuals. Nine new haplotypes were defined based on 78 variable sites. Combined analysis with other 32 haplotypes downloaded from the public database, including 1 Sumatran-serow, 11 Formosan-serow and 20 Japanese-serow (Capricornis crispus) haplotypes, a relatively high level of nucleotide diversity was first observed in Sumatran serow (pi = 0.0249). By comparative analysis with structural consensus sequences from other mammals, we have identified central, left and right domains and depicted the putative functional structure, including extend termination associated sequences and conserve sequence blocks, in mtDNA control region. The alignment of mtDNA control region revealed that both Sumatran and Japanese serow have two tandem repeats (TRs), but three TRs in Formosan serow. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Formosan serow is distinct species with the Japanese serow, but a sister group with the Sumatran serow. The divergence time estimated among three serow species revealed that Pleistocene climate changes and the uplift of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau might play an important role in the genetic differentiation of the serows. These results mainly provide the convinced evidence on the genetic relationship between three serow species.

The associations between LHCGR polymorphisms and six reproductive traits [body weight at first egg (BWAFE), weight of first egg, age at first egg (AFE), number of eggs at 300 days of age (EN), body weight at 300 days of age and egg weight at 300 days of age (EWTA)] were estimated using the one-way analysis of variance method. Results showed that SNP +G4058A and SNP +T4099G of the LHCGR gene were significantly associated with BWFE and AFE. Birds with the AG genotype for the +G4058A SNP exhibited shorter AFE (P < 0.05) and greater EN than those of the GG and AA genotypes, suggesting a balancing selection (overdominance); the effect of allele C in SNP +C3021T and allele C in SNP +T4490C on EN and AFE is additive and may reflect the influence of positive selection. These alleles have promise as genetic markers for future marker-assisted selection.

In this study, we isolated starch phosphorylase genes (Pho1 and Pho2) from barley, characterized their gene and protein structures, predicated their promoter's cis-elements and analyzed expression patterns. Multiple alignments of these genes showed that (1) both Pho1 and Pho2 genes possess 15 exons and 14 introns in all but three of the species analyzed, Aegilops tauschii (for Pho1 which contains 16 exons and 15 introns), potato (for Pho1b which contains 14 exons and 13 introns), and Triticum uraru (for Pho2 which contains 15 exons and 14 introns); (2) the exon-intron junctions of Pho1 and Pho2 flanking the ligand-binding sites are more conservative than the other regions. Analysis of protein sequences revealed that Pho1 and Pho2 were highly homologous except for two regions, the N terminal domain and the L78 insertion region. The results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated that Pho2 is mainly expressed in germinating seeds, and the expression of Pho1 is similar to that of starch synthesis genes during seed development in barley. Microarray-based analysis indicated that the accumulation of Pho1 or Pho2 transcripts exhibited uniform pattern both in various tissues and various stages of seed development among species of barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. Pho1 of barley was significantly down-regulated under cold and drought treatments, and up-regulated under stem rust infection. Pho2 exhibited similar expression to Pho1 in barley. However, significant difference in expression was not detected for either Pho1 or Pho2 under any of the investigated abiotic stresses. In Arabidopsis, significant down-regulation was detected for Pho1 (PHS1) under abscisic acid (ABA) and for Pho2 (PHS2) under cold, salt, and ABA. Our results provide valuable information to genetically manipulate phosphorylase genes and to further elucidate their regulatory mechanism in the starch biosynthetic pathway.

In this paper, ChAy/Bx, a novel chimeric HMW-GS gene from Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (AABB, 2n = 4x = 28) accession D129, was isolated and characterized. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyaaylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed that the electrophoretic mobility of the glutenin subunit encoded by ChAy/Bx was slightly faster than that of 1Dy12. The complete ORF of ChAy/Bx contained 1671 bp encoding a deduced polypeptide of 555 amino acid residues (or 534 amino acid residues for the mature protein), making it the smallest HMW-GS gene known from Triticum species. Sequence analysis showed that ChAy/Bx was neither a conventional x-type nor a conventional y-type subunit gene, but a novel chimeric gene. Its first 1305 nt sequence was highly homologous with the corresponding sequence of 1Ay type genes, while its final 366 nt sequence was highly homologous with the corresponding sequence of 1Bx type genes. The mature ChAy/Bx protein consisted of the N-terminus of 1Ay type subunit (the first 414 amino acid residues) and the C-terminus of 1Bx type subunit (the final 120 amino acid residues). Secondary structure prediction showed that ChAy/Bx contained some domains of 1Ay subunit and some domains of 1Bx subunit. The special structure of this HMW glutenin chimera ChAy/Bx subunit might have unique effects on the end-use quality of wheat flour. Here we propose that homoeologous recombination might be a novel pathway for allelic variation or molecular evolution of HMW-GSs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Application of CaCl2 enhanced the thermotolerance of lily, whereas treatment with calcium ion chelator EGTA and CaM antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) lowered the thermotolerance. Besides, HS-induced expression of LlHsf1 and LlHsfA2 genes were up-regulated by CaCl2 and down-regulated by EGTA or TFP. These findings implied that Ca2+-CaM were involved in HS signal transduction in lily via HSF pathway. Subsequently, five LlCaM genes encoding three canonical CaM isoforms were isolated and characterized, among which the LlCaM3 expression was induced by heat and CaCl2 and correlated positively with thermotolerance of lily. Additionally, transient expression analysis determined LlCaM3 to be a cytoplasm and nucleus protein. Furthermore, overexpression of LlCaM3 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) increased the transcript level of AtHsfA1a and AtHsp18.2 following HS and improved the thermotolerance of transgenic plants. Taken together, the results suggest that LlCaM3 is a key component in Ca2+-CaM HS signaling pathway in lily and may be in the upstream of HSF.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggested that: (1) the St, H, W, and P genomes were donated by Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum, Australopyrum, and Agropyron, respectively, while the Y genome is closely related to the Xp genome in Peridictyon sanctum; (2) different hexaploid Elymus s.l. species may derived their StY genome from different StY genome tetraploid species via independent origins; (3) due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybridization events, the genealogical conflict between the two gene trees suggest introgression involving some Elymus s.l. species, Pseudoroegneria, Agropyron and Aegilops/Triticum; (4) it is reasonable to recognize the StH genome species as Elymus sensu stricto, the StY genome species as Roegneria, the StYW genome species as Anthosachne, the StYH genome species as Campeiostachys, and the StYP genome species as Kengyilia. The occurrence of multiple origin and introgression could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Elymus s.l. species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adult male rats (n = 36) were randomly and equally allocated into three groups: Control (no treatment), surgically castrated, or immunized against 50 mu g D-Lys6-GnRH-tandem-dimer peptide conjugated to ovalbumin in Specol adjuvant at 12 week of age (with a booster 8 week later). Blood samples (for antibody titers and hormone concentrations) were collected at 2-week intervals until rats were killed (20 week). Compared with intact controls, immunocastration reduced (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of testosterone, LH, and FSH, and GnRH content in the median eminence, reduced the weight of the hypohysis (P < 0.01), and induced testicular atrophy (suppression of spermatogenesis). Furthermore, mRNA expression of GnRH in the hypothalamus, GnRH receptor, LH-beta and FSH-beta in the pituitary, LH receptor and FSH receptor in the testes, and genes in sex steroid feedback loops (androgen receptor [AR], kisspeptin encoded gene (Kiss-1), and kisspeptin receptor (GPR54) in the hypothalamus were decreased in immunocastrated rats compared with intact controls (P < 0.05). Similarly, surgical castration reduced GnRH in the median eminence as well as mRNA expression of GnRH, AR, Kiss-1, and GPR54 in the hypothalamus (P < 0.05). We concluded that anti-GnRH immunization in adult rats reduced synthesis of hypothalamic GnRH by decreasing androgen-AR-Kiss-peptin-GPR54 signaling pathways, and caused dysfunction of the pituitary-testicular axis, thereby suppressing spermatogenesis, resulting in testicular atrophy.

The co-introduction of rhizobial symbionts of introduced plants has drawn attention since they may influence local soil communities. We studied the phylogenetic position of the L. leucocephala isolates and assessed if the rhizobia were introduced together with the host to Panxi, Sichuan, China. The glnII and atpD genes of fifteen representative isolates were sequenced and analyzed, and applied multilocus sequence analyses in which the housekeeping genes recA, glnII and atpD were included. Furthermore, we estimated the within species diversity directly with 23S rDNA and IGS RFLP and indirectly through phenotypic analysis of forty L. leucocephala isolates. The isolates represented seven species and 38 diversified strains in the genera Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium. The within species diversity of the Ensifer isolates was large, proposing a potential to occupy novel niches. There was not conclusive evidence to show that any of the strains would have been co-introduced with L. leucocephala. On the contrary, we came to a conclusion that the possible introduction should not be inferred from sequence data alone.

JIAN; RAT	To investigate the effects of dietary copper (Cu) on fish growth, digestive and absorptive enzyme activities, and antioxidant status in the hepatopancreas and intestine, young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (282 +/- 2.8 g) were fed six diets containing 0.74 (basal diet), 2.26, 3.75, 5.25, 6.70, and 8.33 mg Cu /kg diet for 8 weeks. Results showed that percentage weight gain (PWG) and feed intake were increased with dietary Cu levels up to 3.75 mg/kg diet. In addition, the positive effects of dietary Cu at a level 3.75 or 5.25 mg/kg diet on trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase activities in the hepatopancreas and of Na+, K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities in three intestine segments produced significantly (P < 0.05) better feed efficiency (FE). However, amylase activity in the hepatopancreas was decreased by dietary Cu levels up to 3.75 mg/kg diet (P < 0.05). In addition, dietary Cu at 3.75 or 5.25 mg/kg diet decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content partly by significantly (P < 0.05) increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione content in the hepatopancreas and intestine. Collectively, dietary Cu improved growth and digestive and absorptive capacity and decreased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation partly by enhancing antioxidant defense in the hepatopancreas and intestine. The dietary Cu requirement for PWG, plasma ceruloplasmin activity, and FE of young grass carp (282-688 g) were 4.78, 4.95, and 4.70 mg/kg diet, respectively.	[Tang, Q. Q.; Feng, L.; Jiang, W.

However, as an essential adaptor downstream of TLR4, the genetic variation of myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88) and its association with digestive disorders have remained unknown. In this study, we detected 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire genomic region of rabbit MyD88. The genetic variation in susceptibility to digestive disorders for the only coding SNP (synonymous c.699T>C) was studied in Yaan (183 cases and 142 controls) and Chengdu populations (145 cases and 140 controls). A case-control association study revealed that individuals with the C allele had significant protection against digestive disorders in the Yaan population (OR=0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.99; P<0.05), the Chengdu population (OR=0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.78; P<0.01) and for joint analysis (OR=0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.79; P<0.01). We also experimentally induced digestive disorders by feeding a fiber-deficient diet and found that increased susceptibility was significantly associated with higher MyD88 mRNA expression (P<0.05). The lowest MyD88 mRNA expression was observed in individuals carrying the protective CC genotype. These results suggest that MyD88 is one of the most plausible candidate genes in relation to digestive disorders in rabbit. Further studies are required to explore the biological implications of MyD88 in the pathogenesis of digestive disorders.

WULIANG; CENTRAL YUNNAN; PAN-PANISCUS; PRIMATES	In primates, grooming is considered among the most common behaviors for maintaining social bonds; however, to date, few studies have examined grooming behavior in gibbon species in detail. We used both a 5-min interval scan method and social network analysis to study grooming in two groups of polygynous western black-crested gibbon (Nomascus concolor) in Wuliang Mountain, Central Yunnan, China. Individuals in both groups spent little time in social grooming (1.45% and 1.97% of active time). We compared the two groups' grooming networks and found that the group that maintained a more stable social unit had a more complex grooming network while the group with new immigrants had a grooming network characterized by fewer grooming pairs. Females in both groups played important roles in the grooming network. A newly immigrant female spent the most time grooming others and chose the resident adult female as her main adult grooming partner. Other females from both groups chose the adult male as their primary grooming partner (except their offspring). A sub-adult male who had resided in his natal group for 2 years after maturing into an adult also groomed more and was at the center of the network. This male finally replaced the breeding male in his group 3 years after our data collection period ended. We hypothesize that the immigrant female and the resident young adult male engaged in more extensive grooming interactions as a behavioral strategy to gain tolerance from long-term residents. Our results suggest that female gibbons in polygynous groups actively cooperate in maintaining social relationships rather than co-exist through tolerance or avoidance. Our observations indicate that grooming networks in crested gibbons reflect individual dynamics and partly support the social cohesion hypothesis for primate grooming. In this regard, we suggest that changes in gibbon grooming networks can be used to predict social change. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1165-1173, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We hypothesised that the immune function of IUGR neonates might be affected by increased nutrient intake (NI) during the suckling period. Therefore, we investigated the effects of high NI (HNI) on the growth performance, intestinal morphology and immunological response of IUGR and normal-birth weight (NBW) piglets. A total of twelve pairs of IUGR and NBW piglets (7 d old) were randomly assigned to two different nutrient-level formula milk groups. After 21 d of rearing, growth performance, the composition of peripheral leucocytes, serum cytokines and intestinal innate immune-related genes involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4-myeloid differentiation factor 88-NF-kappa B pathway were determined. The results indicated that IUGR decreased the average daily DM intake (ADMI) and the average daily growth (ADG). However, the ADMI and ADG were increased by HNI, irrespective of body weight. Likewise, serum cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) and ileal gene expressions (TLR-4, TLR-9, TRAF-6 and IL-1 beta) were lower in IUGR piglets, whereas HNI significantly increased blood lymphocyte percentage and serum IL-10 concentrations, but decreased neutrophil percentage, serum IL-1 beta concentrations and ileal gene expressions (NF-kappa B and IL-1 beta). Furthermore, IUGR piglets with HNI exhibited lower serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta than NBW piglets, and these alterations in the immune traits of IUGR piglets receiving HNI were accompanied by decreasing ileal gene expressions of TLR-4, TLR-9, NF-kappa B and IL-1 beta that are related to innate immunity. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that increased NI during the suckling period impaired the immune function of neonatal piglets with IUGR.

A total of 125 piglets were randomly allotted on the basis of their body weight and litters to one of five experimental diets, i.e. a control diet without fibre source (CT), and diets in which expanded maize was replaced by 10% maize fibre (MF), 10% soyabean fibre (SF), 10% wheat bran fibre (WBF) or 10% pea fibre (PF). The diets and water were fed ad libitum for 30 d. Piglets on the WBF and PF diets had lower diarrhoea incidence compared with the MF- and SF-fed animals. A higher ratio of villous height: crypt depth in the ileum of WBF-fed piglets and higher colonic goblet cells in WBF- and PF-fed piglets were observed compared with CT-, MF-and SF-fed piglets. In the intestinal digesta, feeding WBF and PF resulted in increased Lactobacillus counts in the ileum and Bifidobacterium counts in the colon. Lower Escherichia coli counts occurred in the ileum and colon of WBF-fed piglets than in SF-fed piglets. Tight junction protein (zonula occludens 1; ZO-1) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) gene mRNA levels were up-regulated in the ileum and colon of pigs fed WBF; however, feeding MF and SF raised IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha mRNA levels. Furthermore, higher diamine oxidase activities, transforming growth factor-alpha, trefoil factor family and MHC-II concentration occurred when feeding WBF and PF. In conclusion, the various fibre sources had different effects on the ileal and colonic barrier function. Clearly, WBF and PF improved the intestinal barrier function, probably mediated by changes in microbiota composition and concomitant changes in TLR2 gene expression.

Under the few circumstances in which the plant is studied, C. sinensis flowers, which are important for reproduction and cross-breeding, receive less emphasis than investigation of its leaves or roots. Using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing, we analyzed a C. sinensis floral transcriptome, and 26.9 million clean reads were assembled into 75,531 unigenes averaging 402 bp. Among them, 50,792 (67.2%) unigenes were annotated with a BLAST search against the NCBI Non-Redundant (NR) database and 10,290 (16.67%) were detected that contained one or more simple sequence repeats (SSRs). From these SSR-containing sequences, 2,439 candidate SSR markers were developed and 720 were experimentally tested, validating 431 (59.9%) novel polymorphic SSR markers for C. sinensis. Then, a consensus SSR-based linkage map was constructed that covered 1,156.9 cM with 237 SSR markers distributed in 15 linkage groups. Both transcriptome information and the genetic map of C. sinensis presented here offer a valuable foundation for molecular biology investigations such as functional gene isolation, quantitative trait loci mapping, and marker-assisted selection breeding in this important species.

Knowledge of genetic variation within and among populations is essential for breeding new cultivars in the species. The major objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude of genetic variation among and within natural populations in China. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this experiment, we analyzed genetic variation of 164 individuals of 18 populations collected from natural habitats in six Chinese provinces using 20 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) primer pairs generating 277 polymorphic bands. Among and within the populations, the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 80.00% and 27.07%, genetic diversity (H-E) was 0.245 and 0.099, effective number of alleles (N-E) was 1.350 and 1.170, and Shannon's information index (I) was 0.340 and 0.147, respectively. The populations were clustered into six groups exhibiting a high level of genetic differentiation, which was highly associated with geographic origins of respective germplasm populations, but was not significantly associated with geographic distances between the populations. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first report indicating that large genetic variation exists in the Chinese E. arundinaceus germplasm based on the SRAP molecular marker analysis of native populations. The genetic structure of populations in the species has been substantially affected by geographic landforms and environments. The diverse collection will be highly valuable in genetic improvement in the species per se and likely in sugarcane.

Rats received biweekly intragastric administration of zearalenone mycotoxin (3 mg/kg body weight) for 2 weeks. Urine and plasma samples after zearalenone administration were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics. Zearalenone exposure significantly elevated the plasma levels of glucose, lactate, N-acetyl glycoprotein, O-acetyl glycoprotein, and propionate but reduced the plasma levels of tyrosine, branched-chain amino acids, and choline metabolites. Zearalenone supplementation decreased the urine levels of butyrate, lactate, and nicotinate. However, it increased the urine levels of allantoin, choline, and N-methylnicotinamide at 0-8 h after the last zearalenone administration and those of 1-methylhistidine, acetoacetate, acetone, and indoxyl sulfate at 8-24 h after the last zearalenone administration. These results suggest that zearalenone exposure can cause oxidative stress and change common systemic metabolic processes, including cell membrane metabolism, protein biosynthesis, glycolysis, and gut microbiota metabolism.

We have identified sequences bordering each of the main translocation and inversion breakpoints on chromosomes 4A, 5A and 7B of the modern bread wheat genome. The locations of these breakpoints allow, for the first time, a detailed description of the evolutionary origins of these chromosomes at the gene level. Results from this study also demonstrate that, although the strategy of exploiting sorted chromosome arms has dramatically simplified the efforts of wheat genome sequencing, simultaneous analysis of sequences from homoeologous and non-homoeologous chromosomes is essential in understanding the origins of DNA sequences in polyploid species.

To better understand the regulatory mechanism of immature embryo dedifferentiation, we generated four small RNA and degradome libraries from samples representing the major stages of dedifferentiation. More than 186 million raw reads of small RNA and degradome sequence data were generated. We detected 102 known miRNAs belonging to 23 miRNA families. In total, we identified 51, 70 and 63 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in the stage I, II, III samples, respectively, compared to the control. However, only 6 miRNAs were continually up-regulated by more than fivefold throughout the process of dedifferentiation. A total of 87 genes were identified as the targets of 21 DEM families. This group of targets was enriched in members of four significant pathways including plant hormone signal transduction, antigen processing and presentation, ECM-receptor interaction, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. The hormone signal transduction pathway appeared to be particularly significant, involving 21 of the targets. While the targets of the most significant DEMs have been proved to play essential roles in cell dedifferentiation. Our results provide important information regarding the regulatory networks that control immature embryo dedifferentiation in maize. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We generated AFLP fingerprints for 96 leaf samples, collected at 30 m intervals in the two populations, using ten selective primer pairs. A total of 92 genotypes were identified from the both populations. The mean proportion of distinguishable genotypes (G/N) was 0.9583 (0.9375 to 0.9792) and Simpson's index of diversity (D) was 0.9982 (0.9973 to 0.9991). So, two B. fangiana populations were multiclonal and highly diverse. The largest single clone may occur over a distance of about 30 m. Our results demonstrated that the genotypic diversity and genet density of B. fangiana clonal population did not change significantly (47 versus 45) with genet aging and low partitioned genetic differentiation was between the two populations (Gst = 0.0571). The analysis of molecular variance consistently showed that a large proportion of the genetic variation (87.79%) existed among the individuals within populations, whereas only 12.21% were found among populations. In addition, the high level of genotypic diversity in the two populations implies that the further works were needed to investigate the reasons for the poor seed set in B. fangiana after flowering.

In the present study, differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were identified among healthy, moderate and severe mastitic cows by proteomic profiling. The health status of cows was closely determined by the somatic cell count (SCC). Differentially expressed proteins were resolved using the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) with the pH 4-7 non-linear DryStrips. Subsequently, 8 protein spots, which altered more than 3-fold, were isolated and identified with the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisationtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS). The identified spots were split into four proteins: alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, serum albumin, transthyretin (TTR) and haptoglobin, respectively. Compared with the healthy cows, the expression of haptoglobin was up-regulated in mastitic cows, and the others were down-regulated. Moreover, the proteomic data were consistent with the results of Western blot. All of the identified DEPs were acute phase proteins, which acted together and represented the consequence of serial cascades after mastitic infection. More importantly, the alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein was novel identified corresponding to the bovine mastitis in Chinese Holstein dairy cows. Taken together, our results indicate that the host responses may play an important role in the pathogenesis of mastitis and provide the potential diagnostic indicator of the underlying mastitis in dairy cows.

As an environmentally friendly alternative to the commonly used chemical fugicides, a highly effective photocatalytic disinfection of F. graminearu m macroconidia under visible light illumination was demonstrated on a visible-light-activated palladium-modified nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (TiON/PdO) nanoparticle photocatalyst. Because of the opposite surface charges of the TiON/PdO nanoparticles and the F. graminearum macroconidium, the nanopartides were strongly adsorbed onto the macroconidium surface, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic disinfection of these macroconidia. The photocatalytic disinfection mechanism of TON/ PdO nanoparticles on these macroconidia could be attributed to their cell wall/membrane damage caused by the attack from reactive oxygen species (ROSs) as demonstrated by the fluorescence/phase contrast microscopy observations, while a breakage of their cell structure was not necessary for their loss of viability.

Sexual selection, fecundity selection and ecological divergence between males and females are the major evolutionary forces of SSD. However, the influences of mating system and habitat types on SSD have received little attention. Here, using phylogenetic comparative methods, we at first examine the hypotheses to that mating system (intensity of sexual selection) and habitat types affect significantly variation in SSD in anurans (39 species and 18 genera). Results: Our data set encompass 39 species with female-biased SSD. We provide evidence that the effects of mating system and habitat types on SSD were non-significant across species, also when the analyses were phylogenetically corrected. Conclusions: Contrast to the hypotheses, our findings suggest that mating system and habitat types do not play an important role in shaping macro-evolutionary patterns of SSD in anurans. Mating system and habitat types cannot explain the variation in SSD when correcting for phylogenetic effects.

Visceral adipose tissues (VATs) and subcutaneous adipose tissues (SATs), the two main fat compartments in mammals, are anatomically, physiologically, metabolically, and clinically distinct. Various studies of adipose tissues have focused mainly on DNA methylation, and mRNA and protein expression, nonetheless little research sheds directly light on the miRNA transcriptome differences between these two distinct adipose tissue types. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of miRNA transcriptomes across six variant porcine adipose tissues by small RNA-sequencing. We identified 219 known porcine miRNAs, 97 novel miRNA*s, and 124 miRNAs that are conserved to other mammals. A set of universally abundant miRNAs (i.e., miR-148a-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-27b-3p, miR-let-7a-1-5p, and miR-let-7f-5p) across the distinct adipose tissues was found. This set of miRNAs may play important housekeeping roles that are involved in adipogenesis. Clustering analysis indicated significant variations in miRNA expression between the VATs and SATs, and highlighted the role of the greater omentum in responding to potential metabolic risk because of the observed enrichment in this tissue of the immune-and inflammation-related miRNAs, such as the members of miR-17-92 cluster and miR-181 family. Differential expression of the miRNAs between the VATs and SATs, and miRNA target prediction analysis revealed that the VATs-specific enriched miRNAs were associated mainly with immune and inflammation responses. In summary, the differences of miRNA expression between the VATs and SATs revealed some of their intrinsic differences and indicated that the VATs might be closely associated with increased risk of metabolic disorders.

ZFP also belongs to a large family of transcription factor. It plays many important regulatory roles in plants. Here, we explained that the percentage of ZFP transcription factor in total transcription factors is similar among plant species. The ZFP functions were implicated in development, growth, stress response and phytohormone responses based on the conclusion of four ZFP families, C2H2, CCCH, C3HC4 and C4. Meanwhile, there was one main function in each ZFP family. On the basis of analyses of the ZFP gene expression in the CCCH family of rice, the regulation controlled by rice ZFP in various tissues was significantly related with each other, as well as in responses to different abiotic stresses. Expression of some rice tissues-specific ZFP genes was significantly related to abiotic or biotic stresses.

WATER-STRESS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; ABIOTIC STRESS; HIGHER-PLANTS; SALT STRESS; LEAVES; WHEAT	Improving drought tolerance through drought preconditioning is an important way to understand drought tolerance mechanism in plants. Some limited researches have focused on the gene expression patterns in conjunction with the underlying enzymes promoting drought tolerance and post-drought recovery in white clover. The objective of this study was to identify whether preconditioning-induced drought tolerance is in relation to changes of antioxidant enzyme activities, gene expression and osmoregulatory solutes in white clover. Plants of white clover cultivar, 'Chuanyin Ladino' (drought sensitive), were exposed to two cycles of drought preconditioning (non-preconditioned, well-watered plants, as a control) then exposed to drought stress for 11 days and rewatered for 6 days in a growth chamber with 14 h photoperiod at day/night temperature of 21/16 C, 70 % relative humidity, and 300 umol m-2 s' photosynthetic photon flux density. Results showed that drought preconditioning improved drought tolerance and post-drought recovery in white clover, as demonstrated by significantly lower (p<0.05) lipid peroxidation, better cell membrane stability and higher relative water content in drought-preconditioned plants as compared to non-preconditioned plants under drought stress and rewatering. Drought-preconditioned plants exhibited higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase activities (POD), as well as higher transcript level of Cu/Zn SOD gene. Meanwhile, more accumulation of soluble sugars and betain and less accumulated proline were also observed in preconditioned plants. Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and significantly higher transcript level of Cu/Zn SOD gene may be the critical reasons in acquiring drought tolerance through drought preconditioning. This study also suggests that drought preconditioning improved white clover drought tolerance, which could be related to more accumulation of soluble sugars and betain, while the accumulated proline is associated with the degree of drought stress injury in white clover.

Pb and Cd co-induced oxidative stress in liver and kidney tissues. This result was indicated by a significant (P <0.01) increase in the maleic dialdehyde level and decreased levels of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. MT mRNA and protein significantly increased (P <0.01) in the liver and kidney of rats. Furthermore, the expression levels of MT-1 mRNA and MT-2 mRNA differed between the liver and kidney. The findings indicate that Pb combined with Cd induced oxidative damage in the liver and kidney of rats, and MT may be a biochemical environmental indicator. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In plants, the MYB family transcription factor has selectively expanded, particularly through the large family of R2R3-MYB. MYB proteins are key factors in regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. AtMYB123/TT2 encodes a R2R3 type MYB transcription factor, and plays a key role in regulating flavonoid late biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis. Here, we firstly identified a TT2/AtMYB123 homologous protein FtMYB123L through bioinformatics analysis from the floral transcriptome data from Fagopyrum tataricum. We speculate that FtMYB123L also involves the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in F. tataricum. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To investigate the roles of miRNAs in maize endosperm development, two small RNA libraries of maize endosperm at two developmental stages were sequenced. A total of 17,773,394 and 18,586,523 small RNA raw reads were obtained, respectively. Further analysis identified and characterized 95 known miRNAs belonging to 20 miRNA families. In addition, 18 novel miRNAs were identified and grouped into 11 families. Potential targets for 5 of the novel miRNA families were successfully predicted. We had also identified 12 corresponding miRNAs* of these novel miRNAs. In summary, we investigated expression patterns of miRNA in maize endosperm at key developmental stages and identified miRNAs that are likely to playing an important role in endosperm development.

Besides benzophenone and ammonium persulfate were used as initiators, which could enhance the yield of grafting markedly. The occurrence of grafting polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide was testified by the attenuated total multiple reflection technique and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Scanning electron micrograph showed that the surface morphology of ethylene-vinyl acetate membrane changed after modification. The lower critical solution temperature of the membrane was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The wettability of membrane was investigated by water contact angle measurement. The results showed that the grafting degree increased with irradiation time, monomer and ammonium persulfate concentration at the beginning of reaction. It was also found that the modified membrane surface became hydrophilic and displayed thermosensitivity similar to that of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) gel, and the lower critical solution temperature was about 32A degrees C.

A total of 50 E. nutans accessions from the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were analyzed using simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers from wheat and Elymus species. Our results show that a total of 144 reliable bands were generated, of which 132 (91.38%) were found to be polymorphic. Nei-Li's genetic similarity coefficients ranged from 0.515 to 0.870 with an average of 0.719, which shows a high level of genetic diversity and a broad genetic base among accessions. There was a low correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance (r =0.121, P =0.088) in the region, which is consistent with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis of accessions. The mountain ridges and river valleys in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet region could serve as genetic barriers for pollinator movement and seed dispersal. The rule of the most genetic diversity at medium altitude of E. nutans in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was also validated in the study. The implications of these results for the conservation of E. nutans are discussed.

In order to identify some specific proteins associated with CMS in pepper, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was applied to proteomic analysis of anthers/buds between a CMS line (designated NA3) and its maintainer (designated NB3) in Capsicum annuum L. Thirty-three spots showed more than 1.5-fold in either CMS or its maintainer. Based on mass spectrometry, 27 spots representing 23 distinct proteins in these 33 spots were identified. Proteins down-regulated in CMS anthers/buds includes ATP synthase D chain, formate dehydrogenase, alpha-mannosidas, RuBisCO large subunit-binding protein subunit beta, chloroplast manganese stabilizing protein-II, glutathione S-transferase, adenosine kinase isoform 1T-like protein, putative DNA repair protein RAD23-4, putative caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase, glutamine synthetase (GS), annexin Cap32, glutelin, allene oxide cyclase, etc. In CMS anthers/buds, polyphenol oxidase, ATP synthase subunit beta, and actin are up-regulated. It was predicted that male sterility in NA3 might be related to energy metabolism turbulence, excessive ethylene synthesis, and suffocation of starch synthesis. The present study lays a foundation for future investigations of gene functions associated with pollen development and cytoplasmic male sterility, and explores the molecular mechanism of CMS in pepper.

Comparison of a 481-bp segment revealed a total of 192 haplotypes with 141 variable sites. The haplotype and nucleotide diversities ranged from 0.782 +/- 0.079 to 1.000 +/- 0.020 and from 0.009 +/- 0.001 to 0.045 +/- 0.006, respectively, indicating a relatively high genetic diversity in Chinese black goats. Phylogenetic analyses identified five haplogroups (A, B-1, B-2, C and D). The dominant haplogroups A, B-1 and B-2 were distributed in most of breeds, while the haplogroups C and D were only presented in the breeds located in north or northwest of China. Analysis of molecular variance and multidimensional scaling plot of F (ST) analyses indicated no obvious geographic structure among breeds. Furthermore, the migration rates revealed that a wide range of gene flow or gene exchange occurred among breeds, which may result in the weak geographic structure of Chinese black goats. Population expansion analysis based on mismatch distribution indicated that two expansion events in Chinese black goats occurred at 10 and 28 mutational time units. Finally, our findings indicate the multiple maternal origins of Chinese black goats and more gene flow (female-mediated) which occurred during their domestic and breeding histories.

To date, several genes related to grain weight, grain number and panicle number have been described in rice. However, no genes regulating the panicle seed setting rate have been functionally characterized. Here we show that the domestication-related POLLEN TUBE BLOCKED 1 (PTB1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, positively regulates the rice panicle seed setting rate by promoting pollen tube growth. The natural variation in expression of PTB1 which is affected by the promoter haplotype and the environmental temperature, correlates with the rice panicle seed setting rate. Our results support the hypothesis that PTB1 is an important maternal sporophytic factor of pollen tube growth and a key modulator of the rice panicle seed setting rate. This finding has implications for the improvement of rice yield.

The present study aimed to identify the association between genetic polymorphisms of TBC1D1 and body weight (BW) in rabbits. Among the total of 12 SNPs detected in all 20 exons, only one SNP was non-synonymous (c.214G>A. p.G72R) located in exon 1. c.214G>A was subsequently genotyped among 491 individuals from two rabbit breeds by the high-resolution melting method. Allele A was the predominant allele with frequencies of 0.7780 and 0.6678 in European white rabbit (EWR, n = 205) and New Zealand White rabbit (NZW, n = 286), respectively. The moderate polymorphism information content (0.25<PIC<0.50) was present in both breeds. The association analysis revealed that genotypes GA and AA had higher 35 d body weight (BW) than genotype GG in both EWR (p<0.01) and NEW (p<0.05). For the 56 d BW and 70 d BW traits, genotypes AA and GA were higher than genotype GG in both two breeds, the difference was not significant (p>0.05). Our results implied that the c.214G>A of TBC1D1 gene might be one of the candidate loci affecting the trait of 35 d BW in the rabbit.

This could result in developing effective extracts of E. adenophorum as a source of natural, low-toxicity plant-based acaricidal drugs. Adult engorged females of H. longicornis were collected from naturally infected goats. The engorged females were reared in the laboratory and their offspring (larvae and nymphs) were used as test ectoparasites. The toxic effects of botanical extracts from E. adenophorum against larvae and nymphs of H. longicornis were evaluated. The results showed that the extracts with 1.5 and 1.0 g/ml (w/v) concentrations were toxic for H. longicornis, comparable to a toxic effect of 2% chlorpyrifos (positive control). The median lethal time (LT50) for larval and nymphal ticks with 1.5 g/ml (w/v) concentration of extract were 0.790 (LT99 = 1.065) and 1.018 (LT99 = 10.608) hours, respectively, whereas the LT50 of 1.0 g/ml (w/v) concentration were 1.445 (LT99 = 6.047) and 1.313 (LT99 = 29.932) hours for larval and nymphal ticks, respectively. At a concentration of 1.5 g/ml (w/v), an acaricidal effect of 100% was achieved for both larval and nymphal ticks, while a concentration of 1.0 g/ml (w/v) resulted in 100% (for larvae) and 93% (for nymphs) within a 6 h period. In additional, we found that the relatively low concentration (0.5 g/ml) also obtained a good acaricidal effect during the short experimental period, with 2.22 and 2.651 h LT50 for larval and nymphal ticks, respectively. These results indicate that E. adenophorum contains potent acaricidal ingredients against the hard tick H. longicornis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Jian). 1050 juvenile Jian carp (initial weight 7.73 +/- 0.03 g) were fed seven isonitrogenous diets with graded concentrations of tryptophan (1.1, 1.7, 2.5, 3.8, 4.9, 6.0, 6.9 g/kg diet) for 8 weeks. Percent weight gain, feed intake and protein retention value were markedly improved, with increases in dietary tryptophan up to 3.8 g/kg diet. Similar trend was found in glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities, trypsin, lipase and a-amylase activities, Na+/K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase activities, and relative expression of eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP). On the other hand, feed conversion ratio, plasma ammonia concentration and the relative expression of target of rapamycin (TOR) in different tissue showed an opposite pattern. A series of experiments in vitro were then carried out. Compared with the control group, tryptophan supplementation increased 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) OD value, protein content and activity of AKP, GOT, GPT and Na+/K+-ATPase in enterocytes and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and ammonia concentration in the culture medium. Protein synthesis rate was 17% higher and relative expression of TOR was 28% lower in tryptophan-supplemented than in control carp enterocytes. In conclusion, our results indicate that tryptophan improved fish growth, digestive and absorptive function as well as protein synthesis, which may be partly related to the TOR signaling pathway.

Ancient trees remaining in natural areas from once widespread forest due to overexploitation and habitat modification would naturally regenerate to form small isolated populations after the halting of disturbance. The genetic processes and consequence of this regeneration are generally unknown, which prevents the effective conservation and management of these populations. One such population, an Erythrophleum fordii population, is located in Dinghushan National Nature Reserve (China). Owing to the remarkably huge trunk of the sole ancient tree (KG) relative to the other individuals in the population, the local people and local tourism administration presume that this population has developed solely from KG. We found, using genetic diversity analyses, that contrary to this presumption, the population might have regenerated from several founders with diverse genetic backgrounds. Severe degradation of genetic diversity within the population did not take place, rather, it possessed the potential ability to maintain and recover gradually with population development. According to the results of simulations, we found that the longevity of tree species with iteroparity offers the potential to maintain genetic diversity in small isolated populations. The results from this study will benefit the restoration and conservation of the endangered species E. fordii, and of other congener species and tree species with similar life history traits.

A total of 96 finishing pigs [(Yorkshire x Landrace) x Duroc] with an average BW of 73.1 +/- 2.5 kg were used in a 6-wk study. Pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) CON, basal diet, 2) CON + 1% fructan (FC1), and 3) CON + 2% fructan (FC2) with 8 replicate pens per treatment and 2 barrows and 2 gilts per pen. During the overall study, pigs fed the fructan supplementation diets had a greater (P < 0.05) ADG, G:F, the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM and GE than pigs fed the CON diet. The levels of fructan supplementation did not affect growth performance and ATTD of DM, N, and GE. Fecal E. coli concentrations in the fructan treatments were lower (P < 0.001), while fecal Lactobacillus concentrations in the fructan treatments were greater (P < 0.001) compared with the CON treatment. Fecal ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emissions were lower (P < 0.05) in d 3, 5, and 7 in the fructan treatments, and total mercaptans emission was lower (P < 0.05) on d 3 and 5 compared with the CON treatment. In conclusion, fructan supplementation improved growth performance and ATTD of DM and GE, improved the fecal microbial balance, and inhibited the fecal E. coli. Furthermore, fructan may decrease fecal noxious gas emissions by finishing pigs.	[Zhao, P. Y.; Wang, J. P.] Dankook Univ, Dept Anim Resource & Sci, Cheonan 330714, Choongnam, South Korea; [Zhao, P.

This experiment lasted 31 d. Broilers were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) CON, basal diet, 2) CON + 0.25% fructan (FC1), and 3) CON + 0.50% fructan (FC2). Each treatment contained 16 pens with 15 chicks per pen. Broilers on levan fructan supplementation treatments (FC1 + FC2) had a lower (P = 0.005 for d 15 to 31) ADFI and greater (P = 0.005 for d 15 to 31 and P = 0.022 for d 1 to 31) G: F than those on the CON. A decreased (P = 0.031) relative spleen weight was observed with levan fructan supplementation treatments compared with the CON. Cecal E. coli and C. perfringens concentrations in levan fructan treatments were decreased, while cecal Lactobacillus, as well as Bifidobacteria, concentrations in levan fructan treatments were increased compared with the CON. However, excreta NH3 concentrations were decreased (P = 0.013) in levan fructan treatments compared with the CON. In conclusion, fructan supplementation improved later stage growth performance, increased cecal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria concentrations, and decreased cecal E. coli and C. perfringens concentrations, as well as excreta NH3 concentrations, in broilers.

Comparisons among the three nucleotide sequences of three genotypes indicated that three base substitutions (A213T, A91G, and A89C) were detected in FSH beta gene, which A213T substitution led to one amino acids mutation (Lys > Met), and the other two substitutions were synonymous mutations. The AA, AB and BB genotypes patterns obtained by FSH beta primer1 had evident relation with the litter traits, but the SSCP genotypes patterns obtained by FSH beta primer2 and primer3 had no evident relation with the litter traits in giant panda.

Controlling the life-cycle of T. solium between humans and pigs is essential for eradication of cysticercosis. One difficulty for the accurate detection and identification of T. solium species is the possible co-existence of two other human Taenia tapeworms (T. saginata and T. asiatica, which do not cause cysticercosis in humans). Several key issues for taeniasis/cysticercosis (T/C) evidence-based epidemiology and control are reviewed: (1) advances in immunological and molecular tools for screening of human and animals hosts and identification of Taenia species, with a focus on real-time detection of taeniasis carriers and infected animals in field community screenings, and (2) spatial ecological approaches that have been used to detect geospatial patterns of case distributions and to monitor pig activity and behaviour. Most recent eco-epidemiological studies undertaken in Sichuan province, China, are introduced and reviewed.

In the current study, we assessed the positive detection rate of a self-detection tool, stool microscopy with direct smear and coproPCR for taeniasis carriers in endemic Tibetan areas of northwest Sichuan. The self-detection tool through questioning about a history of proglottid expulsion within the previous one year showed an overall positive detection rate of more than 80% for Taenia saginata, T. solium and T. asiatica. The positive detection rate was similar for T. saginata and T. solium. In 132 taeniid tapeworm carriers, 68 (51.5%) were detected by microscopy and 92 (69.7%) were diagnosed by coproPCR. A combination of microscopy and coproPCR increased the positive detection rate to 77.3%. There remained 10 cases (7.6%) coproPCR negative but microscopy positive. Due to the high cost and complicated process, coproPCR is required for the identification of Taenia species only when necessary, though it had a significant higher positive detection rate than microscopy. Combined use of self-detection and stool microscopy are recommended in community-based mass screening for taeniases in this Tibetan area or in other situation-similar endemic regions.

NOV.; SOIL; CHINA; CHROMATOGRAPHY; SEQUENCES; TREES; ACID	A novel halophilic, filamentous actinomycete, designated TRM 4064(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Sichuan Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on an almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain TRM 4064(T) showed that it was most closely related to Actinopolyspora mortivallis (99.1 % sequence similarity). The sequence similarities between strain TRM 4064(T) and other Actinopolyspora species with validly-published names were < 97.0 %. However, it had relatively low mean values for DNA-DNA relatedness with the A. mortivallis DSM 44261(T) (23.2 %). Optimal growth occurred at 37 A degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the presence of 13 % (w/v) NaCl. The whole-cell sugar pattern consists of xylose, glucose, ribose and arabinose. The predominant menaquinones are MK-10(H-4) (38.2 %), MK-9(H-4) (25.1 %), MK-9(H-2) (28.6 %) and MK-8(H-4) (7.3 %). The major fatty acids are anteiso-C-17:0 (36.9 %) and iso-C-17:0 (19.3 %). The diagnostic phospholipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 66.3 mol%. Strain TRM 4064(T) therefore represents a novel species of the genus Actinopolyspora, for which the name Actinopolyspora dayingensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 4064(T) (= KCTC 19979(T) = CCTCC AA 2010010(T)).

Flavonoids are also beneficial for human health and depress the progression of some chronic diseases. The biosynthesis of flavonoids, which belong to a large family of phenolic compounds, is a complex metabolic process with many pathways that produce different metabolites, controlled by key enzymes. There is limited knowledge about the composition, biosynthesis and regulation of flavonoids in cereals. Improved understanding of the accumulation of flavonoids in cereal grains would help to improve human nutrition through these staple foods. The biosynthesis of flavonoids, scope for altering the flavonoid composition in cereal crops and benefits for human nutrition are reviewed here.

To assess roles of DgZFP3 in plant drought stress responses, we performed gain-of-function experiment. The DgZFP3-overexpression tobacco plants showed significant drought tolerance over the wild type (WT). The transgenic lines exhibited less accumulation of H2O2 under drought stress, more accumulation of proline and greater activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase than the WT under both control conditions and drought stress. In addition, there was greater up-regulation of the ROS-related enzyme genes (NtSOD and NtPOD) and stress-related genes (NtLEA5 and NtDREB) in transgenic lines under normal or drought conditons. Thus DgZFP3 probably plays a positive regulatory role in drought stress response and has the potential to be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve drought stress tolerance in plants.

Although males accumulated higher Cu concentrations in leaves than did females under Cu stress, they did not suffer more damage than females, as reflected by changes in gas exchange, pigment contents, membrane lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) and protein oxidation (carbonyl). Higher Cu tolerance of males was correlated with a higher H2O2 scavenging ability and proline responses, and a better maintenance of non-protein thiols (NP-SHs) and spermine (Spm) contents. We also discovered that mitigation effects of exogenous Put on Cu stress occurred, as visible as a recovery of the total chlorophyll content, and lower TBARS and carbonyl under interaction treatment when compared to Cu stress alone. Exogenous Put decreased the Cu concentration in leaves of both sexes, but to different degrees. Such effects of exogenous Put suggested that Put may play important roles in the stabilization of membrane integrity and protein structures, and it may modulate the uptake and transportation of Cu. Our results indicated that (1) males are more tolerant to Cu stress than females; (2) Put could mitigate Cu toxicity in P. cathayana, but to a different degree in males and females; (3) males are better candidates than females for Cu extraction and phytoremediation.

A total of 240 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg of nickel chloride (NiCl2) for 42 days. Results showed that the small intestinal villus height, crypt depth and villus/crypt ratio were significantly decreased, and also the small intestinal goblet cells numbers and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) contents were significantly decreased in the 300-, 600- and 900-mg/kg groups when compared with those of the control group. In conclusion, dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg reduced the villus height, crypt depth, the goblet cells population and the IGF-1 and EGF contents in the small intestine, indicating that the normal development and function of the small intestine were finally impaired in broilers. This study firstly provided the new experimental information for future studies on the effects of NiCl2 on the intestinal function in humans and other animals.

The aim of this study was to investigate on erythrocytes and erythrocyte immune adherence function in broiler chickens fed with high fluorine (F) diets by measuring the total erythrocyte count (TEC), the contents of hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volumn (PCV), erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), erythrocyte C-3b receptor rosette rate (E-C3bRR), and erythrocyte immune complex rosette rate (E-ICRR). A total of 280 1-day-old healthy avian broiler chickens were randomly allotted into four equal groups of 70 birds each and fed with a corn-soybean basal diet containing 22.6 mg F/kg (control group) or same basal diets supplemented with 400, 800, and 1,200 mg F/kg (high F groups I, II, and III) in the form of sodium fluoride for 42 days. Blood samples were collected for the abovementioned parameters analysis at 14, 28, and 42 days of age during the experiment. The experimental results indicated that TEC, Hb, and PCV were significantly lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and EOF was higher (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the high F groups II and III than that in the control group from 14 to 42 days of age. The E-C3bRR was significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in the three high F groups, whereas the E-ICRR was markedly increased (p < 0.01) in the high F groups II and III from 14 to 42 days of age. It was concluded that dietary F in the range of 800 to 1, 200 mg/kg could significantly cause anemia and impair the integrity of erythrocyte membrane, the transport capacity of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and erythrocyte immune adherence function in broiler chickens.

In this study we have examined the mechanisms of control of transcription by plastid signals, focusing on transcription factors. We have also further addressed the physical nature of plastid signals and the physiological role, in stress acclimation of this regulatory pathway. ABI4, a master Apetala 2 (AP2)-type transcription factor (TF), is targeted by multiple signalling pathways in plant cells, such as abscisic acid (ABA) signals, sugar signals and plastid signals derived from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chlorophyll intermediates. ABI4 binds the promoter of target genes to prevent their transcription by competing with other competitive TFs. However, we found that once ABI4 bound the element (CCACGT), it may not be bound by other TFs, therefore making the signalling long-lasting. Downstream of ABI4, CBFA (CCAAT binding factor A) is a subunit of the HAP2/HAP3/HAP5 (Heme activator protein) trimeric transcription complex. CBFA however is a redundant HAP3 subunit. When emergency occurs (such as herbicide treatments or environmental stresses followed by ABA and ROS accumulation), the master transcription factor ABI4 down-regulates some TFs, like CBFA, and then some other TF subunits enter the transcription complex and transcriptional efficiency of stress-responsive genes (including the transcription co-factor CBP) is improved instantaneously. abi4, cbfA and cbp mutants showed weaker drought-tolerance after a herbicide norflurazon treatment, which indicated the physiological role of these key transcription factors.

The microemulsion was successfully prepared using toluene as solvent, emulsifier HSH as surfactant, and methanol as co-surfactant. And its optimal formulation was 4/3/3 (w/w) [oil/SAA (mixture of emulsifier and methanol)/water] selected according to the pseudoternary phase diagrams. In this formulation, SAA consists of emulsifier HSH and methanol with a weight ratio of 4/3. Triadimefon microemulsion did not freeze at -18 degrees C; moreover, the low temperature stability of triadimefon preparations was greatly improved, which was one of the key findings. After observing appearance, centrifuging, and diluting, type of the microemulsion was determined to oil in water. All of the other physicochemical properties including heat storage stability, emulsion stability, and cloud point met the standard of pesticide microemulsion. Its antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA including mycelium growth, sclerotia formation and germination were statistically significant higher than that of 20% triadimefon emulsion from the t-test done by IBM SPSS 19.

Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) the StH genome species from the same areas or neighboring geographic regions are closely related to each other; (2) the Acc1 gene sequences of the StH genome species from North America and Eurasia are evolutionarily distinct; (3) Dasypyrum has contributed to the nuclear genome of Elymus repens and Elymus mutabilis; (4) the StH genome polyploids have higher levels of sequence diversity in the H genome homoeolog than the St genome homoeolog; and (5) the Acc1 sequence may evolve faster in the polyploid species than in the diploids. Our result provides some insight on evolutionary dynamics of duplicate Acc1 gene, the polyploidy speciation and phylogeny of the StH genome species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the potential relationship between MT-CO3 variants and high-altitude adaptation remains poorly understood in Tibetan chicken. Here, we sequenced MT-CO3 gene of 125 Tibetan chickens and 144 Chinese domestic chickens in areas at a low elevation (below 1000 m). Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected; and five of them (m.10081A>G, m.10115G>A, m.10270G>A, m.10336A>G and m.10447C>T) shared by Tibetan chicken and lowland chicken with the significant difference in their respective allele frequencies. Nine haplotypes (H1-H9) were finally defined. Among them, haplotype H4 was positively associated with high-altitude adaptation whereas haplotypes H6, H7 and H8 had negative association with high-altitude adaptation. The Median-joining profile suggested that haplotype H5 had the ancestral position to the other haplotypes but had no significant relationship with high-altitude adaptation. However, there was only m.10081A>G mutation differed from haplotype H4 and H5. Results also suggested that chickens with A allele at m.10081A>G, had over 2.6 times than those with G allele in the probability of the ability to adapt hypoxia. It suggests that the synonymous mutation m.10081A>G may be a prerequisite for shaping high-altitude adaptation-specific haplotypes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, under a high level of atmospheric N deposition, the N distribution and cycling through water flows in forest ecosystems especially in bamboo ecosystems are not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to investigate N fluxes through water flows in a Pleioblastus amarus bamboo forest, event rainfall/snowfall (precipitation, PP), throughfall (TF), stemflow (SF), surface runoff (SR), forest floor leachate (FFL), soil water at the depth of 40 cm (SW1) and 100 cm (SW2) were collected and measured through the whole year of 2009. Nitrogen distribution in different pools in this ecosystem was also measured. Mean N pools in vegetation and soil (0-1 m) were 351.7 and 7752.8 kg ha(-1). Open field nitrogen deposition at the study site was 113.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), which was one of the highest in the world. N-NH4+, N-NO3- and dissolved organic N (DON) accounted for 54%, 22% and 24% of total wet N deposition. Net canopy accumulated of N occurred with N-NO3- and DON but not N-NH4+. The flux of total dissolved N (TDN) to the forest floor was greater than that in open field precipitation by 17.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), due to capture of dry and cloudwater deposition net of canopy uptake. There were significant negative exponential relationships between monthly water flow depths and monthly mean TDN concentrations in PP, TF, SR, FFL and SW1. Conclusions/Significance: The open field nitrogen deposition through precipitation is very high over the world, which is the main way of reactive N input in this bamboo ecosystem. The water exchange and N consume mainly occurred in the litter floor layer and topsoil layer, where most of fine roots of bamboo distributed.

Nevertheless, their expression patterns and the relationship with IMF have been poorly exposed. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), classical Soxhlet extraction, and in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that among 13 goat tissues, expression of PPAR gamma 1 was dramatically higher than that of PPAR gamma 2 except for lung. We further demonstrated the expression patterns of PPAR gamma 1 and PPAR gamma 2 and their negative association with intramuscular fat content in three goat muscles with kids growing. Meanwhile, PPAR gamma expression was located in the connective tissues. These results suggest that PPAR gamma 1 is rather active for most tissues of goat, and closely related with the muscular fat metabolism during early postnatal life, but a more direct proof remains to be provided.

The present study collected 232 sequences from 27 Salvia species through DNA sequencing and 77 sequences within the same taxa from the GenBank. The discriminatory capabilities of these regions were evaluated in terms of PCR amplification success, intraspecific and interspecific divergence, DNA barcoding gaps, and identification efficiency via a tree-based method. ITS1 was superior to the other marker for discriminating between species, with an accuracy of 81.48%. The three combinations did not increase species discrimination. Finally, we found that ITS1 is a powerful barcode for identifying Salvia species, especially Salvia miltiorrhiza. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In Arabidopsis, COP1 is a central repressor of photomorphogenesis in the form of COP1-SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA (SPA) complex(es). CUL4-DDB1-COP1-SPA suppresses the photomorphogenic program by targeting the transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 for degradation. Intriguingly, under photomorphogenic UV-B light, COP1 reverses its repressive role and promotes photomorphogenesis. However, the mechanism by which COP1 is functionally switched is still obscure. Here, we demonstrate that UV-B triggers the physical and functional disassociation of the COP1-SPA core complex(es) from CUL4-DDB1 and the formation of a unique complex(es) containing the UV-B receptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8). The establishment of this UV-B-dependent COP1 complex(es) is associated with its positive modulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 stability and activity, which sheds light on the mechanism of COP1's promotive action in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis.

Inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) are critical for development and molting in nematode parasites and represent potential targets for vaccination. Here, a new PPase homologue, Bsc-PYP-1, from B. schroederi was identified and characterized, and its potential as a vaccine candidate was evaluated in a mouse challenge model. Sequence alignment of PPases from nematode parasites and other organisms show that Bsc-PYP-1 is a nematode-specific member of the family I soluble PPases. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong localization of native Bsc-PYP-1 to the body wall, gut epithelium, ovary and uterus of adult female worms. Additionally, Bsc-PYP-1 homologues were found in roundworms infecting humans (Ascaris lumbricoides), swine (Ascaris suum) and dogs (Toxocara canis). In two vaccine trials, recombinant Bsc-PYP-1 (rBsc-PYP-1) formulated with Freund complete adjuvant induced significantly high antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G but no IgE or IgM responses. Analysis of IgG-subclass profiles revealed a greater increase of IgG1 than IgG2a. Splenocytes from rBsc-PYP-1/FCA-immunized mice secreted low levels of T helper (Th) 1-type cytokines, interferon-. and interleukin (IL)-2, while producing significantly high levels of IL-10 and significantly elevated levels of IL-4 (Th2 cytokines) after stimulation with rBsc-PYP-1 in vitro. Finally, vaccinated mice had 69.02-71.15% reductions (in 2 experiments) in larval recovery 7 days post-challenge (dpc) and 80% survival at 80 dpc. These results suggest that Th2-mediated immunity elicited by rBsc-PYP-1 provides protection against B. schroederi, and the findings should contribute to further development of Bsc-PYP-1 as a candidate vaccine against baylisascariasis.

Four base pair adjacent base substitution mutations (CAAA to TTTT) and eight bp insertion mutations were found in orf366-c compared with orf364. ORF366-C was predicted to contain one membrane-spanning domain using TMHMM online software. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that orf366-c was upregulated in the CMS-C line in comparison to its maintainer line at the uninucleate stage. The protokaryotic protein expression of orf366-c in Escherichia coli showed that ORF366-C could be a cytotoxic protein. All the results indicated that orf366-c may be associated with maize CMS-C.

Effect of Hybridization on Carcass Traits and Meat Quality of Erlang Mountainous Chickens	ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Hybridization; Carcass Traits; Meat Quality; Erlang Mountainous Chicken	GROWING CHICKEN; COMBINING ABILITIES; OUTDOOR ACCESS; RAISED INDOORS; BREAST MUSCLE; BROILER MEAT; GENOTYPES; BREEDS; ASSOCIATION; POPULATIONS	Native chickens hold a significant share of the market in China. In response to the huge demand from the market, the productivity of Chinese native chickens needs to be improved. Cross breeding is an effective method to increase productivity, although it might affect meat quality. In this study, two pure lines (SD02 and SD03) of Erlang mountainous chickens were hybridized with a yellow feather and faster growing line (SD01). The effect of hybridization on carcass and meat quality (physiochemical and textural traits) was measured in the F-1 population at d 91 of age. The hybrids exhibited higher body weight and dressed weight, and amount of semieviscerated, eviscerated, breast muscle and abdominal fat (p<0.05). Abdominal fat yield also increased (p<0.05) compared to the offspring of the two pure-lines. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in meat quality traits except for the myofiber diameter and density and the shear force of the breast muscle. Overall, the offspring of cross-lines were similar to pure lines in meat color, pH value, inosinic acid, crude protein, crude fat, dry matter, moisture content and amino acid composition in the breast muscle. These results suggest that productivity can be improved via cross-breeding while maintaining meat quality of the Erlang mountainous chicken.	[Yin, H. D.; Zhang, Z. C.; Zhao, X.

Recent evidence revealed that MYB-related genes play crucial roles in plants. However, compared with the R2R3-MYB type, little is known about the complex evolutionary history of MYB-related proteins in plants. Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of MYB-related proteins from 16 species of flowering plants, moss, Selaginella, and algae. We identified many MYB-related proteins in angiosperms, but few in algae. Phylogenetic analysis classified MYB-related proteins into five distinct subgroups, a result supported by highly conserved intron patterns, consensus motifs, and protein domain architecture. Phylogenetic and functional analyses revealed that the Circadian Clock Associated 1-like/R-R and Telomeric DNA-binding protein-like subgroups are > 1 billion yrs old, whereas the I-box-binding factor-like and CAPRICE-like subgroups appear to be newly derived in angiosperms. We further demonstrated that the MYB-like domain has evolved under strong purifying selection, indicating the conservation of MYB-related proteins. Expression analysis revealed that the MYB-related gene family has a wide expression profile in maize and soybean development and plays important roles in development and stress responses. We hypothesize that MYB-related proteins initially diversified through three major expansions and domain shuffling, but remained relatively conserved throughout the subsequent plant evolution.

In this study, we used whole-genome sequences from 16 maize inbreds and 1 wild relative to determine SSR abundance and to develop a set of high-density polymorphic SSR markers. A total of 264 658 SSRs were identified across the 17 genomes, with an average of 135 693 SSRs per genome. Marker density was one SSR every of 15.48 kb.(C/G) n, (AT) n, (CAG/CTG)n, and(AAAT/ATTT) n were the most frequent motifs for mono, di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs, respectively. SSRs were most abundant in intergenic region and least frequent in untranslated regions, as revealed by comparing SSR distributions of three representative resequenced genomes. Comparing SSR sequences and e-polymerase chain reaction analysis among the 17 tested genomes created a new database, including 111 887 SSRs, that could be develop as polymorphic markers in silico. Among these markers, 58.00, 26.09, 7.20, 3.00, 3.93, and 1.78% of them had mono, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide motifs, respectively. Polymorphic information content for 35 573 polymorphic SSRs out of 111 887 loci varied from 0.05 to 0.83, with an average of 0.31 in the 17 tested genomes. Experimental validation of polymorphic SSR markers showed that over 70% of the primer pairs could generate the target bands with length polymorphism, and these markers would be very powerful when they are used for genetic populations derived from various types of maize germplasms that were sampled for this study.

In this study, we described the establishment of a simple, sensitive and cost-efficient loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of B. bronchiseptica. A set of primers towards a 235 bp region within the flagellum gene of B. bronchiseptica was designed with online software.. The specificity of the LAMP assay was examined by using 6 porcine pathogens and 100 nasal swabs collected from healthy pigs and suspect infected pigs. The results indicated that positive reactions were confirmed for all B. bronchiseptica and no cross-reactivity was observed from other non-B. bronchiseptica. In sensitivity evaluations, the technique successfully detected a serial dilutions of extracted B. bronchiseptica DNA with a detection limit of 9 copies, which was 10 times more sensitive than that of PCR. Compared with conventional PCR, the higher sensitivity of LAMP method and no need for the complex instrumentation make this LAMP assay a promising alternative for the diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica in rural areas and developing countries where there lacks of complex laboratory services.

The prolyl oligopeptidase family in plants includes four members, which are prolyl oligopeptidase (POP, EC3.4.21.26), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC3.4.14.5), oligopeptidase B (OPB, EC3.4.21.83), and acylaminoacyl peptidase (ACPH, EC3.4.19.1). POP is found in human and rat, and plays important roles in multiple biological processes, such as protein secretion, maturation and degradation of peptide hormones, and neuropathies, signal transduction and memory and learning. However, the function of POP is unclear in plants. In order to study POP function in plants, we cloned the cDNA of the OsPOP5 gene from rice by nested-PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA encodes a protein of 596 amino acid residues with M-w approximate to 67.29 kD. In order to analyze the protein function under different abiotic stresses, OsPOP5 was expressed in Escherichia coli. OsPOP5 protein enhanced the tolerance of E. coli to high salinity, high temperature and simulated drought. The results indicate that OsPOP5 is a stress-related gene in rice and it may play an important role in plant tolerance to abiotic stress.

NOV.; BASE COMPOSITION; I METHANOTROPHS; LIPIDS; TREES	A novel Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped strain designated PG04(T)-was isolated from the rhizosphere of watermelon plants cultivated in Beijing, China. A polyphasic taxonomic study was performed on the new isolate. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies, isolate PG04(T) belonged clearly to the genus Hansschlegelia and was most closely related to Hansschlegelia zhihuaiae (97.3 % similarity to the type strain). The predominant respiratory quinone was ubiquinone 10 (Q-10) and the polar lipid profile was composed of the major lipids diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The major fatty acids were C-18 : 1 omega 7c (41.3 %), C-19 : 0 cyclo omega 8c (30.6%) and C-16 (:) (0) (19.1%). The G + C content of the DNA was about 64.4 mol%. DNA DNA hybridization experiments showed 34.4% relatedness between strain PG04(T) and H. zhihuaiae DSM 18984(T). The results of physiological and biochemical tests and differences in fatty acid profiles allowed clear phenotypic differentiation of strain PG04(T) from the most closely related species in the genus, H. zhihuaiae. Strain PG04(T) therefore represents a novel species within the genus Hansschlegelia, for which the name Hansschlegelia beijingensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain PG04(T)(=DSM 25481(T)=ACCC 05759(T)).

Most Bartonella species appear to share a natural cycle that involves an arthropod transmission, followed by exploitation of a mammalian host in which they cause long-lasting intra-erythrocytic bacteremia. Persistence in erythrocytes is considered an adaptation to transmission by bloodsucking arthropod vectors and a strategy to obtain heme required for Bartonella growth. Bartonella genomes do not encode for siderophore biosynthesis or a complete iron Fe3+ transport system. Only genes, sharing strong homology with all components of a Fe2+ transport system, are present in Bartonella genomes. Also, Bartonella genomes encode for a complete heme transport system. Bartonella must face various environments in their hosts and vectors. In mammals, free heme and iron are rare and oxygen concentration is low. In arthropod vectors, toxic heme levels are found in the gut where oxygen concentration is high. Bartonella genomes encode for 3-5 heme-binding proteins. In Bartonella henselae heme-binding proteins were shown to be involved in heme uptake process, oxidative stress response, and survival inside endothelial cells and in the flea. In this report, we discuss the use of the heme uptake and storage system of B. henselae during its infection cycle. Also, we establish a comparison with the iron and heme uptake systems of Yersinia pestis used during its infection cycle.

A total of 720 1-d-old broilers were used in a 28 d experiment to determine the effects of probiotic supplementation in diets with different dietary nutrient densities.2. Birds were randomly allotted to one of the 4 treatments in a 2x2 factorial arrangement (12 replicateswith 15 broilers per replicate) with two levels of nutrient density [high nutrient density (metabolisable energy (ME) 12.7 MJ/kg and crude protein (CP) 230.3g/kg for 1-7 d; ME 13.2 MJ/kg and CP 220.3g/kg for 8-28 d) or low nutrient density (ME 12.1 MJ/kg and CP 220.2g/kg for 0-7 d; ME 12.6 MJ/kg and CP 209.8g/kg for 8-28 d)] and 0 or 2g/kg probiotics (1.0x10(10) viable spores/g of Bacillus subtilis endospores and 1.0x10(9) viable spores/g of Clostridium butyricum).3. The high-nutrient-density diet increased body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentration relative to the low-nutrient-density diet. High-nutrient-density diet reduced water loss ratio of breast muscle, liver and fat relative to body weight compared to low-nutrient density-diet. The inclusion of probiotics increased BWG and feed intake throughout the experiment. Dietary probiotics increased the percentage of blood lymphocytes and relative weight of spleen and bursa of Fabricius when compared to the non-probiotic treatment. The inclusion of probiotics decreased serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and lightness (L*) value of breast meat compared to the non-probiotic-supplemented diet.4. In conclusion, high dietary nutrient density increased growth performance and serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in broiler chickens. The inclusion of probiotics increased growth performance but reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. The positive effect of probiotic supplementation on growth performance was reduced by the high-nutrient-density diet during the first week of life.	[Chen, W.; Huang, Y.

How RPW8.2 activates defenses at a precise subcellular locale is not known. Here, we report a comprehensive mutational analysis in which more than 100 RPW8.2 mutants were functionally evaluated for their defense and trafficking properties. We show that three amino acid residues (i.e., threonine-64, valine-68, and aspartic acid-116) are critical for RPW8.2-mediated cell death and resistance to powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum UCSC1). Also, we reveal that two arginine (R)- or lysine (K)-enriched short motifs (i.e., R/K-R/K-x-R/K) make up the likely core EHM-targeting signals, which, together with the N-terminal transmembrane domain, define a minimal sequence of 60 amino acids that is necessary and sufficient for EHM localization. In addition, some RPW8.2 mutants localize to the nucleus and/or to a potentially novel membrane that wraps around plastids or plastid-derived stromules. Results from this study not only reveal critical amino acid elements in RPW8.2 that enable haustorium-targeted trafficking and defense, but also provide evidence for the existence of a specific, EHM-oriented membrane trafficking pathway in leaf epidermal cells invaded by powdery mildew.

Drugs to cure avian influenza infection - multiple ways to prevent cell death	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Review						avian influenza virus infection; acute respiratory distress syndrome; cell death; combination therapy; reactive oxygen species	A H7N9 VIRUS; RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME; ACUTE LUNG INJURY; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; SIALIDASE FUSION PROTEIN; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CYCLOSPORINE-A; HUMAN-DISEASE; H5N1 VIRUSES; MICE	New treatments and new drugs for avian influenza virus (AIV) infection are developed continually, but there are still high mortality rates. The main reason may be that not all cell death pathways induced by AIV were blocked by the current therapies. In this review, drugs for AIV and associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are summarized. The roles of antioxidant (vitamin C) and multiple immunomodulators (such as Celecoxib, Mesalazine and Eritoran) are discussed. The clinical care of ARDS may result in ischemia reperfusion injury to poorly ventilated alveolar cells. Cyclosporin A should effectively inhibit this kind of damages and, therefore, may be the key drug for the survival of patients with virus-induced ARDS. Treatment with protease inhibitor Ulinastatin could also protect lysosome integrity after the infection. Through these analyses, a large drug combination is proposed, which may hypothetically greatly reduce the mortality rate.

It is difficult to know how to treat the combined wastewater in tidal rivers at the estuary, where the situation is very different from ordinary fresh water rivers. Waste oyster shell was used as the active filler in this study in a bio-contact oxidation tank to treat the combined wastewater at the Fengtang Tidal River. With a middle-experimental scale of 360 m(3)/day, the average removal efficiency of COD, BOD, NH3-N, TP and TSS was 80.05%, 85.02%, 86.59%, 50.58% and 85.32%, respectively, in this bio-contact oxidation process. The living microbes in the biofilms on the waste oyster shell in this bio-contact oxidation tank, which were mainly composed of zoogloea, protozoa and micro-metazoa species, revealed that waste oyster shell as the filler was suitable material for combined wastewater degradation. This treatment method using waste oyster shell as active filler was then applied in a mangrove demonstration area for water quality improvement near the experiment area, with a treatment volume of 5 x 10(3) m(3)/day. Another project was also successfully applied in a constructed wetland, with a wastewater treatment volume of 1 x 10(3) m(3)/day. This technology is therefore feasible and can easily be applied on a larger scale.

The four paclitaxel derivatives were analyzed using NMR, CD spectroscopy, and side-chain hydrolysis in order to measure their optical rotations and GC characteristics. In this way, the stereoconfigurations of the products were determined. Evaluation of the compounds' activity indicated that they had differing cytotoxic activities: compound 5 had superior activity in BCG-823 tumor cells compared to paclitaxel, while compound 7 had superior activity in HCT-8 and A549 tumor cells compared to paclitaxel. These results indicate that the stereoconfiguration of the paclitaxel N-acyl side chain has a significant impact on its activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study demonstrates that sulfated Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharides (sCVPSs) were potent inhibitors of NDV, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 62.55 to 76.31 mu g ml(-1) in Baby hamster kidney fibroblasts clone 21 (BHK-21) and from 101.57 to 125.90 mu g ml(-1) in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). sCVPS is more effective than heparan sulfate (HS; as a positive control) with IC50 values of 99.28 mu g ml(-1) in BHK-21 and 118.79 mu g ml(-1) in CEF. sCVPSs and HS exhibit anti-NDV activity by prevention of the early stages of viral life. The mechanism of action study indicated that virus adsorption in BHK-21, and both virus adsorption and penetration in CEF were inhibited by sCVPSs. When the number of viruses was increased to an m.o.i. of 0.1 in the immunofluorescence study and to an m.o.i. of 1 in the fluorescent quantitative PCR study, viral infection was also significantly suppressed; the antiviral activity of sCVPSs was independent of the m.o.i. sCVPSs also prevented the cell-to-cell spread of NDV. In vivo tests carried out on specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens showed that sCVPSs also inhibited virus multiplication in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. These results indicated that sCVPSs perform more effectively than HS as antiviral agents against NDV, and can be further examined for their potential as an alternative control measure for NDV infection.

It is therefore important to develop an exact diagnostic technique to detect this parasite. Using a known number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100) of feces-isolated B. schroederi egg and adult DNA, we developed a PCR to detect a portion of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and applied it to giant panda fecal samples. The method was sufficiently sensitive to detect B. schroederi DNA from isolated eggs in a fecal sample with, a detection threshold of one egg. We detected B. schroederi in 88% of fecal samples, 30% higher than the conventional flotation technique. No cross-reactivity with other common nematode DNA was detected. Our PCR assay may constitute a valuable alternative for the diagnosis of B. schroederi infections.

The first one uses microfluidic chambers or microwells to split the sample into hundreds of nanolitre volumes. Microfluidic chips simplify reaction setup; nevertheless, it is challenging to scale to achieve high-throughput. The second one is based on emulsion PCR, called BEAMing. BEAMing requires specialized heterogeneous assay schemes that add complexity to the workflow, thereby limiting its adoption to a few applications including DNA methylation and rare allele detection. All in all, limited throughput, high costs and complicated workflows have hampered the adoption of digital PCR. It is important to develop a method that uses water-in-oil droplets as the enabling technology to realize high-throughput digital PCR in a practical and low-cost format. In this review, we discuss the application areas of droplet digital PCR in low-level detection, determination of copy number variation and the absolute quantitation of circulating DNA in cell-free plasma.

Elymus sensu lato is a group of allopolyploid species, which share a common St genome and with the different combinations of H, Y, P, and W genomes. To estimate the evolutionary process of the rbcL gene in species of Elymus s. l. and its putative dioploid relatives, 74 sequences were obtained from 21 species of Elymus s. I. together with 24 diploid taxa representing 19 basic genomes in Triticeae. Phylogeny and sequence diversity pattern analysis suggested that (1) species of Pseudoroegneria (Nevski) A. Love might serve as the maternal donor of the species of Elymus s. I; (2) differentiation of St genome were shown in the species of Elymus s. I. following polyploidy event; (3) divergences within the species might associate with geographic diversity and morphological variability; (4) differences in the levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity of the rbcL gene implied that the St genome lineages in the species of Elymus s. I. have differently evolutionary potentials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phylogenetic analyses and diversification patterns suggested that (1) a major radiation occurring in the Triticeae about 6.1-9.2 MYA might have been triggered by the late Miocene climate oscillations; (2) the Triticeae lineages from Mediterranean and Arctic-temperate regions were evolutionarily distinct; (3) the relationship between Thinopyrum bessarabicum and Triticum/Aegilops is more closely than that between Lophopyrum elongatum and Triticum/Aegilops; (4) Pseudoroegneria is closely related to Australopyrum and Lophopyrum; (5) Australopyrum might originate from colonization via South-east Asia during the late Miocene; (6) Habitats, mating systems, and climate oscillations may associated with the diversification rate shifts leading to the majority of Mediterranean lineage. Diversification rate shifts in Mediterranean lineage of the Triticeae not only spur the occurrence of many endemic lineages but also provide opportunity for polyploid crop origin and domestication.

The three components were successfully separated on a Shimadzu Shim-pack VP-ODS C-18 reserved phase column (5 mu m, 250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) by gradient elution using acetonitrile and 0.03 % (v/v) phosphoric acid as the mobile phase, the flow rate was 1 mL min(-1) and the detection was set at 288 nm. The linearity was obtained over 0.648-99.06 mu g mL(-1) for protoctechuic aldehyde, 14.63-1786 mu g mL(-1) for salvianolic acid B and 2.561-334.14 mu g mL(-1) for salvianolic acid A. The average recovery rates of protoctechuic aldehyde, salvianolic acid B and salvianolic A were 95.17, 94.06 and 91.43 %, respectively. This method was successfully applied to the determination of three important phenolic acids constituents in 25 samples. The proposed method is simple, effective and suitable for quality control of S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species.

In this work, the optimum extraction conditions of flavonoids from F. cymosum complex leaves were investigated by orthogonal design. Six methodological factors (including alcohol concentration, material-liquid ratio, reaction temperature, distilled time, extraction times and ultrasonic power) were studied using an L18 (3') orthogonal test table. The results showed that the effects of each factor on the extraction of flavonoids in order were as follows: alcohol concentration > materials-liquid ratio > ultrasonic power > extraction times > distilled time > reaction temperature, the effect of alcohol concentration on extraction was extremely significant, while the effect of other factors was not. The highest yield was obtained when alcohol concentration, liquid material ratio, ultrasonic power, extraction times, distillation time, reaction temperature were 60 %, 1:20 (w/v), 70 % (175 w), three times, 20 min and 40 degrees C, respectively. And the crude extract of flavonoids was determined using four kinds of spectrophotometric methods, The results show that the method D (HAC-AlCl3 spectrophotometric method) was the best. It's a simple, accurate and precise method for the determination of flavonoids content in leaves of F. cymosum complex.

Volatile compounds were analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and 56 different volatile compounds were tentatively identified and semi-quantified. The data was subjected to SIMCA-P+13.0 Software. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) were used to predict the tobacco's geographical origin or cultivar using soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) statistical techniques. Both PCA and PLS-DA indicate that all samples could be classified into three clusters coincident to the three geographical origins. The PLS-DA have an average recognition ability of 91.4 %. However, analysis on discriminating tobacco cultivars by volatiles revealed that it is difficult to find any volatile as a distinctive mark to identify these six tobacco cultivars cultured in Sichuan Province.

However, no reports were shown to investigate its transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, we first identified porcine Sixl gene core promoter region (+ 170/-360) using luciferase reporter assay system and found that promoter activities were significantly higher in the mouse myoblast C2C12 cells than that in the mouse fibroblast C3H10T1/2 cells, implying that Six] promoter could possess muscle-specific characteristics. Moreover, our results showed that promoter activities of Sixl were decreased as induction of differentiation of C2C12 cells, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of mRNA expression of Six) gene. In addition, we found that the DNA methylation of Six) promoters in vitro obviously influences the promoter activities and the DNA methylation level of Six) promoter core region was negatively correlated to Six) gene expression in vivo. Taken together, we preliminarily clarified transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of Six) gene, which should be useful for investigating its subtle transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the future. On the other hand, based on Six) involved in tumorigenesis, our data also provide a genetic foundation to control the generation of diseases via pursuing Six1 as therapeutic target gene.

To investigate the evolution and diversity of dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes in the Kengyilia, forty-five homoeologous DAAI gene sequences were isolated from sampled Kengyilia species and analyzed together with those of its close relatives. These results suggested that (1) Kengyilia species from Central Asia and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau had different origins from those of the geographically differentiated P genome; (2) the St and P genomes of Kengyilia were donated by Pseudoroegneria and Agropyron, respectively, and the Y genome had an independent origin and showed an affinity with the St genome; (3) purifying selection dominated the DAAI gene members and the St-DAAI gene was evolving at faster rate than the P- and Y-DAAI genes in Kengyilia; and (4) natural selection was the main factor on the codon usage pattern of the DAAI gene in Kengyilia.

In this study, the first DuCV isolate GH01 was identified in Sichuan by PCR, which shared a high level of nucleotide identity (81.8-99.4%) with sequences of other DuCV isolates available in GenBank. Comparative phylogenetic and pairwise sequence comparison analyses indicated that DuCV could be divided into two genotypes (DuCV-1 and DuCV-2) and six subtypes (la, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b and 2c) based on the complete genome sequence. The results revealed that both DuCV-1 and DuCV-2 had evolved from the same ancestor but undergone divergent evolution. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses indicated that three isolates were classified into a cluster DuCV-2a using complete DuCV genome sequence and cap gene, except rep gene. Recombination analyses revealed that DuCV-2a arose from recombination between DuCV-1a and DuCV-2b isolates within the rep genes, and the recombination events mainly occur both in non-structural protein coding region and structural protein coding region. In addition, the mechanisms of recombination supporting the genetic variability in DuCV isolates were investigated. Likewise, selective pressure indicated that purifying selection had been a major driving force in maintaining diversity among the DuCV isolates. Because eradicating the virus from commercial ducks is impossible, it is necessary to take effective control measures and implement them throughout the world. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Phylogenetic analysis shows that the waterfowl CD8 alpha formed a monophyletic group. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that transcripts of goCD8 alpha mRNA were high in the immune-related organs and mucosal immune system in gosling, and high in thymus and spleen comparing to other immune-related tissues in goose. The obvious increase of CD8 alpha expression was observed in spleen of acute new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) infected bird, while the increase of CD8 alpha were observed in the thymus, bursa of fabricius, and cecum of chronic infected bird. The CD8 alpha mRNA transcription level in spleen mononuclear cells was significantly up-regulated when stimulated by phytohemagglutinin, but not by lipopolysaccharide in vitro. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to examine the responses of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPAR and PPAR) promoter methylation, mRNA expression of genes involved in energy metabolism and metabolite concentrations of intrauterine growth-retarded (IUGR) piglets to dietary folic acid supplementation. According to a 2x2 factorial arrangement, 16 IUGR and 16 normal birth weight (NBW) piglets were fed a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 5mg/kg of folic acid from weaning (day 14) to day 35 of age. Triglycerides in hepatic tissue and plasma were significantly elevated in control diets-fed IUGR piglets compared with NBW piglets but were decreased by dietary folic acid supplementation. Hepatic mRNA expression levels of GR, PPAR, PPAR, fatty acid synthase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in IUGR piglets fed a control diet were significantly higher than that in NBW piglets, and promoter methylation status of GR, PPAR and PPAR in IUGR piglets was reduced significantly compared with NBW piglets. However, the changes in gene expression and DNA methylation status of IUGR piglets were reversed by dietary folic acid supplementation. Hepatic DNA methyltransferase activity was greater with dietary folic acid supplementation regardless of birth weight. Taken together, these results demonstrated that folic acid supplementation during early period of life could prevent the changes of promoter methylation status and gene expressions in the liver of IUGR piglets.

The functions of one molecule in this class, ZIP11/SLC39A11, remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis of the distribution and evolutionary relationships of different ZIP members in eukaryotes and prokaryotes indicated that Zip11, the sole member of gufA subfamily, is an ancient ZIP family member that might have originated in early eukaryotic ancestors. Murine Zip11 mRNA is abundantly expressed in testes and the digestive system including stomach, ileum and cecum. Analysis of cellular zinc content, metallothionein levels, and cell viability under high or low zinc conditions in cells transfected with a murine Zip11 expression plasmid, suggest that Zip11 is a zinc importer. Further, cellular zinc concentrations and metallothionein levels decreased when Zip11 was knocked down. In mice supplemented with zinc, both mRNA and protein levels of Zip11 were slightly up-regulated in several tissues. The metal response element sequences (MREs) upstream of the first exon of Zip11 responded to elevated extracellular zinc concentrations, as assessed by luciferase reporter assays. Mutagenic analysis showed that several of the MREs could regulate Zip11 promoter activity, and metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) was shown to be involved in this process. Collectively, these data suggest that Zip11 has unique protein sequence and structure features, it functions as a cellular zinc transporter, and its expression is at least partially regulated by zinc via hMTF-1 binding to MREs of the Zip11 promoter.

Investigating the performance and evolutionary impacts of pig CNVs requires comprehensive knowledge of their structure and function within and between breeds. In the current study, 4 different programs (i.e., GADA, PennCNV, QuantiSNP, and cnvPartition) were used to analyze Porcine SNP60 genotyping data of 585 pigs from one Large White x Minzhu intercross population to detect copy number variant regions (CNVRs). Overlapping CNVRs recalled by at least 2 programs were used to construct a powerful and comprehensive CNVR map, which contained249 CNVRs (i.e., 70 gains, 43 losses, and 136 gains/losses) and covered 26.22% of the regions in the swine genome. Ten CNVRs, representing different predicted statuses, were selected for validation via quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR); 9/10 CNVRs (i.e., 90%) were validated. When being traced back to the F0 generation, 58 events were identified in only Minzhu F0 parents and 2 events were identified in only Large White F0 parents. A series of CNVR function analyses were performed. Some of the CNVRs functions were predicted, and several interesting CNVRs for meat quality traits and hematological parameters were obtained. A comprehensive and lower false rate genome-wide CNV map was constructed for Large White and Minzhu pig genomes in this study. Our results may provide an important basis for determining the relationship between CNVRs and important qualitative and quantitative traits. In addition, it can help to further understand genetic processes in pigs.

The transcription dynamic process of UL49.5 homologous genes in herpesviruses was reported. However, the transcription dynamic process of DEV UL49.5 gene has not yet been established. In this study, a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (real-time qRT-PCR) assay was established to test the transcription dynamic process of DEV UL49.5 gene, and the recombinant plasmid pUCm-T/UL49.5 was constructed as the standard DNA. The samples prepared from DEV-infected (at different time points) and uninfected cell were detected and calculated. The results demonstrated that the real-time qRT-PCR assay was successfully established. The transcription product of DEV UL49.5 gene was first detected at 0.5 h post infection (p.i.), increased at 8 h p.i. and reached a peak at 60 h p.i. Our results illustrated that DEV UL49.5 gene could be regarded as a late gene. The transcription dynamic process of DEV UL49.5 gene may provide a significant clue for further studies of DEV UL49.5 gene.

Its mixing performances in digestion are completely different from traditional substrates such as animal manures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was employed to investigate mixing performances and determine suitable stirring parameters for efficient biogas production from rice straw. The results from CFD simulation were applied in the anaerobic digestion tests to further investigate their reliability. The results indicated that the mixing performances could be improved by triple impellers with pitched blade, and complete mixing was easily achieved at the stirring rate of 80 rpm, as compared to 20-60 rpm. However, mixing could not be significantly improved when the stirring rate was further increased from 80 to 160 rpm. The simulation results agreed well with the experimental results. The determined mixing parameters could achieve the highest biogas yield of 370 mL (g TS)(-1) (729 mL (g TSdigested)(-1)) and 431 mL (g TS)(-1) (632 mL (g TSdigested)(-1)) with the shortest technical digestion time (T (80)) of 46 days. The results obtained in this work could provide useful guides for the design and operation of biogas plants using rice straw as substrates.

However, it is unable to maintain its stability due to high temperature during the feed pelleting process. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis in the Aspergillus niger N25 phyA (m) gene at residue 44I and 252 T, and they were replaced by glutamic acid and arginine. Single-site mutants I44E-PhyA and T252R-PhyA, as well as double-site mutant I44E/T252R-PhyA, were constructed to improve the thermostability of PhyA through hydrogen bondings and ionic interactions. The three mutant enzymes all showed more than 20 % improvement in thermostability compared to the wild-type enzyme after being heated at 80 A degrees C for 10 min. Their melting temperatures (T (m)) were increased by 1, 1, and 1.2 A degrees C, respectively. The k (m) values of I44E-PhyA, T252R-PhyA, and I44E/T252R-PhyA for sodium phytate were 78, 44, and 79 % lower (P < 0.05) than that of the wild-type enzyme. Overall catalytic efficiency (k (cat)/k (m)) of I44E-PhyA, T252R-PhyA, and I44E/T252R-PhyA was improved by 310, 155, and 84 % (P < 0.05) than that of the wild type, respectively. The catalytic efficiency did not seem to be negatively affected by the improvement in thermostability.

OKGM (Oxidized Konjac glucomannan) is a kind of polysaccharide oxidative degraded from KGM. Added 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 mg/kg OKGM into the diets of S. prenanti. After 60 days feeding trial, WGR (weight gain rate), SGR (specific growth rate), PER (protein efficiency ratio) of groups fed the diet with 8000 mg/kg OKGM was all significantly (P < 0.05) higher; FCR (feed conversion ratio) was significantly lower than the control group whose diet have no OKGM. Hepatopancreas index, spleen index of group 6 whose feed added 8000 mg/kg OKGM were significantly higher and gallbladder index was significantly lower than the control group. Erythrocyte number, leukocyte number of group 5, 6 whose feed added 4000, 8000 mg/kg OKGM were excellent significantly (P < 0.01) more than the control group. At the same time, Erythrocyte phagocytic rate, erythrocyte phagocytic index, neutrophilic granulocyte phagocytic rate, neutrophilic granulocyte phagocytic index of all the groups whose diet added OKGM were significantly higher than the control group. Content of IgM, C-3 of group 4 whose feed added 2000 mg/kg OKGM were significantly more than the control group. As for activity of CAT, group 6 was significantly higher than the control group. When compared activity of SOD, group 6 was significantly higher than group 1, 2, 3. Accordingly, activity of GSH-Px of group 3, 4, 5, 6 were significantly higher than the control group. On the contrary, content of MDA, group 3, 4, 5, 6 whose feed added 1000-8000 mg/kg OKGM was excellent significantly lower than the control group. After injected Aeromonas hydrophila 21 days, only group 6 whose feed added 8000 mg/kg OKGM survived excellent significantly more than the control group. So we can draw a conclusion of that added OKGM in the diets of S. prenanti, not only promoted growth, but also improved immune function, and the best dose was 8000 mg/kg in this experiment.

In order to establish infection, B. henselae must overcome oxidative stress damage produced by the mammalian host and arthropod vector. B. henselae encodes for putative Fe2+ and Mn2+ transporter SitABCD. In B. henselae, SitAB knockdown increases sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. We consistently show that SitAB knockdown decreases the ability of B. henselae to survive in both human endothelial cells and cat fleas, thus demonstrating that the SitABCD transporter plays an important role during the B. henselae infection cycle.

Major QTL for Fusarium crown rot resistance in a barley landrace	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							ESTIMATING DISEASE LOSSES; HORDEUM-VULGARE L.; LINKAGE MAP; BREAD WHEAT; PLANT HEIGHT; HEAD BLIGHT; PSEUDOGRAMINEARUM; POPULATION; GRAMINEARUM; SEVERITY	Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a serious cereal disease in semi-arid regions worldwide. In assisting the effort of breeding cultivars with enhanced resistance, we identified several barley genotypes with high levels of FCR resistance. One of these genotypes, AWCS079 which is a barley landrace originating from Japan, was investigated by developing and assessing three populations of recombinant inbred lines. Two QTL, one located on the long arm of chromosome 1H (designated as Qcrs.cpi-1H) and the other on 3HL (designated as Qcrs.cpi-3H), were found to be responsible for the FCR resistance of this genotype. Qcrs.cpi-1H is novel as no other FCR loci have been reported on this chromosome arm. Qcrs.cpi-3H co-located with a reduced height (Rht) locus and the effectiveness of the former was significantly affected by the latter. The total phenotypic variance explained by these two QTL was over 60 %. Significant effects were detected for each of the QTL in each of the three populations assessed. The existence of these loci with major effects should not only facilitate breeding and exploitation of FCR-resistant barley cultivars but also their further characterization based on fine mapping and map-based gene cloning.

To dissect this complex trait and identify superior alleles, 350 tropical and subtropical maize inbred lines were genotyped using a 1536-SNP array developed from drought-related genes and an array of 56,110 random SNPs. The inbred lines were crossed with a common tester, CML312, and the testcrosses were phenotyped for nine traits under well-watered and water-stressed conditions in seven environments. Using genome-wide association mapping with correction for population structure, 42 associated SNPs (P a parts per thousand currency sign 2.25 x 10(-6) 0.1/N) were identified, located in 33 genes for 126 trait x environment x treatment combinations. Of these genes, three were co-localized to drought-related QTL regions. Gene GRMZM2G125777 was strongly associated with ear relative position, hundred kernel weight and timing of male and female flowering, and encodes NAC domain-containing protein 2, a transcription factor expressed in different tissues. These results provide some good information for understanding the genetic basis for drought tolerance and further studies on identified candidate genes should illuminate mechanisms of drought tolerance and provide tools for designing drought-tolerant maize cultivars tailored to different environmental scenarios.

However, general physically based rainfall-runoff model, such as the XXT model (a hybrid model of TOPographic MODEL and the Xinanjiang model), is difficult to catch the non-linear factors and take full advantages of previous information of rainfall and runoff that is essential to the initial watershed average saturation deficit of each time step. In order to address the issue, this study selected the initial subsurface flow for the whole time series of the XXT model as the breakthrough point, and used the observed runoff and rainfall data of two days before the present day as the inputs of artificial neural network (ANN) and initial subsurface flow of the present day as the output, then integrated ANN into runoff generation module of XXT model and finally tested the integrated model for daily runoff simulation in large-scale and semi-arid Linyi watershed, eastern China. In addition, this work employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to seek the best combination of 6 physical parameters in XXT and a great number of weights in ANN to avoid the local optimization. The results show that the integrated model performs much better than XXT in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Hence, the new integrating approach proposed here is promising for daily rainfall-runoff modeling and can be easily extended to other process-based models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The present study was designed to investigate effects of three zinc chemical forms on H2O2-induced cell apoptosis in IEC-6 cells via analysis of cell vitality, LDH activity, apoptosis percentage, caspase-3 activity, and Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3, -8, and -9 gene expression. Cells were divided into H2O2 and zinc sources+H2O2 groups, and there are three different zinc sources [zinc oxide nanoparticle (nano-ZnO), zinc oxide (ZnO), and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4)] and three concentrations (normal = 25 mu M, medium = 50 mu M, and high = 100 mu M) used in this article. In the present study, we found the striking cytotoxicity of H2O2 higher than 200 mu M on cell vitality, LDH activity, and apoptosis percentage in the cells using five different concentrations (50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mu M) of H2O2 for 4 h. Moreover, we observed that cell vitality was increased, LDH activity and apoptotic percentage were decreased, and gene expression level of Bax and caspase-3 and -9 was markedly reduced, while gene expression level of Bcl-2 and ratio of Bcl-2/Bax were increased in normal concentration groups of nano-ZnO and ZnSO4 compared with H2O2 group, but no significant difference was observed in caspase-8 gene expression. Furthermore, medium or, more intensely, high concentrations of nano-ZnO and ZnSO4 enhanced H2O2-induced cell apoptosis. Compared with nano-ZnO and ZnSO4, ZnO showed weakest protective effect on H2O2-induced apoptosis at normal concentration and was less toxic to cells at high level. Taken together, we proposed that preventive and protective effects of zinc on H2O2-induced cell apoptosis varied in IEC-6 cells with its chemical forms and concentrations, and maybe for the first time, we suggested that nano-ZnO have a protective effect on H2O2-induced cell apoptosis in IEC-6 cells.

In the present study, DurocxLandracexYorkshire (DLY) pig PID1 cDNA was cloned. The entire open reading frame of the cloned porcine PID1 is 654 bp. The predicted protein is composed of 217 amino acids residues with a molecular mass of 24,774 Da. Over-expression of porcine PID1 significantly accelerated the proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte, but inhibited preadipocyte differentiation by decreasing the numerous fat droplets appeared and down-regulating the mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, fat acid synthase and lipoprotein lipase. Together, these results suggest that porcine PID1 plays a role in regulating adipose development.

It can cause severe baylisascariasis which is highly infectious in its natural hosts. A rapid and reliable diagnosis of parasite infections is crucial to protect giant pandas, as well as for environmental monitoring and disease surveillance. Here, we established a specific PCR assay for B. schroederi detection which was targeting a 331-bp long fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene. Fifty fresh fecal samples collected from captive giant pandas were tested by the established PCR assay and the traditional flotation technique. DNA extracted from a single B. schroederi egg could be successfully amplified, while no cross-reactivity was found with DNA from Ancylostoma caninum eggs. The detection rate of the PCR assay was 68%, which was higher than that of the traditional egg flotation (46%). Our findings demonstrated that the PCR assay is sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of B. schroederi eggs. Therefore, it could become a useful tool for the investigation of B. schroederi infections in giant pandas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fifty-seven fecal samples were collected from giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda (CCRCGP) in Sichuan and examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts by Sheather's sugar flotation technique. An 18-year-old male giant panda was Cryptosporidium positive, with oocysts of an average size of 4.60 x 3.99 mu m (n = 50). The isolate was genetically analyzed using the partial 18S rRNA, 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and actin genes. Multi-locus genetic characterization indicated that the present isolate was different from known Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. The closest relative was the Cryptosporidium bear genotype, with 11, 10, and 6 nucleotide differences in the 18S rRNA, HSP70, and actin genes, respectively. Significant differences were also observed in the COWP gene compared to Cryptosporidium mongoose genotype. The homology to the bear genotype at the 18S rRNA locus was 98.6%, which is comparable to that between Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis (99.2%), or between Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium andersoni (99.4%). Therefore, the Cryptosporidium in giant pandas in this study is considered as a new genotype: the Cryptosporidium giant panda genotype. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to reveal the association between FTO and growth and meat quality traits in rabbits. A total of eight coding SNPs were detected, and four SNPs of them in exon 3 were further genotyped for association analysis in 442 rabbits from three breeds, including 248 New Zealand rabbits, 92 Ira rabbits, and 102 Champagne rabbits. Because there were significant differences for the allele and genotype frequencies among breeds, the association analysis was independently conducted in each breed only for these SNPs with minor allele frequency >5.0%. The results revealed that non-synonymous SNP c.499G > A (p.A167T) was significantly associated with body weight (BW) at 35, 70, and 84 days of age in New Zealand rabbits (P < 0.01). The CC genotype of synonymous SNP c.660T > C was significantly associated with higher BW84, average daily weight gain, and intramuscular fat content of longissimus lumborum than TT and TC genotypes in Ira rabbits (P < 0.05). There were no associations between the four SNPs and growth and meat quality traits in Champagne rabbits. Meanwhile, FTO SNPs were not associated with meat pH value. Our data indicated that FTO gene could be a candidate gene associated with growth and meat quality traits in rabbits. However, the breed-specific effect should be carefully taken into consideration.

Electroantennography and a Y-tube olfactometer were used to compare and analyze electroantennogram and behavioral responses of unmated male and female adults to the volatiles from V. awabuki (both undamaged and infested plants). The results of the GC-MS analysis showed that phytosterol and alkane are major volatiles for V. awabuki. The relative content of V. awabuki volatiles changed during the day. Electroantennogram and behavioral responses of unmated male and female adults to the volatiles from both undamaged and infested plants of V. awabuki were stronger between 08:00 and 10:00 and 16:00 and 18:00, which is consistent with early morning and evening feeding behaviors of adults in the field.

In this study, we have cloned the full-length cDNA sequence for AgRP in a cyprinid fish (Schizothorax prenanti). The AgRP gene, encoding 126-amino acids, was strongly expressed in the brain. The AgRP gene was detected in embryos at developmental stages. Further, its mRNA was detectable in unfertilized eggs. An experiment was conducted to determine the expression profile of AgRP during short-term and long-term fasting of the hypothalamus. The expression level of AgRP in unfed fish was significantly increased at 3 and 4 h post-fasting than in fed fish but did not affect AgRP mRNA expression after 14 days fasting. Overall, our results suggest that AgRP is a conserved peptide that might be involved in the regulation of short-term feeding and other physiological function in Schizothorax prenanti.

In order to better protect these endangered animals, it is necessary to better understand their digestive physiology and nutritional requirements. The gut microbiota is nutritionally important for herbivorous animals. However, little is known about the microbial diversity in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the white rhinoceros. Methanogen diversity in the GIT may be host species-specific and, or, function-dependent. To assess methanogen diversity in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses, an archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed from pooled PCR products obtained from the feces of seven adult animals. Results: Sequence analysis of 153 archaeal 16S rRNA sequences revealed 47 unique phylotypes, which were assigned to seven operational taxonomic units (OTUs 1 to 7). Sequences assigned to OTU-7 (64 out of 153 total sequencs - 42%) and OTU-5 (18%, 27/153) had 96.2% and 95.5% identity to Methanocorpusculum labreanum, respectively, making Methanocorpusculum labreanum the predominant phylotype in these white rhynoceroses. Sequences belonging to OTU-6 (27%, 42/153) were related (97.6%) to Methanobrevibacter smithii. Only 4% of the total sequences (6/153) were assigned to Methanosphaera stadtmanae (OTU-1). Sequences belonging to OTU-2 (4%, 6/153), OTU-3 (3%, 5/153) and OTU-4 (2%, 3/153) were distantly related (87.5 to 88,4%) to Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and were considered to be novel species or strains that have yet-to-be cultivated and characterized. Conclusion: Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the methanogen species in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses were more similar to those in the hindgut of horses. Our findings may help develop studies on improving the digestibility of forage for sustainable management and better health of these endangered animals.

They have a central function in the post-transcriptional regulation during pathogenic lifestyles. Hfq, an RNA-binding protein that many sRNAs act in conjunction with, is required for Y. pestis pathogenesis. However, information on how Yersinia pestis modulates the expression of sRNAs during infection is largely unknown. Methodology and Principal Findings: We used RNA-seq technology to identify the sRNA candidates expressed from Y. pestis grown in vitro and in the infected lungs of mice. A total of 104 sRNAs were found, including 26 previously annotated sRNAs, by searching against the Rfam database with 78 novel sRNA candidates. Approximately 89% (93/104) of these sRNAs from Y. pestis are shared with its ancestor Y. pseudotuberculosis. Ninety-seven percent of these sRNAs (101/104) are shared among more than 80 sequenced genomes of 135 Y. pestis strains. These 78 novel sRNAs include 62 intergenic and 16 antisense sRNAs. Fourteen sRNAs were selected for verification by independent Northern blot analysis. Results showed that nine selected sRNA transcripts were Hfq-dependent. Interestingly, three novel sRNAs were identified as new members of the transcription factor CRP regulon. Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that Y. pestis from the infected lungs induced the expressions of six sRNAs including RyhB1, RyhB2, CyaR/RyeE, 6S RNA, RybB and sR039 and repressed the expressions of four sRNAs, including CsrB, CsrC, 4.5S RNA and sR027. Conclusions and Significance: This study is the first attempt to subject RNA from Y. pestis-infected samples to direct high-throughput sequencing. Many novel sRNAs were identified and the expression patterns of relevant sRNAs in Y. pestis during in vitro growth and in vivo infection were revealed. The annotated sRNAs accounted for the most abundant sRNAs either expressed in bacteria grown in vitro or differentially expressed in the infected lungs. These findings suggested these sRNAs may have important functions in Y. pestis physiology or pathogenesis.

PKoV is distributed worldwide with high prevalence in clinically healthy pigs and those with diarrhea. Methods: Fecal and intestinal samples (n = 163) from pig farms in Sichuan Province, China were obtained to determine the presence of PKoV using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Specific primers were used for the amplification of the gene encoding the PKoV VP1 protein sequence. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to clarify evolutionary relationships with other PKoV strains. Results: Approximately 53% (87/163) of pigs tested positive for PKoV. PKoV was widespread in asymptomatic pigs and those with diarrhea. A high prevalence of PKoV was observed in pigs younger than 4 weeks and in pigs with diarrhea. Phylogenetic analysis of 36 PKoV VP1 protein sequences showed that Sichuan PKoV strains formed four distinct clusters. Two pigs with diarrhea were found to be co-infected with multiple PKoV strains. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed diversity within the same host and between different hosts. Significant recombination breakpoints were observed between the CHN/SC/31-A1 and CHN/SC/31-A3 strains in the VP1 region, which were isolated from the same sample. Conclusion: PKoV was endemic in Sichuan Province regardless of whether pigs were healthy or suffering from diarrhea. Based on our statistical analyses, we suggest that PKoV was the likely causative agent of high-mortality diarrhea in China from 2010. For the first time, we provide evidence for the co-existence of multiple PKoV strains in one pig, and possible recombination events in the VP1 region. Our findings provide further insights into the molecular properties of PKoV, along with its epidemiology.

In this study, the preproghrelin cDNA sequence was cloning in the gut of Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti). The preproghrelin gene, encoding 103-amino acids, was strongly expressed in the gut and brain using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The S. prenanti preproghrelin was detected in embryonic developmental stages. Further, it was detectable in unfertilized eggs, suggesting that ghrelin could be classified as maternal mRNA. An experiment was conducted to determine the expression profile of ghrelin during post-feeding and fasting status of the brain and gut. The results revealed a significant postprandial decrease in ghrelin mRNA expression in the gut 6 h post-feeding (hpf) and brain (1.5 and 9 hpf) compared to an unfed control group, indicating that food intake and processing affect the regulation of expression of ghrelin in S. prenanti. The constructed recombinant plasmid pMD-19 T-ghrelin was transformed to Escherichia coli BL21 and induced with IPTG, and the expressed product was identified by SDS-PAGE. The prokaryotic expression vector for ghrelin was constructed successfully, and fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21, which laid the foundation for the further study on the function of this protein and its mechanism. Overall, our results provide evidence for a highly conserved structure and biological actions of ghrelin in S. prenanti. Further studies are required to identify the tissue specific functions of ghrelin in S. prenanti. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the essential role of vitamin A in chicken reproduction, we measured RBP4 mRNA abundance in Erlang mountainous chickens. We also identified and analyzed the gene polymorphism and its effect on reproduction traits among 349 chickens. The expression of RBP4 mRNA showed specific developmental changes and striking differences among tissues. The mRNA abundance was greatest (P < 0.05) in the liver, intermediate in the ovary, kidney, small intestine, oviduct and heart, and lowest in the hypothalamus and pituitary, as compared to all other tissues (P< 0.05). We detected one single nucleotide polymorphism (g.19942455C>G) in intron 2 of the RBP4 gene. Three genotypes (CC, CG and GG) were identified, with a significant effect of genotype on the age at first egg (AFE), first egg weight (FEW), total eggs at 300 days (TE300), highest continuous laying days (HCLD) and average laying interval (ALI). The GG genotype, where chickens display earlier AFE, more TE300, longer HCLD and shorter ALI, would be genetically advantageous and its selection may improve reproduction traits. These results suggested that the RBP4 gene might play an important role in reproduction traits in chickens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Avian TLR are slightly different from their mammalian counterparts, including the pseudogene TLR8, the absence of TLR9, and the presence of TLR1La, TLR1Lb, TLR15, and TLR21. Avian TLR3 and TLR7 are involved in RNA virus recognition, especially highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), while TLR15 and TLR21 are potential sensors that recognize both RNA viruses and bacteria. However, the agonist of TLR15 is still unknown. Interestingly, chickens, unlike ducks, geese and finches, lack RIG-I, however they do express melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) which functionally compensates for the absence of RIG-I. Duck RIG-I is the cytosolic recognition element for HPAIV recognition, while chicken cells sense HPAIV through MDA5. However, the contributions of MDA5 and RIG-I to IFN-beta induction upon HPAIV infection is different, and this may contribute to the chicken's susceptibility to highly pathogenic influenza. It is noteworthy that the interactions between avian DNA viruses and PRR have not yet been reported. Furthermore, the role for avian Nod-like receptors (NLR) in viral immunity is largely unknown. In this review, recent advances in the field of viral recognition by different types of PRR in birds are summarized. In particular, the tissue and cellular distribution of avian PRR, the recognition and activation of PRR by viruses, and the subsequent expression of innate antiviral genes such as type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines are discussed.

It shows potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. However, Cefquinome is susceptible to hydrolysis, which limiting its clinical employment efficacies to some extent. So, in this study, to increase Cefquinome Sulfate biological half-life, a novel Cefquinome Sulfate proliposome was prepared by solid dispersion and effervescent techniques and characterized for morphology, particle size, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release. A Reversed Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was first chosen and established to determine the drug concentration in plasma after intra muscular (IM) administrating Cefquinome Sulfate solution and liposome at a single dosage of 18 mg/kg in rabbit. Then their pharmacokinetics in vivo was compared. Results showed that the received liposome was milky white suspension, spherical or ellipsoidal in shape. The mean particle size was 203 +/- 5 nm and the entrapment efficiency was 53.5 +/- 0.16%. The cefaquinom sulfate solution and liposome both followed a two compartment model, in vivo. The pharmacokinetic parameters for the solution and liposomal formulations were measured as follows: t(1/2 alpha) were (1.214 +/- 0.135) h and (1.395 +/- 0.113) h, t(1/2 beta) were (8.752 +/- 0.846) h and (16.503 +/- 1.275) h, AUC((0-24)) were (49.582 +/- 9.173) (mg.h)/L and (138.727 +/- 11.034) (mg.h)/L, CL/F were (0.357 +/- 0.015) L/(h.kg) and (0.127 +/- 0.012) L/(h.kg), MRT(0-24) were (2.68 +/- 0.229) h and (5.945 +/- 0.479) h, respectively. It could be clearly seen that t(1/2 beta) of liposome prolonged (p < 0.05), AUC and MRT both increased remarkably (p < 0.01), CL/F decreased. Results indicated that this preparation has more residence time and exhibits some sustained-release tendency.

To investigate the effect of dietary vitamins on the cecal bacterial communities, 2 bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from pooled PCR products obtained from the cecal digesta of 28-d broilers fed diets with vitamins (V) at the NRC level or with no vitamins (NV). The results showed that BW gain and average feed intake of V broilers was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than NV broilers, whereas the feed/gain ratio was significantly lower (P < 0.01) in V broilers. A total of 188 and 185 clones were sequenced for the NV and V broilers, respectively. Sequence identity criterion of 98% was used to assign sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTU). Clones from the NV group broilers were assigned to 14 OTU, with 33% clones affiliated with the genus Clostridium, 19% affiliated with the genera Escherichia/Shigella, 14% affiliated with the genus Bacteroides, and the remaining clones (34%) affiliated with 5 other bacterial genera (Faecalibacterium, Parasporobacterium, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Subdoligranulum). Clones from the V group broilers were assigned to 23 OTU, with 46% of the clones affiliated with the genus Clostridium, 11% affiliated with the genus Fecalibacterium, and the remaining clones (43%) affiliated with 8 other genera (Anaerofilum, Lactobacillus, Anaerotruncus, Oscillibacter, Alistipes, Gracilibacter, Acetivibrio, and Haloplasma). Three OTU assigned to Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminoccus were shared between the 2 libraries. Shannon diversity index showed the V broilers exhibited significantly higher bacterial diversity (P = 0.05), and Libshuff analysis indicated that the community structure between the 2 groups was significantly different (P < 0.0001). These results suggest that lack of dietary vitamins can increase the ratio of facultative pathogenic bacteria and decrease the diversity of bacteria in the cecum of broilers. Our results provide new leads for further investigations on the interaction between dietary vitamin additives and the gut health of broilers.

Merr.; growth retardant; morphological characters soybean; third trifoliolate stage; uniconazole	SHADE; YIELD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; AGRICULTURE; CHLOROPHYLL; ARABIDOPSIS; HORMONES; QUALITY; MAIZE	Due to light limit under maize/soybean relay strips intercropping system, soybean is thin and weak at seedling stage. Uniconazole is a plant growth retardant that could reduce plant stem elogation and increase lateral growth. For a better understanding, the respose of soybean to uniconazole at V-4 (The third trifoliolate leaf fully developed), morphological characters such as the height, the diameter of stem, the leaf morphological and the content of chlorophyll of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] cv. Gongxuan 1 was studied. The results showed that plant hight and stem slenderness ratio (H : D) decreased and stem diameter increased after seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 mg/kg seed). Uniconazole also significantly increased the petiole length, leaf length and leaf width. In addition, it enhanced the content of chlorophyll and the ratio of chl a and chl b. Thus, results suggested that uniconazole treatment could improve plant growth which would be conducive to greater use of light source areas and favourable to gain light sources efficiently.

A factorial completely randomized design was used for experimentation. Plant cuts by 15-16 cm in length and 3.0 mm in diameter with three nodes were treated with different dosages (0 similar to 400 mg/l) of NAA for different soaking time (10 similar to 30 min). After 30 days, the cuttings were removed from the rooting medium for observations. It was found that the rooting per cent, length of the longest primary root, number of primary roots, root dry weight per cutting, root vigour, root to shoot dry weight ratio, the number of leaves per cutting and shoot dry weight per cutting were significantly influenced by the NAA dosage. Treatment with lower dosage of NAA increased rooting parameters, whereas higher dosage NAA suppressed these parameters. Furthermore, interactive effect between NAA dosage and soaking time on rooting response was also significant. Overall, the investigations suggested that 200 mg/l NAA and 20 mm soaking time can be used to maximize rooting and produce high quality planting stem material for clonal propagation grass programme of H. compressa.

In this study these alpha-gliadin genes from diploid Triticeae species were systemically characterized, and divided into 3 classes according to the distinct organization of their protein domains. Our analyses indicated that these alpha-gliadins varied in the number of cysteine residues they contained. Most of the alpha-gliadin genes were grouped according to their genomic origins within the phylogenetic tree. As expected, sequence alignments suggested that the repetitive domain and the two polyglutamine regions were responsible for length variations of alpha-gliadins as were the insertion/deletion of structural domains within the three different classes (I, II, and III) of alpha-gliadins. A screening of celiac disease toxic epitopes indicated that the alpha-gliadins of the class II, derived from the Ns genome, contain no epitope, and that some other genomes contain much fewer epitopes than the A, S(B) and D genomes of wheat. Our results suggest that the observed genetic differences in alpha-gliadins of Triticeae might indicate their use as a fertile ground for the breeding of less CD-toxic wheat varieties.

Evaluation and Comparison of Composting Rabbit Manure Mixed with Mushroom Residue and Rice Straw	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Composting; Livestock; Microbial Diversity; Mixture; Recycle	CATTLE FEEDLOT MANURE; SOUTHERN ALBERTA; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; MOISTURE CONTENTS; SOIL; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; EMISSION; MATURITY; PCR	The purpose of this study was to look for carbon materials for composting with rabbit manure. Rabbit manure was composted with rice straw and mushroom residues. During the composting process, different related parameters were evaluated. Results showed that the rabbit manure could be normally co-composted with rice straw or with mushroom residues. The GI value showed that both composts could help seed growth. By comparing the effects of the two composts, the rabbit manure co-composted with rice straw had a much greater effect on improving seed growth. The results showed that co-composting rabbit manure with rice straw and mushroom residues was a much more efficient method to utilize the material. Rabbit manure mixed with rice straw has also been shown to compost much more efficiently than with mushroom residues.

The experiment consisted of nine treatment combinations with three levels of N (0, 0.65 and 1.3 g per pot) and three levels of drought stress (soil moisture at 40%, 60% and 80% field capacity, FC). N fertilization promoted growth in terms of height and basal diameter, and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of E. grandis saplings across all water treatments. Compared with those that were not given N, the metabolism of N-treated saplings appeared to be more active and possessed better osmoregulatory ability due to higher leaf water potential (LWp) and Pn across all water treatments. N addition (especially 1.3 g N) was likely to have a promotive action on water consumption in the saplings by enhancing gas exchange, resulting in reduced leaf relative water content (LRWC) and leaf vapor pressure deficit (VpdL) in the face of severe drought. N application does not appear to benefit E. grandissaplings under severe drought condition.

The results showed that the ethanol-type fermentation dominated in both digestion processes when OLR was at low levels (<2.0 g(VS) L-1 d(-1)). The propionic acid was rapidly accumulated as OLR was increased to higher levels (>2.0 g(VS) L-1 d(-1)), which could cause unstable anaerobic digestion. Single-phase digestion was better than two-phase digestion in term of 4.1% increase in CH4 production at lower OLRs (<2.0 g(VS)L-1 d(-1)). However, at higher level of OLR (>= 2.0 g(VS) L-1 d(-1)), two-phase digestion achieved higher CH4 production of 0.351-0.455 L (g VS)(-1) d(-1), which were 7.0-15.8% more than that of single-phase. Additionally, two-phase digestion presented more stable operation, and higher OLR treatment capacity. Furthermore, comparison of these two systems with bioenergy recovery revealed that two-phase system overall presented higher bioenergy yield than single-phase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Jian). Fish were fed with six different experimental diets containing graded levels of choline at 165 (choline-deficient control), 310, 607, 896, 1167 and 1820 mg kg(-1) diet for 65 days. At the end of the feeding trail, Fish were challenged with AH and mortalities were recorded over 17 days. Dietary choline significantly enhanced spleen and head kidney weights, spleen index, red blood cell and white blood cell counts, and intestinal Lactobacillus counts of juvenile Jian carp; whereas, intestinal Escherichia coli and A. hydrophila counts decreased. Moreover, the post-challenge survival rate, leucocyte phagocytic capacity, serum lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, hemagglutination titer, complement 3 and 4 contents, immunoglobulin M content, and anti-AM antibody titer were significantly enhanced by choline and the lowest in choline-deficient group, while serum total iron-binding capacity was the highest in choline-deficient group. The relative gene expressions of interleukin 10 in spleen and head kidney, target of rapamycin (TOR) in spleen and eIF4E-binding protein2 (4E-BP2) in head kidney significantly increased with increasing of dietary choline up to a certain point. However, the relative gene expressions of interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta 2 in spleen and head kidney, TOR in head kidney and 4E-BP2 in spleen significantly decreased. In conclusion, dietary choline improved disease resistance, enhanced the immune function, and regulated immune-related gene expression of juvenile Jian carp. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with AFB1 group, the percentages of apoptotic thymocytes detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method and flow cytometry method in three +Se groups were decreased, the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax, through quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical method, in three +Se groups were decreased, while the expression of Bcl-2 was increased. The results indicate that sodium selenite supplied in the diet, through a mechanism of apoptosis regulation, may ameliorated AFB(1)-induced lesions of thymus and accordingly improve the impaired cellular immune function.

Firstly, two LCF life prediction models based on total strain energy density and Support Vector Regression (SVR) meta-model are presented for turbine disk alloy GH4133 under different loading conditions at 250 degrees C. Compared with the SWT model, modified Walker model and Response Surface (RS) model, the predicted lives by the proposed models are within a factor of +/- 2 and a factor of +/- 1.1 respectively. Secondly, based on the fatigue design criteria, the probabilities of failure are calculated using SPA for the explicit and implicit performance functions using two proposed LCF models and viscosity-based model. These three models have provided the reliability design rules for GH4133. Finally, the failure probabilities curves between SPA and the designed fatigue lives are achieved. The reliability analysis results were found to be in good agreement with the calculated results of test data. These results show that SPA is very apt for the fatigue reliability analysis of turbine disk under different loading conditions using only a small number of samples without any distribution assumptions for random variables. Moreover, it can be used to estimate the system's probability of failure with a large number of random variables or high nonlinearity of performance functions. The effectiveness and accuracy of the combination of the fatigue models and SPA for fatigue reliability analysis are verified using three examples.

Firstly, solution space generation method is found application to generate feasible initial population. Secondly, chaos optimization is adopted to optimize initial population. Thirdly, new selective operators, trigonometric selective operators, are proposed to overcome the fitness requirement of non-negative and to maintain the diversity of population. Fourthly, adaptive probabilities of crossing and mutation are adopted in order to improve the convergence speed of GA. Besides, elitist strategy is used to ensure that the best individual can be remained in each generation. Furthermore, the performance of these proposed improvement strategies was checked against the historical improvement strategies by simulating optimal operation of Three Gorges cascade reservoirs premised on historical hourly inflows, and the comparison yields indications of superior performance. In these proposed improvement strategies, trigonometric selective operators are feasible and effective for optimizing operation of cascade reservoirs. These new selective operators could help GA to find a more excellent solution in the same algebra, and the performance of convergence speed is advanced. Adaptive probabilities of crossing and mutation have better performance than other improvement strategies, such as annealing chaotic mutation and simulated annealing of large probability of mutation, because this method realizes the twin goals of maintaining diversity in the population and advancing the convergence speed of GA.

Scheffersomyces stipitis is able to reduce furfural and HMF to less toxic furanmethanol and furan-2,5-dimethanol; however, the enzymes involved in the reductive reaction still remain unknown. In this study, transcription responses of two known and five putative alcohol dehydrogenase genes from S. stipitis were analyzed under furfural and HMF stress conditions. All the seven alcohol dehydrogenase genes were also cloned and overexpressed for their activity analyses. Our results indicate that transcriptions of SsADH4 and SsADH6 were highly induced under furfural and HMF stress conditions, and the proteins encoded by them exhibited NADH- and/or NADPH-dependent activities for furfural and HMF reduction, respectively. For furfural reduction, NADH-dependent activity was also observed in SsAdh1p and NAD(P)H-dependent activities were also observed in SsAdh5p and SsAdh7p. For HMF reduction, NADPH-dependent activities were also observed in SsAdh5p and SsAdh7p. SsAdh4p displayed the highest NADPH-dependent specific activity and catalytic efficiency for reduction of both furfural and HMF among the seven alcohol dehydrogenases. Enzyme activities of all SsADH proteins were more stable under acidic condition. For most SsADH proteins, the optimum temperature for enzyme activities was 30 A degrees C and more than 50 % enzyme activities remained at 60 A degrees C. Reduction activities of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, isovaleraldehyde, benzaldehyde, and phenylacetaldehyde were also observed in some SsADH proteins. Our results indicate that multiple alcohol dehydrogenases in S. stipitis are involved in the detoxification of aldehyde inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic biomass conversion.

Dectin-1 gene polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to nonspecific digestive disorders and cytokine expression in rabbits	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						case-control study; cytokine; dectin-1; nonspecific digestive disorders; rabbits; single nucleotide polymorphism	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; C-TYPE LECTIN; BETA-GLUCAN RECOGNITION; ACTIVE CROHNS-DISEASE; GROWING RABBIT; TH17 CELLS; ENTEROPATHY; MACROPHAGES; DEFICIENCY; CLEC7A	Dectin-1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation by recognizing the pathogenic agents and mediating cytokine responses. The objective of this study was to establish the association between dectin-1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to nonspecific digestive disorders (NSDD) and cytokine expression in rabbits. A total of 7 coding SNP were detected in dectin-1 gene. The genetic association between SNP (ss707197675A > G) and susceptibility to NSDD was evaluated using a case-control study (178 cases and 174 controls). The results revealed that the A allele was associated with an increased risk of developing NSDD in rabbits. The AA genotype significantly increased the genetic susceptibility to NSDD with odds ratio of 4.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.92-12.50, P = 0.0002) compared with GG and GA genotypes. We also experimentally induced NSDD in another independent growing rabbit population by feeding a low-fiber diet and subsequently investigated the cytokine mRNA expression. Among the 4 studied cytokines, the expression of interferon-gamma, IL-17F, and IL-22 were increased 2.8 to 6.0-fold in AA genotype compared with GG genotype (P < 0.01). The greater IL-17F and IL-22 mRNA expressions indicated a positive correlation with severe intestinal inflammation (P < 0.05). The decreased expression of IL-10 was associated with severe intestinal inflammation (P = 0.006), but IL-10 expression was not influenced by dectin-1 genotype. In conclusion, polymorphism ss707197675 of dectin-1 is related with susceptibility to NSDD and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and dectin-1 could be an important candidate gene associated with NSDD in rabbits.

In this study, the transcriptional response of maize roots to Pi starvation at 3 days after the onset of Pi deprivation was assessed. The investigation revealed a total of 283 Pi-responsive genes, of which 199 and 84 genes were found to be either up- or down-regulated respectively, by 2-fold or more. Pi-responsive genes were found to be involved in sugar and nitrogen metabolic pathways, ion transport, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and other processes related to growth and development. In addition, the expression patterns of maize inorganic phosphorus transporters, acid phosphatase, phytase, 2-deoxymugineic acid synthase1, POD and MYB transcription factor were validated in 178 roots response to low phosphorus stress. of which, two genes encoding phytase and acid phosphatase were significantly induced by Pi deficiency and may play a pivotal role in the process of absorption and re-utilization of Pi in Maize. These results not only enhance our knowledge about molecular processes associated with Pi deficiency, but also facilitate the identification of key molecular determinants for improving Pi use in maize. Moreover, this work sets a framework to produce Pi-specific maize microarrays to study the changes in global gene expression between Pi-efficient and Pi-inefficient maize genotypes.

The vast majority were classified as G1 genotype (n = 82), and two samples from human patients in Sichuan province were identified as G3 genotype. Based on the concatenated sequences of nad1 + atp6, 28 different haplotypes (NA1-NA28) were identified. A parsimonious network of the concatenated sequence haplotypes showed star-like features in the overall population, with NA1 as the major haplotype in the population networks. By AMOVA it was shown that variation of E. granulosus within the overall population was the main pattern of the total genetic variability. Neutrality indexes of the concatenated sequence (nad1 + atp6) were computed by Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests and showed high negative values for E. granulosus, indicating significant deviations from neutrality. F-ST and Nm values suggested that the populations were not genetically differentiated. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We characterized a germplasm collection of 118 Ae. tauschii accessions for response to stripe rust, a devastating disease caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). We evaluated tillering stage and adult-plant resistance to stripe rust using prevalent Pst races from the United States and China. Resistant accessions predominated in Ae. tauschii subsp. strangulata and Ae. tauschii subsp. tauschii from the Caspian Sea region. We further analyzed the inheritance of stripe rust resistance by inoculating F 2 plants of 60 crosses with a mixture of Chinese Pst races. Crosses between resistant and susceptible lines indicated both dominant and recessive inheritance. Tests of allelism among 14 highly resistant accessions indicated the common presence of YrAS2388, previously mapped on chromosome arm 4DS, in all accessions. In conclusion, the study presented valuable data on stripe rust resistance in Ae. tauschii, which assist with informed introgression of the D-genome trait for stripe rust resistance in common wheat.

The experimental design scheme was 0 (CK), 40 (A(1)), 80 (A(2)) and 120 g pot(-1) (A(3)) of E. grandis leaves, and changes in the volatile oil chemical composition during litter decomposition were assessed in the present study. The results showed that C. septentrionale leaf litter inhibited the growth of E. grandis saplings, as determined by the height, basal diameter and chlorophyll content, after 69 d (T1). Five months after transplantation (T2), the height growth rate of the E. grandis saplings increased and then gradually reduced (A(1): 40 g pot(-1) > A(2): 80 g pot(-1) > A(3): 120 g pot(-1) > CK: 0 g pot(-1)). After eleven months (T3), the variations in the height and basal diameter were the same as observed at 12, and the inhibition on leaf, branch, root and stem biomass increased with increasing leaf litter content. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the volatile compound composition. The results indicated that the C septentrionale original leaf litter (S1) contained thirty-one volatile compounds, but the treated leaf litter S2 (which was mixed with soil for eleven months to simultaneously plant E. grandis saplings) only possessed fourteen volatile compounds, releasing many secondary metabolites in the soil during decomposition. Most of the volatile compounds were alcohols, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, alkanes, alkene, esters and ketones. Most of the allelochemicals of C septentrionale might be released during the initial decomposing process, inhibiting the growth of other plants, whereas some nutrients might be released later, promoting the height growth of plants.

Temperature-related effects of treatments with jasmonic and salicylic acids on Arabidopsis infected with cucumber mosaic virus	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Arabidopsis thaliana; cucumber mosaic virus; jasmonic acid; salicylic acid; temperature fluctuation	SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE; PLANT-DISEASE; SALT STRESS; DEFENSE; TOBACCO; ACCUMULATION; EXPRESSION; PATHOGENS; PATHWAY; TISSUE	Plant-virus interactions are affected by environmental factors, including temperature. Plant defenses are often inhibited by high or low temperature. In this study, oxidative damage and gene expression were detected in Arabidopsis thaliana infected with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) at different temperatures. Before virus inoculation, plants were treated with jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), both of which are important signaling molecules in plant defense responses. The levels of MDA and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and electrolyte leakage were significantly higher in CMV-infected leaves at 15 and 37A degrees C. The accumulation of H2O2 and superoxide radical (O (2) (center dot-) ) was obviously suppressed by spraying with JA followed by SA (JA -> SA) at different temperatures. The CMV-CP expression analysis showed that virus replication was inhibited efficiently in the (JA -> SA) treatment. Therefore, many JA- and SA-responsible resistance genes were quantified; MPK4 was expressed highly and steadily in the (JA -> SA) treatment. To further confirm the role of MPK4, the CMV-CP gene expression was evaluated in wild-type Arabidopsis and its mpk4 mutant infected with CMV. The results suggested that MPK4 might play an important role in the antagonism between JA and SA at temperature fluctuation.	[Zhao, P. P.; Shang, J.; Guo, Z. C.; Lin, H.

In order to understand the distribution and characteristics of E. coli from giant pandas, 67 fecal and 30 vaginal E. coli isolates from 21 giant pandas were characterized for O serogroups, phylogenetic groups, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. In addition, these isolates were tested for the presence of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) by multiplex PCR detection of specific virulence genes. The most prevalent serogroups for all E. coli isolates were O88, O18, O167, O4, and O158. ExPEC isolates were detected mostly in vaginal samples, and DEC isolates were detected only in fecal samples. Phylogenetic group B1 predominated in fecal isolates, while groups B2 and D were frequently detected in vaginal isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was most frequently observed, followed by resistance to nalidixic acid and tetracycline. All except five isolates were typeable by using XbaI and were categorized into 74 PFGE patterns. Our findings indicate that panda E. coli isolates exhibited antimicrobial resistance, and potentially pathogenic E. coli isolates were present in giant pandas. In addition, these E. coli isolates were genetically diverse. This study may provide helpful information for developing strategies in the future to control E. coli infections of giant pandas.

A 90-day subchronic toxicity study of neem oil, a Azadirachta indica oil, in mice	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Azadirachta indica oil; neem oil; subchronic toxicity; mice	IN-VITRO; ACARICIDAL ACTIVITY; EXTRACTS; LARVAE	To determine the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of exposure and target organs of neem oil for establishing safety criteria for human exposure, the subchronic toxicity study with neem oil in mice was evaluated. The mice (10 per sex for each dose) was orally administered with neem oil with the doses of 0 (to serve as a control), 177, 533 and 1600mg/kg/day for 90 days. After the treatment period, observation of reversibility or persistence of any toxic effects, mice were continuously fed without treatment for the following 30days. During the two test periods, the serum biochemistry, organ weight and histopathology were examined. The results showed that the serum biochemistry and organ coefficient in experimental groups had no statistical difference compared with those of the control group. At the 90th day, the histopathological examinations showed that the 1600mg/kg/day dose of neem oil had varying degrees of damage on each organ except heart, uterus and ovarian. After 30-day recovery, the degree of lesions to the tissues was lessened or even restored. The NOAEL of neem oil was 177mg/kg/day for mice and the target organs of neem oil were determined to be testicle, liver and kidneys.

Cells were collected from the BM of two stillborn giant pandas. The cells were cultured and expanded in 10% fetal bovine serum medium. Cell morphology was observed under an inverted microscopy, and the proliferation potential of the cells was evaluated by counting cell numbers for eight consecutive days. Differentiation potentials of the cells were determined by using a variety of differentiation protocols for osteocytes, adipocytes, neuron cells, and cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, the specific gene expressions for MSCs or differentiated cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. The isolated cells exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology; expressed mesenchymal specific markers such as cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX-2), guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3 (GNL3), and stem cell factor receptor (SCFR); and could be differentiated into osteocytes and adipocytes that were characterized by Alizarin Red and Oil Red O staining. Under appropriate induction conditions, these cells were also able to differentiate into neuroglial-like or myocardial- like cells that expressed specific myocardial markers such as GATA transcription factors 4 (GATA-4), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and myosin heavy chain 7B (MYH7B), or neural specific markers such as Nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). This study demonstrated stem cells recovery and growth from giant pandas. The findings suggest that cells isolated from the BM of giant pandas have a high proliferative capacity and multiple differentiation potential in vitro which might aid conservation efforts.

To gain insights into how the T. reesei adapts to various carbons and regulates enzyme production, the extra-and intracellular proteomes of T. reesei grown in defined medium with lactose or xylose as the carbon source were investigated. Results indicated that the composition of extracellular proteome differed considerably depending on the carbons. The main cellobiohydrolases, i.e. Cel7a/Cel6 were the most abundant cellulolytic enzymes identified in both media, and found to be more abundant in lactose-grown culture. As compared to lactose, xylose can serve as a potent inducer of xylanolytic enzymes. Interestingly, most identified intracellular proteins are involved in carbon metabolism. Enzymes involved in utilization of xylose, such as n-xylose reductase (Xyl1p) and n-xylose dehydrogenase (Xyl2p), were present at elevated levels in the culture growing on xylose but only in minor amounts in the lactose culture. However, lactose induction significantly activated the expression of key enzymes involved in glycolysis pathway and citrate cycle. Importantly, the protein Xyl1p which participates both in the lactose and the xylose catabolism was verified as a potential regulator for cellulase formation in T. reesei. Biological significance This study not only gives an overview of the ubiquitous cellular changes induced by the two conventional carbon substrates, but offers the framework for understanding the mechanisms behind the carbon-dependent induction of extracellular enzymes in T. reesei. Moreover, this study provides a potential target (Xyl1p) that could be tentatively used for metabolic engineering of T. reesei for cost-effective cellulase production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, they are appropriate tools to study the origin and evolution of polyploidy plant taxa. The plastid 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene (Pgk-1) sequences from 44 accessions of Triticum and Aegilops, representing diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheats, were used to estimate the origin of Triticum petropavlovskyi. Our phylogenetic analysis was carried out on exon+intron, exon and intron sequences, using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and haplotype networking. We found the D genome sequences of Pgk-1 genes from T. petropavlovskyi are similar to the D genome orthologs in T. aestivum, while their relationship with Ae. tauschii is more distant. The A genome sequences of T. petropavlovskyi group with those of T. polonicum, but its Pgk-1 B genome sequences to some extent diverge from those of other species of Triticum. Our data do not support for the origin of T. petropavlovskyi either as an independent allopolyploidization event between Ae. tauschii and T. polonicum, or as a monomendelian mutation in T. aestivum. We suggest that T. petropavlovskyi originated via spontaneous introgression from T. polonicum into T. aestivum. The dating of this introgression indicates an age of 0.78 million years; a further mutation event concerning the B genome occurred 0.69 million years ago.

The ability of brucellae to survive and multiply in the hostile environment of host macrophages is essential to its virulence. The RNA-binding protein Hfq is a global regulator that is involved in stress resistance and pathogenicity. Here we demonstrate that Hfq is essential for stress adaptation and intracellular survival in B. melitensis. A B. melitensis hfq deletion mutant exhibits reduced survival under environmental stresses and is attenuated in cultured macrophages and mice. Microarray-based transcriptome analyses revealed that 359 genes involved in numerous cellular processes were dysregulated in the hfq mutant. From these same samples the proteins were also prepared for proteomic analysis to directly identify Hfq-regulated proteins. Fifty-five proteins with significantly affected expression were identified in the hfq mutant. Our results demonstrate that Hfq regulates many genes and/or proteins involved in metabolism, virulence, and stress responses, including those potentially involved in the adaptation of Brucella to the oxidative, acid, heat stress, and antibacterial peptides encountered within the host. The dysregulation of such genes and/or proteins could contribute to the attenuated hfq mutant phenotype. These findings highlight the involvement of Hfq as a key regulator of Brucella gene expression and facilitate our understanding of the role of Hfq in environmental stress adaptation and intracellular survival of B. melitensis.

Comparison of enhanced microsphere transport in an iron-oxide-coated porous medium by pre-adsorbed and co-depositing organic matter	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Colloid transport; Pre-adsorbed OM; Co-depositing OM; Site blocking; Extended RSA model	VINEYARD-DEVOTED SOILS; HUMIC-ACID; COLLOID TRANSPORT; PARTICLE DEPOSITION; BACTERIOPHAGE PRD1; SAND; NANOPARTICLES; ADSORPTION; SURFACES; COLUMNS	The effects of two types of organic matter (OM) (humic acid and protein) on colloid transport in porous media were investigated with column experiments and numerical modeling. Colloid deposition was explored in double-pulse experiments (DPEs) by injecting a pulse of OM to allow its pre-adsorption to iron-oxide-coated sand, followed by a pulse of latex microspheres. These experiments were compared with single-pulse experiments (SPEs), where one mixed pulse of OM and microspheres was introduced to the column. The experimental results show that pre-adsorbed and co-depositing OM may, respectively, limit initial and transient colloid deposition. The DPE results can be interpreted with an existing colloid transport model (random sequential adsorption: RSA). SPE results were interpreted with an extended RSA model (RSAE) that couples the process of OM co-deposition and blocking to colloid transport by introducing a conversion factor (K-conv) that reflects the blocking efficiency of OM. The calculations with the verified model suggest a comparable site blocking capacity of pre-adsorbed and co-depositing OM with a blocking capacity that differs for different sources of OM. Traditionally described as a modification of the chemistry of the overall deposition surface for the suspended particles, OM adsorption can also be interpreted as blocking local colloid attachment sites by the OM. This second interpretation may be more useful in describing nanoparticle deposition where the particle size is comparable to the length scale where a molecule of OM modifies the deposition surface.

Infections frequently lead to host death, resulting in huge socioeconomic losses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of a large number of animal genes by imperfectly binding target mRNAs. To date, there have been no reports of miRNAs in T. multiceps. Results: In this study, we obtained 12.8 million high quality raw reads from adult T. multiceps small RNA library using Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 796 conserved miRNA families (containing 1,006 miRNAs) from 170,888 unique miRNAs were characterized using miRBase (Release 17.0). Here, we selected three conserved miRNA/miRNA* (antisense strand) duplexes at random and amplified their corresponding precursors using a PCR-based method. Furthermore, 20 candidate novel miRNA precursors were verified by genomic PCR. Among these, six corresponding T. multiceps miRNAs are considered specific for Taeniidae because no homologs were found in other species annotated in miRBase. In addition, 181,077 target sites within T. multiceps transcriptome were predicted for 20 candidate newly miRNAs. Conclusions: Our large-scale investigation of miRNAs in adult T. multiceps provides a substantial platform for improving our understanding of the molecular regulation of T. multiceps and other cestodes development.

Previous studies of the giant pandas indicated that this population is genetically distinct, implying the presence of a new subspecies. Based on the co-evolution between the parasite and the host, the aim of this study was to investigate the genetic differentiation in the B. schroederi population collected from giant pandas inhabiting different mountain ranges, and further to identify whether the evolution of this parasite correlates with the evolution of giant pandas. Methods: In this study, 48 B. schroederi were collected from 28 wild giant pandas inhabiting the Qinling, Minshan and Qionglai mountain ranges in China. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (mtCytb) gene was amplified by PCR, and the corresponding population genetic diversity of the three mountain populations was determined. In addition, we discussed the evolutionary relationship between B. schroederi and its host giant panda. Results: For the DNA dataset, insignificant Fst values and a significant, high level of gene flow were detected among the three mountain populations of B. schroederi, and high genetic variation within populations and a low genetic distance were observed. Both phylogenetic analyses and network mapping of the 16 haplotypes revealed a dispersed pattern and an absence of branches strictly corresponding to the three mountain range sampling sites. Neutrality tests and mismatch analysis indicated that B. schroederi experienced a population expansion in the past. Conclusions: Taken together, the dispersed haplotype map, extremely high gene flow among the three populations of B. schroederi, low genetic structure and rapid evolutionary rate suggest that the B. schroederi populations did not follow a pattern of isolation by distance, indicating the existence of physical connections before these populations became geographically separated.

The susceptibility of these two hosts to schistosome infection is different, as water buffalo are less conducive to S. japonicum growth and development. To identify genes that may affect schistosome development and survival, we compared gene expression profiles of schistosomes derived from these two natural hosts using high-throughput microarray technology. Results: The worm recovery rate was lower and the length and width of worms from water buffalo were smaller compared to those from goats following S. japonicum infection for 7 weeks. Besides obvious morphological difference between the schistosomes derived from the two hosts, differences were also observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Microarray analysis showed differentially expressed gene patterns for parasites from the two hosts, which revealed that genes related to lipid and nucleotide metabolism, as well as protein folding, sorting, and degradation were upregulated, while others associated with signal transduction, endocrine function, development, immune function, endocytosis, and amino acid/carbohydrate/glycan metabolism were downregulated in schistosomes from water buffalo. KEGG pathway analysis deduced that the differentially expressed genes mainly involved lipid metabolism, the MAPK and ErbB signaling pathways, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, dorso-ventral axis formation, reproduction, and endocytosis, etc. Conclusion: The microarray gene analysis in schistosomes derived from water buffalo and goats provide a useful platform to disclose differences determining S. japonicum host compatibility to better understand the interplay between natural hosts and parasites, and identify schistosome target genes associated with susceptibility to screen vaccine candidates.

Their exact taxonomic position was determined in the present study by using polyphasic approaches. Comparative analysis of nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these strains belonged to the genus Mesorhizobium, with Mesorhizobium ciceri USDA 3383(T), Mesorhizobium loti NZP 2213(T), Mesorhizobium shangrilense CCBAU 65327(T) and Mesorhizobium australicum WSM2073(T) as the closest neighbours (>99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Phylogenies of the housekeeping genes atpD and recA confirmed their distinct position, showing low similarity with respect to those of M. loti LMG 6125(T) (96.5% and 92.3% similarity respectively), M. ciceri USDA 3383(T) (96.8% and 93.3% similarity, respectively), M. shangrilense CCBAU 65327(T) (96.5% and 92.7% similarity, respectively) and M. australicum WSM2073(T) (95.4 % and 90.6% similarity, respectively). The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain SCAU7(T) and strain SCAU27 were 83.0%, showing that they belong to the same species. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of SCAU7(T) with M. loti NZP 2213(T), M. ciceri USDA 3383(T) and M. shangrilense CCBAU 65327(T) were 41.1%, 48.8% and 23.4%, respectively, clearly indicating that strain SCAU7(T) represents a novel species. A series of phenotypic and genotypic tests and comparison of cellular fatty acids indicated that the novel group of isolates was distinct from previously described species. Therefore, we propose that strains SCAU7(T) and SCAU27 represent a novel species of the genus Mesorhizobium, Mesorhizobium sangairsp. nov., with strain SCAU7(T) (=HAMBI 3318(T)=ACCC 13218(T)) as the type strain.

All the model variables are assumed as a function of time. Three factors, industrial scale, structure, and generation technologies are considered in pollutant generation model, which together determine the change of pollutant. The average abatement rate, influenced by abatement technologies and the percentage of pollutant generation in each department, is equal to the weighted sum of abatement rate. The change of pollutant emission is commonly determined by the change of pollutant generation and unabatement rate. Particularly, it's determined by both factors that influence the pollutant generation and abatement rate. The decisive factors of pollutant emission vary with the object investigated.

T pisiformis cysticercus (the larval stage) causes severe damage to rabbit breeding, which results in huge economic losses. In this study, the genetic variation of T pisiformis was determined in Sichuan Province, China. Fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) (922 bp) gene were amplified in 53 isolates from 8 regions of T. pisiformis. Overall, 12 haplotypes were found in these 53 cytb sequences. Molecular genetic variations showed 98.4% genetic variation derived from intra-region. F-ST and Nm values suggested that 53 isolates were not genetically differentiated and had low levels of genetic diversity. Neutrality indices of the cytb sequences showed the evolution of T pisiformis followed a neutral mode. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no correlation between phylogeny and geographic distribution. These findings indicate that 53 isolates of T pisiformis keep a low genetic variation, which provide useful knowledge for monitoring changes in parasite populations for future control strategies.

Sequencing of the respective HMW-GS genes Ax, Bx, Ay and By in both accessions indicated equal DNA lengths with gene silencing caused by 1 to 4 in-frame stop codon(s) in the open reading frames. Six synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were produced by crossing PI94668 or PI349045 with six Aegilops tauschii by spontaneous chromosome doubling of unreduced gametes. As expected, these amphiploids had three different HMW-GS: Dx 3.1(t) + Dy11*(t), Dx2.1(t) + 10(t) and Dx2(t) + Dy12(t) in Glu-D1 but double nulls in Glu-A1 and Glu-B1. Quality tests showed that most quality parameters in two T. turgidum ssp. dicoccon parents were very low due to the lack of HMW-GSs. However, incorporation of HMW-GS from Ae. tauschii in six synthetic hexaploid wheat lines significantly increased most quality related parameters.

Furthermore, a mitotically unstable dicentric chromosome and stable multicentric chromosomes were observed in the progeny of a Chinese Spring-Imperial rye 3R addition line. An unstable multicentric chromosome was found in the progeny of a 6R/6D substitution line. Drastic variation of terminal heterochromatin including movement and disappearance of terminal heterochromatin occurred in the progeny of wheat-rye addition line 3R, and the 5RS ditelosomic addition line. Highly stable minichromosomes were observed in the progeny of a monosomic 4R addition line, a ditelosomic 5RS addition line and a 6R/6D substitution line. Minichromosomes, with and without the FISH signals for telomeric DNA (TTTAGGG)(n), derived from a monosomic 4R addition line are stable and transmissible to the next generation. The results indicated that centromeres and terminal heterochromatin can be profoundly altered in wheat-rye hybrid derivatives.

This gene was found to encode a polypeptide of 674 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 75.2 kDa. This polypeptide was 62.1% identical to cry59Aa1. The Cry59Ba1 protein was expressed in the acrystalliferous mutant strain HD73(-) and tested against Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera), Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera) and Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera). The bioassay showed Cry59Ba1 protein to be highly toxic to S. exigua (Lepidoptera) (LC50 =26.2 mu g/ml, 95% confidence limit, 16.2-75.3 mu g/ml). The cloning of cry59Ba1 gene may provide a novel type insecticidal resource for resolving the problem of lepidopteran insects developing resistance to the Cry1 proteins.

To effectively preserve and sustainably utilize this species, a study in genetic diversity and population structure was carried out by the sequence variation of chloroplast DNA trnQ-rps16 intergenic spacers. Polymorphism was calculated among the 200 individuals from 7 local and 10 wild populations across its geographical range in China. The results showed that (1) Total genetic variation in species level was poor (h = 0.478, pi = 0.0018). But in the wild populations, it was much higher than that in the local populations (h = 0.565, pi = 0.0021 vs. h = 0.152, pi = 0.0006). (2) Low levels of genetic differentiation (F-SC = 0.19595, P = 0.000), genetic distance (0.00000-0.00297), as well as pairwise Fst value among populations were detected. These results, combined with the insignificant gene genealogy pattern and neutrality tests indicate that Chinese Cherry has relatively low levels of genetic diversity and insignificant population structure. Coancestry might be a combined effect of the reduction in effective population size with the recent demographic bottlenecks and mating systems. The pronounced seed dispersal abilities and relatively high rates of gene exchange are supported by the limited genetic differentiation among populations.

Previously, TaCPK2 was shown to be inducible by powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici, Bgt) infection in wheat. Here, its functions in disease resistance are characterized further. This study shows the presence of defence-response and cold-response cis-elements on the promoters of the A subgenome homoeologue (TaCPK2-A) and D subgenome homoeologue (TaCPK2-D), respectively. Their expression patterns were then confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using genome-specific primers, where TaCPK2-A was induced by Bgt treatment while TaCPK2-D mainly responded to cold treatment. Downregulation of TaCPK2-A by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) causes loss of resistance to Bgt in resistant wheat lines, indicating that TaCPK2-A is required for powdery mildew resistance. Furthermore, overexpression of TaCPK2-A in rice enhanced bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xoo) resistance. qRT-PCR analysis showed that overexpression of TaCPK2-A in rice promoted the expression of OsWRKY45-1, a transcription factor involved in both fungal and bacterial resistance by regulating jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling genes. The opposite effect was found in wheat TaCPK2-A VIGS plants, where the homologue of OsWRKY45-1 was significantly repressed. These data suggest that modulation of WRKY45-1 and associated defence-response genes by CPK2 genes may be the common mechanism for multiple disease resistance in grass species, which may have undergone subfunctionalization in promoters before the formation of hexaploid wheat.

By using continuous enrich culturing process, three high efficiency cellulose-degrading microbial strains JSB1, JSA1 and JSF1 were screened and their phylogenic position were determined. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing showed that bacterial strain JSB1 belonged to Bacillus sp. and actinomycete strain JSA1 belonged to Streptomyces sp. respectively. Based on the morphology and ITS fragment sequence, fungal strain JSF1 was determined as Trichoderma longibrachiatum. Confrontation tests revealed that there was no antagonistic phenomenon among these three strains. The compound inoculants consisted of those three strains at ratio 1: 1: 1 and its cellulose activity reached to 300U/ml. Adding 5% of compound inoculants and 2% of urea as nitrogen source with rice straw, the fermentation was done. The results showed that after 15 days' fermentation, the weight loss rate of rice straw achieved 53.91% and the degrading rates of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were 37.55%, 56.65% and 14.78% respectively. These results suggested that these strains can be used as straw-degrading strains.

Jian). Six semi-purified isonitrogenous diets (4.2, 7.0, 9.5, 11.9, 13.9 and 16.9 g Ile kg(-1) diet) were fed to Jian carp (6.9 +/- 0.03 g) for 60 days. The results showed that Ile supplementation improved the head kidney index, red and white blood cell counts, anti-hydroxyl radical capacity and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase (P < 0.05), and decreased the malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and glutathione contents in the head kidney (P < 0.05). After a 60 day feeding trial, an Aeromonas hydrophila challenge study was conducted for 17 days. Differences in survival rate, leucocyte phagocytic activity, serum lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase activity, haemagglutination titre, complement components 3 and 4, immunoglobulin M level and A. hydrophila agglutination antibody titre followed the same trend as that of the head kidney index (P < 0.05). Furthermore, real time polymerase chain reaction revealed that relative mRNA expression of transforming growth factor beta 2 and target of rapamycin (TOR) in the head kidney significantly increased with increasing Ile levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, the relative mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 10 and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) in the head kidney showed a downward trend (P < 0.05). Collectively, this study indicates that dietary Ile improves the fish immune response, regulates the antioxidant status and cytokine, TOR and 4E-BP gene expression in the head kidney.

To identify genes differentially expressed during FV infection, four cDNA libraries were constructed for suppression subtractive hybridization using RNA isolated from bracts of an FV-resistant inbred maize line, Bt-1, as well as an FV-susceptible maize inbred line, Ye478. A total of 145 clones were obtained following reverse dot-blot hybridization, and these were sequenced from these libraries. Similarity analysis revealed that of these genes, 93 were unique, including 68 of known function, 24 of unknown function, and a single novel gene. Most genes of known function were predominantly involved in plant defense such as cell defense, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and metabolism. Expression profiles of eight representative genes, using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, confirmed that differential gene regulation during FV infection was involved. These findings suggested that these differentially expressed genes might be involved in FV defense responses in maize.

The properties such as geometrical parameters and electronic energies are determined for open-chain and cyclic species. Our results indicate that the open-chain structures with low spin states (doublet) are more stable than the cyclic ones for the small sizes clusters (n a parts per thousand currency sign 9), as the cluster sizes increase (n = 10, 11), the cyclic species are more stable. The incremental binding energies show a smooth even-odd alternation phenomenon for open-chain species, n-even (n is the numbers of C atom in the clusters) species have the stronger stabilities relative to the adjacent odd-numbered ones. In addition, the most favorable dissociation channels are determined by calculating the fragmentation energies accompanying various possible pathways. The studied clusters incline to be dissociated to Au + C (n) and AuC (n-3) + C-3 fragments.

In the present study, we aimed to study the polymorphisms of NLRPI2 gene and its association with susceptibility to non-specific digestive disorder (NSDD) in rabbits. We re-sequenced the entire coding region of the rabbit NLRP12 gene and detected a total of 19 SNPs containing 14 synonymous and five non-synonymous variations. Among them, the coding SNP (c.1682A>G), which would carry a potential functional implication, was subsequently subjected to genotyping for case-control association study (272 cases and 267 controls). The results revealed that allele A was significantly protective against NSDD with an odds ratio value of 0.884 (95% confidence interval, 0.788 to 0.993; p = 0.038). We also experimentally induced NSDD in growing rabbits by feeding a fibre-deficient diet and subsequently investigated NLRPI2 mRNA expression. The mRNA expression of NLRPI2 in healthy status was significantly higher than that in severe NSDD (p = 0.0016). The highest expression was observed in individuals carrying the protective genotype AA (p = 0.0108). These results suggested that NLRP12 was significantly associated with the NSDD in rabbits. However, the precise molecular mechanism of NLRPI2 involving in the development of rabbit NSDD requires further research.

Identification and characterization of the major histocompatibility complex class II DQB (MhcMath-DQB1) alleles in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana)	TISSUE ANTIGENS			English	Article						allelic polymorphism; balancing selection; genetic diversity; Macaca thibetana; Mhc-DQB1 allele; trans-species polymorphism	CYNOMOLGUS MACAQUES; RHESUS MACAQUES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DRB ALLELES; MHC; POLYMORPHISM; GENE; DIVERSITY; MULATTA; TRANSPLANTATION	Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana), an endangered primate species endemic to China, have been used as experimental animal model for various human diseases. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes play a crucial role in the susceptibility and/or resistance to many human diseases, but little is known about Tibetan macaques. To gain an insight into the MHC background and to facilitate the experimental use of Tibetan macaques, the second exon of Mhc-DQB1 gene was sequenced in a cohort of wild Tibetan macaques living in the Sichuan province of China. A total of 23 MhcMath-DQB1 alleles were identified for the first time, illustrating a marked allelic polymorphism at the DQB1 locus for these macaques. Most of the sequences (74%) observed in this study belong to DQB1*06 (9 alleles) and DQB1*18 (8 alleles) lineages, and the rest (26%) belong to DQB1*15 (3 alleles) and DQB1*17 (3 alleles) lineages. The most frequent alleles detected among these macaques were MhcMath-DQB1*15:02:02 (17.9%), followed by Math-DQB1*06:06, 17:03 and 18:01, which were detected in 9 (16.1%) of the monkeys, respectively. Non-synonymous substitutions occurred at a significantly higher frequency than synonymous substitutions in the peptide-binding region, suggesting balancing selection for maintaining polymorphisms at the MHC class II DQB1 locus. Phylogenetic analyses confirms the trans-species model of evolution of the Mhc-DQB1 genes in non-human primates, and in particular, the extensive allele sharing is observed between Tibetan and other macaque species.

However, the roles of the chrysanthemum WRKY genes in abiotic stress response remain obscure. In this study, we functionally characterized a novel WRKY gene, DgWRKY3, from chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum). Its expression in the chrysanthemum was up-regulated by salinity or dehydration stress, but not by abscisic acid (ABA). The DgWRKY3-overexpression tobacco plants increase salt tolerance compared with wild-type (WT) tobacco plants. The increased levels of proline were observed in transgenic plants compared to WT plants under salt stress. In addition, the DgWRKY3 transgenic plants reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) compared with WT plants, accompanied by higher activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and the greater accumulation of antioxidants including ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) under salt stress. Moreover, the DgWRKY3 transgenic plants enhanced the expression of stress-related genes involved in osmotic adjustment and membrane protection (NtP5CS, NtLEA5, and NtERD10D) and oxidative stress response (NtSOD, NtPOD, NtCAT, and NtAPX) under salt stress. However, no significant difference in the expression of stress-related genes (NtP5CS, NtLEA5, NtERD10D, NtSOD, NtPOD, NtCAT, and NtAPX) was found between the DgWRKY3-overexpression and WT tobacco plants under normal conditions, despite the fact that the constitutive promoter was used to drive DgWRKY3. These findings suggest that DgWRKY3 functions as a positive regulator to mediate tolerance of plants to salt stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Animal studies have demonstrated that selenium (Se) provides anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects against AFB(1). However, the effects of Se against AFB(1)-induced immunosuppression were rarely reported. To test this, three hundred 1-day-old male avian broilers were divided into five groups and fed on control diet (0.4 mg/kg Se), AFB(1) group(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg Se), AFB(1) + Se group 1(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.6 mg/kg Se), AFB(1) + Se group 11(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.8 mg/kg Se) and AFB(1) + Se group III(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 1.0 mg/kg Se) for 21 days (n = 60/group). Although the body weight in AFB(1) group was lower than that in control group at 14 days of age, there no significant differences on body weight among five groups at 7 and 21 days of age. No evident clinical symptoms were observed among five groups from 7 to 21 days of age. The percentages of peripheral blood CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and the contents of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma in AFB(1) group were decreased, compared with those in control group. Compared with those in AFB(1) group, the percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in three AFB(1) + Se groups were increased from 14 to 21 days of age, and the contents of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma in all AFB(1) + Se groups were increased from 7 to 21 days of age. On the contrary, the percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells, and the contents of Serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma in AFB(1) + Se group III were lower than those in AFB(1) + Se group II. It was concluded that 0.6 and 0.8 mg/kg Se could increase the decreased percentages of peripheral blood T-cell subsets and the contents of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma induced by 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) in the diets, and cellular immune function could be improved in chickens.

However, the alterations and abnormal mitotic behaviours of wheat chromosomes caused by wheat-rye monosomic addition lines are seldom reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: Octoploid triticale was derived from common wheat T. aestivum L. 'Mianyang11'xrye S. cereale L. 'Kustro' and some progeny were obtained by the controlled backcrossing of triticale with 'Mianyang11' followed by self-fertilization. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) using rye genomic DNA and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using repetitive sequences pAs1 and pSc119.2 as probes were used to analyze the mitotic chromosomes of these progeny. Strong pSc119.2 FISH signals could be observed at the telomeric regions of 3DS arms in 'Mianyang11'. However, the pSc119.2 FISH signals were disappeared from the selfed progeny of 4R monosomic addition line and the changed 3D chromosomes could be transmitted to next generation stably. In one of the selfed progeny of 7R monosomic addition line, one 2D chromosome was broken and three 4A chromosomes were observed. In the selfed progeny of 6R monosomic addition line, structural variation and abnormal mitotic behaviour of 3D chromosome were detected. Additionally, 1A and 4B chromosomes were eliminated from some of the progeny of 6R monosomic addition line. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicated that single rye chromosome added to wheat might cause alterations and abnormal mitotic behaviours of wheat chromosomes and it is possible that the stress caused by single alien chromosome might be one of the factors that induced karyotype alteration of wheat.

The phytohormones in plant systems are closely involved in responses against drought stress. However, information on the regulatory effect of abscisic acid (ABA), and free polyamine (PA) metabolism on the accumulation of JA is limited. Elucidating the endogenous mechanisms that confer stress resistance is essential to providing insights into the potential of plants to adapt to environmental change. This study aims to determine the relationship between the concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid am and the accumulation of free PAs (putrescine, spermine, and spermidine), as well as with polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity, in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum M.) seedlings grown hydroponically under polyethylene glycol - induced drought stress. The results indicate that the concentrations of endogenous ABA, JA, and free polyamines, and the PAO activity in the roots and leaves of tomato seedlings were generally higher in the treatment groups than in the untreated controls. A significantly positive correlation was observed between the concentrations of endogenous polyamines and PAO activity (R = 0.708**) in roots and leaves of tomato seedlings. The time course in the present experiment demonstrated that the ABA concentrations increase in the roots prior to that in the leaves. Therefore, under drought stress, the higher concentrations of endogenous spermine and spermidine in the roots and leaves stimulate the simultaneous accumulation of endogenous ABA and JA with increasing PAO activity.

Jian). First, seven isonitrogenous diets containing graded levels of Thr (7.4-25.2 g/kg diet) were fed to the fishes for 60 days. Second, enterocyte proliferation and differentiation were assayed by culturing enterocytes with graded levels of Thr (0-275 mg/l) in vitro. Finally, enterocytes were cultured with 0 and 205 mg/l Thr to determine protein synthesis. The percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency, protein retention value, activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase, weights and protein contents of hepatopancreas and intestine, folds heights, activities of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and Na+/K+-ATPase in all intestinal segments, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities in hepatopancreas, and 4E-BP2 gene expression in muscle, hepatopancreas and intestinal segments were significantly enhanced by Thr (p<0.05). However, the plasma ammonia concentration and TOR gene expression decreased (p<0.05). In vitro, Thr supplement significantly increased cell numbers, protein content, the activities of GOT, GPT, AKP and Na+/K+-ATPase, and protein synthesis rate of enterocytes, and decreased LDH activity and ammonia content in cell medium (p<0.05). In conclusion, Thr improved growth, digestive and absorptive capacity, enterocyte proliferation and differentiation, and protein synthesis and regulated TOR and 4E-BP2 gene expression in juvenile Jian carp. The dietary Thr requirement of juvenile Jian carp was 16.25 g/kg diet (51.3 g/kg protein) based on quadratic regression analysis of PWG.

In this study, we characterised a S. scabiei thioredoxin peroxidase (SsTPx) and evaluated a recombinant SsTPx as a diagnostic antigen in rabbits. Methods: The open reading frame of the gene encoding SsTPx-2 was amplified and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified. SsTPx was localized in mite tissue by immunolocalisation using the purified recombinant protein. Serodiagnosis assays were carried out in 203 New Zealand White rabbit serum samples by dot-ELISA. Result: The open reading frame (489 bp) of the gene encodes an 18.11 kDa protein, which showed highly homology to that of Psoroptes cuniculi (98.77% identity) and belongs to the 2-Cys family of peroxiredoxins. SsTPx was mainly distributed in muscle tissues of mites, integument of the epidermis and the anterior end of S. scabiei. Although SsTPx cross-reactivity with psoroptic mites was observed, the SsTPx dot-ELISA showed excellent diagnostic ability, with 95.3% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity in mange-infected and uninfected groups. Conclusions: This study showed that the purified SsTPx is a highly sensitive antigen for the diagnosis of mange infection by dot-ELISA. This technique is a rapid and convenient method that can be used worldwide for the clinical diagnosis of sarcoptic mange in rabbits, and is especially useful in developing regions.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; AMYLOSE CONTENT; VISCOSITY; CULTIVARS; RESPONSES; GRAIN; RVA	Rice is an important staple crop throughout the world, but environmental stress like low-light conditions can negatively impact crop yield and quality. Using pot experiments and field experiments, we studied the effects of shading on starch pasting viscosity and starch content with six rice varieties for three years, using the Rapid Visco Analyser to measure starch pasting viscosity. Shading at different growth stages and in different rice varieties all affected the starch pasting characteristics of rice. The effects of shading on starch pasting viscosity at middle and later growth stages were greater than those at earlier stages. Shading enhanced breakdown but reduced hold viscosity and setback at tillering-elongation stage. Most pasting parameters changed significantly with shading after elongation stage. Furthermore, the responses of different varieties to shading differed markedly. The change scope of starch pasting viscosity in Dexiang 4103 was rather small after heading, while that in IIyou 498 and Gangyou 906 was small before heading. We observed clear tendencies in peak viscosity, breakdown, and pasting temperature of the five rice varieties with shading in 2010 and 2011. Correlation analysis indicated that the rice amylose content was negatively correlated with breakdown, but was positively correlated with setback. Based on our results, IIyou 498, Gangyou 906, and Dexiang 4103 had higher shade endurance, making these varieties most suitable for high-quality rice cultivation in low-light regions.

Reconstructing gender ideologies of English loanwords in Chinese	LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Loanwords; Gender assignment; Gender ideology	LANGUAGE; CODE	This article explores how English loanwords appropriated into Chinese are not merely linguistic adaptations but need to be understood as ideologically influenced processes of nativization (i.e. Chinesization). It focuses particularly on how traditional gender ideologies are re-constructed through examining the following aspects of gender assignment in English loanwords: gender associations in personal names, gender metaphor, gender visualization, and gender markers. Based on examples of loanwords representing these aspects of gender assignment, we find that gender feature values often change as English words are nativized into Chinese, and further, we find that such gender assignments often strengthen rather than resist traditional ideologies of gender in Chinese.

Two hundred one-day-old male broilers, divided into five groups, were fed with basal diet (control group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) (AFB(1) group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.2 mg/kg Se (+Se group I), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg Se (+ Se group II) and 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.6 mg/kg Se (+Se group III), respectively. According to biochemical assays, AFB(1) significantly decreased the activities of glutathione peroxidase, total superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, catalase and the level of glutathione hormone, while it increased the level of malondialdehyde. Moreover, AFB(1) increased the percentage of apoptosis cells by flow cytometry and the occurrence of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay. Simultaneous supplementation with sodium selenite restored these parameters to be close to those in control group. In conclusion, sodium selenite exhibited protective effects on AFB(1)-induced splenic toxicity in broilers by inhibiting oxidative stress and excessive apoptosis.

However, the role of leucine in myoblast proliferation remains unclear. In this study, we found that leucine could promote proliferation of C2C12 cells. Moreover, expressions of miR-27a and myostatin (a bona fide target of miR-27a) were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, following leucine treatment. We also found that miR-27a loss-of-function by transfection of a miR-27a inhibitor suppressed the promotion of myoblast proliferation caused by leucine. Our results suggest that miR-27a is induced by leucine and contributes to leucine-induced proliferation promotion of myoblast.

This extract enriched in polyphenols, showed a potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity with maltose as a substrate in enzyme assay. The extract was then applied to MCI-gel column chromatography with a water-methanol gradient to give three fractions: fraction 1 (F-1, water), fraction 2 (F-2, 80% methanol in water), and fraction 3 (F-3, 100% methanol). F-2 showed the highest maltase inhibitory activity compared with F-1 and F-3, and down-regulated alpha-glucosidase activity for the maltose hydrolysis in Caco-2 monolayer. In maltose-loaded SD-rats, F-2 significantly reduced postprandial blood glucose level. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid was found to be the potent maltase inhibitor, whereas chlorogenic acid and rutin showed a weak inhibitory activity against maltase. This is the first report on the mammalian alpha-glucosdiase inhibition of L. japonica. The result presented here suggests a use of the extract of L. japonica for antidiabetes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While application of pesticides can be a cost to the environment and human health, development and utilization of resistant cultivars is the most effective, economical, and eco-friendly approach to disease control. Using resistant cultivars is especially important for organic agriculture. Increasing breakthroughs have been made in understanding the mechanism of plant-microbe interaction. A current challenge now is how to apply the new knowledge to more effectively create disease-resistant crop cultivars. Integration of plant breeding and plant pathology is necessary to underpin crop improvement for food and other plant-based production. In this review, we summarize our current understanding on the mechanism of plant-microbe interaction and discuss the strategies for disease-resistance breeding of crop cultivars.

Although no known HLB-resistant citrus species or varieties have been identified, some citrus accessions such as rough lemon are reportedly tolerant. To better understand the HLB tolerance or susceptibility mechanisms in citrus, comparative anatomical analyses of tolerant rough lemon and sensitive sweet orange seedlings in response to HLB-associated bacterium, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', were performed on leaf, stem and root tissues using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Phloem collapse, plugged sieve elements and accumulation of starch were observed in leaf petioles of symptomatic leaves from both HLB-diseased rough lemon and sweet orange, while not in the mock-inoculated controls. Interestingly, in symptomless leaves, significant anatomical changes (e. g. phloem cell collapse and starch accumulation) were found in HLB-diseased sweet orange, but not in rough lemon. Furthermore, starch depletion, phloem cell collapse and absence of phloem fibers were observed in secondary roots of only diseased sweet orange. In young green stems, a few plugged sieve elements were seen in both diseased rough lemon and sweet orange; whereas starch deposition only occurred in the latter. Taken together at the whole plant level, HLB infection induces fewer disruptive anatomical changes in rough lemon than in sweet orange. In particular, the absence of obvious changes in the rough lemon root system is suggested to be critical for sustaining plant growth after infection, and may contribute greatly to its HLB tolerance.

In Expt. 1, growing pigs (8 wk old, n = 3) were fed 0.02 or 3.0 mg Se/kg (as sodium selenite) for 16 wk and produced serum with 0.5 and 5.4 mu mol/L Se, respectively. In Expt. 2, growing pigs (5 wk old, n = 6) were fed 0.3 or 1.0 mg Se/kg (as Se-enriched yeast) for 6 wk and produced serum with 2.6 and 6.2 mu mol/L Se, respectively. After the Se-biofortified porcine sera were added at 16% in RPMI 1640 to treat NCI-H446, DU145, and HTC116 cells for 144 h, they decreased (P < 0.05) the viability of the 3 types of human cancer cells by promoting apoptosis, compared with their controls. This effect was replicated only by adding the appropriate amount of methylseleninic acid to the control serum and was mediated by a downregulation of 8 cell cycle arrest genes and an upregulation of 7 apoptotic genes. Along with 6 previously reported selenoprotein genes, selenoprotein T (Selt), selenoprotein M (Selm), selenoprotein H (Selh), selenoprotein K (Selk), and selenoprotein N (Sepn1) were revealed to be strongly associated with the cell death-related signaling induced by the Se-enriched porcine serum. In conclusion, porcine serum could be biofortified with Se to effectively inhibit the proliferation of 3 types of human cancer cells and the action synchronized with a matrix of coordinated functional expression of multiple selenoprotein genes.

Here, we report the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor Enhanced Drought Tolerance/HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS11 (EDT1/HDG11) was able to confer drought tolerance and increase grain yield in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The improved drought tolerance was associated with a more extensive root system, reduced stomatal density, and higher water use efficiency. The transgenic rice plants also had higher levels of abscisic acid, proline, soluble sugar, and reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme activities during stress treatments. The increased grain yield of the transgenic rice was contributed by improved seed setting, larger panicle, and more tillers as well as increased photosynthetic capacity. Digital gene expression analysis indicated that AtEDT1/HDG11 had a significant influence on gene expression profile in rice, which was consistent with the observed phenotypes of transgenic rice plants. Our study shows that AtEDT1/HDG11 can improve both stress tolerance and grain yield in rice, demonstrating the efficacy of AtEDT1/HDG11 in crop improvement.

QTL analysis of the spring wheat "Chapio" identifies stable stripe rust resistance despite inter-continental genotype x environment interactions	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; ADULT-PLANT RESISTANCE; MULTIPLE FUNGAL PATHOGENS; F-SP TRITICI; LEAF RUST; DURABLE RESISTANCE; BREAD WHEAT; PUCCINIA-STRIIFORMIS; YELLOW RUST; GENETIC-ANALYSIS	Chapio is a spring wheat developed by CIMMYT in Mexico by a breeding program that focused on multigenic resistances to leaf rust and stripe rust. A population consisting of 277 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed by crossing Chapio with Avocet. The RILs were genotyped with DArT markers (137 randomly selected RILs) and bulked segregant analysis conducted to supplement the map with informative SSR markers. The final map consisted of 264 markers. Phenotyping against stripe rust was conducted for three seasons in Toluca, Mexico and at three sites over two seasons (total of four environments) in Sichuan Province, China. Significant loci across the two inter-continental regions included Lr34/Yr18 on 7DS, Sr2/Yr30 on 3BS, and a QTL on 3D. There were significant genotype x environment interactions with resistance gene Yr31 on 2BS being effective in most of the Toluca environments; however, a late incursion of a virulent pathotype in 2009 rendered this gene ineffective. This locus also had no effect in China. Conversely, a 5BL locus was only effective in the Chinese environments. There were also complex additive interactions. In the Mexican environments, Yr31 suppressed the additive effect of Yr30 and the 3D locus, but not of Lr34/Yr18, while in China, the 3D and 5BL loci were generally not additive with each other, but were additive when combined with other loci. These results indicate the importance of maintaining diverse, multi-genic resistances as Chapio had stable inter-continental resistance despite the fact that there were QTLs that were not effective in either one or the other region.

A 30-day experiment was performed using New Zealand rabbits that were naturally infested with S. scabiei in the toes (n = 30) or artificially infected in the external ear margin with S. scabiei (n = 30). Rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (6 animals per,group, A-E groups for rabbits of naturally infested and F-J groups for artificially infected rabbits), respectively. All 60 rabbits were treated twice on days 0 and 7 successively. Animals in groups A/F, BIG, and C/H were treated on each toe/external ear margin with topical E. adenophorum ethanol extract at 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml (w/v), respectively. Animals in groups D/I and E/J were treated with ivermectin by injections (positive controls) or by glycerol with water only rubbed onto the affected area (negative controls). After two treatments with extracts of E. adenophorum with relatively high concentrations of 0.5 and 1 g/ml, the S. scabiei was completely eliminated in rabbits between days 14 and 30. Our results showed that rabbits treated with ivermectin (positive controls) and those treated with the extracts of concentrations of 1.0 or 0.5 g/ml achieved remarkable therapeutic efficacy; no mites were present in toes of rabbits in these groups on day 14, which confirmed a 100% therapeutic efficacy rate up to day 30 of the end of the trial. The clinical effects of treatment with 1.0 and 0.5 g/ml E. adenophorum extracts (groups A and B) were similar to ivermectin treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy in group C and E rabbits only reached 43.25% and 7.13% by day 14. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy improved slightly by the end of the experiment on day 30, and rabbits in groups F, G and I also achieved good efficacy according to the recovery scoring criteria. These results indicate that E. adenophorum contains potent compounds for the effective control of sarcoptidosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The intestinal mucosal immune system is equipped with unique innate and adaptive defense mechanisms that provide a first line of protection against infectious agents. Meanwhile, immunoglobulins are the major secretory products of the adaptive immune system and their levels can be a strong indicator of a disease or condition. In this study, therefore, we investigated the effects of high dietary fluorine on the numbers of immunoglobulin A-positive (IgA(+)) cells in the lamina propria of intestines (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) by immunohistochemistry as well as on the contents of immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the mucosa of intestines (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 280 1-day-old healthy avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet (fluorine 22.6 mg/kg) or the same basal diet supplemented with 400, 800, and 1,200 mg/kg fluorine (high fluorine groups I, II, and III) in the form of sodium fluoride (NaF) for 42 days. The experimental data showed that the numbers of IgA(+) cells as well as the IgA, IgG, and IgM contents were significantly decreased (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) in the high fluorine groups II and III when compared with those of the control group. It was concluded that dietary fluorine in the range of 800-1,200 mg/kg significantly reduced the numbers of the IgA(+) cells and the contents of aforementioned immunoglobulins in the intestines (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) of broilers, which could finally impact the mucosal humoral immune function in the intestines by a way that reduces the lymphocyte population and/or lymphocyte activation.

In order to research the pathology of selenium deficiency in common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., 360 juvenile carp were allocated to three treatments. Each treatment containing 120 fish was randomly divided into four groups, fed with purified diets containing selenium at 0, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45mgkg-1. The results indicated that the morbidity and mortality rates of the test groups were negatively correlated with the level of selenium in the diets. The morbidity and mortality rates were, respectively, 46.7%, 33.3%, 13.3%, 0 and 26.7% 16.7%, 6.7%, 0. The affected fish exhibited pathological changes, such as thin back disease' and lordosis. Histologically, there was no abnormality observed in muscles, liver and pancreas. Ultrastructurally, there was swelling of the mitochondria of the cardiac muscle cells, the liver cells and renal tubular epithelial cells, with disintegration and lysis of the cristae of the mitochondria which vesiculated. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels were increased and the activity of the serum glutathione peroxidase and the serum superoxide dismutase was decreased; in contrast, the serum malonaldehyde concentration was increased.

A cDNA clone was isolated by immunoscreening with a monoclonal antibody raised against nuclear matrix proteins of Daucus carota L Its deduced amino acid sequence showed about 40% identity with the PESCADILLO protein of zebrafish and humans. Primary structure analysis of the protein revealed a Pescadillo N-terminus domain, a single breast cancer C-terminal domain, two nuclear localization signals, and a potential coiled-coil region as also found in animal PESCADILLO proteins. Therefore, we designated this gene DcPES1. Although DcPES1 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, its levels were highest in tissues with proliferating cells. Immunofluorescence using specific antiserum against the recombinant protein revealed that DcPES1 localized exclusively in the nucleolus. Examination of fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein revealed that the N-terminal portion was important for localization to the nucleoli of tobacco and onion cells. Moreover, when the nuclear matrix of carrot cells was immunostained with an anti-DcPES1 serum, the signal was detected in the nucleolus. Therefore, the DcPES1 protein appears to be a component of or tightly bound to components of the nuclear matrix. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bovine oocytes at metaphase II were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) untreated (control); (2) exposed to vitrification solution without freezing (toxicity); and (3) vitrified and warmed by the open-pulled straw method (vitrification). After parthenogenetic activation, in the vitrification group compared with the control, the timing of compaction was delayed in (108-120 vs. 96-108 hours, respectively), and the percentage of blastocysts that developed from eight-cell embryos was lower (32.08% vs. 61.03%; P < 0.05). To investigate whether vitrification delayed embryo compaction by affecting adhesion junction formation and function, immunostaining and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were done to characterize distribution patterns (E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and the cytoskeletal protein F-actin) and expression levels of cell adhesion-related proteins (beta-catenin). Distribution of beta-catenin in eight-cell embryos from the vitrification group changed dramatically compared with the control and toxicity groups. Relative expression of beta-catenin at the mRNA and protein levels was lower (P < 0.05) than that of the fresh and toxicity groups. However, expression and distribution of E-cadherin were similar among groups. In conclusion, abnormal distribution and decreased expression of beta-catenin in bovine parthenogenetic eight-cell embryos derived from vitrified-warmed oocytes were associated with embryo compaction and reduced competence for subsequent embryo development.

In this study, we performed an experiment in which in situ exudates were collected from Picea asperata seedlings that were transplanted in disturbed soils exposed to two levels of temperature (ambient temperature and infrared heater warming) and two nitrogen levels (unfertilized and 25g Nm-2a-1). Here, we show that the trees exposed to an elevated temperature increased their exudation rates I (gCg-1 root biomassh-1), II (gCcm-1root lengthh-1) and III (gCcm-2root areah-1) in the unfertilized plots. The altered morphological and physiological traits of the roots exposed to experimental warming could be responsible for this variation in root exudation. Moreover, these increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with the microbial release of extracellular enzymes involved in the breakdown of organic N (R2=0.790; P=0.038), which was coupled with stimulated microbial activity and accelerated N transformations in the unfertilized soils. In contrast, the trees exposed to both experimental warming and N fertilization did not show increased exudation rates or soil enzyme activity, indicating that the stimulatory effects of experimental warming on root exudation depend on soil fertility. Collectively, our results provide preliminary evidence that an increase in the release of root exudates into the soil may be an important physiological adjustment by which the sustained growth responses of plants to experimental warming may be maintained via enhanced soil microbial activity and soil N transformation. Accordingly, the underlying mechanisms by which plant root-microbe interactions influence soil organic matter decomposition and N cycling should be incorporated into climate-carbon cycle models to determine reliable estimates of long-term C storage in forests.

The results showed that the serum content of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IgG, and IgM was lower (p<0.05 or p<0.01) in the three high F groups than in the control group. The serum IgA level was significantly increased (p<0.05 or p<0.01) in the high F groups II and III at 42 days of age and significantly decreased (p<0.01) in the same groups at 14 days or from 14 to 28 days of age. In conclusion, high dietary F in the range of 800-1200 mg/kg was found to reduce the aforementioned serum cytokines and immunoglobulins, which could ultimately adversely impact humoral and cellular immune functions in broilers.

Previous studies have indicated that arginine (Arg) may function as a potential substance against oxidative stress. The present study was conducted to explore the potential mechanisms behind the Arg-induced protective effects against oxidative stress in piglets. A total of thirty-six piglets were randomly allocated to six groups with six replicates per group. Piglets were subjected to three dietary treatments (namely two groups per treatment) in week 1 and fed with a basal diet (ArgL) or the basal diet supplemented with 0.8% (ArgM) or 1.6% (ArgH) L-Arg, respectively. On day 8, piglets were injected intraperitoneally either with diquat (10 mg/kg body weight) or sterile saline. The whole trial lasted 11 d. Results showed that dietary Arg supplementation did not affect growth performance in week 1. Oxidative stress significantly decreased the growth performance of piglets (P< 0.05). However, ArgH attenuated the negative effects of oxidative stress on feed intake and significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity in the liver under oxidative stress (P< 0.05). Both ArgM and ArgH enhanced the activities of plasma glutathione peroxidases and superoxide dismutases and decreased the IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA level in the liver under oxidative stress (P< 0.05). The present study not only shows that Arg can function as a potential nutrient to alleviate oxidative stress responses through the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, and inhibition of the expression of inflammatory cytokines, but the results also suggest that alleviation of oxidative stress responses using dietary nutrient components deserves further attention in the future.

The results showed that the total dry weight decreased by 40% at 120 mM NaCl but remained the same at 60 and 90 mM NaCl. As salt concentration increased, chlorophyll contents decreased markedly by 10-70%, whereas the increments of the antioxidant enzyme activities were 1.0-1.6, 1.2-1.3, and 2.0-4.0 times, respectively, for superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase. The proline contents in salt-treated plants were 17-42 times higher than that in control. Moreover, leaf possessed significantly higher K+ content and K+/Na+ ratio than stem and root for all salt treatments. In addition, 90-120 mM NaCl treatment notably decreased the content of rebaudioside A (RA) and stevioside (ST) by 16.2-38.2%, whereas the increment of the ratio of RA/ST of salt-treated plants was 1.1-1.4 times. These results indicate that S. rebaudiana is moderately tolerant to salt stress. Hypohaline soil can be utilized in the plantation of S. rebaudiana and may be profitable for optimizing the steviol glycoside composition.

In the modern pig industry, lean type pigs have undergone strong artificial selection for muscle growth, which has led to remarkable phenotypic variations compared with fatty type pigs, making these different breeds an ideal model for comparative studies. Results: Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiling for the white (longissimus dorsi muscle) and the red (psoas major muscle) skeletal muscles among male and female fatty Rongchang, feral Tibetan and lean Landrace pigs, using a microarray approach. We identified differentially expressed genes that may be associated the phenotypic differences of porcine muscles among the breeds, between the sexes and the anatomical locations. We also used a clustering method to identify sets of functionally coexpressed genes that are linked to different muscle phenotypes. We showed that, compared with the white muscles, which primarily modulate metabolic processes, the red muscles show a tendency to be a risk factor for inflammation and immune-related disorders. Conclusions: This analysis presents breed-, sex- and anatomical location-specific gene expression profiles and further identified genes that may be associated with the phenotypic differences in porcine muscles among breeds, between the sexes and the anatomical locations.

The Pt/reduced graphene oxide (Pt/RGO) was fabricated by the co-reduction of GO and Pt salt using ethylene glycol under microwave irradiation, then the Pt/RGOSs were obtained by oxygen implosion in situ rolling up of the Pt/RGO using catalytic decomposition of Pt towards H2O2 under ultrasonication. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the reduced graphene oxide nanoscrolls with tubular structure, open edges and ends, and tubular diameter ranging from 10 to 100 nm. X-ray diffraction indicates that the crystal structure and diffraction intensity of the platinum practically remains unchanged, and the RGO has not been oxidized before or after rolling. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the Pt/RGOSs have a higher D/G ratio (1.2) than Pt/RGO (1.1). BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) results exhibit that the Pt/RGOSs possess higher specific surface area and broader pore size range (188 m(2) g(-1), 25-45 nm) than Pt/RGO (122 m(2) g(-1), 30-38 nm). Additionally, the electrocatalytic performance of the Pt/RGOSs for methanol oxidation was evaluated, and the results show that the Pt/RGOSs possess significantly higher electrocatalytic activity and stability than Pt/RGO.

This disease has been responsible for significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin in specific plants and exhibits inhibitory activity against many kinds of virus. In this paper, resveratrol was found to inhibit duck enteritis virus (DEV) replication in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 3.85 mu g/mL. The inhibition in virus multiplication in the presence of resveratrol was not attributed to direct inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment to the host cells, but to the inhibition of viral multiplication in host cells. The assay of the time of addition limited the drug effect during the first 8 h of infection. This conclusion was supported by the ultrastructure images of the early stage of DEV infection, which showed that the replication of virus nucleic acid and the formation of the capsid in the cell nucleus were suppressed. In the indirect immunofluorescence assay, proteins expression in DEV infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) within 24 h post-infection (p.i.) was also effectively suppressed by resveratrol. In summary, the resveratrol has a good activity against DEV infection in vitro, which could be attributed to that fact that several essential immediate early viral proteins for virus replication were impacted by resveratrol.

Molecular epidemiological investigation of PCMV is important for prevention and treatment, and this study is the first such investigation in Sichuan Province, Southwest China. A PCMV positive infection rate of 84.4% (865/1025) confirmed that PCMV is widely distributed in Sichuan Province. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the PCMV glycoprotein B gene (gB) nucleotide and amino acid sequences from 24 novel Sichuan isolates and 18 other PCMV gB sequences from Genbank. PCMV does not appear to have evolved into different serotypes, and two distinct sequence groups were identified (A and B). However, whether PCMV from this region has evolved into different genotypes requires further research. Analysis of the amino acid sequences confirmed the conservation of gB, but amino acid substitutions in the major epitope region have caused antigenic drift, which may have altered the immunogenicity of PCMV.

Total phenolics and flavonoids contents of different S. rebaudiana lines were in the range of 55.64-58.35 mg (gallic acid) g(-1) dw and 48.29-60.33 mg (rutin) g(-1) dw, respectively. The contents of phenolics and flavonoids, and antioxidant capacities in the leaves of S. rebaudiana were twofold to fivefold significantly higher than that in stems of S. rebaudiana. SR-3 had the highest total phenolics and flavonoids contents and the strongest scavenging abilities to DPPH and ABTS radicals. DPPH and TEAC assays were equal to evaluate the antioxidant ability of ethanolic extract of S. rebaudiana. The obtained results clearly indicated that the leaves of S. rebaudiana had an important value of utilization and development as a natural antioxidant agent and further studies for SR-3 should be put into practice.

In this study, we isolated and characterized waxy alleles of three waxy (GSHO 908, GSHO 1828 and NA 40) and two non-waxy barley accessions (PI 483237 and CIho 15773), estimated the expression patterns of waxy genes via Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), investigated promoter activity by analyzing promoter-GUS expression, and examined possible effects of waxy alleles on starch granule morphology in barley accessions by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A 193-bp insertion in intron 1, a 15-bp insertion in the coding region, and some single nucleotide polymorphic sites were detected in the waxy barley accessions. In addition, a 397-bp deletion containing the TATA box, transcription starting point, exon 1 and partial intron 1 were also identified in the waxy barley accessions. RT-qPCR analysis showed that waxy accessions had lower waxy expression levels than those of non-waxy accessions. Transient expression assays showed that GUS activity driven by the 1,029-bp promoter of the non-waxy accessions was stronger than that driven by the 822-bp promoter of the waxy accessions. SEM revealed no apparent differences of starch granule morphology between waxy and non-waxy accessions. Our results showed that the 397-bp deletion identified in the waxy barley accessions is likely responsible for the reduction of waxy transcript, leading to lower concentrations of GBSS I protein thus lower amylose content.

It was observed that genes activation and silencing were immediately established over the whole range of the genome at the onset of autotriploid formation. Furthermore, the occurrences of genes activation events were much more frequent than silencing ones. The frequencies of activated and silenced loci statistically deviated from the average levels for some chromosomes, which resulted in increased susceptibility or insensitivity to ploidy change for those chromosomes. Some functional categories could also influence the frequencies of activation and silencing loci, indicating different degrees of sensitivity to ploidy shift for the genes in those functional categories. This autotriploid-diploid twin-seedling rice provides us a new way to understand the changes in gene expression profiles at the beginning of spontaneous auto-polyploidization.

From after heading to mature stage, changes in the contents of chlorophyll, soluble sugar and soluble protein, malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD). in the flag leaves of four field-grown indica hybrid rice varieties under different postponing nitrogen (N) applications were studied. The results showed that the proper postponing N ratio could improve the value of chlorophyll and soluble protein of flag leaf, reduce the content of MDA and the activity of POD and soluble sugar content, the effects on SOD were changing with cultivars. Taken together, the different postponing N ratios for different varieties could be able to alleviate the damages membranes caused by active oxygen and the peroxidation of membrane lipids, thereby delaying leaf senescence in some extent.

Under soil nutrient, the plasticity of the leaf and reproductive allocation was "true" plasticity, the plasticity of stem allocation was "apparent" plasticity, which is dependent on plant size, but there was no plasticity in root allocation. Under soil water stress, the plasticity of root, leaf and reproductive allocation was "true". In response to population density, the plasticity of stem allocation is "true" plasticity, while the value of the stem allocation is consistent because of the trade off between the effects of plant size and population density. The biomass allocation strategy increases reproductive allocation but decrease leaf allocation with the decrease of soil nutrient, when compared at the same plant size. At lower soil water, the plant allocated more biomass to the root and leaf rather than to reproductive organ.

A total of 240 one-day-old broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600 or 900 mg/kg NiCl2 during a 42-day experimental period. The results showed that the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the ability to inhibit hydroxy radical and glutathione (GSH) content were significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) decreased in the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups in comparison with those of the control group. In contrast, malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) higher in the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups than that in the control group. It was concluded that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg could cause oxidative damage in the intestinal mucosa in broilers, which finally impaired the intestinal functions including absorptive function and mucosal immune function. The oxidative damage might be a main mechanism on the effects of NiCl2 on the intestinal health of broilers.

All 20 tapeworms except one without scolex were expelled under good conditions. She was free of secondary cysticercosis within one year follow up. Although the first choice for treatment of taeniasis is still praziquantel, it may often cause serious side effect on asymptomatic cysticercosis cases to suddenly become symptomatic within a half day of the treatment. Therefore, the problems in treatment of taeniasis and/or cysticercosis in Asia are briefly overviewed, since other platyhelminthic diseases including schistosomiasis, opisthorchiasis etc. are more common and praziquantel is strongly recommended for mass treatment of these trematodiases with no idea on the co-infection with eggs of T. solium which cause asymptomatic cysticercosis.

Three genes for melatonin receptors have been cloned. The MT1 (or Mel1a or MTNR1A) and MT2 (or Mel1b or MTNR1B) receptor subtypes are present in humans and other mammals, while an additional melatonin receptor subtype, Mel1c (or MTNR1C), has been identified in fish, amphibians and birds. Another melatonin related orphan receptor, GPR50, which does not bind melatonin, is found exclusively in mammals. The hormone melatonin is secreted primarily by the pineal gland, with highest levels occurring during the dark period of a circadian cycle. This hormone acts systemically in numerous organs. In the brain, it is involved in the regulation of various neural and endocrine processes, and it readjusts the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This article reviews recent studies of gene organization, expression, evolution and mutations of melatonin receptor genes of vertebrates. Gene polymorphisms reveal that numerous mutations are associated with diseases and disorders. The phylogenetic analysis of receptor genes indicates that GPR50 is an outgroup to all other melatonin receptor sequences. GPR50 may have separated from a melatonin receptor ancestor before the split between MTNR1C and the MTNR1A/B ancestor.

We report here the identification of genetic and epigenetic changes in a set of wheat-rye translocation lines (R59, R57, and R25) which exhibited novel heritable morphological characteristics compared with the parent lines (MY11 and L155). Genome in situ hybridization and amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses revealed no obvious variations in the primary structure of the genome in different translocation lines, with the exception of the same 1RS chromosome translocation. Global assessment of the extent and pattern of cytosine methylation alterations by methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analyses revealed differences in the extent of genomic DNA methylation between the rye and wheat parent lines. Fully-methylated sites were significantly increased and hemi-methylated sites were markedly decreased in the genome of translocation lines compared with the wheat parental cultivar MY11. Comparisons of different MSAP patterns revealed both monomorphic and polymorphic sites between translocation lines and wheat parents. Sequencing of 44 isolated fragments that showed methylation alterations indicated that cellular genes and especially transposable elements were targets for methylation alterations in translocation lines. The present study provides further understanding of the rules governing the distribution and existence of DNA methylation variations induced in the wheat genome during alien germplasm introduction. Furthermore, our study provides insights into the relationship between DNA methylation and hybrid vigor as well as a theoretical basis for further fundamental research and breeding application.

Surviving vitrified/warmed oocytes were used to detect CD9 distribution (fluorescence microscopy), CD9 mRNA (qRT-PCR), and CD9 protein expression (Western blot), and to analyze in vitro fertilization rates (number of sperm bound to or that penetrated the oocytes) after removing the zona pellucida. Fresh oocytes acted as control. The experimental results showed that the vitrification/warming procedures significantly decreased CD9 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and changed the CD9 distribution pattern in bovine oocytes. After fertilization in vitro, the average number of sperm binding and penetration of vitrified oocytes were significantly lower than those of the non-vitrified oocytes. In conclusion, vitrification of bovine oocytes caused a decrease in CD9 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and an alteration of CD9 distribution pattern, which may have resulted in lowered fertilization capacity.

Correctly identifying submitochondria locations of proteins can provide plentiful information for understanding their functions. However, using web-experimental methods to recognize submitochondria locations of proteins are time-consuming and costly. Thus, it is highly desired to develop a bioinformatics method to predict the submitochondria locations of mitochondrion proteins. In this work, a novel method based on support vector machine was developed to predict the submitochondria locations of mitochondrion proteins by using over-represented tetrapeptides selected by using binomial distribution. A reliable and rigorous benchmark dataset including 495 mitochondrion proteins with sequence identity a parts per thousand currency sign25 % was constructed for testing and evaluating the proposed model. Jackknife cross-validated results showed that the 91.1 % of the 495 mitochondrion proteins can be correctly predicted. Subsequently, our model was estimated by three existing benchmark datasets. The overall accuracies are 94.0, 94.7 and 93.4 %, respectively, suggesting that the proposed model is potentially useful in the realm of mitochondrion proteome research. Based on this model, we built a predictor called TetraMito which is freely available at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/TetraMito.

In this study, both types of piglets were either sow-fed until 28 days of age or until 3 days of age and subsequently formula-fed until day 28. Formula-fed piglets had higher serum IGF-1 levels compared to suckled piglets, whereas low birth weight piglets had lower IGF-1 levels in comparison with normal birth weight piglets. In contrast, the mRNA expression of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) showed lower expression in formula-fed piglets versus suckled piglets. However, the opposite effect was observed for IGF-1R protein abundance. Moreover, birth weight did not markedly affect IGF-1R mRNA or protein abundance. In conclusion, formula-fed piglets have higher IGF-1 serum levels and altered gene and protein expression of IGF-1R in the small intestine, irrespective of their birth weight. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Every year, antibiotic medicines including tetracycline and doxycycline are used in the duck industry. Few reports compare the expression of multi-drug-resistant genes in RA before and after addition of chemical drugs. With this in mind, the direct effects of gradient concentration of tetracyclines on the expression of tetracycline resistance genes (TETr) in RA at the cDNA level were studied by using a quantitative real-time PCR method. The expression of TETr, tetA, tetC, and tetM was investigated in ATCC11845 and in 30 RA isolated from different samples. Using a range of doxycycline concentrations up to 50% of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the optimal induction concentration of 0.0625 mu g/mL was selected. Under the optimal inducible expression, concentrations of TETr, tetC, and tetM cDNA were detected in all isolates, and the highest mRNA expression level of TETr genes was shown. Additionally, the expression levels of 3 TETr genes in RA14 (tetA and tetC) and RA17 (tetM and tetC) were compared. Both tetC and tetA found in isolate RA14 was found to express both tetC and tetA, and tetC cDNA was detected in isolate RA17 at all doxycycline concentrations tested, whereas tetM cDNA was not detected at any concentration. We can conclude that resistance pump is the main mechanism of tetracycline antibiotic resistance, and under the action of drug resistance pump tetC, the expression of tetM was not activated in RA17. These data suggest that the mRNA expression level of TETr genes was correlated with the MIC values, indicating that the degree of drug resistance is determined by the expression levels of TETr genes. Also, the induction of TETr is the major tetracycline resistance mechanism in RA, especially the resistance pump. However, lower concentrations of doxycycline induced higher TETr expression, and higher concentrations inhibited TETr expression. Maybe that is the reason for selection mutation to make tolerated bacteria survive.

The experiment used a 4 x 3 factorial arrangement with 12 diets formulated to contain combinations of 4 levels of dietary Ca:P: 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, or 2.0 and 3 levels of SBM: 31.0, 44.0, or 57.0%. A total of 576 male Ross 708 broilers were allocated to 12 dietary treatments with 8 cages (6 birds per cage) per treatment from d 15 to 22 posthatching, and the BW between groups were similar. Chromic dioxide was used as an indigestible marker to calculate P digestibility and retention. The results showed that BW gain and feed efficiency were increased (linear, P < 0.01), and prececal DM digestibility and DM retention were decreased (linear, P < 0.01) with graded SBM in diets for each Ca: P. De-creasing linear (P < 0.01) relationships were observed for apparent prececal P digestibility and total tract P retention with increased dietary SBM levels. The prececal and excreta P output increased (linear, P < 0.01; quadratic, P < 0.05) as increasing levels of SBM were added to the experimental diets. True prececal P digestibility in SBM was greater (P < 0.05) for birds fed a diet with Ca: P of 0.8 compared with those fed higher Ca: P, but there was no difference among the Ca: P ratios between 1.2 and 2.0. However, the total tract retention of P from SBM was not affected by Ca: P between 0.8 and 2.0. In conclusion, results of the present experiment demonstrated that prececal digestibility of P in SBM was not affected by Ca: P ratio between 1.2 and 2.0; and there was no difference in total tract retention of P from SBM among the Ca: P ratios between 0.8 and 2.0 in broiler chickens.

One group was offered diets containing 1, 0.85, and 0.70% total lysine, whereas the other was offered diets with 1.15, 1, and 0.85% total lysine from d 1 to 28, d 29 to 49, and d 50 to 70, respectively. In total, 252 chickens were commercially processed at 70 d old. Traits measured included live BW, subcutaneous fat thickness, weight of carcass, eviscerated carcass, semi-eviscerated carcass, breast muscle (left pectoralis major and minor), leg muscle (boneless left drum plus thigh), heart, gizzard, proventriculus, spleen, liver, comb, and abdominal fat, color parameters lightness, redness, or yellowness (L*, a*, and b*), pH, and breast muscle intramuscular fat content. The results indicated that, although dietary lysine concentration did not affect subcutaneous fat thickness, color parameters, pH, intramuscular fat content, and organ weights, there were effects on feed conversion and muscle and BW (P < 0.05). Males and females displayed major differences in feed conversion, BW, muscle growth, and organ weight. The Line SD02 chickens grew faster and displayed less fat deposition and superior feed conversion compared with Line SD03 and the reciprocal crosses. In conclusion, performance of the chicken stocks evaluated in this study differs substantially in muscle weight and carcass weight.

Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited onto the N-HCMS via a microwave-assisted reduction process. The morphology, surface area, and pore size distribution of the N-HCMS supported Pt catalysts (Pt/N-HCMS) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and surface area and porosimetry measurements. The electrocatalytic properties of the Pt/N-HCMS catalyst towards oxygen-reduction reaction were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. The Pt/N-HCMS catalyst showed almost double the specific mass activity of a commercial carbon supported Pt catalyst. This was attributed to a uniform dispersion of the Pt NPs and the unique mesoporous and hollow structure of N-HCMS. In addition, fast electron transfer processes were found to occur on the nitrogen doped N-HCMS and the catalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability. This work is of significance for the development of high-performance cathodic catalysts in fuel cells.

NA is synthesized from S-adenosylmethionine in a process catalyzed by nicotianamine synthase (NAS). In this study, a set of structural and phylogenetic analyses have been applied to identify the maize NAS genes based on the maize genome sequence release. Ten maize NAS genes have been mapped; seven of them have not been reported to date. Phylogenetic analysis and expression pattern from microarray data led to their classification into two different orthologous groups. C-terminal fusion of ZmNAS3 with GFP was found in the cytoplasm of Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Expression analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed ZmNAS genes are responsive to heavy metal ions (Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Cd), and all 10 ZmNAS genes were only observed in the root tissue except of ZmNAS6. The promoter of ZmNAS genes was analyzed for the presence of different cis-element response to all kinds of phytohormones and environment stresses. We found that the ZmNAS gene expression of maize seedlings was regulated by jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid. Microarray data demonstrated that the ZmNAS genes show differential, organ-specific expression patterns in the maize developmental steps. The integrated comparative analysis can improve our current view of ZmNAS genes and facilitate the functional characterization of individual members.

They are implicated in the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress responses. With the availability of the maize genome sequence information, we identified 12 members of the maize annexin genes. Analysis of protein sequence and gene structure of maize annexins led to their classification into five different orthologous groups. Expression analysis by RT-PCR revealed that these genes are responsive to heavy metals (Ni, Zn, and Cd). The maize annexin genes were also found to be regulated by Ustilago maydis and jasmonic acid. Additionally, the promoter of the maize annexin gene was analyzed for the presence of different stress-responsive cis-elements, such as ABRE, W-box, GCC-box, and G-box. RT-PCR and microarray data show that all 12 maize annexin genes present differential, organ-specific expression patterns in the maize developmental steps. These results indicate that maize annexin genes may play important roles in the adaptation of plants to various environmental stresses.

However, the role of MEF2c in avian muscle development still remains unclear. To understand the function of MEF2c in avian muscle development, we first cloned the duck MEF2c coding domain sequence (CDS) and analyzed MEF2c expression in duck muscle tissues of embryos from 10 days of incubation to 1 week after birth using real-time PCR technology. The results showed that the duck MEF2c CDS consists of 1,398 nucleotides that encode 465 amino acids. The MEF2c duck protein contains a MADS domain, a MEF2 domain and a HJURP_C domain with high homology to related proteins in other organisms. Different expression levels of MEF2c were found in skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle. Therefore, these results indicated that duck MEF2c has two conserved domains (a MADS and a MEF2 domain), is an indispensable regulator of muscle development, and plays an important role in the development of duck muscle.

The genome contains 27,695 nucleotides (nt), and possesses a genomic structure similar to other IBV strains. Sequence comparisons demonstrated that the Sczy3 genome had the highest nt sequence identity with QX-like IBVs and was most dissimilar to the Massachusetts type IBV. Differences in the sequences of genes present in the Sczy3 genome and other IBVs gene sequences were also identified. Phylogenic analysis showed that the entire genome and most of the Sczy3 genes were located in the same cluster as LX4. Recombination analysis showed that Sczy3 is a chimeric strain derived from LX4 (major parental sequence) and H120 (minor parental sequence) suggesting that recombination occurred in a region containing the 3' terminal 5a sequence (83 nt), the 5' terminal 5b sequence (222 nt), and the 5' terminal nucleocapsid protein gene sequence (132 nt). Mutations and intergenic recombination may have played an important role in the evolution of IBVs.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of vitrification on the distribution and expression of CI( during mouse oocyte maturation. Germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) untreated (fresh), (2) exposed to vitrification solution (VS) without being plunged into liquid nitrogen (CPA exposure), or (3) vitrified using the open-pulled straw (UPS) method (vitrification). The oocytes were then incubated for 0 h, 6 h (metaphase I (MI) stage), and 10 h (metaphase II (Mu) stage). The CK distribution in the oocytes at the GV, MI, and MII stages was observed by immunofluorescence, and the expression at the MII stage oocytes derived from vitrified GV oocytes was detected by Western blotting. The CM distribution in the GV oocytes (88.5%) displayed a cortical pattern in the fresh group, whereas a granular pattern was mainly found at the MI (86.7%) and MII (93.5%) stages. In the CPA exposure group, 90.3% of the GV oocytes were observed to display the cortical pattern, and 69.2% of the MI oocytes and 92.9% of the MII oocytes showed the granular pattern. In the vitrification group, most oocytes (GV, 88.9%; MI, 100%; MII, 93.3%) exhibited the cortical pattern. The CK fluorescence intensities of the MII stage oocytes in both the fresh (59.27) and CPA exposure (60.05) group were significantly higher than that of the vitrification (26.53) group (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that the CM expression in the MII oocytes derived from vitrified GV oocytes was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in the control. In conclusion, UPS vitrification affects the normal CM distribution pattern during oocyte maturation and results in decreased CM expression in MII oocytes derived from vitrified GV oocytes.

Population genetic and phylogenetic analyses were conducted in 66 Tibetan individuals from Sichuan ( SC), Huangshan ( HS), and Fujian ( FJ) based on a 477-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA control region. Four new haplotypes were defined, and a relatively high level of genetic diversity was first observed in FJ populations (Hd 0.7661). Notably, a continuous approximately 10 bp-fragment deletion was observed near the 5' end of the mtDNA control region of both HS and FJ populations when compared with that of SC population, and a sharing haplotype was found between the two populations, revealing a closer genetic relationship. However, significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.8700) and more poor gene exchange (Nm < 1) had occurred among three populations. This study mainly provide a further insight into the genetic relationship between HS and FJ Tibetan macaque populations, but it may be necessary to carry out further study with extra samples from other locations in the geographic coverage of the two subspecies (M. thibetana pullus and M. thibetana huangshanensis).

This gene was cloned from the rice 'Digu' (indica) by performing a genome-wide comparison of the NBS-LRR gene family between two genome-sequenced varieties, '9311' (indica) and 'Nipponbare' (japonica). In this study, we performed functional analysis of Pid3-A4, an ortholog of Pid3 revealed by allele mining in the common wild rice A4 (Oryza rufipogon). The predicted protein encoded by Pid3-A4 shares 99.03% sequence identity with Pid3, with only nine amino-acid substitutions. In wild rice plants, Pid3-A4 is constitutively expressed, and its expression is not induced by Magnaporthe oryzae isolate Zhong-10-8-14 infection. Importantly, in transgenic plants, Pid3-A4, as compared with Pid3, displays a distinct resistance spectrum to a set of M. oryzae isolates, including those that prevail in the rice fields of Sichuan Province. Therefore, Pid3-A4 should be quite useful for the breeding of rice blast resistance, especially in southwestern China.

A hairpin RNA expression vector was constructed herein to overcome the low efficiency of cultural protection against MDMV and to improve the MDMV resistance mediated by a shorter transgenic inverted-repeat sequence. This expression vector contained a 451 bp inverted-repeat sequence, homologous to the protease gene (P1) of MDMV. It was used for the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of maize calli induced from a susceptible inbred line. A total of 17 T-2 transgenic lines were identified by both specific PCR amplification and Southern blot hybridization. Of these lines, 15 were evaluated for MDMV resistance in inoculation field trials under two environments. The relative replication levels of the P1 gene were analyzed by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. Results demonstrated that all of the 15 T-2 lines showed an enhanced resistance to MDMV in comparison with that of the non-transformed parent line. Six lines were deemed to be 'resistant' with an average disease index below 25 %, which was not significantly different from that of the resistant control. The relative replication levels of the virus gene were significantly reduced in these resistant T-2 transgenic lines. The efficiency of virus gene silencing was directly related to the transgene copy numbers presented in these transgenic lines.

Both culture filtrate and cell lysate of LZ16 possessed strong growth inhibition activities against Magnaporthe oryzae. Morphological observations revealed that conidial germination, germ tube elongation, appressorium formation were significantly inhibited after the treatment with cell lysate of LZ16. The active substances remained stable at temperature from 7 to 45 degrees C, and pH from 6 to 8. One of the fractions conferring strong fungistatic activities was separated using Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and Sephacryl S-200 High resolution columns, and identified as purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. The gene deoD encoding PNP was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli for the verification of the antagonistic activity against M. oryzae. This is the first report that PNP was associated with fungistatic activity. Field experiments showed that the extract of the bacterial culture prevented and alleviated the disease severity of M. oryzae infection compared to the level in the untreated control. The acute toxicity study revealed the lethal oral dose was more than 5000 mg/kg, and the adverse effect was not observed on both male and female rats after treatment for 14 days. All the results suggested that strain LZ16 and its bioactive substances might be promising candidates for biopesticide development, or transgenetic plant materials for the biocontrol of rice blast.

Inbreeding and Genetic Diversity in Three Imported Swine Breeds in China Using Pedigree Data	ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Genetic Diversity; Inbreeding; Pedigree; Swine	CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; SIZES; PIGS	The accumulation of inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity is a potential problem in the modern swine breeds in China. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the pedigrees of Chinese Duroc (CD), Landrace (CL) and Yorkshire (CY) swine to estimate the past and current rates of inbreeding, and to identify the main causes of genetic diversity loss. Pedigree files from CD, CL and CY containing, 4529, 16,776 and 22,600 records, respectively, were analyzed. Pedigree completeness indexes of the three breeds, accounting for one generation back, were 83.72, 93.93 and 93.59%, respectively. The estimated average annual inbreeding rates for CD, CL and CY in recent three years were 0.21, 0.19 and 0.13%, respectively. The estimated average percentage of genetic diversity loss within each breed in recent three years was about 8.92, 2.19, and 3.36%, respectively. The average relative proportion of genetic diversity loss due to unequal contributions of founders in CD, CL and CY was 69.09, 57.95 and 60.57%, and due to random genetic drift was 30.91, 42.05 and 39.43%, respectively. The estimated current effective population size for CD, CL and CY was 76, 117 and 202, respectively. Therefore, CD has been found to have lost considerable genetic diversity, demanding priority for optimizing the selection and mating to control future coancestry and inbreeding. Unequal contribution of founders was a major cause of genetic diversity loss in Chinese swine breeds and random genetic drift also showed substantial impact on the loss of diversity.	[Tang, G.

Results showed that the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) in serum and all tissues apparently decreased with increasing histidine levels up to an optimal level and increased thereafter. Anti-superoxide anion (ASA) capacity, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities and glutathione (GSH) content in serum and all tissues, anti-hydroxyl radical (a-HR) capacity, catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities in serum, muscle and intestine, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in serum and intestine, as well as glutathione reductase (GR) activity in serum, muscle and hepatopancreas were improved by dietary histidine. Fish fed diet with 8.6 g/kg histidine had lower serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activity than that fed with control diet, whereas pattern of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) activity was opposite. The present results suggested that histidine could improve antioxidant capacity and inhibit lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation of juvenile Jian carp.

To identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may promote muscle growth, we used RNA interference mediated by a lentiviral vector to knockdown myostatin in goat fetal fibroblast cells. We also investigated the expression changes in relevant myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and adipogenic regulatory factors in the absence of myostatin in goat fetal fibrolasts. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that myostatin transcripts were significantly reduced by 75 % (P < 0.01). Western blot showed that myostatin protein expression was reduced by 95 % (P < 0.01). We also found that the mRNA expression of activin receptor IIB (ACVR2B) significantly increased by 350 % (P < 0.01), and p21 increased 172 % (P < 0.01). Furthermore, myostatin inhibition decreased Myf5 and increased MEF2C mRNA expression in goat fetal fibroblasts, suggesting that myostatin regulates MRFs differently in fibroblasts compared to muscle. In addition, the expression of adipocyte marker genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and leptin, but not CCAAT/enhance-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha and C/EBP beta, were upregulated at the transcript level after myostatin silencing. These results suggest that we have generated a novel way to block myostatin in vitro, which could be used to improve livestock meat production and gene therapy of musculoskeletal diseases. This also suggests that myostatin plays a negative role in regulating the expression of adipogenesis related genes in goat fetal fibroblasts.

Jian carp, with an average initial weight of 7.17 +/- 0.01g, were fed with diets containing graded concentrations of available phosphorus, namely 1.7 (control), 3.6, 5.5, 7.3, 9.2 and 11.0gkg1 diet for 9weeks. Results showed that, in intestine and hepatopancreas, content of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) and glutathione (GSH), capacity of anti-superoxide anion (ASA) and anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), and glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were significantly affected by dietary phosphorus levels (P<0.05). Regression analysis showed that significant quadratic responses occurred in MDA content and ASA, GST, GPx and AHR activities in intestine, GSH content and CAT and SOD activities in hepatopancreas (P<0.05). These results indicate that optimal level of dietary phosphorus prevented oxidative damage and increased antioxidant enzyme activities in the intestine and hepatopancreas of juvenile Jian carp. The phosphorus requirement estimated from MDA using quadratic regression analysis was 5.7gkg1 diet.

M. sinensis has been selected as a candidate for bioenergy resources, owing to its high biomass potential and good adaptability on marginal lands. In this study, we detected the genetic diversity in wild populations of M. sinensis in southwest China. The results showed the percentage of polymorphic bands is 93.2%, the average Nei's gene diversity in population was 0.3870 and mean Shannon index was 0.5589. The mean of total gene diversity (H-T) was 0.3831 +/- 0.0216, while the allelic diversity within populations (H-S) and among populations (D-ST) was 0.3127 +/- 0.0161 and 0.0704, respectively. The genetic differentiation coefficient (G(ST)) was 0,1838, and the gene flow (N-m) was 1.110. The wild populations of M. sinensis have high genetic diversity within each population than among populations.

T. gondii infection may alter the expression profile of host microRNAs (miRNAs) which have key regulatory functions at the post-transcriptional level. Methods: Using high-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR technology, we compared the miRNA expression profiles of uninfected mouse brains with brains from mice at 14 days and 21 days after infection with cyst-forming T. gondii (Type II). Results: A total of 51.30 million raw reads were obtained from all samples and 495 (14d infected mouse sample), 511 (14d sham-infected control), 504 (21d infected mouse sample) and 514 (21d sham-infected control) miRNA candidates identified. Among these, 414 miRNAs were consistent across all the studied groups, 17 were specific to the 14d infected group and 32 were specific to the 21d infected group. In addition, 9 miRNAs were common to both the 14d- and 21d-infected groups. Enrichment analysis for the targets of these miRNAs showed a high percentage of "protein tag" functions. Immune related targets including chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and interleukins were also found. Conclusions: These results not only showed that the miRNA expression of the host can be changed by the invasion of cyst-forming T. gondii, but also indicated that the host attempts to respond using two tactics: marking proteins with "protein tags" and adaptation of immune related systems.

A novel canine parvovirus (CPV) was detected from the giant panda in China. Results: Nucleotide and phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein VP2 gene classified the CPV as a new CPV-2a type. Substitution of Gln for Arg at the conserved 370 residue in CPV presents an unusual variation in the new CPV-2a amino acid sequence of the giant panda and is further evidence for the continuing evolution of the virus. Conclusions: These findings extend the knowledge on CPV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.

A molecular study was conducted to detect evidence of a phylogenic relationship between these two porcine TTSuV genogroups from the sera of 244 infected pigs located in 21 subordinate prefectures and/or cities of Sichuan. Results: Both genogroups of TTSuV were detected in pig sera collected from all 21 regions examined. Of the 244 samples, virus from either genogroup was detected in 203 (83.2%), while 44 animals (18.0%) were co-infected with viruses of both genogroups. Moreover, TTSuV2 (186/244, 76.2%) was more prevalent than TTSuV1 (61/244, 25%). There was statistically significant difference between the prevalence of genogroups 1 infection alone (9.4%, 23/244) and 2 alone (64.8%, 158/244), and between the prevalence of genogroups 2 (76.2%, 186/244) and both genogroups co-infection (18.0%, 44/244). The untranslated region of the swine TTSuV genome was found to be an adequate molecular marker of the virus for detection and surveillance. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both genogroups 1 and 2 could be further divided into two subtypes, subtype a and b. TTSuV1 subtype b and the two TTSuV2 subtypes are more prevalent in Sichuan Province. Conclusions: Our study presents detailed geographical evidence of TTSuV infection in China.

To investigate the systematic association between the differences in gene expression profiling and adipose deposition, we used pig as a model, and measured the gene expression profiling of six variant adipose tissues in male and females from three pig breeds which display distinct fat level. Results: We identified various differential expressed genes among breeds, tissues and between sexes, and further used a clustering method to identify sets of functionally co-expression genes linked to different obesity-related phenotypes. Our results reveal that the subcutaneous adipose tissues mainly modulate metabolic indicators, nonetheless, the visceral adipose tissues as well as the intermuscular adipose tissue were mainly associated with the impaired inflammatory and immune response. Conclusions: The present study provided the evidence of gene expression profiling that the subcutaneous adipose tissues are mainly affected the metabolism process, whereas the visceral and intermuscular adipose tissues should been term as the metabolic risk factors of obesity.

Our previous study reported that a nutrient antioxidant, myo-inositol (MI), can protect fish from Cu-induced oxidative injury; however, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze potential pathways. First, to investigate the hypothesis that MI protects enterocytes against Cu toxicity via the intercept pathway, enterocytes were treated with different concentrations of MI (0-75 mg/L medium) in the presence of 6 mg/L of Cu for 24 h (Experiment 1). Next, we investigated the potential reparative role of MI after a Cu challenge (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 1 indicated that cells exposed to Cu alone for 24 h exhibited increases in lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and protein oxidation (P < 0.05). Notably, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on LDH release was observed with all doses of MI. Moreover, co-treatment with MI completely inhibited Cu-induced protein carbonyl (PC) formation. However, Cu-induced lipid peroxidation was not altered by MI co-treatment. Additionally, Cu exposure suppressed total-superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZnSOD and catalase (CAT) activities, and these changes were completely blocked by co-treatment with sufficient MI concentrations. In contrast, cells exposed to Cu exhibited adaptive increases in reduced glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR). Interestingly, the Cu-stimulated increases in these antioxidants were blocked by co-treatment with sufficient MI concentrations. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that cell injury (LDH release), lipid peroxidation (MDA formation) and protein oxidation induced by Cu were reversed by subsequent MI treatment. Meanwhile, Cu-induced decreases in alkaline phosphatase (AMP), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), T-SOD and CuZnSOD activities were completely restored by subsequent MI treatment, while the reduced CAT activity was partially restored. However, MI rescues partially restored the adaptive increase in GPx activity induced by Cu, whereas the adaptive increase in reduced GSH content was completely reversed by 75 mg/L of MI. However, subsequent MI treatments did not alter the induction of GST activity by Cu. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that MI not only protected enterocytes from Cu-induced oxidative damage but also increased the repair activity in primary enterocytes after challenge with Cu. Moreover, MI-mediated increases in antioxidant enzyme activities contributed to lipid and protein oxidant repair. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Preliminary structural characterization was conducted by physicochemical property, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing activity power (FRAP), hydroxyl radical and erythrocyte hemolysis were also evaluated. The physicochemical property analysis indicated significant differences in the three polysaccharides. The FTIR spectra revealed the general characteristic absorption peaks of the three polysaccharides. The SEM images demonstrated significant differences in the surface features of the different polysaccharides. The antioxidant activity assays revealed the obvious antioxidant activities of three polysaccharides, and the polysaccharides of Hawk primary leaf tea exhibited higher antioxidant activities than the other two polysaccharides. With current findings, the polysaccharides from Hawk primary leaf tea may have potential applications in food industries. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

IMPACT OF GRASS ROOT MASS DENSITY ON SOIL DETACHMENT CAPACITY BY CONCENTRATED FLOW ON STEEP SLOPES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Concentrated flow; Detachment rate; Erodibility; Root density; Versatile switchgrass	PLANT-ROOTS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; LOESS PLATEAU; EROSION; ERODIBILITY; TOPSOILS; STRENGTH; TILLAGE; RUNOFF; RATES	The effects of root systems on soil detachment, which are closely related to plant species and flow properties, are not well documented under a wide range of flow hydraulics. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of root mass density of a versatile switchgrass species (Panicum virgatum) on soil detachment capacity, rill erodibility, critical shear stress, and relative soil detachment in a laboratory flume under a wide range of hydraulics using undisturbed soil samples collected from one bare plot (control) and five grass plots with different plant densities. The flow rates varied from 1.32 x 10(-3) to 6.58 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1), slope gradients from 17.4% to 42.3%, and root mass densities from 0.25 to 17.98 kg m(-3). The results showed that soil detachment capacity decreased exponentially with increasing root mass density. The average detachment capacity of soil samples with roots was only one-fourth that of the control, and the rapid decline mostly occurred in the root density range of 0 to 4 kg m(-3). Rill erodibility declined exponentially as root mass density increased (R-2 = 0.595, n = 409), whereas no consistent trend for critical shear stress was found. Live roots reduced soil erodibility up to 78% compared with the control. Relative soil detachment decreased as an exponential function with root mass density (R-2 = 0.395, n = 409). However, the exponential decline was less pronounced compared to other studies, probably caused by differences in plant species, amounts of dead root or residue, and experimental conditions.

Previous assessments of coconut germplasm have been conducted based solely on phenotypic data for agronomic and quality traits, due to lack of available molecular markers. In this study, we developed 30 novel microsatellite markers from Illumina transcriptome sequence data, and used these markers to evaluate coconut genetic diversity in 30 individuals representing accessions from China (12 samples) and Southeast Asia (18 samples). The microsatellite markers displayed low to high genetic polymorphism across the population: observed heterozygosity varied from 0.06 to 0.79, with an average of 0.39 +/- 0.15. Our results indicated that the Southeast Asian population had a significantly higher number of alleles (p=0.02), but not significantly different (p<0.05) observed heterozygosity (p=0.08) or Shannon's diversity index score (p=0.12) compared to the population from China. Population structure analysis showed that Chinese coconuts were genetically similar to a subset of coconut germplasm from Southeast Asia, suggesting that Chinese coconuts did not evolve independently of the Southeast Asian populations. Combining population structural analyses and historic information, we have devised a possible explanation for coconut dispersal patterns from Southeast Asia to China: sea currents could have carried coconuts into the Hainan province, while human dispersal from Southeast Asia may have brought coconuts to the Yunnan province.

Mutation in the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) gene contributes to the waxy phenotype. Two classes of waxy alleles, wx(a) and wx(b), have been characterized previously. In the present work, we identified two novel types of waxy mutations in the sorghum GBSS gene, designated as wx(c) and wx(d). The wx(c) allele has a G deletion at the 5' splicing site of the ninth intron, causing a shift of the 5' cleavage site; in turn, a reading frame shift occurred and resulted in an early translation termination. The wx(d) allele contained a mutation at the 3' splicing site of the 10th intron, which led to a splicing site shift and resulted in the deletion of five amino acids (GTGKK) in the predicted translation product. Furthermore, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed to detect the wx(c) and wx(d) alleles. With these markers, classification of waxy alleles was performed in nearly 100 sorghum accessions from our breeding program. Most waxy sorghum cultivars in China were either wx(a) or wx(c), implying that these two mutations are preferentially maintained during domestic selection in glutinous sorghum production.

It has evolved independently in placental mammals and flowering plants. In plants, imprinting is mainly found in endosperm. Recent genome-wide surveys in Arabidopsis, rice, and maize identified hundreds of imprinted genes in endosperm. Since these genes are of diverse functions, endosperm development is regulated at different regulatory levels. The imprinted expression of only a few genes is conserved between Arabidopsis and monocots, suggesting that imprinting evolved quickly during speciation. In Arabidopsis, DEMETER (DME) mediates hypomethylation in the maternal genome at numerous loci (mainly transposons and repeats) in the central cell and results in many differentially methylated regions between parental genomes in the endosperm, and subsequent imprinted expression of some genes. In addition, histone modification mediated by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins is also involved in regulating imprinting. DME-induced hypomethylated alleles in the central cell are considered to produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which are imported to the egg to reinforce DNA methylation. In parallel, the activity of DME in the vegetative cell of the male gametophyte demethylates many regions which overlap with the demethylated regions in the central cell. siRNAs from the demethylated regions are hypothesized to be also transferred into sperm to reinforce DNA methylation. Imprinting is partly the result of genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming in the central cell and vegetative cell and evolved under different selective pressures.

In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying relationship between infection and injury by investigation of the whole porcine genome expression profiles of swine lung tissues post-inoculated with experimentally Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Expression profiling experiments of the control group and the treatment group were conducted using a commercially available Agilent Porcine Genechip including 43,603 probe sets. Microarray analysis was conducted on profiles of lung from challenged versus non-challenged swine. We found 11,929 transcripts, identified as differentially expressed at the p = 0.01 level. There were 1188 genes annotated as swine genes in the GenBank Data Base. GO term analysis identified a total of 89 biological process categories, 82 cellular components and 182 molecular functions that were significantly affected, and at least 27 biological process categories that were related to the host immune response. Gene set enrichment analysis identified 13 pathways that were significantly associated with host response. Many proinflammatory-inflammatory cytokines were activated and involved in the regulation of the host defense response at the site of inflammation; while the cytokines involved in regulation of the host immune response were suppressed. All changes of genes and pathways of induced or repressed expression not only led to a decrease in antigenic peptides presented to T lymphocytes by APCs via the MHC and alleviated immune response injury induced by infection, but also stimulated stem cells to produce granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and monocyte, and promote neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose bacterial and foreign antigen at the site of inflammation. The defense function of swine infection with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was improved, while its immune function was decreased.

Despite the wide use of vaccines to control the disease, infection with the virus cannot be completely prevented. Therefore, antiviral agents against DEV should be developed. This study presents a novel sulfated polysaccharide from Chuanminshen violaceum (sCVPS), which exhibits significant antiviral activity against DEV with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 77.12 mu g/mL to 104.81 mu g/mL. sCVPS is more effective than heparan sulfate (HS, as a positive control) with IC(50=)132.61 mu g/ml sCVPS and HS inhibit viral activity by preventing virus adsorption with IC50 values ranging from 82.83 mu g/mL to 109.28 mu g/mL for sCVPS and 150.22 mu g/mL for HS. Direct immunofluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the mechanism of action was the interference with virus adsorption. The amount of inhibited virus during adsorption was quantified using fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which revealed that both sCVPS and HS can significantly reduce all viruses attached to cells. sCVPS also prevented the cell-to-cell spread of DEV. These results indicated that sCVPSs perform more effectively than does HS as antiviral agents against DEV and can be further examined for potential effects as an alternative control measure for DEV infection.

The cecal tonsil is an important component of the mucosal immune system and performs important and unique immune functions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dietary high fluorine on the quantities of IgA(+) B cells in the cecal tonsil by immunohistochemistry, and the immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) contents in the cecal tonsil by ELISA. A total of 280 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet (fluorine 22.6 mg/kg) or the same diet supplemented with 400, 800 and 1,200 mg/kg fluorine (high fluorine groups I, II and III) in the form of sodium fluoride, respectively, throughout a 42-day experimental period. The results showed that the quantities of IgA(+) B cells were lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) and the IgA, IgG, and IgM contents were decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in high fluorine groups II and III in comparison with those of control group. It was concluded that dietary fluorine, in the 800- 1,200 mg/kg range, could reduce the numbers of the IgA(+) B cells and immunoglobulin contents in the cecal tonsil, implying the local mucosal immune function was ultimately impacted in broilers.

This study evaluated the effects of biodegradable ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDDS), nitrilotriacetic (NTA) and anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) on the tolerance and uptake of Siegesbeckia orientalis L at 10 and 100 mg kg(-1) Cd-contaminated soils. On the 80th and 90th days of transplanting, pots were treated with EDDS and NTA at 0 (control), 1 and 2 mmol kg(-1) soils, and APAM at 0 (control), 0.07 and 0.14 g kg(-1). Generally, the root and shoot biomass of S. orientalis in all treatments reduced not significantly compared with the control, and the activities of peroxidase and catalase in leaves generally increased by the application of chelants (P < 0.05). The concentrations of Cd in the shoots were increased significantly by addition of all chelants. As a result, the Cd accumulation of S. orientalis under treatments with higher dosages of the three chelants on the 80th day were 1.40-2.10-fold and 1.12-1.25-fold compared to control at 10 and 100 mg kg(-1) Cd, respectively. Under the addition of 2 mmol kg(-1) NTA on the 80th day, the highest metal extraction ratio reached 1.2% and 0.4% at 10 and 100 mg kg(-1) Cd soils, respectively. Therefore, the applications of EDDS, NTA and APAM may provide more efficient choices in chemical-enhanced phytoextraction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A procedure allowing up to eight generations of wheat and nine generations of barley per annum	EUPHYTICA			English	Article						Embryo culture; Wheat; Barley; Generation cycle	TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; EMBRYO RESCUE; HORDEUM-VULGARE; RESISTANCE; CROSSES; INVITRO; HYBRIDS; MAIZE	Generating segregating populations and 'pure lines' is an essential component in many projects of plant breeding and biological studies. Time taken to obtain these materials is often a critical factor restricting the progress of such projects. We report a procedure here which, by combining embryo culture with managements of watering regimes, lighting intensity and duration, temperature and quantity of potting mixture, allows the production of up to eight generations of wheat and nine generations of barley per annum. By dramatically shortening the time frame required to obtain segregating populations and 'pure lines', the procedure could find wide applications in breeding and biological studies.

NOV.; SOIL; BACTERIUM; SEQUENCES; TREES; ACID	A novel bacterial strain, TRM F109(T), was isolated from hypersaline habitat in Sichuan Province, China. It was a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, halotolerant, filamentous bacterium. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed levels of similarity of 97.0-98.4 % to the type strains of recognized species of the genus Isoptericola. Chemotaxonomic data also supported the placement of strain TRM F109(T) within the genus Isoptericola. The low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between the novel strain and the type strains of recognized species of the genus Isoptericola, in combination with differential phenotypic data, demonstrate that strain TRM F109(T) represents a novel species of the genus Isoptericola, for which the name Isoptericola salitolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM F109(T) (=JCM 15901(T)=KCTC 19617(T)).

In this study, a trivalent inactivated vaccine of R. anatipestifer, including strains CH3 (serotype 1), NJ3 (serotype 2), and HXb2 (serotype 10), was developed. Animal experiments showed that the ducks that received two immunizations with the vaccine were 100% protected from challenge with strains from any of the three serotypes (1, 2, or 10). No death or clinical signs of diarrhea, tremors, or limb swelling were shown in the protected ducks. Also, no R. anatipestifer bacteria were isolated from the livers or brains of the protected ducks. Furthermore, no histopathological changes were observed in the liver, spleen, or brain samples from the protected ducks during histological examination. The ducks that received two immunizations with the vaccine generated high antibody titers of 1:3,200 to 1: 6,400 against the three serotypes of strains. The vaccine significantly enhanced the production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) after one immunization and enhanced the production of IL-4 and IL-10 after two immunizations. In addition, real-time PCR indicated that the expression of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I), as well as that of CD40 and CD154 molecules, was significantly increased after one immunization, and the expressions of both MHC-I and MHC-II molecules were increased after two immunizations. Our study indicates that the vaccine can induce both humoral and cellular immunities in ducks and offer effective protection against R. anatipestifer infection.

Herein, a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) gene was identified from transcriptomic data in T. multiceps. This gene, which contains a complete coding sequence, was amplified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The corresponding protein, which was named TmFABP, had a molecular weight of 14 kDa, and subsequently was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified on Ni-NTA beads (Bio-Rad). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses showed that the purified recombinant protein caused immunogenicity. Immunohistochemical studies showed that TmFABP was expressed at the tegumental level in the protoscolices and in the cells between the body wall and parenchyma layer of the cestode. In sections from gravid proglottids, intense staining was detected in the uterus and eggs. Based on this, TmFABP could be switched on during differentiation of germinative layers to protoscoleces and from metacestodes to adult worms. Taken together, our results already reported for T. multiceps suggest the possibility of TmFABP developing a vaccine to control and prevent coenurosis.

The intestinal mucosa is very important to the immune development. Meanwhile, cytokines are present in the normal intestinal mucosal and play an important role in the immune function. Thus, changes of the cytokine contents are related to the state of intestinal mucosal immunity. In this study, we investigated the changes in contents of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced by dietary high F in the mucosa of different parts of intestines (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 280 one-day-old healthy avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet (F 22.6 mg/kg) or the same basal diet supplemented with 400, 800, and 1,200 mg F/kg (high F groups I, II, and III) in the form of sodium fluoride for 42 days. The experimental data showed that the contents of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in the intestinal mucosa were significantly decreased in the high F groups II and III when compared with those of the control group from 14 to 42 days of age. It was concluded that dietary F in the range of 800-1,200 mg/kg significantly reduced the contents of aforementioned cytokines in the intestinal mucosa of broilers, which could impact the function of intestinal mucosal immunity through the pathways that decreased the lymphocyte population and/or lymphocyte activation.

It plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity. Here, the full-length cDNA of CD4 in Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides) was cloned and identified. The goose CD4 is 1940 bp in length and encodes a single open-reading frame of 480 amino acids. The putative amino acid sequence of goose CD4 consisted of a signal peptide, four potential N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. The multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that goose CD4 shared a higher similarity with avian than other vertebrates. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the highest level of CD4 mRNA transcripts was presented in the thymus, and relatively lower in the spleen, small intestine, brain and trachea. Low expression was seen in the bursa of fabricius, cecal tonsil, cecum, skin, lung, kidney and liver. In gosling, the CD4 transcript was expressed with high abundance in the thymus, and relatively lower in the spleen, cecal tonsil and small intestine. However, in adult goose, high expression was seen in the thymus, spleen and cecum, and relatively lower in the cecal tonsil and small intestine. During the course of NGVEV infection, the obvious increase in CD4 gene expression was observed in the spleen, bursa of fabricius and harderian gland. Interestingly, a notable decrease in CD4 mRNA expression in the small intestine at 5 d PI and followed by an increase of that at 19 d PI were shown. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Genetic relationships between A.tauschii and the wheat D genome are of central importance for the understanding of wheat origin and subsequent evolution. Genetic relationships among 477 A.tauschii and wheat accessions were studied with the A.tauschii 10K Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Aegilops tauschii consists of two lineages (designated 1 and 2) having little genetic contact. Each lineage consists of two closely related sublineages. A population within lineage 2 in the southwestern and southern Caspian appears to be the main source of the wheat D genome. Lineage 1 contributed as little as 0.8% of the wheat D genome. Triticum aestivum is subdivided into the western and Far Eastern populations. The Far Eastern population conserved the genetic make-up of the nascent T.aestivum more than the western population. In wheat, diversity is high in chromosomes 1D and 2D and it correlates in all wheat D-genome and A.tauschii chromosomes with recombination rates. Gene flow from A.tauschii was an important source of wheat genetic diversity and shaped its distribution along the D-genome chromosomes.

It remains a serious public health problem in many developing countries including China. This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, morbidity, and endemic distributions of human brucellosis in the People's Republic of China for the period 2005-2010. From 2005 to 2010, the incidence of human brucellosis rose substantially in China, especially in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi3, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Jilin, and Shanxi1. Meanwhile human brucellosis increased gradually in some southern provinces, such as Henan, Guangdong, and Fujian. Due to the rapid expansion of human brucellosis in China, surveillance and prevention of this disease has been greatly challenged. (C) 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

In this study, we obtained the cDNA and promoter sequences of the porcine GSK-3 alpha gene, analyzed its genomic organization and mapped it to SSC6q12 through comparative mapping method. Moreover, the qRT-PCR analysis revealed that porcine GSK-3 alpha gene was widely expressed in many tissues, and a high expression level was observed in the brain and spleen. In addition, seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the promoter region of porcine GSK-3 alpha gene. Association analysis revealed that the GSK-3 alpha Hin1I and MspI polymorphisms both had significant associations (p < 0.05) with loin muscle area, average backfat thickness, thorax-waist fat thickness, and buttock fat thickness. These results provide useful information for further investigation on the function of porcine GSK-3 alpha gene.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in the synthesis and folding of proteins. The disruption of ER homeostasis affects protein folding and causes ER stress, which is associated with protein synthesis in muscle cells. The purpose of this study was to establish the mechanism by which decorin promotes myoblast proliferation and myotube hypertrophy as mediated by an ER stress-related pathway. Duck myoblasts were incubated for 24 h with tunicamycin. Our results show that tunicamycin triggered ER stress in myoblasts and led to an increase in protein synthesis via a decorin-dependent pathway. We then transfected the decorin gene into duck myoblasts in vitro, and the results demonstrated that overexpression of duck decorin increased myogenic determination factor and follistatin expression and decreased myogenin and myostatin expression. Moreover, the results demonstrated that overexpression of duck decorin led to higher expression of ER stress marker genes. This increased expression trend can be alleviated in vitro by 4-PBA, which is a chemical chaperone that inhibits palmitate-induced ER stress. Collectively, our data show that duck decorin promotes myoblast proliferation mediated by an ER stress-related pathway.

This study proposed a radial basis function neural networks model (RBFNN), combined with principal component analysis (PCA), to predict the spatial distribution of SOM content across China. To assess its feasibility, 6241 soil samples collected during the second national soil survey period were used. To predict the SOM at such scale, the entire study area was firstly divided into 22 different soil-landscape units according to soil types and vegetation types; then 11 quantitative environmental factors derived from climate, topography, and vegetation were converted into principal components (PC) and the first five PCs which explain 92.97% of the total data variance were selected as predictors for the purpose of eliminating the mulicollinearity of these actual variables and reducing the number of predictors; finally, a specific artificial neural network model was trained for each soil-landscape unit to capture the relationships between SOM and PCs and then used to predict the distribution of SOM content within the corresponding soil-landscape unit. The performance of this approach was evaluated by several validation indices and compared with multiple linear regression (MLR) and regression kriging (RK). The results have shown that RBFNN performs much better than both MLR and RK with much higher ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and lower prediction errors (mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) and root mean squared error (RMSE)). The RPD obtained by RBFNN was 1.94, which resulted in relative improvement of 29.33% compared with RK and MLR. The three prediction errors of RBFNN were smaller than that of MLR and RK by 3.10 g.kg(-1), 17.25%, 6.25 g.kg(-1), and by 234 g.kg(-1), 5.93%, 6.24 g.kg(-1) respectively. Also, RBFNN presented a more realistic spatial pattern of SOM than RK and MLR. The good performance of this method can be attributed to the division of the study area and the capability of RBFNN to capture the nonlinear relationships between SOM and environmental factors within different soil-landscape units. The result suggests that the proposed method can play a vital role in improving prediction accuracy of SOM within a large area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared to homologous proteins, they showed novel modifications in all domains. In the N-terminals, the y subunit from Er. triticeum (Xey) had 98 aa residues. A short G/IIFWGTS peptide deletion was responsible for the reduced number of aa residues. The end peptide in the y subunit from Er. distans (Fy) was IPTLLR. This unique structure was involved in a replacement between x types with IPA/TLLK/R and y types with R/TSSQTVQ. Both y subunits share the same short peptide LAAQLPAMCRL as x types in the C-terminals. Phylogenic relationships among orthologous genes from Triticeae species revealed that Fy and Xey were neither purely x type nor purely y type based on the N and C terminal residues. Divergence times indicated that Glu-Xe1 and Glu-F1 were separated from each other and that Glu-Xe1 separated from orthologous loci of wild wheat relatives earlier than Glu-F1. Based on the divergence times among Glu-F1, Glu-Xe1, Glu-O1, Glu-St1, and Glu-Ta1, it is possible that genome F separation from O, St, and Ta in species of Henrardia persica, Pseudoroegneria stipifolia, and Taeniatherum crinitum was more recent than the separation of F and Xe.

However, they are not compounds largely accumulated in natural organism. The need for the next generation of biofuels with better physical and chemical properties impels us to develop biosynthetic routes for the production of isoprenol and prenol from renewable sugar. In this study, we use the heterogenous mevalonate-dependent (MVA) isoprenoid pathway for the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) intermediates, and then convert IPP and DMAPP to isoprenol and prenol, respectively. Results: A mevalonate titer of 1.7 g/L was obtained by constructing an efficient MVA upper pathway in engineered E. coli. Different phosphatases and pyrophosphatases were investigated for their abilities in hydrolyzing the IPP and DMAPP. Consequently, ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase was found to be an efficient IPP and DMAPP hydrolase. Moreover, ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase from Bacillus subtilis (BsNudF) exhibited a equivalent substrate specificity towards IPP and DMAPP, while ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase from E. coli (EcNudF) presented a high substrate preference for DMAPP. Without the expression of any phosphatases or pyrophosphatases, a background level of isopentenols was synthesized. When the endogenous pyrophosphatase genes (EcNudF and yggV) that were capable of enhancing the hydrolyzation of the IPP and DMAPP were knocked out, the background level of isopentenols was still obtained. Maybe the synthesized IPP and DMAPP were hydrolyzed by some unknown hydrolases of E. coli. Finally, 1.3 g/L single isoprenol was obtained by blocking the conversion of IPP to DMAPP and employing the BsNudF, and 0.2 g/L similar to 80% prenol was produced by employing the EcNudF. A maximal yield of 12% was achieved in both isoprenol and prenol producing strains. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful report on high-specificity production of isoprenol and prenol by microbial fermentation. Over 1.3 g/L isoprenol achieved in shake-flask experiments represents a quite encouraging titer of higher alcohols. In addition, the substrate specificities of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases were determined and successfully applied for the high-specificity synthesis of isoprenol and prenol. Altogether, this work presents a promising strategy for high-specificity production of two excellent biofuels, isoprenol and prenol.

Litterbags with senescent birch, fir, and spruce leaves were placed on the forest floor at 2,704 m, 3,023 m, 3,298 m, and 3,582 m elevation. Results showed that the decomposition rate positively correlated with soil mean temperature during the plant growing season, and with the number of soil freeze-thaw cycles during the winter. Concentrations of soluble nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) had positive effects but C: N and lignin: N ratios had negative effects on the decomposition rate (k), especially during the winter. Meanwhile, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), N (MBN), and P (MBP) were positively correlated with k values during the first growing season. These biotic factors accounted for 60.0% and 56.4% of the variation in decomposition rate during the winter and the growing season in the first year, respectively. Specifically, litter chemistry (C, N, P, K, lignin, C: N and lignin: N ratio) independently explained 29.6% and 13.3%, and the microbe-related factors (MBC, MBN, MBP, bacterial and fungal biomass, sucrase and ACP activity) explained 22.9% and 34.9% during the first winter and the first growing season, respectively. We conclude that frequent freeze-thaw cycles and litter chemical properties determine the winter decomposition while microbe-related factors play more important roles in determining decomposition in the subsequent growing season.

Studies on the cytoplasmic effects of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) show that most types of CMS have negative effects on yield-related traits and that these negative effects vary among CMS. Some types of genic male sterility (GMS), including photo-thermo sensitive male sterility (PTMS), have been widely used in rice breeding, but the cytoplasmic effects of GMS remain unknown. Here, we identified a GMS mutant line, h(2)s, which exhibited small, white anthers and failed to produce mature pollen. Unlike CMS, the h(2)s had significant positive cytoplasmic effects on the seed set rate, weight per panicle, yield, and general combining ability (GCA) for plant height, seed set rate, weight per panicle, and yield. These effects indicated that h(2)s cytoplasm may show promise for the improvement of rice yield. Genetic analysis suggested that the phenotype of h(2)s was controlled by a single recessive locus. We mapped h(2)s to a 152 kb region on chromosome 6, where 22 candidate genes were predicted. None of the 22 genes had previously been reported to be responsible for the phenotypes of h(2)s. Sequencing analysis showed a 12 bp deletion in the sixth exon of Loc_Os06g40550 in h(2)s in comparison to wild type, suggesting that Loc_Os06g40550 is the best candidate gene. These results lay a strong foundation for cloning of the H2S gene to elucidate the molecular mechanism of male reproduction.

To address these limitations, a high sensitive aptasensor for sulfadimethoxine (SDM) using unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed in the present study. The assay sensitivity was improved by optimizing several key parameters such as the amount of aptamer adsorbed to AuNPs, the concentration of salt and the AuNPs pH value. To our knowledge, this is the first time to investigate the effect of AuNPs pH value on the sensitivity of aptamer-AuNPs based label-free assay. The best procedure for SDM analysis in our system was: the pH value at 8.0, and the concentration of aptamer at 2 mu M, and the concentration of salt at 2 M. The linear range for the current analytical system was from 50 ng/mL to 1 mu g/mL, and the detection limit was 50 ng/mL, which is lower than the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) (100 ng/mL) in edible animal tissues regulated by China and European commission.

A total of 165 Salmonella enterica isolates were identified from 1382 samples taken from conventional farms, abattoirs and retail markets from 2010 to 2011 in Sichuan, China. The Salmonella isolates were assayed for serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, prevalence of class 1 integrons and beta-lactamase genes, and subtyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among these isolates, S. enterica serotypes Derby (76 isolates, 46%) and Typhimurium (16 isolates, 10%) were the most prevalent, and high antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for tetracycline (77%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (43%), nalidixic acid (41%) and spectinomycin (41%). Class 1 integrons were detected in 21% of these isolates, and contained gene cassettes dfrA12-aadA2, dfrA1-aadA1, dfrA1, bla(PSE-1) and dfrA1/aadA2. bla(OXA-1) was the most commonly identified beta-lactamase gene (n=14), followed by bla(TEM-1) (n=6), bla(PSE-1) (n=4) and bla(CMY-2) (n=1). A S. enterica serotype Indiana isolate derived from chicken from a market was positive for both bla(OXA-1) and bla(CMY-2), and resistant to nine tested antibiotics. The PFGE patterns were diverse. Our findings indicated that most isolates from different sampling sites were phenotypically and genetically diverse, and Salmonella was widespread and may transmit along the food production chain from farm to market. Isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, which are used to fight foodborne Salmonella, pose a serious threat to public health.

In this study, we sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin (H) genes from eight canine distemper virus (CDV) isolates obtained from seven raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the partial hemagglutinin gene sequences showed close clustering for geographic lineages, clearly distinct from vaccine strains and other wild-type foreign CDV strains, all the CDV strains were characterized as Asia-1 genotype and were highly similar to each other (91.5-99.8% nt and 94.4-99.8% aa). The giant panda and raccoon dogs all were 549Y on the HA protein in this study, irrespective of the host species. Conclusions: These findings enhance our knowledge of the genetic characteristics of Chinese CDV isolates, and may facilitate the development of effective strategies for monitoring and controlling CDV for wild canids and non-cainds in China.

A 2 x 4 factorial design was used with two basal diets (the positive control group, PC; negative control with ME reduction 100 kcal/kg, NC) and with or without the addition of three exogenous enzymes (0.02% BM; 0.01% AG; 0.05% XG) respectively. 1,200 one-day-old broilers were randomly allocated to 8 treatments with 10 pens of 15 broilers. There was no significant difference on BW, BWG, and FI at 0-21d, 21-42d or 0-42d for diet, enzymes or their interactions, but FI at 22-42d and 0-42d were tend to be decreased with the addition of enzymes. The F/G was significantly improved by the addition of enzymes especially in NC diet. The dietary AME and TME in PC or NC diet were significantly increased by XG or AG in NC diet. The villus length and V/C of ileum were significantly increased by the addition of BM or XG. XG improved the activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase, BM improved the activity of trypsin at 21d, and AG improved the activity of chymotrypsin at 21d. Comparing to PC diet, the addition of enzymes in PC or NC diet decreased feed cost per kg body weight gain especially in NC diet (except AG in PC diet) with the highest profits for XG in NC diet. In conclusion, supplementation of 0.02% BM or 0.01% AG or 0.05% XG could improve feed conversion of broilers in corn-soybean meal diet by improving energy utilization and digestive physiology, and also supplementation of 0.05% XG had a preferable efficacy in low energy diet.

Elevated air temperature led to great loss in rice grain yield in many districts suffering from heat stress due to the greenhouse effect worldwide, which has received more and more attention from researchers. A field experiment was conducted to investigate impacts of high air temperature (HAT) after rice heading stage on dynamics of SPAD values, soluble sugar, soluble protein, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of flag leaves, and grain yield attributes. The results showed that HAT significantly reduced SPAD values, soluble sugar and protein contents, seed-setting rate, number of filled grains per panicles, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield, while increased MDA content. There exists strong correlation between each physiological parameter and days from heading stage to maturity, which can be simulated by quadratic curve equation or linear regression equation. Under HAT, the enhanced MDA content and decreased soluble sugar content demonstrated the damage of membrane structure and photosynthesis function of rice flag leaves, which was partially attributed to the reduced SPAD value and soluble protein content. In the present experiment, rice seed-setting rate was more vulnerable to HAT than grain weight. The disturbance of physiological metabolism in flag leaves was a fundamental reason for the reduction of rice grain yield under HAT.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between exon 3 polymorphisms of NLRP3 and the susceptibility to digestive disorders in rabbits. In total, five coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) were identified; all of which are synonymous. Among them, c.456 C> and c.594 G> were further genotyped for association analysis based on case-control design (n =162 vs n =102). Meanwhile, growing rabbits were experimentally induced to digestive disorders by feeding a fiber-deficient diet, subsequently they were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. Association analysis revealed that haplotype HI (the two cSNPs: GT) played a potential protective role against digestive disorders (p<0.001). The expression of NLRP3 in the group H1HX(1) (H1HX1 is composed of H1H1, H1H3 and H1H4) was the lowest among four groups which were classified by different types of diplotypes. Those results suggested that the NLRP3 gene was significantly associated with susceptibility to digestive disorders in rabbit.

Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a major signalling event induced by osmotic stress in higher plants. Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) family members play essential roles in the response to hyperosmotic stresses in plants. In this study, the TaSnRK2.3 gene, a novel SnRK2 member was cloned, and three copies located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D were identified in common wheat. TaSnRK2.3 was strongly expressed in leaves, and responded to polyethylene glycol, NaCl, abscisic acid, and cold stresses. To characterize its function, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSnRK2.3GFP controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was generated and subjected to severe abiotic stresses. Overexpression of TaSnRK2.3 resulted in an improved root system and significantly enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses, simultaneously demonstrated by enhanced expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes and ameliorative physiological indices, including a decreased rate of water loss, enhanced cell membrane stability, improved photosynthetic potential, and significantly increased osmotic potential and free proline content under normal and/or stressed conditions. These results demonstrate that TaSnRK2.3 is a multifunctional regulator, with potential for utilization in transgenic breeding for improved abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.

Although various miRNAs are known to play crucial roles in adipose deposition and adipogenesis, the microRNA transcriptome of intermuscular adipose tissue has not, until now, been studied. Here, we sequenced the miRNA transcriptomes of porcine intermuscular adipose tissue by small RNA-sequencing and compared it to a representative subcutaneous adipose tissue. We found that the inflammation-and diabetes-related miRNAs were significantly enriched in the intermuscular rather than in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. A functional enrichment analysis of the genes predicted to be targeted by the enriched miRNAs also indicated that intermuscular adipose tissue was associated mainly with immune and inflammation responses. Our results suggest that the intermuscular adipose tissue should be recognized as a potential metabolic risk factor of obesity.

Based on the hypothesis that chicken Lmbr1 should have multiple alternative splices as human and mouse Lmbr1/C7orf2, we successfully identified one novel chicken Lmbr1 transcript variant (designated as Lmbr1-2) by bioinformatics analysis and RTPCR confirmation. Chicken Lmbr1-2 transcript was predicted to encode a 30 amino acid protein. Lmbr1-2 transcript was ubiquitously expressed in a range of chicken tissues. A SNP (rs14135851: G>T, also named as 288G>T reference to 603234777F1) was found to be located at the 5' boundary (first base) of alternatively spliced exon (IN2) of chicken Lmbr1-2. Eight variants/10 haplotypes were detected from 4 breeds in a 300-bp genomic fragment surrounding 288G>T. The 288T>G and 331G>A changes were predicted resulting to the formation/loss of SRSF5 and SRSF6 motifs. The genotype/allele distribution for a G/A variant (331G>A, reference to 603234777F1) and haplotype types in polydactylous Silkie presented distinct difference with that in other four-toed breed chickens. Association analysis showed that chicken 331G>A variation had significant effect on meat quality traits including breast muscle water loss rate, leg muscle water loss rate and leg muscle fiber density, and carcass traits including evisceration weight, pancreas weight in Gushi chicken F-2 resource population. These data demonstrated that chicken Lmbr1 was alternatively spliced to produce multiple splice forms as was the case in mammals, and it suggested that chicken Lmbr1-2 variation might have important effect on the carcass and meat quality traits in chicken.

Based on comparative genomics, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) was considered as a candidate gene for MRDD resistance, validation of which will help to understand the possible genetic mechanism of this disease. ZmeIF4E (orthologs of eIF4E gene in maize) encodes a protein of 218 amino acids, harboring five exons and no variation in the cDNA sequence is identified between the resistant inbred line, X178 and susceptible one, Ye478. ZmeIF4E expression was different in the two lines plants treated with three plant hormones, ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonates at V3 developmental stage, suggesting that ZmeIF4E is more likely to be involved in the regulation of defense gene expression and induction of local and systemic resistance. Moreover, four cis-acting elements related to plant defense responses, including DOFCOREZM, EECCRCAH1, GT1GAMSCAM4, and GT1CONSENSUS were detected in ZmeIF4E promoter for harboring sequence variation in the two lines. Association analysis with 163 inbred lines revealed that one SNP in EECCRCAH1 is significantly associated with CSI of MRDD in two environments, which explained 3.33 and 9.04 % of phenotypic variation, respectively. Meanwhile, one SNP in GT-1 motif was found to affect MRDD resistance only in one of the two environments, which explained 5.17 % of phenotypic variation. Collectively, regulatory motifs respectively harboring the two significant SNPs in ZmeIF4E promoter could be involved in the defense process of maize after viral infection. These results contribute to understand maize defense mechanisms against maize rough dwarf virus.

All phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that specimens from Tam Dao are nested in Kurixalus bisacculus, indicating that they belong to K. bisacculus. R. appendiculatus is closer to genus Kurixalus than to other genera with strong support values. In combination with morphological evidence, it is suggested that R. appendiculatus should be placed in Kurixalus. Kurixalus verrucosus is not related to Kurixalus appendiculatus and it is the sister taxon to the clade of K. bisacculus and Kurixalus odontotarsus, which rejects that K. verrucosus is a synonym of K. appendiculatus. The genus Kurixalus needs redefinition by clear synapomorphic characters, and generic status of Kurixalus ananjevae deserves further examination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This target protein was used as a coating antigen to establish an indirect ELISA for detecting anti-DEV antibodies in serum samples from ducks. In the optimal method for the UL16-ELISA, the fusion protein was coated at 1.25 mu g/ml and duck serum samples were diluted at 1:160. The endpoint cut-off value of this assay was 0.598. The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were both lower than 10%. There was no cross-reaction with duck positive sera of either DHBV, DHV, RA, E. coli, Salmonella anatum, H5N1 or DSHDV. The assay was applied successfully to examine the suspected duck serum samples and showed 95.5% (73/76) identity with the serum neutralization test (SNT). The results showed that recombinant DEV UL16 protein could be used as a coating antigen and the developed UL16-ELISA approach was rapid, specific, sensitive and repetitive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To further assess genetic diversity and population structure within this species, we sequenced 477 bp of mitochondrial DNA control region in 30 Tibetan macaques from the Guizhou (GZ) and Yunnan (YN) of China and conducted population genetic analysis, along with 15 previously described haplotype sequences representing 55 individuals from Sichuan (SC) and Anhui (AH). 87 polymorphic sites were detected in the alignment of 45 sequences and defined 22 haplotypes, of which 9 were newly identified. Haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity (pi) and average number of nucleotide differences (K) is 0.911 +/- A 0.015, 0.06090 +/- A 0.00126 and 28.32, respectively, indicating higher genetic diversity in the whole Tibetan macaque population. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) partitioned the total variation into 83.63 % among populations and 16.37 % within populations, revealing that variations occured among populations mainly. Further analysis demonstrated that significant genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.83628, P < 0.01) and poor gene flow (Nm < 1) had occurred among these four populations. On the phylogenetic tree and haplotype network plot, 22 haplotypes cluster together according to their geographical origins, exhibiting an obvious phylogeographic pattern. We speculate that the significant genetic differentiation among these macaque populations might result from long-term geographic barrier and human activity. In particular, Yangtze River probably play a vital role in population differentiation of Tibetan macaques.

Two isolates, LW101 and LW102, were isolated from kidney and liver of the sick fish on brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar and were considered to be the cause of this disease based on experimental challenges. The morphological and physiological characteristics as well as the biochemical tests of the two isolates were the same and similar to Edwardsiella ictaluri. Furthermore, the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the gryB gene revealed that the isolates were highly homogeneous with E. ictaluri. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of these genes, both isolates were identified as E. ictaluri. Susceptibility of the isolates to 22 antibiotics was tested using the disc diffusion method. Both isolates showed a similar antibiotic susceptibility, which was characterized by resistance to acetylspiramycin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, penicillin, oxytetracycline, and sinomin (SMZ/TMP); the strains were susceptible to amikacin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, doxycycline, and tenemycin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. ictaluri infection in southern catfish.	[Geng, Y.; Wang, K. Y.; Li, C. W.; Ren, S. Y.; Zhou, Z. Y.; Liu, X. X.; Liu, X. F.; Lai, W.

The protein encoded by the UL14 gene is a minor component of the virion tegument and plays a major role in virus replication by enhancing effects on the envelope and capsid transport to the nucleus. It is also involved in virus maturation, neurovirulence, antiapoptotic activity and regulation of the expression of IE gene.

It plays an important role in virus assembly as it comprises the major subunits of the capsomer structure by forming pentons and hexons, containing five and six copies of VP5 molecules, respectively. In both, VP5 molecules are arranged to form an axial channel, which is thought to provide a potential exit route for the internal scaffolding protein. VP5 interacts with other proteins and the morphological intermediates (partial capsids, closed spherical capsids, and polyhedral capsids) are formed in the assembly process. Finally, the mature icosahedral capsid is produced. The recent advances in the characteristics and functions of UL19 gene and its encoding protein VP5 are reviewed to provide a reference for further study of virus assembly and DNA encapsidation.

The mechanisms of polysaccharide export across the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria are not yet completely clear. However, the mechanisms of polysaccharide assembly in Escherichia coli have been intensively investigated. Here, we mainly review the current understanding of the assembly mechanisms of group 1 capsular polysaccharide, group 2 capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide of E. coli, and the current structures and interactions of some polysaccharide export outer membrane proteins with other proteins involved in polysaccharide export in Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, LptD may be targeted by peptidomimetic antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. We also give insights into the directions of future research regarding the mechanisms of polysaccharide export.

A total of 640 ducks were blocked on the basis of sex and body weight, and then allocated randomly to 5 treatments with 8 pens per treatment and 16 ducks per pen. The experiment lasted for 5 wk, and dietary treatments included control diet (CON) and diets with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of normal maize replaced by AFB(1) contaminated maize. Detectable levels of other toxins were present but only AFB(1) exceeded limits and the level of AFB(1) was 196.8 mu g/kg in the contaminated maize and ranged from 2.45 to 128.7 mu g/kg in the starter diet and 2.02 to 157.2 mu g/kg in the grower diet. Feeding AFB(1) contaminated diets decreased (P < 0.05) ADG and ADFI linearly and quadratically during the whole experiment, whereas overall F/G was reduced linearly (P < 0.05). The mortality of ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated diets linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05). The red blood cell counts, hemoglobin amounts, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were reduced (P < 0.05) linearly on d 14, while mean corpuscular volume increased (P < 0.05) quadratically on d 14 and linearly on d 35 in response to AFB(1) contaminated diets. Feeding AFB(1) contaminated diets increased (P < 0.05) the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) linearly, while it decreased (P < 0.05) the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and Mg linearly on d 14. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST increased (P < 0.05) linearly, while the levels of TC and TG reduced (P < 0.05) linearly on d 35. The activity of ALT also showed quadratic response (P < 0.05) on d 14 and 35. The extent of damaged livers was increased by the inclusion of high levels of AFB(1) contaminated maize. In conclusion, the feeding of maize naturally contaminated with AFB(1) decreased growth performance, altered the blood profiles, and damaged the liver tissues in ducks. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of vitamin E and selenium yeast on growth performance and immune function in ducks fed maize naturally contaminated with aflatoxin B-1	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Ducks; Immune function; Aflatoxin B-1; Growth performance; Vitamin E; Selenium yeast	FUSARIUM MYCOTOXINS; BROILER-CHICKENS; ESTERIFIED GLUCOMANNAN; SODIUM BENTONITE; EFFICACY; HEMATOLOGY; DUCKLINGS; SUPPLEMENTATION; CLINOPTILOLITE; PROTECTION	This study was conducted to determine the effects of a combined vitamin E (VE) and selenium yeast (SeY) supplementation on growth performance, blood profiles, relative organ weight, and immune function in ducks fed diets containing maize naturally contaminated with a variety of mycotoxins, but primarily aflatoxin (AFB(1)). A total of 448 ducks were blocked on the basis of sex and body weight, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 2 levels of AFB(1) contaminated maize (0 or 100%) and 2 VE and SeY levels (0 IU VE and 0 mg SeY/kg or 50 IU VE and 0.2 mg SeY/kg) for a 28-d study period. There were 7 replications (pens) per treatment and 16 birds per pen. Detectable levels of other toxins were present but that only AFB(1) exceeded limits, and the level of the AFB(1) was 196.8 mu g/kg in the contaminated maize, 130.5 and 142.4 mu g/kg in the 100% contaminated starter diets with or without VE and SeY, respectively, and 152.6 and 157.1 mu g/kg in the 100% contaminated grower diets with or without VE and SeY, respectively. Ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated maize diets had lower (P < 0.05) ADG and ADFI, and greater (P < 0.05) death rates during the whole experiment. The supplementation of VE and SeY increased (P < 0.05) FCR during d 0 to 14 but decreased (P < 0.05) ADFI during d 15 to 28 and 0 to 28. Interactions were observed (P < 0.05) in ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated diets. Feeding AFB(1) contaminated maize diets increased (P < 0.05) the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, whereas the levels of total protein, albumin, and globulin decreased (P < 0.05) at both d 14 and 28. However, VE and SeY had no consistent effects. The lymphocyte proliferation and acid alpha-naphthylacetate esterase positive ratios (ANAE+) were decreased (P < 0.05) by the inclusion of AFB(1) contaminated diets during the whole experiment but benefited from VE and SeY supplementation. Dietary VE and SeY improved (P < 0.05) the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) throughout the experiment. Avian influenza (H5N1) antibody titer was reduced (P < 0.05) by the inclusion of AFB(1) contaminated maize without VE and SeY supplementation. Ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated maize diets had greater (P < 0.05) relative weights of spleen and bursa of fabricius but lower (P < 0.05) thymus, and the supplementation of VE and SeY increased (P < 0.05) the relative bursa of fabricius weight in the presence of contaminated maize. Interactive effects were observed (P < 0.05) in ANAE+ and IL-2 on d 28 and relative weight of bursa of fabricius. In conclusion, feeding AFB(1) contaminated maize caused adverse effects on growth performance, immunity, and relative immune organ weight in ducks, while dietary addition of VE and SeY partially counteracted the negative effects of AFB(1) on growth and death rate.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this fitness cost are unknown. Here, we utilize the autoimmune response mutant suppressor of npr1, constitutive1 (snc1) resulting from an activated form of the Disease Resistance (R) gene to dissect the genetic component mediating growth inhibition in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The radical-induced cell death1 (rcd1) mutant defective in responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) was isolated as an enhancer of the snc1 mutant in growth inhibition but not in defense response activation. Similarly, the vitamin C2 (vtc2) and vtc3 mutants defective in ROS detoxification enhanced the growth defects of snc1. Thus, perturbation of ROS status by R gene activation is responsible for the growth inhibition, and this effect is independent of defense response activation. This was further supported by the partial rescue of growth defects of rcd1 snc1 by the respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (rbohD) and rbohF mutations compromising the generation of ROS burst. Collectively, these findings indicate that perturbation of ROS homeostasis contributes to the fitness cost independent of defense activation.

Bovine oocytes characteristically contain high levels of lipids that represent one of the major obstacles limiting efficient cryopreservation. These droplets together with structures such as cumulus cells, zona pellucida, cytoplasm membrane, cortical granules, mitochondria, spindle, and cytoskeleton (microtubles and microfilaments) often incur serious damage during cooling and warming. The cryoinjury could, to some extent, be decreased by selection of proper permeable and non-permeable cryoprotectants, and of vitrification with high cooling and warming rates. Additionally, such measures may also enhance their cryotolerance as partial removal of cumulus cells, modification of oocyte membrane constituents, polarization of the cytoplasmic lipid droplets by centrifugation, and addition of cytoskeleton relaxants or ice blockers into vitrification solutions. The improvement in cryopreservation methodology for bovine oocytes will no doubt augment other technologies such as bovine cloning and the establishment of gene bank for transgenic cattle.

Alpha-Cyperone (CYP), astragaloside IV (AS-IV) and andrographolide (AND) are the three major active components in this formula. XQT may modulate the inflammatory or coagulant responses. We therefore assessed the effects of XQT on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model of rat cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (RCMECs). XQT, CYP, AS-IV and AND inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and up-regulated the mRNA expression of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2). XQT and CYP inhibited the secretion of tissue factor (TF). To further explore the mechanism, we found that XQT, or its active components CYP, AS-IV and AND significantly inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 phosphorylation protein expression as well as decreased the phosphorylation levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 proteins in LPS-stimulated RCMECs. These results suggested that XQT and its active components inhibited the expression of inflammatory and coagulant mediators via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. These findings may contribute to future research on the action mechanisms of this formula, as well as therapy for inflammation- or coagulation-related diseases.

Soil temperature distribution patterns under border irrigation and surface drip irrigation were researched. The root water uptake model was modified based on the effect of soil temperature on root water uptake. Results showed soil temperature profile distribution was greatly influenced by irrigation method. The range of temperature was larger under border irrigation, with the temperature being 3-6 degrees C higher in 0-20 cm depth than in 20-100 cm depth. Except for the top layer under surface drip irrigation, mean soil temperature showed the trend of exponential decay throughout the soil profile. The relationship between temperature and water uptake rate was expressed in exponential function. With the modification of the root water uptake model as affected by temperature profile distribution, the value of the root mean square error between the simulated and observed soil water decreased from approximately 0.04 to 0.02 in the top layer under border irrigation, but showed no obvious difference under surface drip irrigation. When soil temperature differed greatly in the top layer from the deep layer, the root water uptake model considering soil temperature could improve the precision of soil water simulation. The results indicated that the modified root water uptake model could be used to simulate soil water dynamics. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000642. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

As the only source of drinking water in Beijing being confronted with severe water shortages, the Chaobai River Basin is extraordinarily important. Land use, being a common and variable influence on streamflow, has been studied widely, whereas spatiotemporal differences and the complex mechanism of land use's effect on runoff are difficult to explain. On the basis of a series of data about land use and runoff depth in the Chaobai River Basin, the sensitivity of land-use change to streamflow was explored using the principle of elasticity. Results of t-tests and F-tests showed that the difference in stream flow between the two river basins is not explained by precipitation; thus, land-use change is the main cause of stream flow variation. The influence of forests on annual runoff depth was significant and increased gradually from 1978 to 2008, whereas the effect of bare land has been insignificant in all time periods. The effect of land use on seasonal and monthly runoff depth showed significant variation. On the whole, the effects of land-use change on streamflow in summer were obvious, especially in August. It is therefore concluded that forest changes are the main factors in streamflow variation in summer. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000669. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Historically, natural remedies have been shown to present interesting biological and pharmacological activity and are used as chemotherapeutic agents. For centuries Cordyceps, which is a genus of more than 400 species in the family Clavicipitaceae, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. This study highlights the chemistry and pharmacology of Cordyceps, especially Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc. and C. militaris (Fr.) L. Information was obtained from Google Scholar and the journal databases PubMed and Scopus. Key findings Many bioactive components of Cordyceps have been extracted, such as cordycepin, cordycepic acid, ergosterol, polysaccharides, nucleosides and peptides. Studies show that Cordyceps and its active principles possess a wide range of pharmacological actions, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour, antihyperglycaemic, antiapoptosis, immunomodulatory, nephroprotective, and hepatoprotective. Summary More research is required to discover the full extent of the activity of Cordyceps.

L) B73 (ZmPhyB1 and ZmPhyB2), and encoded protein structure were analyzed, the results showed that both proteins had 6 conservative coding domains which were analogues among a number of other species and some distinguish existed in two protein. The expression patterns of two genes under different light conditions and in varying tissues were analyzed using semi-quantitative reversed transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The results showed that their expression patterns differs from that of phytochrome B in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPhyB), which may result from the evolutionary diversity between monocots and dicots. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed large differences between their tissue expression patterns. We speculated that the two genes might be involved in feedback regulation in response to environmental factors such as dark, hormone etc.	[Li, Zhuang; Huang, Yu-Bi] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Crop Genet Breeding, Dept Agr, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China	Li, Z (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Crop Genet Breeding, Dept Agr, 211 Hui Min Rd, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.	zhuanglicn2012@126.com						24	0	0	4	22	SPRINGER INDIA	NEW DELHI	7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA	0971-7811			J PLANT BIOCHEM BIOT	J.

In this study, we genotyped a sample comprising 120 wild rhesus macaques from six sites in Sichuan Province for 30 nuclear microsatellite (STR) loci using an ABI 3130xl genetic analyzer. Bayesian analyses and PCA clearly differentiated monkeys from Heishui from those at other sites. The samples from all six sites exhibited high gene diversity suggesting that the Sichuan wild rhesus macaque populations are not threatened by a lack of genetic diversity. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was more frequent in the Danba and Heishui populations. This may be due to the more fragmented habitat and less disturbance by humans in this area that foster greater subpopulation structuring than occurs in eastern China. We suggest that this population subdivision is the result of both long-term geographic barriers and human activity.

To determine the similarities of development of T2DM between rhesus monkey [Macaca mulatta lasiotis (M. m. lasiotis)] and human being, the clinical parameters were determined during a period of 2 years in 60 adult male rhesus monkeys (M. m. lasiotis). Methods: Sixty male monkeys whose fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level less than or equal to 5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) were enrolled in this study. Of these, 50 monkeys aged 7 to 20 years were fed with high-fat diet and 10 aged 4 to 10 years fed with standard diet as normal monkeys. Body weight, body mass index, FPG, fasting plasma insulin, and hemoglobin A(1c) levels were measured and calculated. The responses of insulin and glucose levels to intravenous glucose tolerance test were analyzed. Results: Of 50 monkeys fed with high-fat diet, 8 developed overt T2DM, 26 experienced impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose, and FPG of 16 monkeys was normal. All monkeys with impaired glucose tolerance experienced obesity, compensatory increase of fasting plasma insulin, significant decline of postprandial glucose clearance rate (K(Gluc)5-20), and decreased insulin secretion. Conclusions: In conclusion, rhesus monkey (M. m. lasiotis) has many similarities with human beings in terms of clinical manifestations and risk factors at different diabetes stages.

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying sodium fluoride-induced cytotoxicity in the cecal tonsil lymphocytes are not well understood. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of high dietary fluorine on apoptosis and the expression of the Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 in the cecal tonsil lymphocytes of broilers. The broilers were fed on high-fluorine diets containing 0, 400, 800, and 1,200 mg/kg fluorine. As measured by flow cytometry, the percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes was significantly increased in the high-fluorine groups II and III when compared with those in the control group. Meanwhile, immunohistochemical tests showed that the Bcl-2 protein expression decreased, and the Bax and caspase-3 protein expression increased in the high-fluorine groups II and III. In conclusion, dietary fluorine in the range of 800-1,200 mg/kg increased lymphocyte apoptosis in the cecal tonsil of broilers, suggesting that the lymphocyte apoptosis in the cecal tonsil was mediated by direct effects of fluoride on the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3.

Although several studies on the physicochemical properties and genetic basis of pentosans and pentosan-associated traits have been reported, the genetic architecture and determinants of pentosans remained ambiguous. In this research, 107 QTLs for pentosans and pentosan-associated traits were detected based on a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a 1RS/1BL translocation line x non-1RS/1BL translocation line. We identified seven stable expression QTLs for pentosans and one major QTL (Q.HI.scau-7D linked to xwmc634-7D) for hardness index (HI). Q.HI.scau-7D may be the gene responsible for the bimodal HI distribution map. More than one genetic location harbored QTLs for water-soluble pentosan (WSP), and the ratio of WSP content to water-insoluble pentosans (WIP) content (RWW) varied simultaneously, meaning that these loci harbored pleiotropic genes for WSP and RWW. WSP was the main factor in pentosans affecting wheat HI. This study gives a better understanding of the molecular genetics of pentosans and pentosan-related traits, and provides a certain theoretical basis for molecular genetics and breeding for pentosans.

Despite its agronomic importance, previous germplasm assessment studies have relied solely on morphological and agronomical traits. Molecular biology techniques have been scarcely used in assessment of genetic resources and for improvement of important agronomic and quality traits in Cocos nucifera, mostly due to the absence of available sequence information. Methodology/Principal Findings: To provide basic information for molecular breeding and further molecular biological analysis in Cocos nucifera, we applied RNA-seq technology and de novo assembly to gain a global overview of the Cocos nucifera transcriptome from mixed tissue samples. Using Illumina sequencing, we obtained 54.9 million short reads and conducted de novo assembly to obtain 57,304 unigenes with an average length of 752 base pairs. Sequence comparison between assembled unigenes and released cDNA sequences of Cocos nucifera and Elaeis guineensis indicated that the assembled sequences were of high quality. Approximately 99.9% of unigenes were novel compared to the released coconut EST sequences. Using BLASTX, 68.2% of unigenes were successfully annotated based on the Genbank non-redundant (Nr) protein database. The annotated unigenes were then further classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Conclusions/Significance: Our study provides a large quantity of novel genetic information for Cocos nucifera. This information will act as a valuable resource for further molecular genetic studies and breeding in coconut, as well as for isolation and characterization of functional genes involved in different biochemical pathways in this important tropical crop species.

We attempted to reproduce hemangioma through experimental infection with ALV-J to evaluate viral pathogenicity in layer birds and their progenies. Results: Body weight and indexes for immune organs of chickens infected with ALV-J strain SCDY1 were lower than those in controls. Proliferation of lymphocytes was observed in many tissues, and viral integration was detected in the genome of lymphocytes at 14 days post-infection, along with virus shedding. ALV-J was also efficiently transmitted from eggs to progenies. Embryo hatchability and progeny mortality were lower than those for controls. The efficiencies of virus shedding and virus integration in the lymphocytes of progenies were higher than those in parents. Conclusions: ALV-J is able to inhibit the growth of infected chickens, and causes damage to immune organs. Vertical transmission of ALV-J appears to be more deleterious than horizontal transmission.

Characterization of a ranavirus isolated from the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus, Blanchard, 1871) in China	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Characteristics; Chinese giant salamander; Iridoviridae; Ranavirus	MAJOR CAPSID PROTEIN; RANA-GRYLIO VIRUS; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; MORTALITY EVENTS; DNA-POLYMERASE; IRIDOVIRUS; DISEASE; INFECTION; GENE	In this study, we confirmed that a novel ranavirus was related to mass die-offs of farmed Chinese giant salamanders (Andrias davidianus) in Leshan, Sichuan Province, China. The farmed Chinese giant salamanders presented typical clinical symptoms that included ecchymoses or swollen areas on the head and limbs, necrosis of the limbs, and skin ulceration. Bacteriological and pathologic examinations further proved the possibility of ranavirus infection of the Chinese giant salamanders. The virus was isolated via inoculation in the epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. The virus multiplied and caused cytopathogenic effects (CPE) at 25 degrees C in the EPC cells and it was sensitive to chloroform treatment, trypsinase treatment, heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min, acidity (pH 3.0), and alkalinity (pH=10.0). Treatment with 5-bromouracil deoxyriboside (5-BrdU) inhibited viral replication, which suggested that the viral genome contained DNA. After the viral inoculation in the cell, samples were collected and made the ultrathin sections, and then the iridovirus-like particles could be observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei by electron microscopy. Using the isolated viral DNA as the template for PCR, we amplified, cloned, and analyzed target sequences in three different genomic regions, i.e., the major capsid protein (MCP), DNA polymerase, and neurofilament triplet H1-like protein (NF-H1). Subsequent multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly isolated virus was closely related to KRV-1, soft-shelled turtle iridovirus, Rana grylio iridovirus, and FV3. In the pathogenicity tests, the challenged salamanders showed similar clinical symptoms to the natural infections. Our data suggested that the virus isolate was a novel member of the genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae. We tentatively named the virus as Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). CGSV-L was able to cause serious systemic disease and it was capable of killing 80% of Chinese giant salamanders (body weight=300.0 +/- 15.0 g). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhou, Z.

The tissue distribution of chitosan/DNA complexes, liposome/DNA complexes and pcDNA3.1-gC alone were evaluated using a quantitative real-time PCR based TaqMan (TM) probe following intramuscular administration in ducklings. Results: Compared with pcDNA3.1-gC alone, liposomes universally increased the plasmid DNA copy number at the injection sites, liver, spleen, heart, brain, bursa of Fabricius, and especially in the enteron (esophagus, duodenum, rectum, and cecum). Chitosan also universally increased the plasmid DNA copy number at the injection sites, liver, spleen, heart, brain and esophagus. Compared with lipoplex-gC, higher chitosan-gC plasmid DNA copy numbers were detected at the injection sites, liver, spleen, heart, brain and esophagus. In contrast, compared with lipoplex-gC, lower copy numbers of chitosan-gC plasmid DNA were detected in the duodenum, rectum and cecum. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that chitosan and liposomes mediated rapid and extensive plasmid distribution in duck tissues, with low levels maintained from 1 d after DNA vaccination.

Single-point computations at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level are performed for more precise energy predictions. Two pathways are considered: the concerted and the neutral stepwise mechanisms. The results show that the stepwise mechanism is slightly energetically preferred to the concerted one for the three reaction systems in the gas phase. The solvent effect of acetonitrile is also assessed through single-point calculations by use of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level on the gas-phase optimized geometries. Our computational results indicate that the reaction of CH3C(O)OC6H4X with ammonia dimer is more favorable for X = Cl than for X = H and NH2 in the gas phase and in acetonitrile. The solvation effect decreases the barrier height. When X = NH2, the stepwise process is also favored in acetonitrile, while the concerted mechanism is favorable in solution when X = H and Cl.

However, there is little information about the effect of n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on male health and reproduction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of diets with different n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on the reproductive performance of male rats. Methods: Eighty male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were supplemented with diets containing different n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios (0.13, 0.40, 0.85, 1.52 and 2.85) for 60 days. Half of the rats in each group were sacrificed on day 60, and the other half were chosen to mate with female mice to assess the effects of n-3/n-6 ratios on reproductive performance. Results: Sperm density and sperm motility of the 1.52 group were higher than other groups (P < .05), and the development of testis and the morphological structure of sperm in the 1.52 group were better than other groups. Furthermore, a higher litter size and birth weights of offspring were observed in the 1.52 group. Additionally, serum reproductive hormone levels were significantly affected by the n-3/n-6 ratios. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that a balanced n-3/n-6 ratio was important in male rat reproduction. Therefore there is a necessity to determine an appropriate n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio in man and different male animals in the future.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							ESTIMATING DISEASE LOSSES; LINKAGE MAP; BREAD WHEAT; VULGARE L.; PLANT HEIGHT; HEAD BLIGHT; PSEUDOGRAMINEARUM; POPULATION; QTL; SEVERITY	Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a destructive disease of cereal crops in semiarid regions worldwide. As part of our contribution to the development of Fusarium resistant cultivars, we identified several novel sources of resistance by systematically assessing barley genotypes representing different geographical origins and plant types. One of these sources of resistance was investigated in this study by generating and analysing two populations of recombinant inbred lines. A major locus conferring FCR resistance, designated as Qcrs.cpi-4H, was detected in one of the populations (mapping population) and the effects of the QTL was confirmed in the other population. The QTL was mapped to the distal end of chromosome arm 4HL and it is effective against both of the Fusarium isolates tested, one F. pseudograminearum and the other F. graminearum. The QTL explains up to 45.3% of the phenotypic variance. As distinct from an earlier report which demonstrated co-locations of loci conferring FCR resistance and plant height in barley, a correlation between these two traits was not detected in the mapping population. However, as observed in a screen of random genotypes, an association between FCR resistance and plant growth rate was detected and a QTL controlling the latter was detected near the Qcrs.cpi-4H locus in the mapping population. Existing data indicate that, although growth rate may affect FCR resistance, different genes at this locus are likely involved in controlling these two traits.

Therefore, its genetic polymorphisms and association with susceptibility to infectious diseases have been widely reported in human and farm animals. In the present study, we investigated the genetic polymorphisms in 3171 bp coding region of NOD2 gene and association with non-specific digestive disorder (NSDD) in rabbit. A total of four coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) were detected. Among them, c.2961C>T was further genotyped for case (n=176) and control (n=130) based on association analysis, which revealed that C allele carried the potential protective role for susceptibility to NSDD with the odds ratio (OR) values of 052 (95% confidence interval (CI) 037-0.73, P<0.01). Under the dominant inheritance model, CC genotype was associated with decreased susceptibility to NSDD (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.24-0.60, P<0.01). Along with the aggravation of NSDD, we observed higher mRNA expression of NOD2 gene (P<0.05). However, the mRNA expression pattern of CC genotype would be interacted by the different status of NSDD, which only showed the significantly increased level in severe NSDD group (P<0.05). These results revealed by genetic association and gene expression analysis suggested that the NOD2 gene was associated with the susceptibility to NSDD in rabbit. However, the causative mutations linked to c.2961C>T and corresponding functional depiction should be further explored by performing exhaustive genetic studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, studies of beta-conglycinin on fish are scarce. This study investigated the effects of b-conglycinin on the growth, digestive and absorptive ability, inflammatory response, oxidative status and gene expression of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) in vivo and their enterocytes in vitro. The results indicated that the specific growth rate (SGR), feed intake, and feed efficiency were reduced by beta-conglycinin. In addition, activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, creatine kinase, Na+, K+-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase in the intestine showed similar tendencies. The protein content of the hepatopancreas and intestines, and the weight and length of the intestines were all reduced by beta-conglycinin. beta-conglycinin increased lipid and protein oxidation in the detected tissues and cells. However, beta-conglycinin decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and glutathione (GSH) content in the intestine and enterocytes. Similar antioxidant activity in the hepatopancreas was observed, except for GST. The expression of target of rapamycin (TOR) gene was reduced by beta-conglycinin. Furthermore, mRNA levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) genes were increased by beta-conglycinin. However, beta-conglycinin increased CuZnSOD, MnSOD, CAT, and GPx1b gene expression. In conclusion, this study indicates that beta-conglycinin induces inflammation and oxidation, and causes dysfunction of intestinal digestion and absorption in fish, and finally reduces fish growth. The results of this study provide some information to the mechanism of beta-conglycinin-induced negative effects.

In this study, a mutant strain of A. pleuropneumoniae (SC-1) was constructed and named DapxIC/ompP2. The mutant strain contained foreign DNA in the deletion site of ompP2 gene of Haemophilus parasuis. It showed no haemolytic activity and lower virulence of cytotoxicity in mice compared with the parent strain, and its safety and immunogenicity were also evaluated in mice. The LD50 data shown that the mutant strain was attenuated 30-fold, compared with the parent strain (LD50 of the mutant strain and parent strain in mice were determined to be 1.0 x 10(7) CFU and 3.5 x 10(5) CFU respectively). The mutant strain that was attenuated could secrete inactivated ApxIA RTX toxins with complete antigenicity and could be used as a candidate live vaccine strain against infections of A. pleuropneumoniae and H. parasuis.

The results showed that the corresponding mutations (synonymous codons) according to the codon bias in Pichia pastoris were successfully introduced into keratinase gene. The highest keratinase activity produced by P. pastoris pPICZ alpha A-kerAwt, pPICZ alpha A-kerAopti1 and pPICZ alpha A-kerAopti2 was 195 U/ml, 324 U/ml and 293 U/ml respectively. In addition, there was no significant difference in biomass concentration, target gene copy numbers and relative mRNA expression levels of every positive strain. The molecular weight of keratinase secreted by recombinant P. pastori was approx. 39 kDa. It was optimally active at pH 7.5 and 50 degrees C. The recombinant keratinase could efficiently degrade both alpha-keratin (keratin azure) and beta-keratin (chicken feather meal). These properties make the P. pastoris pPICZ alpha A-kerAopti1 a suitable candidate for industrial production of keratinases.

Using a balanced lethal system, the kanamycin resistance gene of expressing eukaryotic plasmids pVAX1 and pVAXD were replaced by the aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) gene. The NSP4 cleavage product (259-525) of rotavirus OSU strain and VP7 full-length genes were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and then inserted into the eukaryotic single-expression plasmid, pVAX1-asd, and the eukaryotic dual-expression plasmid, pVAXD-asd, respectively. The recombinant plasmids pVAX1-asd-NSP4, pVAX1-asd-VP7 and pVAXD-asd-NSP4-VP7 were transformed into the attenuated S. typhimurium chi 4550 strain by electrotransformation. An indirect immunofluorescence assay of the expressed COS-7 cell suggested that the recombinant S. typhimurium chi 4550 strain was constructed successfully. The recombinant S. typhimurium chi 4550 strain was orally administered to BALB/c mice. The group immunised with dual-expression plasmids produced a significantly higher level of serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and intestinal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) than the group immunised with single-expression plasmids. These results indicated that eukaryotic bicistronic plasmid DNA vaccines could be successfully constructed to enhance humoural, mucosal and cellular immune response against rotavirus infection.

Here, we report that exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethephon (ETH), and abscisic acid (ABA) can reduce Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) accumulation in systemic leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana during early infection. SA and ABA are more efficient and confer a longer-lasting resistance against TCV than JA and ETH, and the plant hormones interact in effecting the plant defence. Synergistic actions of SA and JA, and SA and ET, and an antagonistic action of SA and ABA have been observed in the Arabidopsis-TCV interaction. ABA can down-regulate the expression of the pathogenesis-related genes PR1 and PDF1.2, and compared to the wild type, it drastically reduces TCV accumulation in NahG transgenic plants and the eds5-p1 mutant, both of which do not accumulate SA. This indicates that SA signaling negatively regulates the ABA-mediated defence. ABA-induced resistance against TCV is independent of SA. We also found that mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (MPK5) may be involved in ABA-mediated defence. These results indicate that Arabidopsis can activate distinct signals to inhibit virus accumulation. Cooperative or antagonistic crosstalk between them is pivotal for establishing disease resistance. These results show potential to enhance the plant defence against viruses by manipulating diverse hormones.

Differential expression of Toll-like receptor genes in lymphoid tissues between Marek's disease virus-infected and noninfected chickens	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Marek's disease virus; Toll-like receptor gene; real-time PCR; lymphoid tissue	ENTERICA SEROVAR ENTERITIDIS; INNATE IMMUNE RECOGNITION; INFLUENZA-VIRUS; RESPONSES; INDUCTION; CELLS; CYTOKINE; SPLEEN; RNA; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Toll-like receptors (TLR) are trans-membrane sensors recognizing invading microbes. Toll-like receptors play a central role in initiating immune responses against several pathogens. In this study, we investigated the response of TLR and downstream genes to Marek's disease virus (MDV) infection. Forty 1-d-old chicks were randomly divided into 2 groups, with 20 chicks infected with MDV and 20 chicks mock-infected. Four chickens were euthanized respectively from infected and age-matched noninfected groups at 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d postinfection (dpi). Bursas, spleens, and thymuses were removed. The differential expression of TLR genes, including TLR3, TLR5, TLR7, TLR15, and TLR21, and downstream genes of TLR7, including MyD88, TRAF3, TRAF6, IFNA, IFNB, and IL6, in lymphoid tissues of MDV-infected and noninfected chickens was determined by real-time PCR. The results showed that the change of TLR genes was different in 3 lymphoid tissues. Expression of TLR7 and MyD88 was upregulated at 14 dpi and downregulated at 28 dpi in MDV-infected compared with noninfected spleens. The TRAF6 and IFNB were upregulated, and TRAF3, IFNA, and IL6 genes showed increasing trends in MDV-infected compared with noninfected spleens at 14 dpi. The expression of TLR3 and TLR15 genes was downregulated in MDV-infected compared with noninfected spleens at 28 dpi. The results indicated that TLR7 and its downstream genes were a response to MDV infection at 14 dpi. However, the function of TLR was impaired when the infection entered the tumor transformation phase. In bursas, TLR3 and TLR15 genes were upregulated at 7 and 4 dpi, respectively. It indicated that TLR3 and TLR15 might be involved in response to MDV infection in bursa at early phases. However, no differential expression of TLR genes was observed between MDV-infected and noninfected thymuses, which indicated that the thymus had little response to MDV infection mediated by TLR.

A total of six hundred ninety-six 1-d-old male Cobb broilers were randomly allotted by BW in 1 of 4 treatments for 6-wk trial. The dietary treatments included the basal diet (NC), and the basal diets supplemented with an antibiotic (100 mg of chlortetracycline/kg of diet; PC), 0.1%, or 0.2% probiotic product (containing 1 x 10(7) cfu/g of Lactobacillus fermentum JS and 2 x 10(6) cfu/g of Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Each treatment had 6 replicates with 29 broilers each. The ADG and feed efficiency were improved (P < 0.05) in broilers fed the probiotic diet compared with NC, and were similar to the PC group during 1 to 21 d. However, there were no significant differences in growth performance of broilers during 22 to 42 d among different dietary treatments. Chicks fed probiotics had higher proportions of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, whereas the antibiotic diet decreased the proportion of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in the foregut of broilers at 21 and 42 d compared with the NC group. No significant difference was observed in the mRNA expression level of chicken B-cell marker chB6 (Bu-1) in the foregut of chickens among different treatments. Probiotic-supplemented diets increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR 4 at 21 d, and only the TLR2 mRNA level at 42 d in the foregut of chickens, but did not change (P > 0.05) TLR7 mRNA expression compared with NC or PC. There was no significant difference in the above TLR mRNA levels in the intestine of broilers between PC and NC. These results indicated that the probiotic product incorporating Lactobacillus fermentum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae could stimulate intestinal T-cell immune system without decreasing growth performance in broilers during 1 to 21 d.

Particularly, specific protein degradation and protein modification can disrupt the architecture and integrity of muscle cells so that improves the meat tenderness. Endogenous proteolytic systems are responsible for modifying proteinases as well as the meat tenderization. Abundant evidence has testified that calpains (CAPNs) including calpain I (CAPN1) and calpastatin (CAST) have the closest relationship with tenderness in livestock. They are involved in a wide range of physiological processes including muscle growth and differentiation, pathological conditions and post-mortem meat aging. Whereas, Calpain3 (CAPN3) has been established as an important activating enzyme specifically expressed in livestock's skeletal muscle, but its role in domestic animals meat tenderization remains controversial. In this review, we summarize the role of CAPN1, calpain II (CAPN2) and CAST in post-mortem meat tenderization, and analyse the relationship between CAPN3 and tenderness in domestic animals. Besides, the possible mechanism affecting post-mortem meat aging and improving meat tenderization, and current possible causes responsible for divergence (whether CAPN3 contributes to animal meat tenderization or not) are inferred.

Merr.; molybdenum; root growth; seed treatment; soybean	YIELD; PLANT	For a better understanding of soybean root growth as influenced by seed treatment with molybdenum (Mo), we examined some root growth morphological characteristics of different concentrations Mo (B-0-Control, 0 g/kg, B-1-0.5 g/kg, B-2-1.0 g/kg, B-3-2.0 g/kg and B-4-4.0 g/kg) treated seeds on the growth of soybean under net and relay strip intercropping system. The results showed that the taproot length, number of first order.lateral roots, root volume, root-nodule fresh weight, number of root-nodules and root dry weight were increased by Mo treated after blooming. Moreover, 2.0 g/kg Mo treatment increased root growth morphological characteristics (except the taproot length) most strikingly in net cropping system, while 1.0 g/kg Mo treatment increased root growth morphological characteristics most significantly in relay strip intercropping system. It could be found that the taproot length in relay strip intercropping system was the most strikingly higher than that in net cropping system, while the first order lateral root number, root volume, root-nodules fresh weight and the number of root-nodule of net cropping soybean were most markedly higher than those of relay strip intercropping soybean at R-2 stage. The results also showed that seed treatment with Mo at a suitable concentration could delay root senescence, and it was more sensitive to Mo treatment of relay strip intercropping soybean, lower concentration could achieve the effect of delaying root senescence.

In this study, seasonal variation in fertility parameters and the comprehensive fertility of 3 types of tea garden soils in western Sichuan, China, were investigated using a field survey and laboratory analysis. The results showed that pH, available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) in yellow earth remained low regardless of season; the lowest levels (among all soils) of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) occurred in yellow earth during spring and summer. Higher TOC, TN, and AP content occurred in spring due to basal fertilizer application; TOC was lower in summer due to higher decomposition rates and extensive soil erosion; lower TN and AP contents in summer were attributed to absorption by tea plants and to soil erosion; higher TOC and TN in autumn occurred as litter returned to the soil. Seasonal variation in AK was less obvious than that of the other fertility parameters. The comprehensive fertility of tea garden soils, ranked in order from higher to lower by season and soil type, was as follows: spring > autumn > summer for bleached paddy soil and yellow earth; but spring > summer > autumn for acid purple soil. Among the 3 tea garden soils, the fertility of acid purple soil was highest, and that of yellow earth was lowest in every season. Fertility was highest in spring for all soils. These results can provide a theoretical basis for scientific management of tea plantations in western Sichuan and similar regions.

The subchloroplast locations of proteins are correlated with their functions. With the availability of a great number of protein data, it is highly desired to develop a computational method to predict the subchloroplast locations of chloroplast proteins. In this study, we proposed a novel method to predict subchloroplast locations of proteins using tripeptide compositions. It first used the binomial distribution to optimize the feature sets. Then the support vector machine was selected to perform the prediction of subchloroplast locations of proteins. The proposed method was tested on a reliable and rigorous dataset including 259 chloroplast proteins with sequence identity <= 25%. In the jack-knife cross-validation, 92.21% envelope proteins, 93.20% thylakoid membrane, 52.63% thylakoid lumen and 85.00% stroma can be correctly identified. The overall accuracy achieves 88.03% which is higher than that of other models. Based on this method, a predictor called ChloPred has been built and can be freely available from http://cobi.uestc.edu.cn/people/hlin/tools/ChloPred/. The predictor will provide important information for theoretical and experimental research of chloroplast proteins.

However, the effects of N addition on the different components of soil respiration are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate how the components of soil respiration response to N addition and the potential mechanisms in a subtropical bamboo ecosystem. Four N treatment levels (0, 50, 150, 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) were applied monthly in a Pleioblastus amarus bamboo plantation since November 2007. Total soil respiration (RST) and soil respiration derived from litter layer (RSL), root-free soil (RSs), and plant roots (RSR) were measured for one year (February 2010 to January 2011). The results showed that the mean rate of RST was 428 +/- 11 g C m(-2) year-1, and RSL, RSs, RSR contributed (30.2 +/- 0.7)%, (20.7 +/- 0.9)%, and (49.1 +/- 0.7)%, respectively. The temperature coefficients (Q(10)) of RST, RSL RSs, and RSR were 2.87, 2.28, 3.09, and 3.19, respectively, in control plots. Nitrogen additions significantly increased RS(T)and its three components. RSR was stimulated by N additions through increasing fine root biomass and root metabolic rate. The positive effects of N additions on soil fertility, microbial activity, and the quality and amount of aboveground litterfall also stimulated other CO2 production processes. In the background of increased N input, response of RST and components of RST are primarily due to the positive response of plant growth in this bamboo ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of HAT from R3 (panicle exertion from boot) to R8 stage (physiological maturity) on rice grain yield and quality (milling, appearance, cooking and eating, and nutrition qualities). A split-spot experiment based on randomized complete design was performed, involving two cultivars (japonica Koshihikari and indica IR72), two temperature treatments, and three replicates. Rice cultivars as main plot treatments were grown in a paddy field. The HAT and natural air temperature (NAT) treatments were regarded as subplot. Percentage of chalky kernel increased, whereas head rice yield, amylose and starch contents, and grain yield decreased in both cultivars under HAT, when compared with those under NAT. The HAT enhanced values of peak viscosity and breakdown, but decreased value of setback for Koshihikari. Conversely, starch viscosity characteristics for IR72 were unaffected by HAT. Relative content of amino acids in grains were enhanced; however, absolute content of some amino acids did not increase due to the reduction of grain weight under HAT. The HAT also increased absolute content of grain protein in IR72, but not in Koshihikari. The present study indicates that HAT decreased rice milling, appearance qualities and grain yield, while it positively influenced not only cooking and eating qualities in Koshihikari but also some nutritional components of grains in both cultivars.

Neem oil is a vegetable oil derived from seeds or fruits of the neem tree through pressing or solvent extraction, and largely used in popular medicine to have antifungal, antibacterial, antimalarial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, as well as immunemodulatory properties in different animal species. In the present study, acute and 28-day subacute toxicity tests were carried out. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 values of neem oil were found to be 31.95 g/kg. The subacute treatment with neem oil failed to change body weight gain, food and water consumption. Serum biochemistry analysis showed no significant differences in any of the parameters examined under the dose of 1600 mg/kg/day. Histopathological exams showed that the target organs of neem oil were testicle, liver and kidneys up to the dose of 1600 mg/kg/day. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The cloned fragment contained a 384 bp open reading frame, which encoded a predicted protein of 127 amino acids and was highly conserved among species. Expression of CRBP IV mRNA was detected in all eight tissues (small intestine, heart, liver, kidney, oviduct, ovary, pituitary, and hypothalamus) at different ages (12, 24, 32 and 45 w). High expression was found in small intestine, pituitary, kidney and liver, whereas it was low in the heart (p < 0.05). The CRBP IV mRNA levels changed with age in the various tissues, and were highly expressed in all tissues at 32 w, except for the heart. We identified one nucleotide substitution (c. 826T>C) in the second exon, which caused an amino acid change (p. S49L). Genotypes (TT, TC and CC) had significant effects on the age at first egg (AFE), total eggs for 300 days (TE300) and highest continuous laying days (HCLD). The CC genotype would be genetically advantageous to improve egg production traits due to earlier AFE, more TE300, and longer HCLD.

In this study, we found that nolinospiroside F significantly extends the replicative lifespan of K6001 yeast at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mu M, indicating that it has an anti-aging effect. This may be attributed to its anti-oxidative effect, as nolinospiroside F could increase yeast survival under oxidative stress conditions and decrease the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress biomarker. It could also increase anti-oxidative stress genes, SOD1 and SOD2, expression, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). It increase the activity of SIRT1, an upstream inducer of SOD2 expression. In sod1 and sod2 mutant yeast strains, nolinospiroside F failed to extend their replicative lifespan. These results indicate that SOD participates in the anti-aging effect of nolinospiroside F. Furthermore, nolinospiroside F inhibited the expression of UTH1, a yeast-aging gene that is involved in the oxidative stress of yeast, and failed to extend the replicative lifespan of uth1 or skn7 mutant yeast cells. SKN7 is the transcriptional activator of UTH1. We also demonstrate that SOD and UTH1 regulate each other's expression. Together, these results suggest that SOD and UTH1 genes are required for and play interactive roles in nolinospiroside F-mediated yeast lifespan extension.

We evaluated the developmental and tissue-specific regulation of MUSTN1 mRNA and protein abundance in Erlang Mountainous (EM) chickens. Results indicated that MUSTN1 mRNA/protein was expressed in most tissues with especially high expression in heart and skeletal muscle. The MUSTN1 protein localized to the nucleus in myocardium and skeletal muscle fibers. There were significant differences in mRNA and protein abundance among tissues, ages and between males and females. In conclusion, MUSTN1 was expressed the greatest in skeletal muscle where it localized to the nucleus. Thus, in chickens MUSTN1 may play a vital role in muscle development.

One hundred and twenty one-day-old avian broilers were randomly divided into two groups and fed on a control diet (starter diet, Met 0.50%; grower diet, Met 0.40%) and Met-deficient diet (starter diet, Met 0.26%; grower diet, Met 0.28%) for six weeks. The relative weight of bursae was decreased with Met deficiency when compared to that of the control group. Lesions were also observed in the Met-deficient group. Histopathologically, the numbers of lymphocytes in the follicles were decreased. Ultrastructurally, the mitochondria of lymphocytes were swollen in the Met-deficient group. As measured by flow cytometry, bursal cells in the G(0)G(1) phase were significantly higher (P < 0.01), and bursal cells in the S, G(2)M phases and proliferating index were obviously lower (P < 0.01) with Met deficiency than in the control group. Moreover, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the bursae were significantly increased in Met-deficient birds (P < 0.01). It was concluded that Met deficiency restrained the development of the bursae of Fabricius and affected the humoral immunity of the chickens.

Neutral endoglucanase (EG1) gene was cloned from Bacillus subtilis and expressed Pichia pastoris in our previous study. Redesigned endoglucanases enhanced cellulase domain, added and deleted carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), named EG2, EG3, and EG4, respectively, were constructed in this study. The redesigned EG genes were expressed in P. pastoris, and their characters were also discussed. The optimal temperature and pH value of the all EGs was 65 A degrees C and 6.0, respectively, where their enzymatic activities in P. pastoris cultivation supernatant reached 867, 651, 966, and 881 U/mL. EG2 showed 24.9 % enzymatic activity loss compared to natural endoglucanase. EG4 showed specific activity 30 % loss and thermostability decrease compared to EG1, which suggested CBM played an important role in improving the catalytic power and heat stability of cellulase family which attached. The specific activity of EG2 and EG3 showed similar to EG1, which suggested neither enhancement of CD nor CBM to endoglucanase can improve its catalytic power, which might rest with its intact topologic structure.

Most ITRs are organized as short tandem arrays and are likely evolutionary relics derived from chromosomal rearrangements and DNA repairs. However, megabase-sized ITR arrays were reported in Solanum species. Here, we report a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) survey of ITRs in all representative diploid Solanum species, including potato, tomato, and eggplant. FISH revealed massive amplification of ITRs in the centromeric regions of chromosomes from the Solanum species containing the B and P genomes. A significant proportion of the ITR FISH signals was mapped within the primary constrictions of the pachytene chromosomes of Solanum pinnatisectum (B genome). In addition, some ITR sites overlapped with St49, a satellite repeat enriched in centromeric DNA sequences associated with CENH3 nucleosomes, in both A and B genome Solanum species. These results show that some ITR subfamilies have been amplified and invaded in the functional centromeres of chromosomes in Solanum species.

Under stressful conditions, many thylakoid membrane proteins in photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants undergo rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to environmental changes. CP29 is the most frequently phosphorylated protein among three minor antennae complexes in higher plants. CP29 phosphorylation in dicotyledons has been known for several decades and is well characterized. However, CP29 phosphorylation in monocotyledons is less studied and appears to have a different phosphorylation pattern. In this review, we discuss recent advancements in CP29 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation studies and its physiological significance under environmental stresses in higher plants, especially in the monocotyledonous crops. Physiologically, the phosphorylation of CP29 is likely to be a prerequisite for state transitions and the disassembly of photosystem II supercomplexes, but not involved in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). CP29 is phosphorylated in monocots exposed to environmental cues, with its subsequent lateral migration from grana stacks to stroma lamellae. However, neither CP29 phosphorylation nor its lateral migration occurs in dicotyledonous plants after drought, cold, or salt stress. Since the molecular mechanisms of differential CP29 phosphorylation under stresses are not fully understood, this review provides insights for future studies regarding the physiological function of CP29 reversible phosphorylation.

The mobility of 1Ay12* and 1Ay8* was similar to that of 1Dy12 and 1By8 from common wheat Chinese Spring, respectively. Their ORFs respectively consisted of 1812 bp and 1935 bp, encoding 602 and 643 amino acid residues with the four typical structural domains of HMW-GS including signal peptide, conserved N-, and C-terminal and central repetitive domains. Compared with the most similar active 1Ay alleles previous published, there were a total of 15 SNPs and 2 InDels in them. Their encoding functions were confirmed by successful heterogeneous expression. The two novel 1Ay alleles were named as 1Ay12* and 1Ay8* with the accession No. JQ318694 and JQ318695 in GenBank, respectively. The two alleles were classed into the two distinct groups, Phe-type and Cys-type, which might be relevant to the differentiation of Glu-A1-2 alleles. Of which, 1Ay8* belonged to Cys-type group, and its protein possessed an additional conserved cysteine residue in central repetitive region besides the six common ones in N- and C-terminal regions of Phe-type group, and was the second longest in all the known active 1Ay alleles. These results suggested that the subunit 1Ay8* of cultivated einkom wheat accession PI345186 might have a potential ability to strengthen the gluten polymer interactions and be a valuable genetic resource for wheat quality improvement.

However, no reports are available on DNA methylation affected by male sterile cytoplasm in hybrid rice. We used a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism technique to characterize DNA methylation in four male sterile cytoplasms that are widely commercialized in China. In total, 12 pairs of selective primers in combinations of EcoRI and MspI/HpaII amplified 350 bands among four male sterile (A) lines and the corresponding maintainer (B) lines. Sites b1 and b3 were fully methylated only in all the B lines, while b2 was fully methylated only in all the A lines. These results implied a relationship of DNA methylation at these sites specifically with male sterile cytoplasms, as well as male sterility, since the only difference between the A and B lines was the cytoplasm. The DNA methylation was markedly affected by male sterile cytoplasms. WA-type and Yinshui-type cytoplasms affected the methylation to a much greater degree than G-type and D-type cytoplasms, as indicated by the number and degree of methylated sites, ratio of methylated sites, number of fully methylated sites, ratio of fully methylated sites, and polymorphism between A and B lines for these cytoplasms. The genetic distance between the cytoplasm and nucleus for the WA-type is much greater than for G- and D-types because the former is between wild and cultivated species and the latter is within indica subspecies between African and Asian cultivars. This difference in genetic distance may be responsible for the variation in methylation which we observed.

Sustained and differential antibody responses to virulence proteins of Brucella melitensis during acute and chronic infections in human brucellosis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							ABORTUS INFECTION; BALB/C MICE; GAMMA-INTERFERON; SEROLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP; HYPERSENSITIVITY TEST; BOVINE BRUCELLOSIS; CONFERS PROTECTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; IN-VITRO; DIAGNOSIS	Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease caused primarily by the bacterial pathogens Brucella melitensis and B. abortus. The pathogens cause debilitating febrile illness that can progress into a long-lasting disease with severe complications in humans. Understanding the mechanisms by which the host immune system responds to the infection will provide important information on the pathogenesis and development of differential diagnostic assays. In this study, a protein microarray was used to evaluate the antibody responses of brucellosis patients at different infection stages. A total of 107 outer membrane proteins, surface-exposed or secreted proteins, and known or putative virulence-associated proteins of B. melitensis were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and used to fabricate the protein microarray. Then, 99 serum samples from acute, chronic, primary infection, or relapse brucellosis patients were probed with the protein microarray. Antibodies to 66 of the proteins were detected at least in one serum sample. Among the antigens, the combination of BMEII0318, BMEII0513, BMEI0748, and BMEII1116 could be used as serodiagnostic antigens for brucellosis. Patients at different infection stages show distinct antibody profiles. The numbers of antibodies in the relapse patients were superior to those in the primary infection patients, and the response magnitude of antibodies in the chronic infection patients was higher than those in the acute brucellosis patients. The sustained and differential antibody profiles of patients at different infection stages have implications for the development of new serological methods for the accurate diagnosis of human brucellosis, and contribute to a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic brucellosis.

With its large biomass, maize could be an important object for studying the phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated soil. In our previous research, we screened 19 inbred lines of maize for Pb concentration, and line 178 was identified to be a hyperaccumulator for Pb in both the roots and aboveground parts. To identify important genes and metabolic pathways related to Pb accumulation and tolerance, line 178 was underwent genome expression profile under Pb stress and a control (CK). A total of approximately 11 million cDNA tags were sequenced and 4 665 539 and 4 936 038 clean tags were obtained from the libraries of the test and CK, respectively. In comparison to CK, 2379 and 1832 genes were identified up- or downregulated, respectively, more than fivefolds under Pb stress. Interestingly, all the genes were related to cellular processes and signaling, information storage and processing or metabolism functions. Particularly, the genes involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones; signal transduction, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; and lipid transport and metabolism significantly changed under the treatment. In addition, seven pathways including ribosome, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation were affected significantly, with 118, 12, 34, 21, 18, 72 and 43 differentially expressed genes involved. The significant upregulation of the ribosome pathway may reveal an important secret for Pb tolerance of line 178. And the sharp increase of laccase transcripts and metal ion transporters were suggested to account in part for Pb hyperaccumulation in the line.

Being evolutionary conserved, single-copy orthologous (COSII) genes are particularly useful in comparative mapping and phylogenetic investigation among species. In this study, we identified 2,684 COSII genes based on five sequenced Poaceae genomes including rice, maize, sorghum, foxtail millet, and brachypodium, and then developed 1,072 COSII markers whose transferability and polymorphism among five bamboo species were further evaluated with 46 pairs of randomly selected primers. 91.3 % of the 46 primers obtained clear amplification in at least one bamboo species, and 65.2 % of them produced polymorphism in more than one species. We also used 42 of them to construct the phylogeny for the five bamboo species, and it might reflect more precise evolutionary relationship than the one based on the vegetative morphology. The results indicated a promising prospect of applying these markers to the investigation of genetic diversity and the classification of Poaceae. To ease and facilitate access of the information of common interest to readers, a web-based database of the COSII markers is provided(http://www.sicau.edu.cn/web/yms/PCOSWeb/PCOS.html).

Myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) regulates myofilament activation via phosphorylation by Ca2+ dependent myosin light chain kinase. The cDNA of the myosin light chain, phosphorylatable, fast skeletal muscle (MYLPF) gene from the longissimus dorsi of Tianfu goat was cloned and sequenced. The results showed that MYLPF full-length coding sequence consists of 513 bp and encodes 170 amino acids with a molecular mass of 19.0 kD. Two EF-hand superfamily domain of MYLPF gene conserved between caprine and other animals. The deduced amino acid sequence of MYLPF shared significant identity with the MYLPF from other mammals. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the caprine MYLPF protein has a close genetic relationship and evolutional distance with MYLPF in other mammals. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that the MYLPF mRNA was detected in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, gastrocnemius, abdominal muscle and longissimus dorsi. In particular, high expression levels of MYLPF mRNA were detected in the longissimus dorsi, gastrocnemius and abdominal muscle, and low level of expressions were observed in liver, spleen, lung and kidney. In addition, the temporal expression analysis further showed MYLPF expression decreased gradually with age in the skeletal muscle. This may be important as muscle growth occurs mainly in young age in goats. Western blotting results detected the MYLPF protein in four of the tissues in which MYLPF was shown to be expressed; the four exceptions were liver, spleen, lung and kidney.

To better understand these valuable traits, levels of chlorophyll a and b, soluble proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, and other components of CN17 were assayed. In addition, chloroplast ultrastructure, chloroplast number, and differences in gene expression between CN17 and a control variety, MY11, were examined. By 21 d post-anthesis (DPA), CN17 leaves exhibited a significantly higher maximal photochemical efficiency for photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm) and a significantly higher efficiency of excitation capture by open PSII reaction centres (Fv'/Fm'). In addition, chlorophyll degradation in CN17 was delayed by approximately 14 d, and was not blocked as observed in cosmetic stay-green phenotypes. The soluble protein content (Ps) of CN17 was higher than MY11 at all timepoints assayed, and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was significantly higher. CN17 also exhibited isolated granal lamellae associated with vesicles and diminished peroxidation, and between 35 and 42 DPA, a sharp decrease in chloroplast number was detected. Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that chloroplast ultrastructure regeneration is responsible for the functional stay-green trait of CN17, and gene expression data provide insight into the mechanistic details.

In this study, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and real-time PCR were performed to characterize the duck LRP8 gene. The cDNA of duck LRP8 contained a 14-bp 5' UTR, a 2754-bp open reading frame, and a 189-bp 3' UTR. The duck LRP8 encoded a protein of 917 amino acid residues composed of five functional domains and resembling other members of the LDLR family, and it displayed high nucleotide and amino acid homology to the LRP8 sequences in other avian species. The mRNA expression level of LRP8 was greater in duck extra-hepatic adipose tissue than in the liver. The peak expression values of LRP8 in both liver and adipose tissues occurred at week 1 and were significantly higher than the values observed during any other week (p < 0.05). Differences in the expression patterns of LRP8 mRNA from weeks 2 to 8 of growth were observed in different organs. A consistent low expression was observed in the liver, and fluctuating expression was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (up- and then down-regulated) and abdominal adipose tissue (down-, then up-, then down-regulated). These findings suggest that LRP8 might play more important roles in regulating lipid metabolism in extra-hepatic adipose tissues than in the liver during early growth after hatching in the duck.

The yield of essential oils varied in the range of 0.5-3.0% within forty-five populations. Based on essential oil composition. all M. haplocalyx accessions could be classified into six chemotypes, including linalool, pulegone, menthone, carvone, menthol, and piperitenone oxide. In particular, all chemotypes were observed in Sichuan Basin. M. spicata accessions were relatively stable in essential oil content and composition, and were grouped together into chemotype carvone. M. haplocalyx was polymorphic in essential oil properties which could be associated with its genetic diversity. Sichuan Basin in China could be a primary diversity region for M. haplocalyx rather than for M. spicata. The characterization of essential oil variation is of commercial importance as well as helpful in the improvement of Mentha resources for fragrance and pharmaceutical industries.

Glycolytic and oxidative myofibers, the two main types of skeletal muscles, play important roles in metabolic health as well as in meat quality and production in the pig industry. Previous expression profile studies of different skeletal muscle types have focused on these aspects of mRNA and proteins; nonetheless, an explanation of the miRNA transcriptome differences between these two distinct muscles types is long overdue. Results: Herein, we present a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiling between the porcine longissimus doris muscle (LDM) and psoas major muscle (PMM) using a deep sequencing approach. We generated a total of 16.62 M (LDM) and 18.46 M (PMM) counts, which produced 15.22 M and 17.52 M mappable sequences, respectively, and identified 114 conserved miRNAs and 89 novel miRNA*s. Of 668 unique miRNAs, 349 (52.25%) were co-expressed, of which 173 showed significant differences (P < 0.01) between the two muscle types. Muscle-specific miR-1-3p showed high expression levels in both libraries (LDM, 32.01%; PMM, 20.15%), and miRNAs that potentially affect metabolic pathways (such as the miR-133 and -23) showed significant differences between the two libraries, indicating that the two skeletal muscle types shared mainly muscle-specific miRNAs but expressed at distinct levels according to their metabolic needs. In addition, an analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathway associated with the predicted target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that the target protein coding genes of highly expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in skeletal muscle structural development, regeneration, cell cycle progression, and the regulation of cell motility. Conclusion: Our study indicates that miRNAs play essential roles in the phenotypic variations observed in different muscle fiber types.

A 30-day experiment was performed using New Zealand rabbits that were naturally infested with P. cuniculi on a farm. Rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (6 animals per group); animals in groups A, B and C were treated in each ear topically with 2 ml of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml (w/v) E. adenopho rum ethanol extract, respectively. Animals in groups D and E were treated with ivermectin (by injection; positive controls) and glycerol with water only (by embrocation; negative controls), respectively. Each rabbit was treated twice with separate treatments on days 0 and 7. Rabbits were observed daily and detailed examinations were performed on days 0, 7, 14 and 30, to inspect the presence or absence of mites and scabs/crusts. Clinical infection and the degree of recovery were evaluated, and the rate of reduction in mites and clinical efficacy rate (%) were calculated. The clinical effect of treatment with E. adenopho rum extracts was similar to treatment with ivermectin. Seven days after the initial treatment, the mean clinical scores (presence of scabs/crusts) decreased from 3.32, 3.08 and 3.17 to 0.37, 0.47 and 0.48 in the left ears of animals in groups A, B and C, respectively, and from 3.53, 3.73 and 3.67 to 0.40, 0.45 and 0.48 in the right ears of animals in groups A, B and C, respectively, which were similar to the observations recorded in the positive control rabbits. However, the clinical score for negative control rabbits did not decrease significantly (P > 0.05) during the experiment, and this changed from 3.32 to 2.75 in the left ears and from 3.50 to 3.25 in the right ears, and there were no significant differences in clinical efficacy between left and right ears. After two treatments (7 days space), the rabbits in groups A, B, C and D had recovered completely 30 days after the last treatment and no recurrences of infection were observed. These results indicate that E. adenophorum contains potent compounds for the effective control of animal acariasis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, 12 NAM-G1 genes in Triticum timopheevii Zhuk. (AAGG, 2n = 4x = 28) were cloned. These genes had the same length of 1546 bp including two introns and three exons, and encoded a polypeptide of 407 amino acid residues which contained a N-terminal NAC domain with five sub-domains, and a C-terminal transcriptional activation region (TAR). They were highly similar to the previously published functional NAM-B1 gene DQ871219 from T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides Korn. (AABB, 2n = 4x = 28) in both the nucleotide and protein sequence's, with a very high identity of 99.5%. The differences among the 12 NAM-G1 genes resulted from 17 SNPs including 14 transitions and 3 transversions. They had outstandingly different expression levels in qRT-PCR. And, their relative expression quantities were significantly positively correlated with GPC of the accessions. In addition, the difference in amino acid sequences of the NAM-G1 genes may also affect the GPC variation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

For a better understanding of the structure and function of the PID1 gene and to study its effect in caprine, the cDNA of the PID1 gene from the abdominal muscle of Tianfu goat was cloned and sequenced. The structure of PID1 was analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The results showed that the full sequence of the caprine PID1 cDNA was 896 bp long and contained a 654 bp long coding region that encoded a 217 amino acid sequence. Fifteen phosphorylation sites were predicted in the translated PID1 protein. The protein had a phosphotyrosine-binding domain between Arg(53) and Ile(199). A phylogenic tree based on the PID1 proteins from other species revealed that the caprine protein was closely related to cattle PID1. Fluorescence quantitative PCR analyses revealed that PID1 was expressed in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, leg muscle, abdominal muscle and longissimus dorsi muscle of goats. In particular, high expression levels of PID1 were detected in liver and abdominal muscle, and low expression levels were seen in lung. Furthermore, the PID1 mRNA expression levels in the longissimus dorsi muscles increased gradually with the age of the goats (P<0.05). Western blotting results detected the PID1 protein in six of the tissues in which PID1 was shown to be expressed: the two exceptions were liver and spleen. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, phylogeography and demography of Tylototriton shanjing was investigated from a mitochondrial perspective to address the role of the Quaternary ice ages in shaping phylogeographic history and genetic diversity of Yunnan. A total of 146 individuals from 19 populations across the entire range of the species were collected. We detected four maternal phylogenetic lineages corresponding to four population groups, and found that major glaciation events during the Pleistocene have triggered the intra-specific divergence. Coalescent simulations indicated that the populations retreated to different refugia located in southern Yunnan, northwestern Yunnan, the border region of western Yunnan with Myanmar, and middle-western Yunnan, respectively, during previous glacial periods in the Pleistocene, and these four refugia were not retained during the Last Glacial Maximum. Population expansions occurred during the last inter-glaciation, during which ice core and pollen data indicated that the temperature and precipitation gradually increased, and declines of population sizes started after the beginning of the Last Glacial Maximum when the climate became cooler and dryer. The paleodrainage system had no contribution to the current genetic structure and the rivers were not dispersal barriers for this salamander.

Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	PEERJ			English	Article						Photorespiration; Glycolate oxidase; Disease resistance; NH1; NPR1; Glutaredoxin; Hydrogen peroxide; WRKY45		Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme in photorespiration, catalyzing the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. Arabidopsis GLO is required for nonhost defense responses to Pseudomonas syringae and for tobacco Pto/AvrPto-mediated defense responses. We previously described identification of rice GLO1 that interacts with a glutaredoxin protein, which in turn interacts with TGA transcription factors. TGA transcription factors are well known to participate in NPR1/NH1-mediated defense signaling, which is crucial to systemic acquired resistance in plants. Here we demonstrate that reduction of rice GLO1 expression leads to enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Constitutive silencing of GLO1 leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports. Inducible silencing of GLO1, employing a dexamethasone-GVG (Gal4 DNA binding domain-VP16 activation domain-glucocorticoid receptor fusion) inducible system, alleviates these detrimental effects. Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression.

The aim of this study was to compare the neuronal differentiation potential of parthenogenetic and fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells. Before differentiation, karyotype analysis was performed, with normal karyotypes detected in both parthenogenetic and fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells. Sex chromosomes were identified as XX. Immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR detected high expression of the pluripotent gene, Oct4, at both the mRNA and protein levels, indicating pluripotent differentiation potential of the two embryonic stem cell subtypes. Embryonic stem cells were induced with retinoic acid to form embryoid bodies, and then dispersed into single cells. Single cells were differentiated in N2 differentiation medium for 9 days. Immunocytochemistry showed parthenogenetic and fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells both express the neuronal cell markers nestin, beta III-tubulin and myelin basic protein. Quantitative real-time PCR found expression of neurogenesis related genes (Sox-1, Nestin, GABA, Pax6, Zic5 and Pitx1) in both types of embryonic stem cells, and Oct4 expression was significantly decreased. Nestin and Pax6 expression in parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells was significantly higher than that in fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells. Thus, our experimental findings indicate that parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells have stronger neuronal differentiation potential than fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells.

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of the polysaccharide from the Radix Cyathulae officinalis Kuan (RCPS) for its adjuvant potential on the FMDV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. In this study, our findings shows that oral administration of RCPS significantly enhanced the phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophage, splenocyte proliferation, the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers. Furthermore, RCPS promoted the level of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-4 in CD4(+)T cells and level of IFN-gamma in 0381 cells. In addition, RCPS enhanced the expression of CD40(+), CD80(+) and CD86(+) on DCs. Importantly, RCPS could up-regulated the mRNA level of MHC I, MHC II, TLR-2, TLR-4. Interestingly, RCPS down-regulated the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RCPS can enhance both cellular and humoral immune responses via up-regulating DCs maturation through TLR2, TLR4 signaling pathway, and suppressing Treg frequency.

Mycobacterium fluoroquinolone resistance protein A (MfpA) from Mycobacterium smegmatis is a newly identified DNA gyrase inhibitor that is believed to confer intrinsic resistance to fluoroquinolones. However, MfpA does not prevent drug-induced inhibition of DNA gyrase in vitro, implying the involvement of other as yet unknown factors. Here, we have identified a new factor, named Mycobacterium fluoroquinolone resistance protein B (MfpB), which is involved in the protection of DNA gyrase against drugs both in vivo and in vitro. Genetic results suggest that MfpB is necessary for MfpA protection of DNA gyrase against drugs in vivo; an mfpB knockout mutant showed greater susceptibility to ciprofloxacin than the wild-type, whereas a strain overexpressing MfpA and MfpB showed higher loss of susceptibility. Further biochemical characterization indicated that MfpB is a small GTPase and its GTP bound form interacts directly with MfpA and influences its interaction with DNA gyrase. Mutations in MfpB that decrease its GTPase activity disrupt its protective efficacy. Our studies suggest that MfpB, a small GTPase, is required for MfpA-conferred protection of DNA gyrase.

The effects of pretreatment conditions including, phosphoric acid concentration, pretreatment temperature, time, and ratio of textiles and phosphoric acid were thoroughly investigated. Results indicated the mentioned four factors had significant influences on sugar and polyester recovery. Almost complete polyester recovery was achieved by enhancing phosphoric acid concentration, temperature and pretreatment time or reducing the ratio of textiles and phosphoric acid. However, these behaviors decreased the sugar recovery seriously. 100% polyester recovery with a maximum sugar recovery of 79.2% was achieved at the optimized conditions (85% phosphoric acid, 50 degrees C, 7 h, and the ratio of 1:15).

A pot experiment with different soil Cd concentrations and a plot experiment at 28.44 mg Cd kg(-1) were conducted to investigate Cd tolerance and accumulation by Siegesbeckia orientalis following a field survey. In the pot experiment, at Cd concentration of 150 mg kg(-1),S. orientalis grew normally and shoot biomass was not reduced significantly compared with the no Cd control. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in roots and leaves, and peroxidase in leaves significantly increased with increasing soil Cd (P < 0.05). The highest shoot Cd concentrations were 117.48, 192.92 and 77.10 mg kg(-1), in the field survey, pot and plot experiments, respectively and their corresponding accumulations were 6.762 mg plant(-1),4.134 mg pot(-1) and 18.45 mg m(-2). All Cd bioconcentration factors and translocation factors were more than 1.0. Therefore, S. orientalis is a Cd-accumulator with hyperaccumulating ability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular cytological characterization of two novel durum Thinopyrum intermedium partial amphiploids with resistance to leaf rust, stem rust and Fusarium head blight	HEREDITAS			English	Article							STREAK-MOSAIC-VIRUS; F-SP TRITICI; CYTOGENETIC CHARACTERIZATION; POWDERY MILDEW; SPECIFYING RESISTANCE; INSITU HYBRIDIZATION; WHEAT; GENE; DERIVATIVES; CHROMOSOME	Thinopyrum intermedium, a wild relative of wheat, is an excellent source of disease resistance. Two novel partial amphiploids, 08-47-50 and 08-53-55 (2n = 6x = 42), were developed from wide crosses between durum wheat and Th. intermedium. Meiotic analysis showed that pollen mother cells of the two partial amphiploids formed an average 20.49 bivalents for 08-47-50 and 20.67 bivalents for 08-53-55, indicating that they are basically cytologically stable. GISH analysis revealed that the two partial amphiploids carried different chromosome compositions. 08-47-50 had fourteen chromosomes from Th. intermedium and its alien chromosomes included six St-, four Ee- and four Ee-St translocated chromosomes, whereas 08-53-55 had four St- and ten Ee-St translocated chromosomes. Fungal disease evaluation indicated that both partial amphiploids had a high level of resistance to FHB, leaf rust and stem rust race Ug99. These two novel partial amphiploids with multiple disease resistance could be used as a new source of multiple disease resistance in bread wheat and durum wheat breeding programs.

The two species are sympatric in southwest of China. Natural hybrids between R. parvifolius and R. coreanus do generally occur. In this study, chromosomal, palynological, RAPD and ISSR markers were developed to identify R. parvifolius, R. coreanus and their putative hybrids. UPGMA model-based clustering of the genetic data indicated that two genetic units existed in these populations. One contained twenty-one accessions, mainly characterized by R. parvifolius and R. coreanus with typical morphological features ("pure"). The other was composed of sixteen accessions, which shared an intermediate morphology with the R. parvifolius and R. coreanus ("hybrid"). These results showed obvious genetic differentiation between their potential parents and among individuals of hybrids themselves in the long evolutionary history by several hybridization events. A triploid accession R03-10 (2n=3x=21), was identified as a probable natural hybrid of R. parvifolius and R. coreanus based on morphological, chromosomal and palynological identifications. The species R. parvifolius, an important resource involved in the hybridization, multipolyploidization and speciation of the genus Rubus, is discussed.

The results showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plant growth and stem sap flow increased and salt tolerance improved, whereas Na+ and Cl- accumulated. Na+ significantly decreased, and no significant decline was detected in Cl- content after AMF inoculation compared with the non-AM plants. The LeNHX1 gene expression was induced in the AM and non-AM plants by NaCl stress. However, AMF did not improve the LeNHX1 level, and low expression was observed in the AM tomato. Hence, the mechanism that reduced the Na+ damage to tomato induced by AMF has little relation to LeNHX1, which can export Na+ from the cytosol to the vacuole across the tonoplast.

Conventional energy and emergy are applied to quantify energy consumption and emissions' impact, respectively. The five indicators based on money, energy and emergy, including ratio of nonrenewable energy to renewable energy (RNR), energy use per unit GDP (EUPG), environmental cost per unit GDP (ECPG), impact of emissions per unit energy consumption (IEPEC), and environmental benefit per unit environmental protection investment (EBPEI), are presented to depict the relationships among economic growth and energy consumption and impact of air emissions and air environmental protection investment. The results show that energy consumption rapidly rises with China's fast economic growth; however, energy efficiency and environmental loading intensity from energy consumption are reduced simultaneously but their improvements fall far behind economic growth rate. Impact of air emissions, mainly Composed of impact of emissions on human health (especially dust), is slightly decreased. The performance of air environmental protection investment is obviously declined in the study period. Generally speaking, the conflict among economy, energy and air environment protection is slightly mitigated but still acute due to great dependence of China's economy on fossil energy and inefficient environmental protection measures. Finally, this paper discusses the corresponding issues, and then puts forward some related suggestions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The RDE was purified about 11.34-fold and its final yield was 3.5%, which was very low, due to our purification strategy of giving priority to purity over yield. The RDE molecular weight was estimated to be about 60kDa. When rutin was used as substrate, an optimal enzyme activity was seen at around pH 5.0 and 40 degrees C. Strains isolation strategy characterized by the use of rutin as sole carbon source in enrichment cultures was used to isolate RDE-producing strains. Then the active strains were identified by morphology characterization and 18s rDNA-ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) gene sequencing. Three isolates coded as B3, W2, Y2 were successfully isolated from fusty Fagopyrum tataricum flour cultures. Strain B3 possessed the highest unit activity among these three strains, and its total activity reached up to 171.0 Unit. The active isolate (B3) could be assigned to Penicillium farinosum. When the Penicillium farinosum strains were added to tartary buckwheat flour cultures at pH 5.0, 30 degrees C after 5 days fermentation, the quercetin production raised up to 1.78mg/l, almost 5.1 times higher than the fermentation without the above active strains. Hence, a new approach was available to utilize microorganism-aided fermentation for effective quercetin extraction from Fagopyrum tataricum seeds.

The induced resistance lasted for 1015days, with the optimum induced effect against anthracnose occurring by the third day. Following treatment with C.camelliae alone, COS alone and C. camelliae and COS combined, camellia plants showed different responses, which included the activity of H2O2, the defence-related enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, catalase, phenylalanine ammonialyase, and concentration of soluble proteins. Plants that received COS treatments consistently had higher levels of biochemical activity than plants not treated with COS. Assessment of anthracnose severity on infected plants, as evidenced by reduced lesions on leaves, indicated that COS-induced camellia plants had significantly lower disease ratings. To our knowledge, we are first to report the inducement by COS on camellia against anthracnose.

In this study, selective genotyping was applied to four maize F2 populations. Thirty plants were selected from each of the two tails of the original F2 populations to represent extreme resistant and susceptible plants to root lodging, and genotyped individually with 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A quantitative trait locus (QTL) was declared when at least three closely linked SNPs showed significant allele frequency difference between the two tails. Nine QTL were identified for root lodging across the four populations, which were located on chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10 and one of them was shared between two populations. A total of 20 segregation distortion regions (SDRs) were identified across the four populations, one of which was co-localized with a QTL on chromosome 4. The tightly linked SNPs identified in this study can be used for marker-assisted selection for root lodging. Selective genotyping, when combined with pooled DNA analysis, can be used to develop strategies for high-throughput genetic mapping for all crops.

J	Hou, K; Wu, W; Gan, SS				Hou, Kai; Wu, Wei; Gan, Su-Sheng			SAUR36, a SMALL AUXIN UP RNA Gene, Is Involved in the Promotion of Leaf Senescence in Arabidopsis	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; TRANSGENIC PLANTS; TOBACCO CELLS; EXPRESSION; THALIANA; PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION; ELEMENT; GENOME; KINASE	Small Auxin Up RNA genes (SAURs) are early auxin-responsive genes, but whether any of them are involved in leaf senescence is not known. Auxin, on the other hand, has been shown to have a role in leaf senescence. Some of the external application experiments indicated that auxin can inhibit leaf senescence, whereas other experiments indicated that auxin can promote leaf senescence. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf senescence-associated gene named SAG201, which is highly up-regulated during leaf senescence and can be induced by 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, a synthetic auxin. It encodes a functionally uncharacterized SAUR that has been annotated as SAUR36. Leaf senescence in transfer DNA insertion saur36 knockout lines was delayed as revealed by analyses of chlorophyll content, F-v/F-m ratio (a parameter for photosystem II activity), ion leakage, and the expression of leaf senescence marker genes. In contrast, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing SAUR36 (without its 3' untranslated region [UTR]) displayed an early leaf senescence phenotype. However, plants overexpressing SAUR36 with its 3' UTR were normal and did not exhibit the early-senescence phenotype. These data suggest that SAUR36 is a positive regulator of leaf senescence and may mediate auxin-induced leaf senescence and that the 3' UTR containing a highly conserved downstream destabilizes the SAUR36 transcripts in young leaves.

Biofortification, or breeding staple food crops that are rich in micronutrients, provides a sustainable way to fight VAD and other micronutrient malnutrition problems. Polymorphisms, with associated molecular markers, have recently been identified for two loci, LcyE (lycopene epsilon cyclase) and CrtRB1 (beta-carotene hydroxylase 1) that govern critical steps in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in maize endosperm, thereby enabling the opportunity to integrate marker-assisted selection (MAS) into carotenoid breeding programs. We validated the effects of 3 polymorphisms (LcyE5'TE, LcyE3'Indel and CrtRB1-3'TE) in 26 diverse tropical genetic backgrounds. CrtRB1-3'TE had a two-ten fold effect on enhancing beta-carotene (BC) and total provitamin A (proA) content. Reduced-function, favorable polymorphisms within LcyE resulted in 0-30 % reduction in the ratio of alpha- to beta-branch carotenoids, and increase in proA content (sometimes statistically significant). CrtRB1-3'TE had large, significant effect on enhancing BC and total ProA content, irrespective of genetic constitution for LcyE5'TE. Genotypes with homozygous favorable CrtRB1-3'TE alleles had much less zeaxanthin and an average of 25 % less total carotenoid than other genotypes, suggesting that feedback inhibition may be reducing the total flux into the carotenoid pathway. Because this feedback inhibition was most pronounced in the homozygous favorable LcyE (reduced-function) genotypes, and because maximum total proA concentrations were achieved in genotypes with homozygous unfavorable or heterozygous LcyE, we recommend not selecting for both reduced-function genes in breeding programs. LcyE exhibited significant segregation distortion (SD) in all the eight, while CrtRB1 in five of eight digenic populations studied, with favorable alleles of both the genes frequently under-represented. MAS using markers reported herein can efficiently increase proA carotenoid concentration in maize.

Lineage A was speculated to share the same mitochondrial ancestors with the populations from Taiwan Island. Lineage C harboured most of the haplotypes (39/60) of populations and may have experienced population expansion. The distribution pattern of Lineage C from east to west regions may have resulted from the occurrence of the major glaciation and inter-regional introduction. Lineage A, B and E inhabiting coastline regions were immune from the expansion of Lineage C due to isolation from inland areas blocking gene flow between inland and coastal populations. On the other hand, Chinese swamp eels were revealed to be maintaining substantially differentiated population structures, while three populations from the Sichuan basin (MY, LC and YA) were genetically closely related. This was attributed to the geographical isolation of Sichuan populations from other populations, facilitating gene flow among the three populations from the Sichuan basin.

Purification of protein AP-toxin from Arthrinium phaeospermum causing blight in Bambusa pervariabilis x Dendrocalamopisis grandis and its metabolic effects on four bamboo varieties. Phytopathology 103:135-145. Bambusa pervariabilis x Dendrocalamopisis grandis blight is caused by a toxin produced by the fungus Arthrinium phaeospermum. In this study, a toxin fraction (P1-2-2) with an estimated molecular mass of 31 kDa was purified from a culture filtrate of this fungus by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography, Q Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange resin, and Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (i.e., H2N-Gln-Val-Arg-Asp-Arg-Leu-Glu-Ser-Thr) determined by Edman degradation showed homology to known serine alkaline proteases. The purified protein was named AP-toxin. Effects of the purified protein toxin on total phenol, flavonoid, total nucleic acid, DNA, RNA, soluble protein, and soluble sugar content, as well as DNase and RNase activities and disease index, were analyzed in different bamboo varieties by the impregnation method. The toxin had a significant effect on each parameter tested. In addition, a significant correlation was observed among the metabolic index, treatment time, bamboo resistance, and disease index. These data suggest that AP-toxin plays an important role in mediating the phytotoxic activities of A. phaeospermum. This study also indicates that metabolic indices could reflect the resistance indices of hybrid bamboo to blight.

Jian). A total of 1200 fish with an average initial weight of 9.67 +/- 0.03 g were fed diets containing 5.3 (unsupplemented control), 8.7, 11.8, 14.9, 18.7 and 20.1 g valine kg-1 diet for 60 days. Results indicated that the specific growth rate, feed efficiency, body protein and lipid content of fish were significantly improved by the dietary valine (P < 0.05). The hepatopancreas weight and activities of trypsin, amylase, lipase, chymotrypsin, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) took the similar trends. Similarly, the optimum levels of dietary valine induced increases in the intestinal length, weight, folds height and activities of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase. In contrast, the trends of muscle GOT activity and plasma ammonia content were opposite. Intestinal Aeromonas, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Bacillus were changed by dietary valine supplementations. The dietary valine requirement for Jian carp (9.6776.4 g) based on SGR was 13.7 g valine kg-1 diet (4.0 g valine 100 g-1 CP). Together, these results indicated that valine improved fish growth, digestive and absorptive ability.

The enterocytes were incubated in media containing 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 mg MI L-1 for 96 h. The results indicated that MI could increase cell viability. In addition, the activities of cellular alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (?-GT), Na+, K+-adenosine trisphosphatase (Na+, K+-ATPase) and creatinkinase (CK) increased with MI supplementation at levels ranging from 15 to 60 mg MI L-1 medium, indicating an improvement in cell differentiation and function. Further, enzymatic antioxidant ability, as measured by total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, improved with MI supplementation. Finally, cell damage, as indicated by lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the medium and cellular protein carbonyls (PC), was all depressed by MI. Correlation analyses showed that cell viability (MTT) was positively related to the antioxidant enzyme activities, but negatively related to cell damage (LDH, MDA and PC). In summary, the data showed that MI could improve the growth of fish enterocytes. This result may be partly due to the enhanced antioxidant status and depressed oxidative damage.

The purpose of this study was to examine the serum cytokine contents including interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced by dietary nickel chloride in broilers by enzyme-linked immunospecific assay. A total of 240 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of nickel chloride. During the experimental period of 42 days, the results showed that the serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha contents were lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 300, 600, 900 mg/kg groups than those in the control group. It was concluded that dietary nickel chloride in the range of 300 to 900 mg/kg could reduce the serum cytokine contents, which could finally impact the immune function in broilers.

Vaccination with recombinant actin from scab mites and evaluation of its protective efficacy against Psoroptes cuniculi infection	PARASITE IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						actin; immunolocalization; Psoroptes cuniculi; vaccine	SHEEP SCAB; ANTIBODY-RESPONSES; EXPRESSION; OVIS; LOCALIZATION; RABBITS; GENE	The mite Psoroptes cuniculi is globally widespread and has a serious impact on commercial rabbit breeding. Current treatment methods are based on chemotherapy. Because of the disadvantages of these methods, alternative measures are required, and vaccination is one of the most promising strategies. Here, we cloned and expressed the recombinant P. cuniculi actin gene (rPc-act). Antiserum levels against rPc-act in rabbits were used to locate actin distribution in mite sections. Challenge trials were carried out to evaluate the immunity protection of rPc-act in rabbits, with antibody levels determined by ELISA. Sequence analysis of this gene fragment showed 89.26% and 84.91% identity to Sarcoptes scabiei and Mayetiola destructor sequences, respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed rPc-act to locate widely throughout the mites, especially in feet and muscle tissues. Recombinant P. cuniculi actin with QuliA adjuvant was used to immunize six rabbits. Each animal was challenge-infested with 2550 adult mites. Although IgE levels showed no significant difference to controls, IgG levels were significantly higher, and clinical development showed no significantly different severity of lesions in vaccinated rabbits than in the controls. This study showed that rPc-act is a muscular isotype actin and has no clinical protective efficacy against P. cuniculi.

Analysis of Essential Oil from Pericarps of Chimonanthus praecox	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Chimonanthus praecox; Pericarp; Essential oil; Hydrodistillation; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry	SESQUITERPENE T-CADINOL; CONSTITUENTS	In this work, the essential oil from pericarps of Chimonanthus praecox was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The essential oil in pericarps of both the wild and cultivated wintersweets were mainly characterized by sesquiterpenoids with more than 60 % and, shared 19 components, which indicated the close genetic relationship between the wild and cultivated wintersweets. At the same time, the outstanding differences of both yields and chemical components of the essential oils between the wild wintersweets from different populations, as well as between the wild and cultivated wintersweets, were observed. Pericarps of the tested wild wintersweets possessed higher essential oil contents and more abundant chemical components than those of the cultivated one, of which, the wild wintersweet at Qinghuazhen was more excellent than that at Taipingzhen, suggesting that partial genetic materials controlling some particular natural products might be varied and lost in the processes of evolution and domestication from wild to cultivated wintersweet and there are, to a certain extent, genetic diversity in wild wintersweets. These results revealed that the oil vacuole tissues of wintersweet flowers might be further developed to the fruits, even kept within the dried pericarps that are developed from the ovary walls, which implied that there are probably abundant oil vacuole cells in the pistil of wintersweet.

This study focused on the differences of mesenchymal stem cells from adult adipose (ADSCs), skeletal muscle (MDSCs) and fetal muscle (FMSCs) in biological characteristics, which is the key to cell therapy success. Stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1) expression of MDSCs and FMSCs at passage 3 was two times more than that at passage 1 (P < 0.0001). After 28-day myogenic induction, higher expression levels of skeletal muscle-specific genes were observed in MDSCs than FMSCs (P < 0.01), and the lowest expression levels were demonstrated in ADSCs among three cells (P < 0.01). Besides, M-Cad and MyHC expressions in ADSCs were not detected by immunofluorescence or real-time quantitative PCR. Furthermore, after 14 days adipogenic induction, PPAR gamma 2, LPL and aP2 mRNA expressions were higher in ADSCs vs. MDSCs (P < 0.01). Besides, MSCs from adult or fetal muscle expressed higher OCN and OPN than ADSCs after 28 days osteogenic induction (P < 0.01). Taken together, our results suggested that cell source and developmental stage had great impacts on biological properties of mesenchymal stem cells, and proper consideration of all the issues is necessary.

However, it is little known about the role of functional nutrients in the regulation of porcine beta-defensins' expressions in intestinal epithelial cells. The present study was conducted to determine the hypothesis that zinc and l-isoleucine regulate the expressions of porcine beta-defensins in IPEC-J2 cells. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing supplemental 0-500 mu g/mL l-isoleucine or 0-500 mu mol/mL zinc sulfate that was used to increase the concentration of Zn2+ in the medium. At 12 h after the treatment by the appropriate concentrations of l-isoleucine or Zn2+, the mRNA and protein expressions of porcine beta-defensin 1, 2 and 3 were increased (P < 0.05), and reached their maximum after treatment with 25 or 100 mu mol/mL zinc sulfate and 25 or 50 mu g/mL isoleucine (P < 0.05). These results suggested that both Zn2+ and l-isoleucine could induce beta-defensins' expressions in porcine intestinal epithelial cells.

A total of 34 samples were gathered on the Campus of Sichuan Agricultural University (SAU, urban site, in the city zone of Ya'an), while 49 samples were collected at Baima Spring Scenic Area (BSSA, forest site, situated about 30 km to the northeast of SAU) during June to July, 2010. Using GC/MS analysis with prior trimethylsilylation, organic tracers including isoprene oxidation products (2-methyltetrols. C-5-alkene triols and 2-methylglyceric acid), alpha-/beta-pinene oxidation products (norpinic acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylglutaric acid, and 3-methyl-1,2,3- butanetricarboxylic acid), a sesquiterpene oxidation product (beta-caryophyllinic acid), sugars (glucose and fructose), sugar alcohols (arabitol, mannitol, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol), anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan) and malic acid were determined. The factors that could potentially affect the SOA tracer concentrations, i.e. trace gases (SO2, NOx, O-3, NH3), aerosol acidity and meteorological parameters, were monitored. The results showed that the concentrations of total isoprene oxidation products were 72 and 82 ng/m(3) at the two sampling locations, with 29 +/- 18, 37 +/- 9, 6 +/- 2 ng/m(3) at SAU and 57 +/- 34, 33 +/- 33, 4 +/- 2 ng/m(3) at BSSA for 2-methyltetrols. C-5-alkene triols and 2-methylglyceric acid respectively. Compared with the concentrations of isoprene oxidation products, those of alpha-/beta-pinene oxidation products and beta-caryophyllinic acid were much lower, being 6 +/- 33 and 0.5 +/- 1.9 ng/m(3) at SAO, and 9 +/- 14 and 1.0 +/- 1.2 ng/m(3) at BSSA, respectively. The unique composition of isoprene oxidation products, particularly, the high concentrations of the C-5-alkene triols and their relative abundances comparable to those of the 2-methyltetrols, are possibly due to the fact that they are formed through acid-catalyzed reactions of C-5-epoxydiols on weak acidic aerosols. Moreover, sugars and sugar alcohols were measured in important fractions at the two study areas, with the median concentrations of 309.7 and 465.7 ng/m(3) at SAU and BSSA, respectively. The high abundances of sugar and sugar alcohols in the study area are explained by the robust metabolism of microorganism in the fertile soil under the warm and moist climate as well as vigorous physiological activities of vegetations in the exuberant subtropical areas. The detected organic tracers accounted in total for 1.5-1.8% of organic carbon (OC) in the study atmosphere, and about 15-21% of the OC could in total be apportioned to biogenic aerosol sources and source processes.

Chemical characteristics and source apportionment of fine particulate organic carbon in Hong Kong during high particulate matter episodes in winter 2003	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Fine organic carbon; Source apportionment; Chemical mass balance; Organic tracers; Episode; Secondary organic aerosol	AIR-POLLUTION SOURCES; RIVER DELTA REGION; DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS; SEASONAL CHARACTERISTICS; ATMOSPHERIC PARTICLES; AMBIENT AEROSOLS; GAS-PHASE; ACE-ASIA; EMISSIONS; PM2.5	PM2.5 samples were collected at six general stations and one roadside station in Hong Kong in two periods of high particulate matter (PM) in 2003 (27 October-4 November and 30 November-13 December). The highest PM2.5 reached 216 mu g m(-3) during the first high PM period and mu g m(-3) during the second high PM period. Analysis of synoptic weather conditions identified individual sampling days under dominant influence of one of three types of air masses, that is, local, regional and long-range transported (LRT) air masses. Roadside samples were discussed separately due to heavy influences from vehicular emissions. This research examines source apportionment of fine organic carbon (OC) and contribution of secondary organic aerosol on high PM days under different synoptic conditions. Six primary OC (POC) sources (vehicle exhaust, biomass burning, cooking, cigarette smoke, vegetative detritus, and coal combustion) were identified on the basis of characteristic organic tracers. Individual POC source contributions were estimated using chemical mass balance model. In the roadside and the local samples, OC was dominated by the primary sources, accounting for more than 74% of OC. In the samples influenced by regional and LRT air masses. secondary OC (SOC), which was approximated to be the difference between the total measured OC and the apportioned POC, contributed more than 54% of fine OC. SOC was highly correlated with water-soluble organic carbon and sulfate, consistent with its secondary nature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of cholesterol on lipogenesis and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion in goose primary hepatocytes	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cholesterol; Goose; Lipogenesis; VLDL secretion	TRIGLYCERIDE TRANSFER PROTEIN; B-CONTAINING LIPOPROTEINS; LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN; FATTY-ACID; APOLIPOPROTEIN-B; DIETARY-CHOLESTEROL; LIVER; MICE; CELLS; METABOLISM	To investigate how cholesterol induces hepatocytic steatosis, we investigated the effect of cholesterol on hepatic lipogenesis and the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TGs) in goose primary hepatocytes. We found that cholesterol at 20 mu g/ml increased the concentrations of extracellular VLDL, intracellular cholesterol, and intracellular TGs, while cholesterol at 30 mu g/ml had a reduced effect (p < 0.05). Additionally, cholesterol at 20 mu g/ml, but not at 10 or 30 mu g/ml, increased the extracellular TG concentration. Cholesterol increased the fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with cholesterol increased the mRNA level of genes involved in lipogenesis, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACC alpha), and liver X receptors. The mRNA level of the acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene changed in response to cholesterol treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the regulation of extracellular VLDL and intracellular TG accumulation, the mRNA levels of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, forkhead box O1, and DGAT2 increased with treatment with 10 or 20 mu g/ml of cholesterol, but decreased with treatment with 30 mu g/ml of cholesterol (p < 0.05). Cholesterol had no evident effect on the mRNA level of the apolipoprotein B gene. Incubation with cholesterol at 20 and 30 mu g/ml increased the nuclear SREBP-1 protein level (p < 0.05) and the binding affinity of the nuclear SREBP-1 to ACC alpha SRE probes. In conclusion, cholesterol not only activates the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and TG accumulation, but also activates the transcription of genes involved in the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TG in goose primary hepatocytes.

Accumulation characteristics of and removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from livestock wastewater by Polygonum hydropiper	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mining ecotype; Nitrogen (N); Phosphorus (P); Livestock wastewater; Polygonum hydropiper	BIOLOGICAL NUTRIENT REMOVAL; HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; SEQUENCING BATCH REACTOR; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; CARBON SOURCE; PLANTS; RECOVERY; DAIRY	The mining ecotype (ME) and non-mining ecotype (NME) of Polygonum hydropiper (P. hydropiper) were used as materials to study their potential removal capabilities for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with two (high and low) concentrations from livestock wastewater. The plants were harvested at 15, 30, and 45 d after planting. In treatments for both high and low concentrations, a significant increase in shoot biomass of two ecotypes of P. hydropiper (P < 0.05) was observed with growth time. The shoot biomass from ME of P. hydropiper was higher than that of NME. N and P accumulation in the shoots of two ecotypes of P. hydropiper increased with cultivation time (P < 0.05). However, the accumulation of ME was significantly higher than that of NME. The removal rate of total N (TN) and total P (TP) in the two wastewater concentrations treated by two ecotypes of P. hydropiper increased with cultivation time (P < 0.05), and the ME of P. hydropiper had a higher value than the NME. The ME of P. hydropiper removed as high as 87.47% of TN and 97.63% of TP.

The physicochemical properties of Epimedium polysaccharides were then determined by chemical composition analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Further, the antioxidant activities were studied via different methods, including DPPH assay, ABTS assay, FRAP assay and AAPH-induced erythrocyte hemolysis assay. Results showed that the physicochemical properties of different polysaccharides were similar. Antioxidant assay indicated that four polysaccharides exhibited significant antioxidant activities in a dose-dependent manner. The antioxidant activities of the polysaccharides which obtained by hot water extraction were higher than those of other polysaccharides. Overall. E. acuminatum polysaccharides might be used as potential natural antioxidant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Synonymous codon usage in T. pisiformis was examined through 8118 reconstructed annotations of transcriptome sequences. The mean value of GC content for the reconstructed genes was 49.48%. Twenty-four codons were determined as "optimal codons". Approximately all translational optimal codons (except CGU) ended on G or C. The gene positions on the primary axis were strongly positively correlated with GC content at the third codon positions and GC content of individual genes. At the same time, the gene expression level assessed by the CAI, the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of encoded proteins were correlated with the GC content at the third codon positions and the effective number of codons (ENC), respectively. We infer that the gene expression level, the hydrophobicity and the aromaticity of the encoded proteins also influenced codon usage in T. pisiformis. Knowledge of the codon usage pattern in T. pisiformis can improve our understanding of the mechanisms of biased usage of synonymous codons and can help in selecting appropriate host expression systems for potential vaccine genes of T. pisiformis.

Here in this report, interactions among the possible components in T3SS of Yersinia pestis were identified using yeast mating technique. A total of 57 genes, including all the pCD1-encoded genes except those involved in plasmid replication and partition, pseudogenes, and the putative transposase genes, were subjected to yeast mating analysis. 21 pairs of interaction proteins were identified, among which 9 pairs had been previously reported and 12 novel pairs were identified in this study. Six of them were tested by GST pull down assay, and interaction pairs of YscG-SycD, YscG-TyeA, YscI-YscF, and YopN-YpCD1.09c were successfully validated, suggesting that these interactions might play potential roles in function of Yersinia T3SS. Several potential new interactions among T3SS components could help to understand the assembly and regulation of Yersinia T3SS.

The complex life cycle of D. immitis with several developmental stages in its invertebrate mosquito vectors and its vertebrate hosts indicates the importance of miRNA in growth and development, and their ability to regulate infection of mammalian hosts. This study identified the miRNA profiles of D. immitis of zoonotic significance by deep sequencing. A total of 1063 conserved miRNA candidates, including 68 anti-sense miRNA (miRNA*) sequences, were predicted by computational methods and could be grouped into 808 miRNA families. A significant bias towards family members, family abundance and sequence nucleotides was observed. Thirteen novel miRNA candidates were predicted by alignment with the Brugia malayi genome. Eleven out of 13 predicted miRNA candidates were verified by using a PCR-based method. Target genes of the novel miRNA candidates were predicted by using the heartworm transcriptome dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first report of miRNA profiles in D. immitis, which will contribute to a better understanding of the complex biology of this zoonotic filarial nematode and the molecular regulation roles of miRNA involved. Our findings may also become a useful resource for small RNA studies in other filarial parasitic nematodes.

Hydroxyl radicals were generated by ferrous ion (Fe2+)-mediated decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Fenton reaction). In order to select an optimal (OH)-O-center dot concentration to induce apoptosis, cultures were treated with different concentrations of FeSO4/H2O2 (0 mu M/0 mu M-50 mu M/25 mu M). The results showed that exposure to FeSO4/H2O2 (0 mu M/0 mu M-40 mu M/20 mu M) increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, apoptosis was at its highest level at 40 mu M FeSO4/20 mu M H2O2. We then examined the cytoprotective effects of Gln, Ala, Cit, Pro or the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro under conditions of apoptosis. Carp erythrocytes were treated with the substances listed above in the presence of 40 mu M FeSO4/20 mu M H2O2 for 9 h. The controls were grown in Gln, Ala, Cit, Pro-free culture medium. The results showed that Gln, Ala, Cit, Pro and the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro effectively protected against annexin binding, decrease of forward scatter and DNA fragmentation in carp erythrocytes induced by (OH)-O-center dot. Furthermore, Gln, Ala, Cit, Pro and the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro effectively blocked (OH)-O-center dot-stimulated erythrocyte hemolysis, reduced the increase of superoxide anion and H2O2 concentrations, inhibited the formation of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls and met-hemoglobin, and prevented the decrease of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione content in carp erythrocytes induced by (OH)-O-center dot. In addition, the results suggest that the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro produces a greater anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effect than their individual effects at the same concentrations. Taken together, the results showed that (OH)-O-center dot induces apoptosis and oxidative damage in carp erythrocytes. In addition to inhibiting apoptosis, Gln, Ala, Cit, Pro and the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro protected carp erythrocytes against oxidative damage induced by (OH)-O-center dot, which may be a major factor in the protection of erythrocytes from apoptosis.

Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, wheat-rye 2R and 5R MAALs together with their selfed progeny and parental common wheat were investigated through amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) analyses. The MAALs in different generations displayed different genetic variations. Some progeny that only contained 42 wheat chromosomes showed great genetic/epigenetic alterations. Cryptic rye chromatin has introgressed into the wheat genome. However, one of the progeny that contained cryptic rye chromatin did not display outstanding genetic/epigenetic variation. 78 and 49 sequences were cloned from changed AFLP and MSAP bands, respectively. Blastn search indicated that almost half of them showed no significant similarity to known sequences. Retrotransposons were mainly involved in genetic and epigenetic variations. Genetic variations basically affected Gypsy-like retrotransposons, whereas epigenetic alterations affected Copia-like and Gypsy-like retrotransposons equally. Genetic and epigenetic variations seldom affected low-copy coding DNA sequences. Conclusions/Significance: The results in the present study provided direct evidence to illustrate that monosomic wheat-rye addition lines could induce different and drastic genetic/epigenetic variations and these variations might not be caused by introgression of rye chromatins into wheat. Therefore, MAALs may be directly used as an effective means to broaden the genetic diversity of common wheat.

The open reading frame of this gene was truncated 225 bp at the 5'-end, resulting the N-terminal truncation modification of 75 amino acids for its encoding protein. The TPS1 deletion mutant strain YSH290 of the brewer's yeast transformed by the truncated gene SpTPS1 Delta and its original full-length version restored growth on the medium with glucose as a sole carbon source and displayed growth curves with no significant difference, indicating their encoding proteins functioning as TPS enzyme. The TPS activity of the mutant strain transformed by the truncated gene SpTPS1 Delta was about six fold higher than that transformed by its original version, reasoning that the extra N-terminal extension of the full-length amino acid sequence acts as an inhibitory domain to trehalose synthesis. However, the trehalose accumulation of the mutant strain transformed by the truncated gene SpTPS1 Delta was only 8% higher than that transformed by its original version. This result is explained by the feedback balance of trehalose content coordinated by the comparative activities between trehalose synthase and trehalase. The truncated gene SpTPS1 Delta is suggested to be used in transgenic operation, together with the inhibition of trehalase activity by the application of validamycin A or genetic deficiency of the endogenous trehalase gene, for the enhancement of trehalose accumulation and improvement of abiotic tolerance in transgenic plants.

In the present study, a cDNA encoding mTOR protein was identified from common carp Cyprinus carpio muscle. The open reading frame of this cDNA encodes 2515 deduced amino acid residues that showed high sequence similarity with its zebrafish Danio rerio counterparts. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the protein belongs to the PI-3 kinase family. The putative protein has FAT, FRB, PI3Kc, and FATC domains, which are highly conserved among the vertebrate orthologs. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the abundance of mTOR mRNA was the highest in the heart at 18-31 g and muscle at 31-75 g of common carp. As the common carp grew (18-40 g), the mTOR expression gradually decreased in the hepatopancreas and heart, but increased in the muscle, hind kidney, spleen, gill, head kidney, foregut, midgut, and hindgut Then the mTOR expression kept a constant in all examined tissues during the common carp grew (40-75 g).

It causes severe economic losses in domestic poultry, especially in chickens. At present, there were no effective drugs to treat this disease and the main method to control ND was vaccination. Moreover, new strains of virus resistant to chemotherapy continue to emerge, so does the need for a safe and effective vaccine. The immune adjuvant can make vaccine generate a strong immune response providing long-term protection against infection. With commonly usage of some immune adjuvants (e. g. mineral oil and aluminium hydroxide), many problems were occurred, such as side effects, strong local stimulation and carcinogenesis, together with complicated preparation, or failure to increase immunogenicity of weak antigen and so on. Botanical polysaccharides, as a new type of adjuvant or immunopotentiator, had become the hot research area because of their less side effects and no toxicity. The purpose of this research was to observe whether Chuanminshen violaceum polysaccharide (CVPS) possessed synergistical immunoenhancement, and offer the theoretical evidence for developing potential new-type adjuvant. Materials, Methods & Results: 200 three-yellow chickens at one day of age were randomly divided into four groups and reared in separated pens. On 7 days old, the average maternal serum hemaglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer was less than 3 log2, all chickens of each group (the average body weight (BW) was 120 g) were vaccinated with ND live vaccine through nasal drip and eye-drop. At the same time, the chickens in three CVPS groups (high, medium and low doses of CVPS) were orally administered with 0.5 mL of CVPS at concentrations of 100 mg/kg BW, 50 mg/kg BW, 25 mg/kg BW respectively, once a day for five successive day, in negative control group (NC), with 0.5 mL of physiological saline, once a day for five successive day. On days 14, 21 and 28, the serum antibody titer, erythrocyte-C3b receptor rosette rate (E-C3bRR), erythrocyte-C3b immune complex rosette rate (E-ICRR), peripheral lymphocyte proliferation and peripheral CD4+/CD8+ ratio were measured. The results showed that the antibody titer, E-C3bRR, elimination rate of immune complex and peripheral lymphocyte proliferation in three CVPS groups and peripheral CD4+/CD8+ ratio in medium dosage of CVPS group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in control group throughout the process of whole experiment almost. Discussion: The CVPS not only improved the E-C3bRR and accelerated the elimination rate of CIC, but also induced higher antibody titer, peripheral lymphocyte proliferation and peripheral CD4+/CD8+ ratio in chickens vaccinated against ND live vaccine. This indicated that CVPS possessed immune-enhancement efficacy of ND live vaccine and might be expected as a candidate of new-type adjuvant.

Coexpression of interleukin-6 and-2 from giant panda in Escherichia coli and the biological activity of the fusion protein	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Giant panda; Interleukin-6/interleukin-2; Fusion protein; Prokaryotic expression	AILUROPODA-MELANOLEUCA; EXPRESSION; STRATEGIES; OVEREXPRESSION; ADJUVANTS; CLONING; GENOME; ALPHA; IL-6	To construct a fusion cytokine protein with more and stronger bioactivities to enhance the immunity of the cytokine alone, we expressed interleukin (IL)-6/(IL)-2 from giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in Escherichia coli as a 59.4-kDa fusion protein. Subsequently, the inclusion bodies were solubilized with 8 M urea and applied onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The final production of IL-6/IL-2 reached 6 mg/L in soluble form, and the purified final product was >96% pure. In Western blot assays, the recombinant IL-6/IL-2 was recognized by polyclonal antibodies against IL-6 and IL-2 of giant panda. The results demonstrated that the protein mixture contained correctly folded IL-2 and IL-6 proteins. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay demonstrated that IL-6/IL-2 can promote lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. These data suggest that the fusion protein could be used to develop a novel immunoadjuvant to enhance the immunity of animals against infectious diseases.

Mitotic and meiotic behavior of rye chromosomes in wheat - Psathyrostachys huashanica amphiploid x triticale progeny	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Wheat; Rye; Meiosis; Mitosis; Chromosome behavior; Genomic in situ hybridization	BARLEY HYBRIDS; PROGRESSIVE HETEROCHROMATINIZATION; MICRONUCLEUS FORMATION; CENTRIC MISDIVISION; POLLEN FORMATION; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; SPECIES HYBRIDS; PEARL-MILLET; ELIMINATION; RESTITUTION	The dynamics of rye chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis was analyzed in a subset comprising 33 F-3 lines from the cross of wheat, Psathyrostachys huashanica amphiploid (AABBDDNsNs) and hexaploid triticale (AABBRR), as visualized by genomic in situ hybridization. The results indicated that 31 of the total lines contained 4-14 rye chromosomes. Twenty-eight combinations had more rye chromosomes than the F-1 hybrids, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous quantitative increment. No P. huashanica chromosomes were detected in all of the combinations tested. Mitotic analysis showed that rye chromosomes progressed normally with the wheat counterparts without loss. However, abnormal meiosis was found in almost all lines. Similar progression between wheat and rye genomes appeared from interphase to metaphase I. It was at anaphase I that many rye univalents lagged behind those of wheat, followed by equational division. This resulted in the formation of chromosomal segments and micronuclei at telophase I or II. Micronuclei could also be generated from the immobilized univalents in the periphery of cells. Synapsis and translocations between wheat and rye genomes, chromosome bridges, and unreduced gametes were detected. Therefore, it is proposed that rye chromosome elimination may involve chromatid lagging, fragmentation and micronucleation, or the immobilization of certain univalents during meiosis instead of mitosis in the relatively advanced generations. This mechanism, together with spontaneous incremental increase of rye chromosome number, permitted the generation of various germplasms for wheat improvement.	[Xie, Q.; Kang, H.; Tao, S.; Fan, X.

Genetic relationships between Lolium (Poaceae) species revealed by RAPD markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Lolium; RAPD markers; Taxonomy; Genetic relationship; Polymorphism	GENUS LOLIUM; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; MULTIFLORUM LAM; FESTUCA; POPULATIONS; DIVERSITY; RYEGRASS; COMPLEX	The genus Lolium is one of the most important groupings of temperate forage grasses, including about eight recognized species that are native to some temperate and subtropical regions of the northern hemisphere. We examined genetic relationships among 18 accessions representing all Lolium species using RAPD markers. Among 50 random primers that we screened, 13 gave reproducible amplification banding patterns. Each of these 13 primers generated 1943 scorable fragments. A total of 367 RAPD fragments were detected, of which 95.9% were polymorphic across all the Lolium accessions. Dice's coefficient of dissimilarity ranged from 0.016 to 0.622, which is indicative of substantial genetic variations in these Lolium accessions. A neighbor-joining cluster analysis, with bootstrap permutation, produced an unrooted dendrogram, which grouped 18 accessions into two main clades, supporting high bootstrap values (98 and 96%). The first clade included the self-pollinated species, L. persicum, L. temulentum, L. remotum, and L. subulatum. The cross-pollinated species, i.e., L. multiflorum, L. perenne, L. rigidum, and L. canariense, composed the second clade, in which L. canariense formed a distinct subclade, indicating its higher genetic separation from other allogamous species. The value of r = 0.97 in the Mantel test for cophenetic correlation applied to the cluster analysis indicated the high degree of fit of the accessions to a group. A principal coordinate analysis, whose first three coordinates explained 72.6% of the variation, showed similar groupings as in the cluster analysis. The genetic relationships estimated by the polymorphism of RAPD markers are basically in agreement with those previously inferred with other genetic markers.

The longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle contains more type IIB fibers (75.10%) than does the psoas major (PM) muscle (41.58%), while the PM has more type I (3.65 vs 0.94%), type IIA (34.15 vs 10.63%), and type IIX (20.62 vs 13.33%) fibers. Compared with PM, glycolytic potential (GP), pH(45) (min), and Delta pH from 45 min to 24 h post-mortem were all relatively higher in LD. Glycogen metabolites (lactate and GP) were negatively correlated with pH(24) (h) and positively correlated with Delta pH. Expression of GYG was generally higher in LD. GYG expression was positively correlated with glycogen metabolite (lactate and GP) content and Delta pH, and was negatively correlated with pH(24 h). These data confirm that the muscle-fiber type and GP have significant effects on ultimate pH and pH decline, and suggest that expression of GYG in muscles is related to the metabolism of glycogen and may impact GP, Delta pH, and ultimate pH. High expression of GYG was associated with a high glycogen content, large pH decline, and low ultimate pH in muscles post-mortem.

The goat MRLC2 gene was differentially expressed in the crossbreed, and the purebred mRNA were isolated and identified using fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The complete coding sequence of MRLC2 was obtained using the cDNA method, and the full-length coding sequence consisted of 513 bp encoding 172 amino acids. The EF-hand superfamily domain of the MRLC2 protein is well conserved in caprine and other animals. The deduced amino acid sequence of MRLC2 shared significant identity with MRLC2 from other mammals. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the MRLC2 protein was closely related to MRLC2 in other mammals. Several predicted miRNA target sites were found in the coding sequence of caprine MRLC2 mRNA. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that MRLC2 mRNA was present in the heart, stomach, liver, spleen, lung, small intestine, kidney, leg muscle, abdominal muscle, and longissimus dorsi muscles. In particular, the high expression of MRLC2 mRNA was detected in the longissimus dorsi, leg muscle, abdominal muscle, stomach, and heart, but low levels of expression were also observed in the liver, spleen, lung, small intestine, and kidney. The expression of the MRLC2 gene was upregulated in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Boer and Tianfu goats, and it was moderately upregulated in Chengdu Ma goats.	[Xu, H. G.; Xu, G.

Engelm.] plants can be either male, female, or hermaphrodite (monoecious). As there is no morphological difference in the early vegetative growth of these three classes of plants, it is worthwhile to use molecular biological methods to attempt to identify the sex of a plant at this early growth period. In this study, we identified 23 plants that had a stable sex for over at least 3 years. Of these, 9 were male plants, 10 were female plants, and 4 were hermaphrodites. Screening of 300 RAPD primers identified a primer, namely S211 (5'-ttccccgcga-3'), which is capable of identifying male plants. The specific fragment was cloned, sequenced, and submitted to the GenBank database (accession No. JN982469). When used to identify the sex of 188 plants during their first growing season, the S211 primer correctly identified 85.8% of all male plants. Our results showed that the S211 primer can identify the male, and in doing so, it facilitates buffalo grass breeding work.	[Li, Y. X.; Wang, X. G.; Wu, F. F.; Xue, J.

Expression profile of insulin-like growth factor system genes in muscle tissues during the postnatal development growth stage in ducks	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Insulin-like growth factors; Muscle tissue; Expression pattern	ARBOR ACRES CHICKENS; FACTOR-I; IGF-II; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS; SOMATOTROPIC AXIS; BINDING-PROTEINS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; RECEPTOR; WEIGHT; BRAIN	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are regulators that modulate the proliferation and differentiation of muscle tissues. We quantified the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, and type I and II IGF receptors (IGF-IR and IGF-IIR) in muscle tissues including the breast, leg, and myocardium during an early postnatal development growth stage (post-hatching weeks 1-8) in ducks. The results showed a significant age-related change in mRNA in these muscle tissues. In breast muscle, the developmental expression of IGF-I and IGF-II was highest during week 1 but decreased quickly and maintained a relatively lower level. Leg muscle had the highest mRNA expression of IGF-I and IGF-II genes at week 3. In myocardial tissues, the expression level of IGF-IR and IGF-IIR genes exhibited a "rise-decline" developmental trend. The expression patterns of IGF-I/IGF-IR and IGF-II/IGF-IIR were different between weeks 4 and 6. The same expression pattern was observed for IGF-I and IGF-IR; however, it was different from that observed for IGF-II and IGF-IIR. Our results showed a negative correlation between IGF-II mRNA expression and leg muscle weight at week 4 (P < 0.05). A negative correlation was also found between IGF-II mRNA expression and breast muscle weight (P < 0.01), and a positive correlation was found between IGF-IR expression and breast muscle weight. At week 6, a positive correlation was found between IGF-IR expression and breast muscle weight. However, at week 8, a negative correlation was found between IGF-IR expression and breast muscle weight. The results showed that the expression of IGF mRNA in duck tissues exhibits a specific developmental trend and an age-related pattern, suggesting that the regulation mechanism of these 4 genes in proliferation and differentiation of muscle tissues differed.

Identification of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) cultivars by using simple sequence repeat markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Dactylis glomerata L.; Orchardgrass cultivar; DNA fingerprinting; Simple sequence repeats; Discriminatory power	PORPHYRA LINES RHODOPHYTA; LOLIUM-PERENNE L.; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SSR MARKERS; MOLECULAR MARKERS; SRAP MARKERS; DNA; POPULATIONS; TRANSFERABILITY; RESOURCES	The accurate identification of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) cultivars is necessary to ensure purity for consumers, the effective utilization of cultivars, and to protect the intellectual property for breeders. Therefore, this study aimed to use SSR to construct DNA fingerprinting of orchardgrass cultivars. The genetic diversity of 32 orchardgrass cultivars originated from 21 countries, but grown in China, was assessed using a set of 29 SSR markers distributed across 9 linkage groups of the orchardgrass genome. A total of 229 bands were detected, with an average of 7.9 bands per marker. The average polymorphic rate for the species was 92.1%. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.771 to 0.893. The genetic similarity ranged from 0.55 to 0.84, which confirmed a high level of genetic diversity among orchardgrass cultivars. The unweighted pair-group method, in combination with the arithmetic mean algorithm (UPGMA) dendrogram and principal coordinate analysis, showed a separation of 6 major clusters among 32 cultivars. The number of distinguishable cultivars ranged from 3 to 23, with an average of 12.1 per primer. Moreover, 11 bands that showed stable and repeatable SSR patterns were amplified by A01E14, A01K14, and D02K13. These bands were used to develop the DNA fingerprints for 32 orchardgrass cultivars. In the DNA fingerprints constructed, each cultivar had a unique fingerprinting pattern that was easily distinguished from the others. These results indicate that the SSR marker was polymorphic, and reliable for use in potential large-scale DNA fingerprinting of orchardgrass cultivars.

TaALMT1 promoter sequence compositions, acid tolerance, and Al tolerance in wheat cultivars and landraces from Sichuan in China	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Sichuan-bred wheat cultivars and landraces; Aluminum tolerance; Acid tolerance; TaALMT1 promoter	TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER; ALUMINUM-TOLERANCE; ALMT1 GENE; LOW PH; RESISTANCE; SOILS; MECHANISMS; TOXICITY; ATLAS-66	Previous genetic studies on wheat from various sources have indicated that aluminum (Al) tolerance may have originated independently in USA, Brazil, and China. Here, TaALMT1 promoter sequences of 92 landraces and cultivars from Sichuan, China, were sequenced. Five promoter types (I', II, III, IV, and V) were observed in 39 cultivars, and only three promoter types (I, II, and III) were observed in 53 landraces. Among the wheat collections worldwide, only the Chinese Spring (CS) landrace native to Sichuan, China, carried the TaALMT1 promoter type III. Besides CS, two other Sichuan-bred landraces and six cultivars with TaALMT1 promoter type III were identified in this study. In the phylogenetic tree constructed based on the TaALMT1 promoter sequences, type III formed a separate branch, which was supported by a high bootstrap value. It is likely that TaALMT1 promoter type III originated from Sichuan-bred wheat landraces of China. In addition, the landraces with promoter type I showed the lowest Al tolerance among all landraces and cultivars. Furthermore, the cultivars with promoter type IV showed better Al tolerance than landraces with promoter type II. A comparison of acid tolerance and Al tolerance between cultivars and landraces showed that the landraces had better acid tolerance than the cultivars, whereas the cultivars showed better Al tolerance than the landraces. Moreover, significant difference in Al tolerance was also observed between the cultivars raised by the National Ministry of Agriculture and by Sichuan Province. Among the landraces from different regions, those from the East showed better acid tolerance and Al tolerance than those from the South and West of Sichuan. Additional Al-tolerant and acid-tolerant wheat lines were also identified.	[Han, C.; Dai, S. F.; Liu, D. C.; Wei, Y. M.; Zheng, Y. L.; Wen, D. J.; Zhao, L.; Yan, Z.

Genetic diversity and relationships among accessions of five crested wheatgrass species (Poaceae: Agropyron) based on gliadin analysis	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Agropyron Gaertn.; Genetic diversity; Gliadin; Phylogenetic relationship	TRIBE TRITICEAE; CHINA	Agropyron Gaertn. is the most important genus in Triticeae (Poaceae), which includes many forage grasses with high economic value. The genetic diversity and relationships of 36 accessions from five crested wheatgrass species were analyzed by gliadin markers. A total of 54 product bands were detected after acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), of which 100% were polymorphic. The genetic similarity coefficient based on Nei-Li's method ranged from 0.065 to 0.755 with an average of 0.451. The Shannon diversity information index showed that there was a high level of genetic diversity among the accessions. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) dendrogram was constructed based on the Nei-Li's genetic similarity coefficients, which showed the phylogenetic relationships among accessions of different species. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the proportion of variance explained by inter- and intraspecific variance was 9.34 and 90.66%, respectively, which revealed that the genetic variations within species were higher than the variations among species. Based on pairwise genetic distances (Phi(ST)) among species, the cluster analysis indicated that A. mongolicum had a low-affinity relationship with other species, while A. fragile showed a close relationship with A. cristatum ssp pectinatum. Finally, the implications of the results for the taxonomy of Agropyron were discussed.	[Chen, S. Y.; Ma, X.; Zhang, X. Q.; Huang, L. K.; Zhou, J.

In this study, three kinds of chitosan with different DD were prepared. By means of living imaging technique and fluorescent quantitative technique, the influences of different DD on the distribution of chitosan in vivo were investigated. The results showed that chitosan with molecular weight between 20,000 and 26,000 mainly distributed in kidney after intravenous injection. The influences of DD on the distribution of chitosan in kidney was obvious. The renal distribution of chitosan with 38, 51, and 61% DD achieved the maximum concentration in 60, 30, and 60 min, respectively. The concentration of chitosan with 51% DD was much higher than that of chitosan with 38% and 61% DD, which suggested that the chitosan with 51% DD might obtain better kidney targeting capacities and be considered as a better kidney targeting drug delivery carrier.

V. Administration of Liposomal and Injectable Formulations	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACY			English	Article						Cefquinome sulfate; Liposome; Lung targeting; Pharmacokinetics; Tissue distribution.	ANTIBIOTICS; EXTRACTS; SIZE; MILK	A novel cefquinome sulfate liposome ( CSL) was prepared by a solid dispersion and effervescent techniques. A simple and sensitive HPLC method was established and validated for the determination of cefquinome sulfate (CS) in rat plasma and tissue samples. The analysis method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies of CSL and CS injection solution (CS-S) after i.v. administration to the rats. Following administration, CSL showed significant improvement of t1/2 beta, and MRT (0-infinity) (P < 0.01) compared with those of CS-S. And The t1/2 beta, AUC(0)-infinity and MRT( 0-(infinity)) markedly increased by about 2.30-fold, 1.76-fold and 2.15-fold, respectively. The drug concentration in all tissues decreased with respect to CS-S, except in the lung and liver. A max drug level of 14.81 +/- 2.16 mu g/ mL was gained at 0.5 h after i. v. administration and also decreased much slower, result in a longer action time. All these results demonstrated that CS making into liposome formulation had palpable characteristics of sustained-release, as a result of prolonging the duration of drug concentration, reducing drug given bits and enhancing therapeutic efficiency. To further evaluate the targeting property of liposomal CS, we investigated RE, TE and Ce of the two formulations. It can be found that RE, TE and Ce for CSL in lung were 8.86, 2.61, and 1.61, respectively, which were the highest among other tissues, indicating a special scattering in lung.

A solution-stiring mwthod was selected to prepare the trimethoprim- hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (TMP-HP-beta-CD). Complex fromation was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC). UV-spectrophotometry and phase-solubility techniques were employed to investigate the complexation behaviour uin liquid medium. Moreover, a histopathology study was performed to determine whether muscle tissue damage was caused by repeated doses. The results showed solubility of TMP was increased up to 26 times by complexation with HP-beta-CD compared with the unprocessed TMP. Dissolution rate of TMP was notably inmproved from complex with more than 90% released within 60 min. There was no visible sign of inflammation or hyperemia in muscle tissues after repetitive injection. It is evident from the results herein that complexation with HP-beta-CD is a feasible way to prepare a rapidly dissolved and better absorbed TMP oral product.

Lead (Pb2+) concentrations of 100 and 200 mu M in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium were used. The fresh weights of cotyledons were not affected by Pb treatments; however, the dry weights decreased significantly, while the relative water contents increased as compared to the control. The nitrate, nitrite and ammonium levels also decreased significantly at three developmental stages compared to the control. Nitrate- and nitrite- reductase activities in the treated plants showed significant decline at days 2,4 and 6. The Pb treatment led to a marked increase in glutamine synthetase activity except during the exposure to 200 mu M Pb2+ at day 2. Glutamate synthase activity was also considerably enhanced by Pb application. The NADH-GDH and NAD-GDH activities were raised at the three developmental stages after 100 and 200 mu M Pb treatments. The alanine- and aspartate- aminotransferase activities were increased after the 100 and 200 mu M Pb treatments. The results showed that Pb stress may cause the changes in nitrogen metabolism and relative enzymes during the developmental stages of, J curcas cotyledons.

The total prevalence of PToV was 45% (9 out of 20 farms); it was the first detection of PToV in China, and also the study analyzed the phylogenetic relationships between the Chinese PToV and PToV reference strains as well as other representative toroviruses. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of genetic diversity among geographically separated PToV. Statistical analysis of the PToV positive rate as well as a survey for other enteric pathogens in diarrheic pigs suggests that PToV may play a role as a causative agent of severe diarrhea in piglets.

The results showed that bamboo branches had the highest Klason lignin and ash content, about 26% and 2.75%, respectively. The epidermis layer sample had relatively higher carbohydrate content, while the wax layer sample had the highest hot water and ethanol-toluene extractives and starch content. The results indicated that the bamboo processing residues showed potential for different chemical feedstocks. No significant differences were found in the infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the different samples, indicating that the chemical functional groups were the same, despite variation in chemical components between samples. Klason lignin isolated from the residues showed a higher maximum degradation rate temperature (501 degrees C) and wider degradation temperature range (200 to 550 degrees C) than the carbohydrates.

However, investigation on the relationship among beta-glucan, gut microbiota and immune-modulating effects remains limited particularly in pigs. Considering the critical roles of gut methanogens in the microbial fermentation, energy metabolism and disease resistance, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of methanogens from fermented cultures of porcine colonic digesta with (G) or without (N) yeast beta-glucan based on sequences of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene. A total of 145 sequences in the G library were assigned into 8 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the majority of sequences (114/145) related to strains Methanobrevibacter millerae or Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii with high identities ranging from 97.9 to 98.6%, followed by 23 sequences to Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, 2 sequences to Methanobrevibacter smithii and one sequence to Methanobrevibacter wolinii. The 142 sequences in the N library were assigned to 2 OTUs with most sequences (127/142) related to strains M millerae or M gottschalkii with sequence identities ranging from 97.9 to 98.5%, and 15 sequences related to M gottschalkii with 97.9% identity. Shannon diversity index showed that the G library exhibited significantly higher archaeal diversity (P<0.05) and Libshuff analysis indicated the differences in the community structure between the two libraries were significant (P<0.0001). In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that addition of yeast beta-glucan significantly increased the diversity of methanogens in in vitro fermented porcine colonic digesta.

Cordyceps sinensis), is highly valued in China as a dietary supplement or tonic food and natural remedy. The combination of the fungus and dead insect has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, and evidence shows its efficacy on immunomodulatory potentials. The price of O. sinensis has continued to increase over the last few years due to growing worldwide demand, driving research to determine methods of artificial cultivation to make O. sinensis a more affordable material for commercial trade. This study highlights many aspects of artificial cultivation of O. sinensis, including separation of the anamorph, culture of the mycelium, cultivation of the fruiting bodies, bioecological characteristics of the host insect, and two patterns of artificial cultivation. In addition, this review discusses the current state, limitations, remedies, and future prospects, aiming to draw researchers' attention to the new frontier of research needs in this context.

In this study, a simple, fast, and efficient method based on a UPLC-TOF-MS system without any clean-up steps was developed for DON detection in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2). The established method was then validated by the determination of its sensitivity, linearity, recovery, precision and stability. The limits of detection for extracellular and intracellular matrices were 25 ng ml(-1) while limits of quantitation for both matrices were 50 ng ml(-1), respectively. The recoveries of both matrices were acceptable and the stability of the method was acceptable. Within the detection range, the intra-and inter-day RSDs were less than 12%. Finally, the kinetics of DON in both cell pellets and media were measured using the established method, which showed that DON could be taken up by Hep G2 cells quickly but did not accumulate in the cells. This method could be applied for the fast detection of DON in the human cell matrix, facilitating better understanding of the metabolism of DON in vitro, which, in turn, would benefit the monitoring of DON exposure to humans and animals.

It is the first time that 4-(carboxymethoxy) isophthalic acid is employed in producing lanthanide compounds. The seven compounds exhibit two types of structures with the decreasing radius of the lanthanide ions, representing the lanthanide contraction effect. Compound 1 with the large Pr3+ ion displays a 2D layered structure with a binodal (4,4)-connected topology with the Schl fli symbol of (3(3)6(3))(2), whereas compounds 2-7 with small Ln(3+) ions feature a 3D framework constructed from carboxyl groups with a (5,6,8)-connected topology with the Schl fli symbol of (3(2)4(4)5(4))center dot(3(4)4(4)5(4)6(3))center dot(3(4)4(8)5(6)6(9)8). The luminescence and magnetic properties were investigated, and the results indicate that the H3L ligand can sensitize the lanthanide luminescence in compounds 2, 4 and 5 and makes a contribution to the antiferromagnetic interactions in compound 3 or the uncertain magnetic interactions in compounds 4-7. Additionally, the thermal analyses suggest the high thermal stability of compounds 1-7.

The release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) into culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. Furthermore, blocking experiments with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 antibodies were performed to verify whether cytokine secretion depended on LPS-induced activation of TLR2 or TLR4. The results revealed that LPS-stimulated mouse MECs significantly secreted TNF-alpha and IL-8. Blocking of the TLR4 pathway inhibited the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-8, while inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-8 production was not observed when TLR2 was blocked. Thus, TLR4 can mediate the LPS-induced expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-8 in mouse MECs.

A new model is multiple nonlinear equation systems by comprehensive consideration of axial load of tubular string, internal and external fluid pressure, normal pressure between the tubular and well wall, and friction and viscous friction of fluid flowing. The varied temperature and pressure fields were researched by the coupled differential equations concerning mass, momentum, and energy equations instead of traditional methods. The axial load, the normal pressure, the friction, and four deformation lengths of tubular string are got ten by means of the dimensionless iterative interpolation algorithm.

J	Wan, XQ; Zhang, F				Wan, XueQin; Zhang, Fan			An overview of Populus genetic resources in southwest China	FORESTRY CHRONICLE			English	Article						native poplar; genetic resources; southwest region; China	COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; MARKERS	There are abundant genetic resources of Populus in southwest China, which play an important role in scientific research and practical application. These resources are unfamiliar to the rest of the world and their value has not been widely appreciated; hence the purpose of this paper is to present the resources to the world, and to encourage more attention to be paid to them. There are 28 species, 20 varieties, and about 10 natural hybrids of Populus in the region. Of the 28 species, 25 are endemic to China, and 18 of them are indigenous to southwest China. So the region is regarded as one of the natural distribution and variation centres for Populus in China. The species fall into three floristic types: China-Japan, China-Himalayas, and ancient tropical; and show an obvious zonation in horizontal and vertical distribution with excellent adaptability to a wide range of environments. At present, only a few species are generally recognized, and to some extent grown and utilized, while most of them are still in natural conditions but face severe threat. It is therefore urgent to recognize, conserve and utilize these significant poplar resources.

Apart from the principal transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation mediated by microRNAs appears to be the prevalent response of plants to abiotic stress. In this study, the differential expression of microRNAs in the previously evaluated drought-tolerant inbred lines R09 under drought stress was detected by microarray hybridization. The target genes of the differentially-expressed microRNAs were predicted by bioinformatics software WMD3 for plant target gene prediction. The possible regulation of the differentially-expressed microRNAs as well as their target genes in maize response to drought stress was analysed according to Gene Ontology. Sixty-eight microRNAs in 29 microRNA families were detected to be differentially expressed in the seedling of the drought-tolerant inbred line R09, accounting for 5.97% of the total number of the probes. The expression profiles were different between the two time points of the drought stress. The functions of the genes targeted by the differentially-expressed microRNAs involve multiple physiological and biochemical pathways of response to abiotic stress, such as transcription regulation, metabolism, signal transduction, hormone stimulation, and transmembrane transport. Under drought stress, the differential expression of microRNAs regulates the expression of their target genes, resulting in multiple responses of physiological and biochemical pathways relative to drought tolerance of maize. miR156, miR159 and miR319 families may play more important roles. The different members of the same family may play similar regulation effects in most cases.

The landrace population showed the characters of higher tiller capability and more kernels/spike, especially tiller no./plant of six accessions was over 40 and kernels/spike of three accessions was more than 70. A total of 547 alleles in 124 polymorphic loci were detected with an average of 4.76 alleles per locus by 114 SSR markers. Parameters analysis indicated that the genetic diversity ranked as genome A > genome B > genome D, and the homoeologous groups ranked as 5>4>3>1>2>7>6 based on genetic richness (Ri). Furthermore, chromosomes 2A, 1B and 3D had more diversity than that of chromosomes 4A, 7A and 6B. The variation of SSR loci on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2D, 3B, and 4B implied that, in the past, different selective pressures might have acted on different chromosome regions of these landraces. Our results suggested that Sichuan common wheat landraces is a useful genetic resource for genetic research and wheat improvement.

Genetic effects of polymorphisms in the prolactin receptor gene on chicken reproductive traits	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article							JAK2 PHOSPHORYLATION; EGG-PRODUCTION; ASSOCIATION; GROWTH; HORMONE; GENOME; HENS; AGE	Prolactin receptor (PRLR) is a single transmembrane protein through which prolactin plays a wide variety of physiological roles in vertebrates. Markers of alleles for the PRLR gene were assessed for the association with six reproductive traits (bodyweight at first egg; egg weight at first egg; age at first egg; number of eggs at 300 days of age; bodyweight at 300 days of age; and egg weight at 300 days of age) in a single generation of the Erlang Mountain Chicken. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the PRLR gene by sequencing pooled DNA samples. Genotypes were identified using PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism and direct PCR-sequencing methods. The GLM procedure was used to estimate the association between genotypes and reproductive traits. The results showed that at the P1 locus, individuals with genotype TT had shorter age at first egg and greater number of eggs at 300 days of age than those with genotype CC (P < 0.01). Our findings suggest that the single-nucleotide polymorphism g.-14A > G at P1 locus could be a potential genetic marker for age at first egg and number of eggs at 300 days of age in the Erlang Mountain Chicken and haplotype ATGTT might be advantageous for reproductive traits.

In the LAGA, limited solution strategy, with the feasible solution generation method for generating an initial population and the limited perturbation mutation operator, is presented to avoid hydro units operating in cavitation-vibration regions. The adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation are introduced to improve the convergence speed of the genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, the performance of the limited solution strategy and the adaptive parameter controlling improvement are checked against the historical methods, and the results of simulating inner-plant economical operation of the Three Gorges hydropower station demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. First, the limited solution strategy can support the safety operations of hydro units by avoiding cavitation-vibration region operations, and it achieves a better solution, because the non-negative fitness function is achieved. Second, the adaptive parameter method is shown to have better performance than other methods, because it realizes the twin goals of maintaining diversity in the population and advancing the convergence speed of GA. Thus, the LAGA is feasible and effective in optimizing inner-plant economical operation of hydropower stations.

To investigate the relationship between the responsive genes during FV infection and QTL chromosome regions for resistance to ear rot in maize, the differentially expressed genes and resistant QTL were co-localized on the reference map IBM2 neighbors 2008 (Intermated B73xMo17 Map) in the maize chromosome regions. One hand, gene expression changes was investigated through suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and Genechip experiments in resistant inbred line Bt-1, which derived from the tropical germplasm with high resistance to Fussrium ear rot in southwest China. On the other hand, 117 initial QTLs associating with resistance to Fusarium ear rot from early documents were collected to project meta-QTL on the high-density genetic linkage map IBM2. In total, 312 single-copy FV-induced sequences were obtained from the above two methods in Bt-1 and 29 meta-QTLs for ear rot resistance were projecteded in IBM2 map for distributing on chromosomes 1 to 8. Finally, the co-localization analysis results showed that 35 FV-induced sequences were located in the meta-QTL regions, while most other sequences were closed with the meta-QTLs. This phenomenon indicates that the correlation between FV-induced genes and ear rot resistance was connected together closely by their comparing localization. The co-localization analysis also indicated that FV-induced sequences were clustered on the same chromosome regions, particularly on bins 3.06, 3.04 and 6.02. These regions of interest on chromosomes were recommended to use for improving ear rot resistance in a marker assisted selection (MAS) program.

To better understand the development on genetic mechanisms and physiological processes in this ornamental plant, gametophyte of male and female and breeding types were deeply observed using routine paraffin sections. Experimental results showed that the development of male gametophytes was normal in Ardisia mamillata Hance. Furthermore, the microspore archesporial cell stage, sporogenous cell stage, pollen mother cell stage, tetrad stage and mature pollen grain stage were clearly observed. Moreover, the anther wall was distinctly indicated three layers, including the fiber layer, middle layer and tapetum layer, to be specific, the tapetum layer is a relatively typical secretory tapetum, which will disappear when pollen matures. Meanwhile, a total of 3-6 hemitropous ovules were contained in the first ovarian room and egg apparatus and polar nuclei can be observed in mature blastocyst. Finally, the breeding system of Ardisia mamillata Hance is facultative outcrossing-type. Overall, these findings were inferred to demonstrate physiological functions and provide theoretical basis for future genetic investigation in Ardisia mamillata Hance.
