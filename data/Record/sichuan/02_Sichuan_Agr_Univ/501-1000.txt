Here we report for the first time the complete genome of Y. ruckeri (Yersinia ruckeri) SC09, a highly virulent strain isolated from Ictalurus punctatus with severe septicemia. SC09 possesses a single chromosome of 3,923,491 base pairs, which contains 3651 predicted protein coding sequences (CDS), 19 rRNA genes, and 79 tRNA genes. Among the CDS, we have identified a Ysa locus containing genes encoding all the components of a type III secretion system (T3SS). Comparative analysis suggest that SC09-Ysa share extensive similarity in sequence, gene content, and gene arrangement with Salmonella enterica pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) and chromosome-encoded T3SS from Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1B. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis shown that SC09-Ysa and SPI1-T3SS belong on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree. These results suggest that SC09-Ysa and SPI1-T3SS appear to mediate biological function to adapt to specific hosts with a similar niche, and both of them are likely to facilitate the development of an intracellular niche. In addition, our analysis also indicated that a substantial part of the SC09 genome might contribute to adaption in the intestinal microenvironment, including a number of proteins associated with aerobic or anaerobic respiration, signal transduction, and various stress reactions. Genomic analysis of the bacterium offered insights into the pathogenic mechanism associated with intracellular infection and intestinal survivability, which constitutes an important first step in understanding the pathogenesis of Y. ruckeri.

Although the rice-M. oryzae interaction has been studied extensively, the early molecular events that occur in rice before full maturation of the appressorium during M. oryzae invasion are unknown. Here, we report a comparative transcriptomics analysis of the durably resistant rice variety Digu and the susceptible rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) in response to infection by M. oryzae (5, 10 and 20 h post-inoculation, prior to full development of the appressorium). We found that the transcriptional responses differed significantly between these two rice varieties. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed that many biological processes, including extracellular recognition and biosynthesis of antioxidants, terpenes and hormones, were specifically activated in Digu shortly after infection. Forty-eight genes encoding receptor kinases (RKs) were significantly differentially regulated by M. oryzae infection in Digu. One of these genes, LOC_Os08g10300, encoding a leucine-rich repeat RK from the LRR VIII-2 subfamily, conferred enhanced resistance to M. oryzae when overexpressed in rice. Our study reveals that a multitude of molecular events occur in the durably resistant rice Digu before the full maturation of the appressorium after M. oryzae infection and that membrane-associated RKs play important roles in the early response.

Two types of food waste-based feed pellets FW A (with cereals) and FW B (with cereals and meat products) and the commercial feed JinfengA (R) were used to culture fingerlings of three low-trophic-level fish species: bighead carp, grass carp, and mud carp (in the ratio of 1:3:1) for 1 year period in the Sha Tau Kok Organic Farm in Hong Kong. Heavy metal concentrations in all of the fish species fed with food waste pellets and commercial pellets in Sha Tau Kok fish ponds were all below the local and international maximum permissible levels in food. Health risk assessments indicated that human consumption of the fish fed with food waste feed pellets was safe for the Hong Kong residents. The present results revealed that recycling of food waste for cultivating low-trophic-level fish (mainly herbivores and detritus feeders) is feasible, and at the same time will ease the disposal pressure of food waste, a common problem of densely populated cities like Hong Kong.

The results indicated that grass carp fed with food waste feeds and mix feeds achieved growth performance (based on specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio) that was similar to commercial feeds (p > 0.05). Concentrations of metalloid/metals in food waste feeds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Napier grass were relatively higher than other types of fish feeds (p < 0.05). However, most of the metalloid/metals and PAH levels in fish fed with four types of fish feeds were not significantly different (p > 0.05). These findings show that food waste feeds are suitable for using in the production of fish feed and Napier grass can be served as supplemental feeds for grass carp, and hence reducing the production cost.

The numbers, weights, clitellum development, and cocoon production were monitored for 60 days at a detecting interval of 15 days. The results indicated that 100 % of the sludge can be the suitable food for growth and fecundity of E. fetida, while addition of CD or SM in sludge significantly (P < 0.05) increased the worm biomass and reproduction. The sludge amended with 40 % SM can be a great medium for the growth of E. fetida, and the sludge amended with 40 % CD can be a suitable medium for the fecundity of E. fetida. The addition of CD in sludge provided a better environment for the fecundity of earthworm than SM did. Moreover, vermicomposts obtained in the study had lower pH value, lower total organic carbon (TOC), lower NH4 (+)-N, lower C/N ratio, higher total available phosphorous (TAP) contents, optimal stability, and maturity. NH4 (+)-N, pH and TAP of the initial mixtures explained high earthworm growth. The results provided the theory basic both for management of animal wastes and the production of earthworm proteins using E. fetida.

Splenic lymphocytes isolated from chickens were stimulated with 12.5 mu g/mL Con A and exposed to deoxynivalenol (DON) (0-50 mu g/mL) for 48 h. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), pH, calmodulin (CaM) mRNA levels, and Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase activities were detected. With the DON exposure concentrations increased, the [Ca2+]i and CaM mRNA levels gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner, and all the evaluated conconcentrations affected ATPase activity to the same extent. There were significant differences (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) between the treatment groups and the control group. These results indicate that an imbalance in calcium homeostasis and intracellular acidification are components of DON cytotoxicity in chicken lymphocytes. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

We identified functional centromeres with significant quantitative changes in the centromeric retrotransposons of wheat (CRW) contents in wheat aneuploids (Triticum aestivum) and the offspring of wheat wide hybrids. The CRW signals were strongly reduced or essentially lost in some wheat ditelosomic lines and in the addition lines from the wide hybrids. The total loss of the CRW sequences but the presence of CENH3 in these lines suggests that the centromeres were formed de novo. In wheat and its wide hybrids, which carry large complex genomes or no sequenced genome, we performed CENH3-ChIP-dot-blot methods alone or in combination with CENH3-ChIP-seq and identified the ectopic genomic sequences present at the new centromeres. In adcdition, the transcription of the identified DNA sequences was remarkably increased at the new centromere, suggesting that the transcription of the corresponding sequences may be associated with de novo centromere formation. Stable alien chromosomes with two and three regions containing CRW sequences induced by centromere breakage were observed in the wheat-Th. elongatum hybrid derivatives, but only one was a functional centromere. In wheat-rye (Secale cereale) hybrids, the rye centromere-specific sequences spread along the chromosome arms and may have caused centromere expansion. Frequent and significant quantitative alterations in the centromere sequence via chromosomal rearrangement have been systematically described in wheat wide hybridizations, which may affect the retention or loss of the alien chromosomes in the hybrids. Thus, the centromere behavior in wide crosses likely has an important impact on the generation of biodiversity, which ultimately has implications for speciation.

Upon detection of pathogen invasion by immune receptors, the immune system is turned on, resulting in production of antimicrobial molecules including pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. Conceivably, an efficient immune response depends on the capacity of the plant cell's protein/membrane trafficking network to deploy the right defense-associated molecules in the right place at the right time. Recent research in this area shows that while the abundance of cell surface immune receptors is regulated by endocytosis, many intracellular immune receptors, when activated, are partitioned between the cytoplasm and the nucleus for induction of defense genes and activation of programmed cell death, respectively. Vesicle transport is an essential process for secretion of PR proteins to the apoplastic space and targeting of defense-related proteins to the plasma membrane or other endomembrane compartments. In this review, we discuss the various aspects of protein trafficking during plant immunity, with a focus on the immunity proteins on the move and the major components of the trafficking machineries engaged.

The experiment was conducted for 60 days. The results showed that the average backfat thickness, (testicles + kidney + pelvic) fat percentage and subcutaneous fat percentage in dietary CLA were significantly lower than in the control group, while intramuscular the fat percentage was significantly higher. Compared to the control group, the Longissimus muscle enzyme activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in dietary CLA and the subcutaneous fat enzyme activities of LPL, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) were significantly increased. Similarly, compared to the control group, the Longissimus muscle sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), FAS, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD), ACC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), heart fatty-acid binding protein (H-FABP) and LPL gene expression in dietary CLA were significant increased, as were the subcutaneous fat of PPAR, H-FABP, LPL, CPT-1 and HSL in dietary CLA. These results indicated that dietary CLA increases IMF deposition mainly by the up-regulation of lipogenic gene expression, while decreasing subcutaneous fat deposition mainly by the up-regulation of lipolytic gene expression.

A total of 72 growing pigs (body weight = 40.8 +/- 2.1 kg) were used in feeding trials, lasting for up to 42 days, and were randomly allotted to one of three diets, including a corn-soybean meal control diet as well as two experimental diets containing 10% unfermented rapeseed meal (RSM) or 10% FRSM. The results showed that average daily gain and feed conversion ratio of pigs fed FRSM were superior (P < 0.05) to that of pigs fed unfermented RSM and did not differ from the control. Pigs fed control diet had higher (P < 0.05) total tract apparent digestibility for dry matter, protein, calcium and phosphorus than pigs fed unfermented RSM diet and did not differ from the FRSM diet. Pigs fed FRSM had lower levels (P < 0.05) of serum aspartate transaminase compared to unfermented RSM. In conclusion, solid state fermentation using Aspergillus niger may improve the growth performance and nutrient digestibility of RSM for pigs and FRSM is a promising alternative protein for pig production.

Eighteen barrows with initial body weight (BW) of 13.5 +/- 0.2 kg were randomly allotted to 3 diets (control, protease diet, and nitrogen-free diet) with 6 piglets per diet after fitting with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Control and protease diets were corn-soybean meal based diet supplemented with or without 200 mg/kg of coated protease. The nitrogen-free diet was used to measure basal endogenous losses of AA. The experiment lasted for 7 days, and ileal digesta were collected on days 6 and 7. Results showed that the coefficients of AID and SID of CP and total AA were increased by protease supplementation (P<0.05). For indispensable AA, the coefficients of AID of Ile, Lys, Met and Thr, and the coefficients of SID of Ile, Lys, Met, Thr and Trp were increased by protease (P<0.05). For dispensable AA, both the coefficients of AID and SID of Ala, Asp, Cys, Gly and Ser were increased by protease (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with coated protease increases coefficients of AID and SID of CP and most AAs in weaned piglets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we evaluated the effects of Fusarium graminearum infection on yield and the photosynthesis associated parameters P-n, G(s), and C-i, of wheat flag leaves and determined the influence of FHB resistance. The FHB-resistant wheat genotype L699 and its susceptible sister line L661 were point- and spray-inoculated. Photosynthesis-associated parameters were subsequently measured using a modulated photosynthesis system, and FHB intensity was evaluated. Compared with L661, FHB caused more significant reductions in the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of flag leaves in L699. However, FHB caused a larger reduction in the 1000-grain weight and total grain weight per spike in L661 compared with L699. Independence sample t test showed that FHB resistance was significantly higher in L699 compared with L661. We concluded that under the conditions of the present study, FHB had a significantly greater effect on net photosynthesis in the resistant line compared with the susceptible line; however, it had a greater impact on yield components in the susceptible line. These results provide a new insight into the physiological cost of host resistance to FHB.

On the other side, they act as a main source of toxic peptides triggering celiac disease. In this study, 37 alpha-gliadins were isolated from three species of Aegilops section Sitopsis. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses revealed novel allelic variation at Gli-2 loci of species of Sitopsis and regular organization of motifs in their repetitive domain. Based on the comprehensive analyses of a large number of known sequences of bread wheat and its diploid genome progenitors, the distributions of four T cell epitopes and length variations of two polyglutamine domains are analyzed. Additionally, according to the organization of repeat motifs, we classified the alpha-gliadins of Triticum and Aegilops into eight types. Their most recent common ancestor and putative divergence patterns were further considered. This study provides new insights into the allelic variations of alpha-gliadins in Aegilops section Sitopsis, as well as evolution of alpha-gliadin multigene family among Triticum and Aegilops species.

However, the existing algorithms of OTUs clustering still remain to be improved at reliability. Here we propose an improved method (bioOTU) that first assigns taxonomy to unique tags at genus level for separating the error-free sequences of known species in reference database from artifacts, and then cluster them into OTUs by different strategies. The remaining tags, which fail to be clustered in the previous step, are further subjected to independent OTUs clustering by the optimized algorithm of heuristic clustering. The performance tests on both mock and real communities revealed that bioOTU is powerful for recovering the underlying profiles at both microbial composition and abundance, and it also produces comparable or less number of OTUs in comparison with the prevailing tools of Mothur and UPARSE. The bioOTU is implemented in C and Python languages with source codes freely available on the GitHub repository.

BATSCH; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; SSR MARKERS; AVIUM L.; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; DOMESTICATED PLANTS; WILD CHERRY; PEACH; ASSOCIATION; FREQUENCY	Chinese cherry (Prunus pseudocerasus Lindl.) is an ancient fruit crop with highly economic and ornamental values. It originated in China and the cultivation history can be traced back to 3,000 - 4,000 years ago. Over such a long-term domestication process, a large number of genetic variations have been accumulated in different landraces. However, their utilization for cultivar improvement is limited by the scarcity of information involving genetic diversity and population structure. Here, 17 populations comprised of 140 individuals were collected from four geographic areas: Sichuan Basin (SC), Qinglin Mountain (QL), Yungui Plateau (YG) and North of China (NC), and analyzed using a set of 20 microsatellite markers. In total, 126 polymorphic loci were generated, with 6.3 loci per primer. The global expected heterozygosity (He = 0.63) and Shannon information index (I = 1.23) implied a moderately high level of genetic variation. Two major clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2) were demonstrated based on population structure analysis, which implied the presence of two potential domestication sites of Chinese cherry landraces. Individuals from SC were assigned to cluster 1 and those from QL, YG and NC were grouped into cluster 2. Samples from QL region contained the most plentiful admixture genetic components, implied the possibility of being one transition region of genetic variation. Moreover, botanical characteristics, such as long lifespan, inbreeding preference as well as vegetative propagation, might lead to a relatively low level but significant genetic divergence among populations. Finally, conservation strategies were proposed to protect these valuable natural germplasm based on these results.

In contrast to bread wheat, TaMATE1B conferred greater aluminium tolerance than TaALMT1. Durum wheat (tetraploid AABB, Triticum turgidum) is a species that grows poorly on acid soils due to its sensitivity of Al3+. By contrast, bread wheat (hexaploid AABBDD, T. aestivum) shows a large variation in Al3+ tolerance which can be attributed to a major gene (TaALMT1) located on chromosome 4D as well as to other genes of minor effect such as TaMATE1B. Genotypic variation for Al3+ tolerance in durum germplasm is small and the introgression of genes from bread wheat is one option for enhancing the ability of durum wheat to grow on acid soils. Introgression of a large fragment of the 4D chromosome previously increased the Al3+ tolerance of durum wheat demonstrating the viability of transferring the TaALMT1 gene to durum wheat to increase its Al3+ tolerance. Here, we used a ph1 (pairing homoeologous) mutant of durum wheat to introgress a small fragment of the 4D chromosome harboring the TaALMT1 gene. The size of the 4D chromosomal fragment introgressed into durum wheat was estimated by markers, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and real-time quantitative PCR. In a parallel strategy, we introgressed TaMATE1B from bread wheat into durum wheat using conventional crosses. Both genes separately increased the Al3+ tolerance of durum wheat in both hydroponics and soil cultures. In contrast to bread wheat, the TaMATE1B gene was more effective than TaALMT1 in increasing the Al3+ tolerance of durum wheat grown on acid soil.

Jian) (8.93 +/- 0.03g) were fed diets containing graded levels of vitamin K at 0.027 (basal diet), 1.52, 3.02, 4.51, 6.02 and 7.52mgkg(-1) diet for 60days to investigate the effects of vitamin K on growth, enzyme activities and antioxidant capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine. Percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency of fish were improved by vitamin K. Activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase and lipase in the intestine and hepatopancreas and Na+, K+-ATPase, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in the intestine were increased by vitamin K. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in the hepatopancreas and intestine were decreased with vitamin K supplements. Certain level of vitamin K increased antihydroxyl radical, antisuperoxide anion, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities and glutathione contents in the hepatopancreas and intestine. Intestinal Lactobacillus, E.coli and Aeromonas were changed with vitamin K supplements. Together, these results indicate that vitamin K improved fish growth, digestive and absorptive ability, and anti-oxidant capacity. The dietary vitamin K requirement of juvenile Jian carp (8.93-73.7g) based on PWG was 3.13mgkg(-1) diet.

High-Fat Diet Increased Renal and Hepatic Oxidative Stress Induced by Vanadium of Wistar Rat	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Vanadium; Oxidative stress; Erythroid 2-related factor 2; Histopathological changes	LIPID-PEROXIDATION; LIVER; TOXICITY; METABOLISM; ANTIOXIDANTS; PARAMETERS; SULFATE; ENZYMES; ELEMENT; KIDNEY	The study was conducted to assess the effect of vanadium (V) in high-fat diet on the liver and kidney of rats in a 5-week trial. Seventy-two female Wistar rats (BW = 95 +/- A 5 g) were randomly allotted into eight groups. Groups I, II, III, and IV obtained low-fat diet containing 0, 3, 15, and 30 mg/kg V, and V, VI, VII, and VIII groups received the respective vanadium doses with high-fat diet, respectively. There were lesions in the liver and kidney of V, VI, VII, and VIII groups, granular degeneration and vacuolar degeneration were observed in the renal tubular and glomerulus epithelial cells, and hepatocytes showed granular degeneration and vacuolar degeneration. Supplemented high-fat diet with vanadium was shown to decrease (P < 0.05) activities of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione-S transferase, and NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and increase malondialdehyde content in the liver and kidney. The relative expression of hepatic nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and NQO1 mRNA was downregulated by V addition and high-fat diet, and the effect of V was more pronounced in high-fat diet (interaction, P < 0.05), with VIII group having the lowest mRNA expression of Nrf-2 and NQO1 in the liver and kidney. In conclusion, it suggested that dietary vanadium ranging from 15 to 30 mg/kg could lead to oxidative damage and vanadium accumulation in the liver and kidney, which caused renal and hepatic toxicity. The high-fat diet enhanced vanadium-induced hepatic and renal damage, and the mechanism was related to the modulation of the hepatic and renal mRNA expression of Nrf-2 and NQO1.	[Wang, J. P.; Cui, R.

In this study, the full-length cDNA sequences of Smyd1a and Smyd1b were cloned from Chinese perch, and their molecular structure and expression profile in response to nutrition supply and in vivo IGF treatments were also analyzed. The cDNA sequence of Smyd1a and Smyd1b consists of 1862 and 1802 base pairs (bp), encoding 479 and 476 amino acids, respectively. The SET domains of the two proteins were split into two segments by the MYND domain. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of Smyd1a contains an extra 13-aa insertion in the SET domain in comparison with Smyd1b. The two genes apparently exhibited temporal and spatial differential expression status. In adults, the two genes showed the higher expression level in the muscle and heart than in other testing tissues. During the post-embryonic developmental stages, the higher expression of Smyd1a was detected at 150 days post-hatching (dph), whereas the expression of Smyd1b peaked at 50 dph. It was indicated that they have potential function in muscle developmental regulation. The mRNA levels of Smyd1a and Smyd1b were sharply up regulated within one day after refeeding in the Chinese perch juveniles following fasting for a week. Moreover, IGF-1 treatments in vivo significantly stimulated their expression in the skeletal muscle. Together, these data provide us with further understanding of the molecular characterization and expression regulation of the two genes upon internal and external stimuli. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Many reports have shown that resveratrol has the bidirectional regulation effects on antigen presenting and cellular immunity. However, few reports have evaluated the effects of resveratrol on reinforcing immunity recovery via activating nuclear factor -Kappa B (NF-kappa B). In the present study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on recovery and reconstruction of immune function by detecting nonspecific and specific immunity in immunosuppressive mice. We found that, compared to the immunosuppressive mice, the spleen index and spleen lymphocyte proliferation of resveratrol-treated mice (30 mg/kg body weight) were enhanced. After resveratrol-treatment (15 mg/kg body weight), the function of peritoneal macrophages was enhanced and the CD4+ cells were increased in peripheral blood. The expressions of serum cytokines related to immune function, including interleukin (IL)-1 alpha/beta, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and NF-kappa B were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in spleen was enhanced after resveratrol-treatment The immuno-enhancement effects of resveratrol were similar to that of levamisole (served as positive control). These results demonstrated that resveratrol had potent immune enhancement activity in immunosuppressive mice, and one possible mechanism of action was to activate the NF-kappa B.

An approximate 1.0 kb DNA fragment, encoding for glycoprotein M, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX-M was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, and the expression and translation of the pVAX-M delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M) was detected both in vitro and in vivo. BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-M) at different dosages to evaluate safety of the vaccines. The bacterium was safe to mice at a dosage of 2 x 10(9) CFU, almost eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization and eventually cleared at week 6. Mice immunized with 1 x 10(9) CFU of SL7207 (pVAX-M) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses including levels of IgA, IgG, IL-4, and IFN-gamma as measured by indirect ELISA assay. Moreover, the control groups (pVAX group, PBS group) maintained at a normal level during week 4-8 post-immunization. The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV M gene vaccine.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of exogenous spermidine (Spd) and a Spd inhibitor, dimethylthiourea (DCHA), on drought responses of white clover (Trifolium repens). Metabolic, protein, and gene transcript levels were evaluated at leaf relative water content levels of 87% for non-stressed plants and 50% for drought-stressed plants. The exogenous application of Spd (0.05 mM) significantly increased endogenous PAs content whereas DCHA generally reduced PAs content. Phytohormone responses to Spd application included an elevated gibberellic acid (GA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content under non-stressed condition, and an increased GA and cytokinin (CTK) content as well as decreased IAA content under water deficit condition. The increase in endogenous PAs had no significant effect on abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation under either water treatment. Spd treatment resulted in enhanced antioxidant defense via maintenance of greater antioxidant enzyme activities and transcript levels, especially ascorbic acid (AsA). Other metabolites such as total phenols, flavonoids, proline, metallothionein (MT), and cysteine (Cyt) were also elevated with Spd treatment. On the contrary, inhibition of Spd biosynthesis weakened antioxidant defense, decreased proline metabolism, and inhibited MT genes expression leading to aggravation of drought-induced stress damages. These results suggest that changes of PAs and phytohormones play critical roles in the improvement of drought tolerance in white clover, which are attributed to the alleviation of oxidative stress, inhibition of leaf senescence, and maintenance of growth under drought stress.

A total of 172 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 1148 samples collected from four sample sources (breeder farms, broiler farms, abattoir, and retail markets), representing nine production stages. These Salmonella isolates were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 different antimicrobial agents using a disk diffusion assay. Among them, 168 were identified as six different serotypes of Salmonella enterica. The predominant serotype was S. Enteritidis (n = 116), followed by S. Infantis (n = 18), S. Gueuletapee (n = 16), S. Derby (n = 12), S. Meleagridis (n = 4), and S. London (n = 2). The remaining four isolates were serogroup-untypeable. A majority of the 172 isolates (96.51%) was resistant to one or more antibiotics and 61.05% of the Salmonella isolates showed a multidrug resistance phenotype. Statistical analysis indicated the one risk product stage for Salmonella contamination occurred in the sample source at the abattoir, specifically the stage of Carcasses after chilling. The majority of S. Enteritidis isolates shared the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) cluster, suggesting that the S. Enteritidis strain might spread along the broiler chicken supply chain. The prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in different production stages suggest the importance of controlling Salmonella in the broiler chicken supply chain for public health, underlying the need for improved measures of reducing carcass contamination in abattoirs and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in broiler flocks.

Rhizoctonia solani is a major fungal pathogen of rice causing extreme crop losses in all rice-growing regions of the world. R. solani AG1 IA is a major cause of sheath blight in rice. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive and user-friendly web-based database, RSIADB, to analyse its draft genome and transcriptome. The database was built using the genome sequence (10 489 genes) and annotation information for R. solani AG1 IA. A total of six RNAseq samples of R. solani AG1 IA were also analysed, corresponding to 10, 18, 24, 32, 48 and 72 h after infection of rice leaves. The RSIADB database enables users to search, browse, and download gene sequences for R. solani AG1 IA, and mine the data using BLAST, Sequence Extractor, Browse and Construction Diagram tools that were integrated into the database. RSIADB is an important genomic resource for scientists working with R. solani AG1 IA and will assist researchers in analysing the annotated genome and transcriptome of this pathogen. This resource will facilitate studies on gene function, pathogenesis factors and secreted proteins, as well as provide an avenue for comparative analyses of genes expressed during different stages of infection.

Lewis; Weber, Scott A.; Zhang, Xiaoping			Two New Native beta-Glucosidases from Clavispora NRRL Y-50464 Confer Its Dual Function as Cellobiose Fermenting Ethanologenic Yeast	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; FAMILY 3; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION; QRT-PCR; FERMENTATION; PURIFICATION; HYDROLASE; CELLULOSE; BIOMASS	Yeast strain Clavispora NRRL Y-50464 is able to produce cellulosic ethanol from lignocellulosic materials without addition of external beta-glucosidase by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. A beta-glucosidase BGL1 protein from this strain was recently reported supporting its cellobiose utilization capability. Here, we report two additional new beta-glucosidase genes encoding enzymes designated as BGL2 and BGL3 from strain NRRL Y-50464. Quantitative gene expression was analyzed and the gene function of BGL2 and BGL3 was confirmed by heterologous expression using cellobiose as a sole carbon source. Each gene was cloned and partially purified protein obtained separately for direct enzyme assay using varied substrates. Both proteins showed the highest specific activity at pH 5 and relatively strong affinity with a K-m of 0.08 and 0.18 mM for BGL2 and BGL3, respectively. The optimum temperature was found to be 50 degrees C for BGL2 and 55 degrees C for BGL3. Both proteins were able to hydrolyze 1,4 oligosaccharides evaluated in this study. They also showed a strong resistance to glucose product inhibition with a K-i of 61.97 and 38.33 mM for BGL2 and BGL3, respectively. While BGL3 was sensitive showing a significantly reduced activity to 4% ethanol, BGL2 demonstrated tolerance to ethanol. Its activity was enhanced in the presence of ethanol but reduced at concentrations greater than 16%. The presence of the fermentation inhibitors furfural and HMF did not affect the enzyme activity. Our results suggest that a beta-glucosidase gene family exists in Clavispora NRRL Y-50464 with at least three members in this group that validate its cellobiose hydrolysis functions for lower-cost cellulosic ethanol production. Results of this study confirmed the cellobiose hydrolysis function of strain NRRL Y-50464, and further supported this dual functional yeast as a candidate for lower-cost cellulosic ethanol production and next-generation biocatalyst development in potential industrial applications.

JESWIET; AFLP MARKERS; GENOME; ACCESSIONS; HYBRIDS; TRAITS; SIZE	Erianthus arundinaceus is not only an important germplasm resource for sugarcane breeding but also a potential bioenergy plant. Making clear the distribution of the chromosome ploidy of wild E. arundinaceus in china is the premise of the research and utilization of this species. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the ploidy level and DNA content of the 55 E. arundinaceus accessions using flow cytometry and to identify the correlation between ploidy and phenotypic traits. Among the 55 accessions, four tetraploids and 51 hexaploids were identified. The four tetraploids originated from Mengma Yunnan, Shuangjiang Yunnan, Gaozhou Guangdong and Chengle Sichuan. The mean DNA content was 4.82 pg/2C for the tetraploid and 7.30 pg/2C for the hexaploid plants. The ploidy was negatively correlated with cellulose content and positively correlated (P < 0.05) with plant height, stem diameter, leaf width, dry weight per plant, fresh weight per plant and hemicellulose content. However, ploidy was not correlated with leaf length, tiller number and the ratio of dry weight and fresh weight. This study will be useful for revealing the distribution of the ploidy of wild E. arundinaceus in Chin, traits markers analysis, and utilization of this species, such as cultivar improvement and sugarcane breeding in the future.

It has a pH-responsive capacity to trigger the release of the encapsulated PTX payload under mildly acidic conditions. PTX-loaded PCV conjugated with alkyne-modified PEG-folic acid ligands prepared via click ligation (fP-PCVPTX) has enhanced potency against folate receptor (FR)-positive SKOV-3 ovarian tumour cells over FR-negative A549 lung tumour cells. Moreover, fP-PCVPTX is also four times more potent than the non-targeting PCVPTX platform towards SKOV-3 cells. Overall, as a delivery platform the PCVs have the potential to enhance efficacy of anticancer drugs by targeting a chemotherapeutic payload specifically to tumours and triggering the release of the encapsulated drug in the vicinity of cancer cells.

Plant root systems are not only critical for anchorage in the soil, but also for N acquisition. Therefore, genes controlling root development might also affect N uptake by plants. In this study, the responses of nitrogen on root architecture of mutant rtcs and wild-type of maize were investigated by morphological and physiological analysis. Subsequently, we performed a comparative RNA-Seq analysis to compare gene expression profiles between mutant rtcs roots and wild-type roots under different N conditions. We identified 786 co-modulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to root development. These genes participated in various metabolic processes. A co-expression cluster analysis and a cis-regulatory motifs analysis revealed the importance of the AP2-EREBP transcription factor family in the rtcs-dependent regulatory network. Some genotype-specific DEGs contained at least one LBD motif in their promoter region. Further analyses of the differences in gene transcript levels between rtcs and wild-type under different N conditions revealed 403 co-modulated DEGs with distinct functions. A comparative analysis revealed that the regulatory network controlling root development also controlled gene expression in response to N-deficiency. Several AP2-EREBP family members involved in multiple hormone signaling pathways were among the DEGs. These transcription factors might play important roles in the rtcs-dependent regulatory network related to root development and the N-deficiency response. Genes encoding the nitrate transporters NRT2-1, NAR2.1, NAR2.2, and NAR2.3 showed much higher transcript levels in rtcs than in wildtype under normal-N conditions. This result indicated that the LBD gene family mainly functions as transcriptional repressors, as noted in other studies. In summary, using a comparative RNA-Seq-based approach, we identified DEGs related to root development that also participated in the N-deficiency response in maize. These findings will increase our understanding of the molecular regulatory networks controlling root development and N-stress responses.

In this study, we investigated the roles of the mitochondrial, death receptor, and endoplasmic reticulum pathways in Aflatoxin B-1 induced thymocytes apoptosis. Chickens were fed an aflatoxin B-1 containing diet (0.6 mg/kg AFB(1)) for 3 weeks. Our results showed that (1) AFB(1) diet induced the decrease of T-cell subsets, morphological changes, and excessive apoptosis of thymus. (2) The excessive apoptosis involved the mitochondrial pathway (up-regulation of Bax, Bak, cytC and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and death receptor pathway (up-regulation of FasL, Fas and FADD). (3) Oxidative stress, an apoptosis inducer, was confirmed in the thymus. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that mitochondrial and death receptor pathways involved in AFB(1) induced thymocytes apoptosis in broilers.

In this paper, the spatiotemporal variations of soil nitrogen and the relative importance of their affecting factors were analysed at a county scale in the purple hilly area of the mid-Sichuan Basin in Southwest China based on soil data collected in 1981 and 2012. Statistical results showed that soil total nitrogen (TN) increased from 0.88 g kg(-1) in 1981 to 1.12 g kg(-1) in 2012, whereas available nitrogen (AN) decreased from 84.22 mg kg(-1) to 74.35 mg kg(-1). In particular, AN showed a significant decrease in agricultural ecosystems but remained stable in woodland and grassland. Correspondingly, most of the study area exhibited increased TN content and decreased AN content in space. The nugget/sill ratios of TN and AN increased from 0.419 to 0.608 and from 0.733 to 0.790, whereas spatial correlation distances decreased from 12.00 km to 9.50 km and from 9.50 km to 9.00 km, respectively, suggesting that the spatial dependence of soil nitrogen became weaker and that the extrinsic factors played increasingly important roles in affecting the soil nitrogen distribution. Soil group and land use type were the two dominant factors in 1981, followed by topographic factors, vegetation coverage and parent material, whereas land use type became the most important factor in 2012, and the relative contribution of topographic factors declined markedly. The results suggested that land use related to cultivation management and fertilizer application was the decisive factor for soil nitrogen change. The increase in TN content and the decrease in AN content over the study period also suggested improper use of nitrogen fertilizer, which can result in nitrogen loss through increasing nitrification rates. Thus, effective measures should be taken to increase the uptake rate of nitrogen and prevent nitrogen pollution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, knowledge regarding emerin in the domestic animal is limited. In this study, we cloned and characterized the pig emerin (EMD) gene. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the EMD gene was expressed at the highest level in the heart and fat at 120 d. However, the fetal skeletal muscles displayed a greater abundance of EMD mRNA than that in skeletal muscles at postnatal development stages. In addition, the expression level of EMD at 60 day was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Meishan than Large White pigs. Pig EMD protein displayed the sarcolemma and perinuclear distribution in skeletal muscle sections, and there was no distribution change of EMD in skeletal muscle sections between Large White and Meishan pigs. These studies provide useful information for further research on the functions of pig EMD gene in skeletal muscle. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							PINOT-NOIR; ANTHOCYANIN EXTRACTABILITY; VARIETAL DIFFERENCES; SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE; RED WINES; CAPACITY; SKIN; ACCUMULATION; PROFILES; TEMPERATURE	Wine grapes are usually harvested in vineyards when they ripen. However, not all of the berries in a vineyard ripen homogeneously because of different microclimates around the clusters and berries. In this study, the influence of berry heterogeneity on the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of grapes and wines under a continental monsoon climate was evaluated for a new wine grape cultivar Meili (Vitis vinifera L.). The total phenolic, flavonoid, flavanol, and monomeric anthocyanin contents in the skin and wine significantly increased with grape density; however, there was no significant difference in the seeds between the two lower densities. The highest values of DPPH free radical-scavenging activity, cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity, and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity in the skin, seed and wine were detected for the densest berries. The sum of individual phenolic compounds in skin, seed and wine increased with berry density, though no significant difference for skin was observed between the two higher density classes. Hence, the chemical components of Meili grapes and wines were positively associated with the berry density at harvest under the continental monsoon climate.

This requires a better knowledge of the changes of gene expression during the process of adipose tissue development. Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine the effects of development on subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression in growing and adult pigs. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of mRNA transcriptomes in porcine subcutaneous adipose tissue across four developmental stages using digital gene expression profiling. We identified 3,274 differential expressed genes associated with oxidative stress, immune processes, apoptosis, energy metabolism, insulin stimulus, cell cycle, angiogenesis and translation. A set of universally abundant genes (ATP8, COX2, COX3, ND1, ND2, SCD and TUBA1B) was found across all four developmental stages. This set of genes may play important roles in lipogenesis and development. We also identified development-related gene expression patterns that are linked to the different adipose phenotypes. We showed that genes enriched in significantly up-regulated profiles were associated with phosphorylation and angiogenesis. In contrast, genes enriched in significantly down-regulated profiles were related to cell cycle and cytoskeleton organization, suggesting an important role for these biological processes in adipose growth and development. These results provide a resource for studying adipose development and promote the pig as a model organism for researching the development of human obesity, as well as being used in the pig industry.

However, its function during porcine intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation remains poorly understood. In this study, we prepared the antiserum against porcine FTO (pFTO), which was used to determine its subcellular localization and tissue distribution. Our data indicated that pFTO was localized predominantly in the nucleus. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analysis showed that pFTO was highly expressed in the lung and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Overexpression of pFTO in porcine intramuscular preadipocytes significantly promoted cell proliferation and lipid deposition. Furthermore, overexpression of pFTO in differentiating porcine intramuscular preadipocytes also significantly increased the mRNA levels of adipocyte differentiation transcription factors peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor. (PPAR.), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Our findings provide the first functional evidence to reveal a role of pFTO in porcine intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.

Walp.) is an important tropical grain legume. Asparagus bean (V. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis) is a distinctive subspecies of cowpea, which is considered one of the top ten Asian vegetables. It can be adapted to a wide range of environmental stimuli such as drought and heat. Nevertheless, it is an extremely cold-sensitive tropical species. Improvement of chilling tolerance in asparagus bean may significantly increase its production and prolong its supply. However, gene regulation and signaling pathways related to cold response in this crop remain unknown. Using Illumina sequencing technology, modification of global gene expression in response to chilling stress in two asparagus bean cultivars-"Dubai bean" and "Ningjiang-3", which are tolerant and sensitive to chilling, respectively-were investigated. More than 1.8 million clean reads were obtained from each sample. After de novo assembly, 88,869 unigenes were finally generated with a mean length of 635 bp. Of these unigenes, 41,925 (47.18%) had functional annotations when aligned to public protein databases. Further, we identified 3,510 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Dubai bean, including 2,103 up-regulated genes and 1,407 down-regulated genes. While in Ningjiang-3, we found 2,868 DEGs, 1,786 of which were increasing and the others were decreasing. 1,744 DEGs were commonly regulated in two cultivars, suggesting that some genes play fundamental roles in asparagus bean during cold stress. Functional classification of the DEGs in two cultivars using Mercator pipeline indicated that RNA, protein, signaling, stress and hormone metabolism were five major groups. In RNA group, analysis of TFs in DREB subfamily showed that ICE1-CBF3-COR cold responsive cascade may also exist in asparagus bean. Our study is the first to provide the transcriptome sequence resource for asparagus bean, which will accelerate breeding cold resistant asparagus bean varieties through genetic engineering, and advance our knowledge of the genes involved in the complex regulatory networks of this plant under cold stress.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of Bacillus licheniformis as dietary supplement on the growth, serum antioxidant status, and expression of lipid-metabolism genes of broiler chickens with C. perfringens-induced NE. Methods: A total of 240 one-day-old broilers were randomly grouped into four: a negative control, an NE experimental model (PC), chickens fed a diet supplemented with 30 % of fishmeal from day 14 onwards and challenged with coccidiosis vaccine (FC), and NE group supplied with feed containing 1.0 x 10(6) CFU/g B. licheniformis (BL). Results: Body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, serum antioxidant status, and lipid-metabolism-gene expression were analyzed. In the PC group, FCR increased significantly whereas serum catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased compared with NC group. Dietary B. licheniformis supplementation improved FCR and oxidative stress in experimental avian NE. Using Bacillus licheniformis as a direct-fed microbial (DFM) could also significantly upregulate catabolism-related genes, namely, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, in livers and changed the expression of lipid-anabolism genes. Conclusion: These results suggested that dietary B. licheniformis supplementation can enhance growth and antioxidant ability, as well as change the expression of genes related to fatty-acid synthesis and oxidation in the livers of NE-infected broilers.

In this study, we obtained the miRNA expression profiles of PCMV-infected porcine macrophages via high-throughput sequencing. The comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles showed that 239 miRNA database-annotated and 355 novel pig-encoded miRNAs were detected. Of these, 130 miRNAs showed significant differential expression between the PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine macrophages. The 10 differentially expressed pig-encoded miRNAs were further determined by stem-loop reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with the high-throughput sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis of the target genes of miRNAs in PCMV-infected porcine macrophages showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in immune and metabolic processes. This is the first report of the miRNA transcriptome in porcine macrophages and an analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanisms during PCMV infection. Further research into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive viral infections should contribute to the treatment and prevention of immunosuppressive viruses.

The rapeseed meal (RSM) was fermented with Bacillus subtilis, Candida utilis and Enterococcus faecalis. One hundred and eighty-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into three treatments: a corn-soybean meal based diet and two experimental diets in which the control diet was supplemented with 10.9% RSM or 9.41% FRSM. Results showed that the fermentation process can effectively increase crude protein or small peptides level, and decrease crude fiber level, glucosinolate, isothiocyanate, tannin and phytic acid level in RSM. The levels of serum total antioxidative capacity, total superoxide dismutase, total protein, albumin and glucose of birds fed FRSM were higher than birds fed RSM on days 21 and 42. FRSM also improved the intestinal morphology of broilers. The results indicate that FRSM can be effectively applied in broiler diets.

Our research findings revealed that the entire mitochondrial genome of Meigu goat was 16,643bp in length. The contents of A, C, T and G in the mitochondrial genome were 33.59%, 26.05%, 27.31% and 13.05%, respectively. The mitogenome of meigu goat contained 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and 1 control region. Components of the Meigu goat's mitogenome were similar to those of other Capra hircus in gene arrangement and composition. These results could provide essential information for molecular phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of domestic goats.

A total of 96 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) piglets were randomly divided into four groups: considered or not considered the trace mineral concentrations in basal diet; and then added to the requirements proposed by NRC (2012) (+B/NR or -B/NR); and considered or not considered the basal diet's-trace mineral concentrations and then added to the level of commercial trace mineral supplement (+B/PL or -B/PL). Pigs Were fed from 6.5 to 115 kg. Compared with +B/NR diets, -B/PL diets increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations (P < 0.05), resulted in high levels of Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn accumulation in liver (P < 0.05), as well as led to hepatic oxidative damage with the high concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TEARS), protein carbonylation (PCO), and 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHG) in liver (P < 0.05). Furthermore, pigs fed -B/PL diets increased CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF-2a), interleukin-6(IL-6), B-cell lymphoma leukemia-2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 gene expression (P < 0.05) in liver. -B/PL diets also up-regulated hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasel (PEPCK1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS) (P < 0.05). and down-regulated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA expression (P < 0.05), when compared with those of, the + B/NR diet group. Taken together, the results indicated that long-term dietary mineral exposure with the commercial supplement level could cause harm to the structure and metabolic function of liver in pigs.

Parameters which potentially influenced the functioning of K-nZVI have been investigated as well. Based on the scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopes, X-ray crystal powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifications, we confirm that amorphous Fe-0 core/FexOy shell nZVI can be successfully loaded into the pores and cracks, and onto the surface of kaolin. Removal efficiency of Cr by K-nZVI decreased with increasing initial pH and Cr(VI) concentration, but increased while K-nZVI dosage increased. Humic acid and phosphate had similar dual impacts on chromium removal by K-nZVI, and the inhibitory effect was obvious at high concentrations in spite of their different reaction mechanisms. In contrast, high concentrations of sulfate and nitrate could advance the chromium removal. Adsorption isotherms indicate that the removal processes are endothermic. The data obtained can be better explained with Langmuir than Freundlich model. At the conditions of 318K and optimized pH 4.0, the maximum adsorption capacity was 33.39mgg(-1) illustrating that K-nZVI was effective for the removal of total Cr. The removal mechanism is proposed to divide into four phases, including: (1) aqueous Cr(VI) ions are captured on the surface of K-nZVI; (2) the captured Cr(VI) are partly reduced to Cr(III) accompanied by Fe-0 oxidizing to Fe2+; (3) part of oxidized Fe2+ continues to reduce Cr(VI); and (4) produced Cr(III), Fe2+, and Fe3+ are formed passivation layers on the K-nZVI surface which prevent further removal of chromium and result in redundant Fe-0.

The viral genome contains one open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein that can be processed by viral proteinases. The crucial 3C proteinases (3C(pro)s) of picornaviruses share similar spatial structures and it is becoming apparent that 3C(pro) plays a significant role in the viral life cycle and virus host interaction. Importantly, the proteinase and RNA-binding activity of 3C(pro) are involved in viral polyprotein processing and the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. In addition, 3C(pro) can induce the cleavage of certain cellular factors required for transcription, translation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to modulate cell physiology for viral replication. Due to interactions between 3C(pro) and these essential factors, 3C(pro) is also involved in viral pathogenesis to support efficient infection. Furthermore, based on the structural conservation, the development of irreversible inhibitors and discovery of non-covalent inhibitors for 3C(pro) are ongoing and a better understanding of the roles played by 3C(pro) may provide insights into the development of potential antiviral treatments. In this review, the current knowledge regarding the structural features, multiple functions in the viral life cycle, pathogen host interaction, and development of antiviral compounds for 3C(pro) is summarized.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether melatonin supplement in the extender may improve the quality of cryopreserved mouse sperm. METHODS: Kunming mice sperm frozen in extender R18S3 (18% (w/v) raffinose and 3% (w/v) skim milk) supplemented with melatonin were thawed and evaluated. RESULTS: Mouse spermatozoa were cryopreserved in the freezing extender R18S3 that contained melatonin at 0, 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL melatonin. The extender without melatonin supplement was associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased sperm motility. Melatonin supplement at 0.125 mg/mL significantly increased the progressive motility of sperm in comparison to other melatonin concentration or control. The percentage of thawed viable sperm with ROS was lower in the melatonin-treated groups than in untreated group. Melatonin supplement also increased antiapoptotic gene Bcl-xl expression in the thawed sperm. CONCLUSION: Supplement of 0.125 mg/mL melatonin could reduce oxidative damage and apoptosis.

The proteins E-rns, E1, and E2 are components of the viral envelope membrane. They are also implicated in virus attachment and entry, replication, and (or) anti-immune response. Here, we studied the genetic variations of these envelope proteins in the evolution of CSFV. The results reveal that the envelope proteins underwent different evolutionary fates. In E-rns and E1, but not E2, a number of amino acid sites experienced functional divergence. Furthermore, the diversification in E-rns and E1 was generally episodic because the divergence-related changes of E1 only occurred with the separation of 2 major groups of CSFV and that of E-rns took place with the division of 1 major group. The major divergence-related sites of Erns are located on one of the substrate-binding regions of the RNase domain and C-terminal extension. These functional domains have been reported to block activation of the innate immune system and attachment and entry into host cells, respectively. Our results may shed some light on the divergent roles of the envelope proteins.

Association of polymorphisms in leptin and leptin receptor genes with circulating leptin concentrations, production and efficiency traits in sheep	SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH			English	Article						Leptin; Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); Lactation; Gestation; Physiological stage; Indicator trait	SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; MEAT QUALITY TRAITS; BEEF-CATTLE; MISSENSE MUTATION; LATE PREGNANCY; OVINE LEPTIN; FEED-INTAKE; SERUM CONCENTRATIONS; CARCASS TRAITS; GROWTH TRAITS	The relationships among nucleotide sequence polymorphisms in the genes for leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) and circulating concentrations of leptin and variables related to energy turnover were investigated in a Awassi-Merino crossbred sheep population. Blood sampled at several times during gestation and lactation was used for the assay of circulating leptin and for DNA extraction. Parts of the ovine LEP and LEPR genes were sequenced and, of a total of seven polymorphisms identified, two for each gene were used for genotyping. Feed intake and body weight were recorded for 199 ewes (age 2.9-9.4 years) daily and milk yield and composition were measured. The data were used for association studies between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), circulating leptin concentration and production traits. Both polymorphisms identified in the ovine LEP gene were associated with circulating leptin concentration (P<0.05) and one SNP was associated with feed intake per unit milk production (P<0.05). For the SNPs in the LEPR gene, there were significant effects for residual feed intake during lactation (P<0.05) and for feed intake and residual feed intake at defined times during gestation (P<0.05). We conclude that polymorphisms in the LEP and LEPR genes are associated with production and efficiency traits. The interaction between body condition, milk production, energy efficiency and leptin concentrations should be investigated in detail in future studies. Further studies are also needed to identify the specific roles played by LEP and LEPR in the regulation of circulating leptin concentrations and energy metabolism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On average, TAC, TPC and AA in the peel were 15.34 times, 7.28 times and 5.75 times higher than in the flesh, respectively. High positive correlations between TAC, TPC and AA were observed. Types and contents of anthocyanidins in the peel were more than in the corresponding flesh, but they had the same dominant anthocyanidins. Results showed peel of pigmented potato tuber can be used as an important source material in production of natural pigments and natural antioxidants.

Typhimurium). Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from Salmonella show high immunogenicity and provide protection against Salmonella infection, and truncated LPS alters the outer membrane composition of the cell wall. In our previous study, we demonstrated that Salmonella mutants carrying truncated LPS failed to induce strong immune responses and cross-reaction to other enteric bacteria, due to their high attenuation and low colonization in the host. Therefore, we plan to investigate whether outer membrane proteins from Salmonella mutants with truncated LPS resulting from a series of nonpolar mutations, including increment waaC12, increment waaF15, increment waaG42, increment rfaH49, increment waaI43, increment waaJ44, increment waaL46, increment wbaP45 and increment wzy-48, affect immunogenicity and provide protection against diverse Salmonella challenge. In this study, the immunogenicity and cross-protection efficiency of purified OMPs from all mutants were investigated to explore a potential OMP vaccine to protect against homologous or heterologous serotype Salmonella challenge. The results demonstrated that OMPs from three Salmonella mutants ( increment waaC12, increment waaJ44 and increment waaL46) induced higher immune responses and provided good protection against homologous S. Typhimurium. The OMPs from these three mutants were also selected to determine the cross-protective efficacy against homologous and heterologous serotype Salmonella. Our results indicated that the mutant increment waaC12 can elicit higher cross-reactivity and can provide good protection against S. Choleraesuis and S. Enteritidis infection and that the cross-reactivity may be ascribed to an antigen of approximately 18.4-30 kDa.

Although the changes of bacterial community as litter decomposition proceeding can be regulated by frozen temperature and changed litter quality in cold regimes, little information has been available on. Therefore, the structure and diversity of the bacterial community in Minjiang fir (Abies faxoniana) needle litter were measured in an alpine forest in eastern Tibetan Plateau. The litter samples were sampled at the onset of the freezing stage, the deep freezing stage, the thawing stage, the early growing season and the late growing season from December 2010 to November 2011. The methods of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used. The copy numbers of bacterial 16S rDNA in the fir needle litter changed significantly as litter decomposition proceeding. The abundance of bacterial 16S rDNA was significantly lower at the deep freezing stage but highest at the thawing stage. A large number of bands were observed on the DGGE gel; the intensities and distances of the bands were significantly different among the samples at different stages; the indexes of bacterial diversity at the onset of the freezing and deep freezing stages were lower than them at the other stages. All of the bacterial sequences were affiliated with six distinct classes and an unknown group. Redundancy analysis indicated that moisture, mass loss and the release of litter elements (e.g., C, N, P) exerted obvious influences over the bacterial communities.

However, the production of plectasin from natural microorganisms is still not commercially feasible because of its low expression levels and weak stability. A tandemly arrayed plectasin gene (1,002 bp) from Pseudoplectania nigrella was generated using the isoschizomer construction method, and was inserted into the pPICZaA vector and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The selected P. pastoris strain yielded 143 mu g/ml recombinant plectasin (Ple) under the control of the methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter. Ple was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 41 kDa. In vitro studies have shown that Ple efficiently inhibited the growth of several gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus suis and Staphylococcus aureus. S. suis is the most sensitive bacterial species to Ple, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 mu g/ml. Importantly, Ple exhibited resistance to pepsin but it was quite sensitive to trypsin and maintained antimicrobial activity over a wide pH range (pH 2.0 to 10.0). P. pastoris offers an attractive system for the cost-effective production of Ple. The antimicrobial activity of Ple suggested that it could be a potential alternative to antibiotics against S. suis and S. aureus infections.

Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits affecting biomass and grain yield potential in wheat. Wheat lines with very limited tillering capacity are more productive than free-tillering lines under severe drought conditions. In this study, three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were generated and used, having H461, a low-tillering genotype, as a common parent. A linkage map containing 7808 single nucleotide polymorphism loci was constructed on the basis of H461/CN16 RIL population. Three QTL controlling low tillering were identified on Chromosome (Chr.) 2D (Qltn. sicau-2D), Chr. 2B (Qltn. sicau-2B), and Chr. 5A (Qltn. sicau-5A). Qltn. sicau-2D, Qltn. sicau-2B, and Qltn. sicau-5A explained up to 19.1, 14.6, and 9.6 % of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Comparing with previous findings, Qltn. sicau-2D and Qltn. sicau-2B should thus be novel tillering QTL. The effects of these QTL were further validated in two additional RIL populations. Significant effects of Qltn. sicau-2D were detected across all growth stages in different genetic backgrounds, making it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) underlying this locus.

The results showed that the ME was more tolerant to Pb and more efficient in Pb uptake than the NME. Available Pb concentrations in the rhizosphere of ME and NME increased by 1.2-2.3 times and 1.7-2.7 times when compared to those in the bulk soil, whereas available Pb concentrations in rhizosphere of ME were lower than those of NME. Significant depletion of exchangeable Pb, Pb bound to carbonate and Pb bound to organic matter was observed in the rhizosphere of ME. No statistical change of Pb bound to Fe-Mn oxides was observed in the rhizosphere of both ecotypes. pH values in the rhizosphere of ME decreased by 0.02-0.16 units compared to the bulk soil, and the dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the rhizosphere of ME were 1.1-1.5 times higher than those in the bulk soil. Microorganism numbers in rhizosphere of both ecotypes reduced with increasing Pb treatments, and the sensitivity order of microbial community to Pb was: bacteria[fungi[actinomycetes. Microorganism number in the rhizosphere of ME was higher than that of NME and bulk soil. In conclusion, the ME was more effective in Pb uptake and showed greater capability in mobilizing Pb from non-mobile fraction to mobile fractions likely due to its specific rhizosphere characteristics.

A total of 150 weanling piglets were allocated to six treatments. The piglets were fed the same basel diet supplemented with 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120mg/kg lysozyme as well as antibiotics for 28days. From day 14 to day 28 of dietary treatment, piglets fed 90mg/kg lysozyme had greater average daily gain than piglets fed control diet. During the whole experimental period, piglets fed 120mg/kg lysozyme tended to have greater average daily gain than piglets fed control diet. Compared with piglets fed control diet, piglets fed diets containing antibiotics and 90mg/kg lysozyme had greater villus height to crypt depth ratio in duodenum and jejunum. Additionally, dietary supplementation of 60 and 90mg/kg lysozyme as well as antibiotics enhanced the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages in piglets. In conclusion, dietary lysozyme can accelerate the growth of weanling piglets by improving gut health and non-specific immunity and supplementing 90mg/kg lysozyme is as effective as antibiotics (20mg/kg colistin sulphate + 50mg/kg kitasamycin) in improving the growth performance of weanling piglets.

In the present study, 578 new PCR-based rye-specific markers have been developed by using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, and 76 markers displayed different polymorphism among rye Kustro, Imperial, and King II. A total of 427 and 387 markers were, respectively, located on individual chromosomes and chromosome arms of Kustro by using a set of wheat-rye monosomic addition lines and 13 monotelosomic addition lines, which were derived from T. aestivum L. 'Mianyang11' x S. cereale L. 'Kustro'. In addition, two sets of wheat-rye disomic addition lines, which were derived from T. aestivum L. var. Chinese Spring x S. cereale L. var. Imperial and T. aestivum L. 'Holdfast' x S. cereale L. var. King II, were used to test the chromosomal specificity of the 427 markers. The chromosomal locations of 281 markers were consistent among the three sets of wheat-rye addition lines. The markers developed in this study can be used to identify a given segment of rye chromosomes in wheat background and accelerate the utilization of elite genes on rye chromosomes in wheat breeding programs.

Here, we report accurate estimates of genome size in 99 accessions from 26 species of Avena. We demonstrate that the average genome size of C genome diploid species (2C = 10.26 pg) is 15% larger than that of A genome species (2C = 8.95 pg), and that this difference likely accounts for a progression of size among tetraploid species, where AB < AC < CC (average 2C = 16.76, 18.60, and 21.78 pg, respectively). All accessions from three hexaploid species with the ACD genome configuration had similar genome sizes (average 2C = 25.74 pg). Genome size was mostly consistent within species and in general agreement with current information about evolutionary distance among species. Results also suggest that most of the polyploid species in Avena have experienced genome downsizing in relation to their diploid progenitors. Genome size measurements could provide additional quality control for species identification in germplasm collections, especially in cases where diploid and polyploid species have similar morphology.

Root Vigor and Kinetic Characteristics and Nitrogen Use Efficiencies of Different Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) Cultivars	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						High nitrogen utilization; Kinetics of absorption; Nitrogen form	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; SWEET-POTATO; LOWLAND RICE; YIELD; ACCUMULATION; IRRIGATION; GROWTH	In the present study, the root vigor and kinetic characteristics of nitrogen absorption in potato cultivars was investigated through sand cultivation and pot tests with nutrient solution. Four cultivars of potatoes, namely, Feiwuruita, Yunshu301, Liangshu97, and Chuanyu56 were grown in nutrient solution matrix cultures. The result showed that: (1) Nitrogen uptake rates differed significantly among cultivars with different nitrogen efficiencies; (2) cultivars with High nitrogen-utilization-rate showed significantly higher root vigor, the average root vigor values of cultivars with the high nitrogen-utilization were 115% at seeding stage, 53% at tuber-bulking stage, and 18% at mature stage, respectively, higher than those of cultivars with the low nitrogen-utilization; and (3) Root vigor varied according to growth stage and nitrogen supply i.e. cultivars with high nitrogen-utilization-rate showed enhanced root vigor at the seedling stage under low-nitrogen conditions, while cultivars with low nitrogen-utilization rate showed reduced root vigor at the tuber-bulking and mature stages under high-nitrogen conditions. The kinetic characteristics of nitrogen uptake differed significantly among cultivars: (1) In comparison with cultivars with the low, high nitrogen-utilization showed lower K-m and higher V-max values; (2) The K-m value for nitrate nitrogen uptake was higher than that for ammonium nitrogen uptake, especially in cultivars with low nitrogen-utilization, than those of ammonium nitrogen; (3) In cultivars with low nitrogen-utilization, the V-max value for nitrate nitrogen was lower than that for ammonium nitrogen; and (4) In cultivars with high nitrogen-utilization, the V-max value for nitrate nitrogen was the opposite. The study provides a basis for breeding high nitrogen-utilization cultivars, thereby improving the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization.	[Zheng, S. L.; Cheng, H.; Yuan, J.

Here, we present the identification of ZmbZIP91 as a candidate regulator of starch synthesis via co-expression analysis in maize (Zea mays L.). ZmbZIP91 was strongly associated with the expression of starch synthesis genes. Reverse tanscription-PCR(RT-PCR) and RNA in situ hybridization indicated that ZmbZIP91 is highly expressed in maize endosperm, with less expression in leaves. Particle bombardment- mediated transient expression in maize endosperm and leaf protoplasts demonstrated that ZmbZIP91 could positively regulate the expression of starch synthesis genes in both leaves and endosperm. Additionally, the Arabidopsis mutant vip1 carried a mutation in a gene (VIP1) that is homologous to ZmbZIP91, displayed altered growth with less starch in leaves, and ZmbZIP91 was able to complement this phenotype, resulting in normal starch synthesis. A yeast one-hybrid experiment and EMSAs showed that ZmbZIP91 could directly bind to ACTCAT elements in the promoters of starch synthesis genes (pAGPS1, pSSI, pSSIIIa, and pISA1). These results demonstrate that ZmbZIP91 acts as a core regulatory factor in starch synthesis by binding to ACTCAT elements in the promoters of starch synthesis genes.

The effects of maternal dietary vitamin premixes, canthaxanthin, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the performance of progeny ducklings	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						maternal; vitamin; canthaxanthin; 25-hydroxycholecalciferol; progeny duckling	ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM; E SUPPLEMENTATION; DEVELOPING CHICK; HENS; QUALITY; EGG; CHOLECALCIFEROL; ABSORPTION; SELENIUM; TISSUES	This trial studied the effects of maternal dietary vitamin premixes, and the mixture of canthaxanthin (CX) and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D-3) on the performance of progeny ducklings. Four maternal diets were used under a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 2 kinds of vitamin premixes (Regular and High; High premix had higher levels of all vitamins except K-3 than the Regular premix), and with or without the addition of the mixture of CX (6 mg/kg) and 25-OH-D-3 (0.069 mg/kg). Cherry Valley duck breeders (38-wk-old) were fed with corn-wheat flour-soybean meal-based diets for 8 wk, and then eggs were collected and hatched. Healthy ducklings (equal number of female and male) from each maternal group were randomly selected and received the same commercial starter (1 to 14 d) and grower (15 to 35 d) pellet diet for 35 d. Maternal High vitamin premix increased shank pigmentation (1 d, P = 0.001), BW (1 d, P < 0.001 and 14 d, P = 0.006), BW gain (1 to 14 d, P = 0.008), G:F ratio (1 to 14 d, P = 0.007), superoxide dismutase (SOD; 1 d liver, P = 0.027 and 14 d serum, P = 0.031), and total antioxidant capacity (1 d liver, P < 0.001); and decreased protein carbonyl (14 d serum, P = 0.011) of ducklings. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D-3 increased yolk pigmentation (P < 0.001); increased shank pigmentation (1 d, P < 0.001 and 14 d, P < 0.001), BW (1 d, P < 0.001), feed intake (15-35 d, P = 0.014), SOD (1 d liver, P = 0.032), and tibia ash (14 d, P = 0.010) of ducklings; and decreased malondialdehyde (P < 0.001) and protein carbonyl (P = 0.044) of yolks, and malondialdehyde (14 d serum, P < 0.001) of ducklings. In conclusion, either maternal High vitamin premix or maternal supplementation of the CX and 25-OH-D-3 mixture improves growth performance and antioxidant status of ducklings.	[Ren, Z. Z.; Wang, J.

Annexins are important proteins usually present in the plasma membrane, but previous studies have shown that an annexin B33 protein of E. granulosus (Eg-ANX) could be detected in the excretory/secretory products and cyst fluid. In this study, we cloned and characterized Eg-ANX. In silico analysis showed that the amino acid sequence of Eg-ANX was conserved and lacked any signal peptides. The phospholipid-binding activity of recombinant Eg-ANX (rEg-ANX) was tested; liposomes could bind to rEg-ANX only in the presence of Ca2+. In addition, we performed western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses to further validate the secretory properties of Eg-ANX. The protein could be detected in the cyst fluid of E. granulosus and was also present in the intermediate host tissues, which suggested that Eg-ANX might play an important role in parasite-host interaction.

In this study, the effects of the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and non-ionic polyacrylamide (NPAM) on oxalic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid used to remove zinc from contaminated soils were investigated. The Zn removal efficiencies of all washing solutions showed a logarithmic increase with acid concentrations from 0.5 to 10.0 g/L, while they decreased as pH increased from 4 to 9. Increasing the reaction time enhanced the effects of surfactants on Zn removal efficiencies by the acids during washing and significantly (P < 0.05) improved the removal under some mixed cases. Oxalic acid suffered antagonistic effects from the three surfactants and seriously damaged soil nutrients during the removal of soil Zn. Notably, the three surfactants caused synergistic effects on tartaric and citric acid during washing, with NPAM leading to an increase in Zn removal by 5.0 g/L citric acid of 10.60 % (P < 0.05) within 2 h. NPAM also alleviated the loss of cation exchange capacity of washed soils and obviously improved soil nitrogen concentrations. Overall, combining citric acid with NPAM offers a promising approach to the removal of zinc from contaminated soil.

Exogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 have pharmacological effects, and endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 play vital roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Recent reports have expanded the effects of FGF15/19 and FGF21 on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. However, the regulations of FGF15/19 and FGF21 on metabolism are different. FGF15/19 is mainly secreted from the small intestine in response to feeding, and FGF21 is secreted from the liver in response to extended fasting and from the liver and adipose tissue in response to feeding. In this work, we reviewed the regulatory effects of FGF15/19 and FGF21 on metabolism in the fast and fed states.

The study of the effects of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) addition on cadmium (Cd) accumulation of two ecotypes (mining and farmland) of Solanum photeinocarpum was operated through a pot experiment. The results showed that the biomass and chlorophyll content of the two ecotypes of S. photeinocarpum increased with increasing ABA concentration. Applying exogenous ABA increased Cd content in the two ecotypes of S. photeinocarpum. The maximum Cd contents in shoots of the two ecotypes of S. photeinocarpum were obtained at 20 mu mol/L ABA; shoot Cd contents respectively for the mining and farmland ecotypes were 33.92 and 24.71 % higher than those for the control. Applying exogenous ABA also increased Cd extraction by the two ecotypes of S. photeinocarpum, and the highest Cd extraction was obtained at 20 mu mol/L ABA with 569.42 mu g/plant in shoots of the mining ecotype and 520.51 mu g/plant in shoots of the farmland ecotype respectively. Therefore, exogenous ABA can be used for enhancing the Cd extraction ability of S. photeinocarpum, and 20 mu mol/L ABA was the optimal dose.

The conversion for the liquefaction in methanol, ethanol, and water increased with an increase in reaction temperature, while that for liquefaction in glycerol and PEG was converse. The results of Fourier transform-infrared spectra for the liquefied residues revealed that cellulose was the main resistance to bamboo liquefaction in methanol, ethanol, and water. Glycerol could be selected as a commendable liquefacient for the solvolysis of bamboo components at low temperature using microwave energy.

Carp erythrocytes were treated with the caspase inhibitors in physiological carp saline (PCS) or Ca2+-free PCS in the presence of 40 mu M FeSO4/20 mu M H2O2. The results showed that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of cytochrome c and DNA fragmentation were caspase-dependent, and Ca2+ was involved in calpain activation and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in (OH)-O-center dot-induced carp erythrocytes. Moreover, the results suggested that caspases were involved in PS exposure, and Ca2+ was involved in DNA fragmentation in (OH)-O-center dot-induced fish erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that there might be two apoptosis pathways in fish erythrocytes, one is the caspase and cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis that is similar to that in mammal nucleated cells, the other is the Ca2+-involved apoptosis that was similar to that in mammal non-nucleated erythrocytes. So, fish erythrocytes may be used as a model for studying oxidative stress and apoptosis in mammal cells. Furthermore, the present study investigated the effects of glutamine (Gln)'s metabolites [alanine (Ala), citrulline (Cit), proline (Pro) and their combination (Ala(10)Pro(4)Cit(1))] on the pathways of apoptosis in fish erythrocytes. The results displayed that Ala, Cit, Pro and Ala(10)Pro(4)Cit(1) effectively suppressed ROS generation, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 at the physiological concentrations, prevented Ca2+ influx, calpain activation, PS exposure, DNA fragmentation and the degradation of the cytoskeleton and oxidation of membrane and hemoglobin (Hb) and increased activity of anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR) in (OH)-O-center dot-induced carp erythrocytes. Ala(10)Pro(4)Cit(1) produced a synergistic effect of inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis in fish erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that Ala, Cit, Pro and their combination can protect mammal erythrocytes and nucleated cells against oxidative stress and apoptosis. The studies supported the use of Gln, Ala, Cit and Pro as oxidative stress and apoptosis inhibitors in mammal cells and the hypothesis that the inhibited effects of Gln on oxidative stress and apoptosis are at least partly dependent on that of its metabolites in mammalian.

TLR21 is a TLR that specifically recognizes exogenous double-stranded DNA and rapidly signals to downstream innate immune factors. This study reports the cDNA of goose TLR21 and identifies its immune characteristics. The goose TLR21 is 3161 base pairs and encodes a 975 amino acid protein. As predicted, the goose transmembrane protein TLR21 has a signal peptide, leucine-rich repeat regions, a transmembrane domain, and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that goose TLR21 has homology to chicken TLR21. The tissue distribution of TLR21 suggested that it has high transcript levels in immune-associated tissues, especially in the bursa of Fabricius, the Hadrian gland, and the thymus. After challenge with agonist ODN2006 and new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV), significant induction of TLR21 production, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6, and interferons were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both synthetic DNA (ODN2006) and viral DNA (NGVEV) can be recognized by goose TLR21, which leads to a rapid up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-viral molecules. In vivo, avian influenza A virus H9N2 and NGVEV were used to infect goslings, which was followed by a significant up-regulation of TLR21 mRNA transcripts in multiple tissues of NGVEV-infected geese. In general, goose TLR21 plays an important role in binding invading pathogenic DNA viruses, which subsequently triggers an innate immune response; furthermore, it acts as a functional homologue of mammalian TLR9, as TLR21 recognizes a mammalian TLR9 agonist.

Analyzing the effect of urbanization on carbon (C) stocks is a key step toward enhancing C sequestration and mitigating emissions of carbon dioxide. In a newly urbanized area of western Chengdu, China, we analyzed soil organic C (SOC), soil inorganic C (SIC) stocks down to 1 m, and aboveground vegetation C, and we discussed the effects of land use, density of construction and roads, and distance from the urban center on SOC and SIC density. The SOC, SIC stocks down to 1 m, and aboveground vegetation C stocks were 1.08 x 10(9) kg, 4.67 x 10(7) kg, and 1.58 x 10(7) kg, respectively. Our analyses of SOC and SIC density provided three results: (1) it was significantly higher in rural than in urban land-use types; (2) it tended to decrease as the density of construction and roads increased; and (3) it increased with distance far from the urban center. The results indicated that urbanization led to SOC and SIC loss in our study area. SOC and SIC loss will be alleviated by decreasing the construction and road density and increasing green space area.

Liangshan pig is a special Chinese indigenous pig breed with two completely different coat colors, solid black and blond. In this study, we detected polymorphisms of the above three genes and assessed the relationships between the variations and coat color phenotypes in Liangshan pigs. The findings revealed that the blond phenotype of Liangshan pig was related to dominant mutations in TYRP1, but not related to mutations in MC1R or ASIP. We found three closely linked mutations in TYRP1, g.8406G>A in intron 4, g.11100A>G in intron 5, and g.17599_17604del in exon 8, that were completely associated with blond coat color in Liangshan pigs. Further analysis revealed that a 6-bp deletion mutation resulted in deletion of Met and Gly residues at positions 495 and 496 in TYRP1 protein, and altered the structure of transmembrane domain of TYRP1. Together, our findings indicated that these three mutations in TYRP1 cause the blond phenotype in Liangshan pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tissues were harvested after 21 d of feeding. Serum Mn was greater (P<005) in MnLys rats than in MnSO4 rats, and in L-Fe rats than in A-Fe or H-Fe rats. Duodenal divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) mRNA was lower (P<005) in H-Fe rats than in A-Fe rats for the MnSO4 treatment; however, no significant difference was observed between them for MnLys. Liver DMT1 mRNA abundance was greater (P<005) in MnSO4 than in the MnLys group for H-Fe rats. The DMT1 protein in duodenum and liver and ferroportin 1 (FPN1) protein in liver was greater (P<005) in the MnSO4 group than in the MnLys group, and in L-Fe rats than in H-Fe rats. Duodenal FPN1 protein was greater (P<005) in L-Fe rats than in A-Fe rats for the MnLys treatment, but it was not different between them for the MnSO4 treatment. Results suggest that MnLys increased serum Mn concentration as compared with MnSO4 in rats irrespective of dietary Fe concentration, which was not because of the difference in DMT1 and FPN1 expression in the intestine and liver.

Although forest gaps could regulate water-holding patterns in the understory by redistributing coarse woody debris (CWD), fine woody debris (FWD), non-woody debris (NWD) and understory vegetation, little information is available on the effects of forest gaps on understory WHC. Therefore, we investigated the WHCs of CWD, FWD, NWD, herbaceous vegetation, mosses, epiphytes (including fern and lichen growing on the surface of logs) and soils from the gap centre to the adjacent closed canopy in an alpine forest at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The total WHC of the alpine forest understory components was approximately 300mm. Soil layer had the largest contribution to the total understory WHC (90%), and among the aboveground components, CWD and mosses contributed 5% and 4% to the aboveground WHC, respectively. With the exception of that of the herbaceous layer, the WHC of the forest floor increased from the gap centre to the closed canopy. Although mosses had the lowest biomass allocation on the alpine forest floor, the water-holding ratio (k) of mosses reached 485%. In conclusion, biomass is the parameter that most strongly and positively correlated with the WHC of the alpine forest understory, and forest gap formation decreases the understory WHC of alpine forest resulting from a decrease in organic soils, CWDs and mosses.

Interestingly, centenarians' offspring are prone to achieve longevity. Here we recruited 60 longevity families and investigated the blood biochemical indexes of family members to seek candidate factors associated with familial longevity. First, associations of blood indexes with age were tested. Second, associations of blood parameters in centenarians (CEN) with their first generation of offspring (F1) and F1 spouses (F1SP) were analyzed. Third, genes involved in regulating target factors were investigated. We found that total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) increased with age (20-80 years), but decreased in CEN. Similarly, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and blood creatinine (BCr) increased with age (20-80 years), but were maintained on a plateau in CEN. Importantly, we first revealed dual changes in blood pressure, i.e., decreased diastolic blood pressure but increased systolic blood pressure in CEN, which associated with altered CST3 expression. Genetic analysis revealed a significant association of blood uric acid (BUA) and BCr in CEN with F1 but not with F1SP, suggesting they may be heritable traits. Taken together, our results suggest serum lipids, kidney function and especially diastolic pressure rather than systolic pressure were improved in CEN or their offspring, suggesting these factors may play an important role in familial longevity.

Little information is available regarding how bioelement release from shrub litter is affected by gap formation during critical periods. The release of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the foliar litter of Fargesia nitida and Salix paraplesia in response to gap locations was determined in an alpine forest of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau via a 2-year litter decomposition experiment. The daily release rates of C, N, and P increased from the closed canopy to the gap centers during the two winters, the two later growing seasons and the entire 2 years, whereas this trend was reversed during the two early growing seasons. The pairwise ratios among C, N, and P converged as the litter decomposition proceeded. Compared with the closed canopy, the gap centers displayed higher C: P and N: P ratio but a lower C: N ratio as the decomposition proceeded. Alpine forest gaps accelerate the release of C, N, and P in decomposing shrub litter, implying that reduced snow cover resulting from vanishing gaps may inhibit the release of these elements in alpine forests.

Currently, numerous studies have focused on the model plant Arabidopsis in the KAR research field, rather than on crops. Thus the regulatory mechanisms underlying KAR regulation of crop seed germination are largely unknown. Here, we report that KAR delayed soybean seed germination through enhancing abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, while impairing gibberellin (GA) biogenesis. Interestingly, KAR only retarded soybean seed germination under shaded conditions, rather than under dark and white light conditions, which differs from in Arabidopsis. Phytohormone quantification showed that KAR enhanced ABA biogenesis while impairing GA biosynthesis during the seed imbibition process, and subsequently, the ratio of active GA4 to ABA was significantly reduced. Further qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcription pattern of genes involved in ABA and GA metabolic pathways are consistent with the hormonal measurements. Finally, fluridone, an ABA biogenesis inhibitor, remarkably rescued the delayed-germination phenotype of KAR-treatment; and paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, inhibited soybean seed germination. Taken together, these evidences suggest that KAR inhibit soybean seed germination by mediating the ratio between GA and ABA biogenesis.

Trial 1, thirty-six 1-year-old Qinghai high plateau yaks (body weight 38-83.2 kg) were randomly chosen for body weight and jugular blood samples collection. The relationship between body weight and serum GHRH (P < 0.05, R = 0.45), GH (P < 0.05, R = 0.47), IGF-1 (P < 0.05, R = 0.62) was significantly correlated in yaks colonies with lighter body weights. Trial 2, fifteen 1-year-old Qinghai high plateau yaks with growth retardation (average body weight 54.8 +/- 8.24 kg) were randomly selected and assigned to negative control group (NG), GHRP-2 injection group (GG) and cysteamine feeding group (CG), with 5 yaks per group. Another five 1-year-old Qinghai high plateau yaks with normal growth performance (average body weight 75.3 +/- 2.43 kg) were selected as positive control group (PG). The average daily gain (ADG) of the GG and CG were significantly higher than those in the PG and NG (P < 0.05). Both GHRP-2 and CS administration significantly enhanced the myofiber diameter and area of skeletal muscle (P<0.05). GHRP-2 significantly enhanced the serum GH and IGF-1 levels (P < 0.05), and up-regulated GHR, IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA expression in the liver and skeletal muscle (P < 0.05), enhanced the mRNA expression of PI3K, AKt and mTOR in the skeletal muscle (P<0.05). CS significantly reduced the serum SS levels and the hypothalamus SS mRNA expression (P < 0.05), and enhanced GHR and IGF-1 mRNA expression in the liver (P < 0.05), decreased the mRNA expression of muscle atrophy F-box (Atrogin-1) and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1) mRNA (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Growth retardation in yaks was primarily due to somatotropic axis hormones secretion deficiency. Both GHRP-2 and CS administration can accelerate growth performance and GH, IGF-1 secretion in yaks with growth retardation. GHRP-2 enhanced muscle protein deposition mainly by up-regulated the protein synthesis pathways, whereas CS worked mainly by down-regulated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

To characterize the innate antiviral immune response against AIV H9N2 strain infection in geese as well as the probable relationship between the expression of immune-related genes and the distribution of viral antigens, we investigated the levels of immune related gene transcription both in AIV H9N2 strain-infected geese and in vitro. The patterns of viral location and the tissue distribution of CD4- and CD8u-positive cells were concurrently detected by immunohistochemical staining, which revealed respiratory and digestive organs as the primary sites of antigen-positive signals. Average AIV H9N2 viral loads were detected in the feces, Harderian gland (HG), and trachea, where higher copy numbers were detected compared with the rectum. Our results suggested the strong induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression compared with interferons (IFNs). Notably, in most tissues from the AIV H9N2 strain infected birds, IFN alpha and IFN gamma gene transcripts were differentially expressed. However, inverse changes in IFN alpha and IFN gamma expression after AIV H9N2 strain infection were observed in vitro. Taken together, the results suggest that AIV H9N2 is widely distributed in multiple tissues, efficiently induces inflammatory cytokines in the HG and spleen of goslings and inversely influences type I and II IFN expression both in vivo and in vitro. The findings of this study further our understanding of host defense mechanisms and the pathogenesis of the H9N2 influenza virus in geese.

The present study aimed to determine the effects of different dietary n-6/n-3 ratios on the reproductive performance ofn breeding boars. Thirty-two boars with body weights of 15.0 +/- 1.4 kg were divided into four treatments (C, T1, T2, T3) and fed diets with different n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios (29.06: 1, 20.07:1, 1: 1, 1:17.96, respectively) for 174 days. Results: The highest testis index was observed for treatment T2. Sperm density and total sperm number per ejaculate in the T2 treatment were significantly higher than those in all other treatments, whereas the sperm deformity rate was the lowest. Interestingly, the fatty acid compositions and ratios of sperm were consistent with dietary treatments. Acid phosphatase and fructose concentration of seminal plasma, and the total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase of sperm in T2 were higher than those in other treatments. The concentration of testosterone and prostaglandin E2 increased in boars fed on diets supplemented with fatty acids as compared with boars subjected to the C grouptreatment, reaching a peak at n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios of 1:1. Furthermore, higher expression of Delta(6)-fatty acid desaturase and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha in spermatozoa of the T2 treatment were observed, indicating more vigorous metabolism and intensive hormonal regulation. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the ideal n-6/n-3 ratio in the diet of breeding boars is 1: 1, and proper balancing of n-6/n-3 fatty acids plays an important role in male reproduction.

Phenylpropanoid compounds play an important role in plant stress resistance; however, the mechanism of their synthesis is not fully understood, especially in regard to the expression and regulation of key genes. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first key enzyme involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism, and it has a significant effect on the synthesis of important phenylpropanoid compounds. According to the results of sequence alignments and functional prediction, we selected two conserved R2R3MYB transcription factors as candidate genes for the regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism. The two candidate R2R3-MYB genes, which we named ZmMYB111 and ZmMYB148, were cloned, and then their structural characteristics and phylogenetic placement were predicted and analyzed. In addition, a series of evaluations were performed, including expression profiles, subcellular localization, transcription activation, protein DNA interaction, and transient expression in maize endosperm. Our results indicated that both ZmMYB111 and ZmMYB148 are indeed R2R3-MYB transcription factors and that they may play a regulatory role in PAL gene expression.

Here, we researched the biological characteristics of cheY deletion mutant in Haemophilus parasuis, and found that the growth rate of this mutant was significantly slower compared with serovar 13 wild strain EP3. Additionally, the cheY mutant didn't show obvious sensitivity to porcine sera. The results of biofilm formation assay showed that H. parasuis cheY mutant produced less biofilm mass compared with wild strain. The H. parasuis cheY mutant reduced autoagglutination obviously. These findings were vital for revealing the function of cheY in growth, biofilm formation and autoagglutination. Thus, cheY plays a crucial role in growth and colonization in vivo of H. parasuis.

However, limited attention has been focused on the total phenol dynamics in foliar litter in relation to forest gaps. Here, the foliar litter of six representative tree species was incubated on the forest floor from the gap center to the closed canopy of an alpine Minjiang fir (Abies faxoniana) forest in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and eastern Tibetan Plateau. The dynamics of total phenol concentration in the incubated litter was measured from November 2012 to October 2014. Over two-year incubation, 78.22% to 94.06% of total phenols were lost from the foliar litter, but 52.08% to 86.41% of this occurred in the first year. Forest gaps accelerated the loss of total phenols in the foliar litter in the winter, although they inhibited the loss of total phenols during the growing season in the first year. In comparison with the effects of forest gaps, the variations of litter quality among different species were much stronger on the dynamics of total phenols in the second year. Overall, the loss of total phenols in the foliar litter was slightly higher in both the canopy gap and the expanded gap than in the gap center and under the closed canopy. The results suggest that the predicted decline in snow cover resulting from winter warming or vanishing gaps caused by forest regeneration will retard the loss of total phenol content in the foliar litter of alpine forest ecosystems, especially in the first decomposition year.

To date, it is not fully understood how miRNAs regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. This study aimed at the identification of the role of miRNA-27b in mitochondria biogenesis. The mitochondria content in C2C12 cells was significantly increased during myogenic differentiation and accompanied by a marked decrease of miRNA-27b expression. Furthermore, the expression of the predicted target gene of miRNA-27b, forkhead box j3 (Foxj3), was also increased during myogenic differentiation. Luciferase activity assays confirmed that miRNA-27b directly targets the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Foxj3. Overexpression of miRNA-27b provoked a decrease of mitochondria content and diminished expression of related mitochondrial genes and Foxj3 both at mRNA and protein levels. The expression levels of downstream genes of Foxj3, such as Mef2c, PGC1 alpha, NRF1 and mtTFA, were also decreased in C2C12 cells upon overexpression of miRNA-27b. These results suggested that miRNA-27b may affect mitochondria biogenesis by down-regulation of Foxj3 during myocyte differentiation.

However, progress in glycomics has considerably lagged behind genomics and proteomics, due in part to the enormous challenges in analysis of glycans. Here we present a new integrated and automated microfluidic lectin barcode platform to substantially improve the performance of lectin array for focused glycomic profiling. The chip design and flow control were optimized to promote the lectin-glycan binding kinetics and speed of lectin microarray. Moreover, we established an on-chip lectin assay which employs a very simple blocking method to effectively suppress the undesired background due to lectin binding of antibodies. Using this technology, we demonstrated focused differential profiling of tissue-specific glycosylation changes of a biomarker, CA125 protein purified from ovarian cancer cell line and different tissues from ovarian cancer patients in a fast, reproducible, and high-throughput fashion. Highly sensitive CA125 detection was also demonstrated with a detection limit much lower than the clinical cutoff value for cancer diagnosis. This microfluidic platform holds the potential to integrate with sample preparation functions to construct a fully integrated "sample-to-answer" microsystem for focused differential glycomic analysis. Thus, our technology should present a powerful tool in support of rapid advance in glycobiology and glycobiomarker development.

Tianfu Black rabbits had the heaviest head, skin, thoracic viscera and commercial carcass percentage (p<0.05). In addition, Tianfu Black had the highest pH(0) (h) value, followed by the Champagne and Hyla breeds (p<0.01) in the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles. Tianfu Black had a higher a* (0 h and 24 h) than the other two breeds in both longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles (p<0.05). The Hyla, Champagne, and Tianfu Black breeds showed a similar pattern of differences for meat quality traits (pH, L*, a* and b*) measured in fresh meat (0 h) and meat stored for 24 h. Hyla had the highest IMF values of the three breeds (p<0.01). The lower intramuscular fat of Tianfu Black and Champagne rabbits gives them an advantage over Hyla rabbits among most consumers seeking lean rabbit meat.

In this work, we report a facile method for preparation of nitrogen-doped graphene scrolls (N-GSS) through acoustic cavitation, which can not only realize graphene nitrogen doping but also simultaneously result in its scrolled topological structure and improvement of reduction degree. As a metal-free electrocatalyst, the prepared N-GSS showed good electrocatalytic activity towards oxidation of hydrogen peroxide with the sensitivity of 87.8 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Then N-GSS was employed as a matrix for glucose oxidase (GOD) loading, and the fabricated biosensor also exhibited excellent analytical characteristics, such as a high sensitivity (55.2 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), wide linear range (2 mu M to 3.56 mM, R = 0.999) and low detection limit (1 mu M).

However, microsatellites are not always available for the species to be studied and their isolation could be time- and cost-consuming. To investigate transferability in cross species applications, 102 primer pairs previously developed in ryegrass and tall fescue were amplified across three allogamous ryegrass species including Lolium rigidum, Lolium perenne and Lolium multiflorum. Their highly transferability (100%) were evidenced. While, most of these markers were multiple loci, only 17 loci were selected for a robust, single locus pattern, which may be due to the recentness of the genome duplication or duplicated genomic regions, as well as speciation. A total of 87 alleles were generated with an average of 5.1 per locus. The mean polymorphism information content (PIC) and observed heterozygosity (Ho) values at genus was 0.5532 and 0.5423, respectively. Besides, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that all three levels contributed significantly to the overall genetic variation, with the species level contributing the least (P < 0.001). Also, the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averaging dendrogram (UPGMA), Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis and the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that accessions within species always tended to the same cluster firstly and then to related species. The results showed that these markers developed in related species are transferable efficiently across species, and likely to be useful in analyzing genetic diversity. (C) 2016 Academie des sciences.

Effects of Dietary Supplementation of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate on Sow Performance and mRNA Expression of Myogenic Markers in Skeletal Muscle of Neonatal Piglets	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article							METHYL BUTYRATE SUPPLEMENTATION; LACTATING PRIMIPAROUS SOWS; LATE-GESTATION; PROTEIN-METABOLISM; BODY-COMPOSITION; FEEDING LEVEL; GROWTH; LEUCINE; GENE; PIGS	The effects of dietary beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation during gestation on reproductive performance of sows and the mRNA expression of myogenic markers in skeletal muscle of neonatal pigs were determined. At day 35 of gestation, a total of 20 sows (Landrace 9 Yorkshire, at third parity) were randomly assigned to two groups, with each group receiving either a basal diet or the same diet supplemented with 4 g/day beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate calcium (HMB-Ca) until parturition. At parturition, the total and live litter size were not markedly different between treatments, however, the sows fed HMB diet had a decreased rate of stillborn piglets compared with the sows fed the control (CON) diets (p < 0.05). In addition, piglets from the sows fed HMB diet tended to have an increased birth weight (p = 0.08), and a reduced rate of low birth weight piglets (p = 0.05) compared with piglets from the CON sows. Nevertheless, lower feed intake during lactation was observed in the sows fed the HMB diet compared with those on the CON diet (p < 0.01). The relative weights of the longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) muscle were higher (p < 0.05) in neonatal pigs from the HMB than the CON sows. Furthermore, maternal HMB treatment increased the mRNA levels of the myogenic genes, including muscle regulatory factor-4 (MRF4, p < 0.05), myogenic differentiation factor (MyoD) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1, p < 0.01). In conclusion, dietary HMB supplementation to sows at 4 g/day from day 35 of gestation to term significantly improves pregnancy outcomes and increases the expression of myogenic genes in skeletal muscle of neonatal piglets, but reduces feed intake of sows during lactation.

Wilson) forest in a transitional area located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Over the first year of litter decomposition, the litter exhibited absolute cellulose loss and absolute lignin accumulation except for the red birch litter. The changes in litter cellulose and lignin were significantly affected by the interactions among gap position, period and species. Litter cellulose exhibited a greater loss in the winter with the highest daily loss rate observed during the snow cover period. Both cellulose and lignin exhibited greater changes under the deep snow cover at the gap center in the winter, but the opposite pattern occurred under the closed canopy in the growing season. The results suggest that decreased snowpack seasonality due to winter warming may limit litter cellulose and lignin degradation in alpine forest ecosystems, which could further inhibit litter decomposition. As a result, the ongoing winter warming and gap vanishing would slow soil carbon sequestration from foliar litter in cold biomes.

The distribution and morphological characteristics of VIP of BF in Chinese yellow quails at different ages.(0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 32 and 36 weeks) were observed using the immunohistochemical streptavidin-biotin complex method after obtaining the sections and subsequent immunohistochemical staining. Then semi-quantitative analysis of the mean optical density (MOD), integral optical density (IOD) and mean gray value (MGV) for VIP immunoreactivity was performed through Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. VIP was observed at all ages in Chinese yellow quail's BF. It formed a long fusiform, oval or granular type structures with clear outline mainly localized in the submucosa, muscular layer and serosal connective tissue. At 25 weeks of age, the MOD value of VIP-positive cells reached the maximum, and then gradually reduced, while the MGV value was the lowest. We observed the localization and morphological characteristics of VIP in BF of Chinese yellow quail. VIP was mainly localized in the submucosa, muscular layer and serosal connective tissue of BF. Findings of this study may provide further understanding of the function of VIP in BF of Chinese yellow quails.

Twelve desexed Boer crossbred goats were used in a replicated 3x3 Latin square design with 23-d periods. Dietary treatments were basal diet (control, no cellulase), basal diet plus 2 g unitary cellulase/kg of total mixed ration dry matter (DM), and basal diet plus 2 g compound cellulase/kg of total mixed ration DM. Three stages of feeding trials were used corresponding to the three treatments, each comprised 23 d, with the first 14 d as the preliminary period and the following 9 d as formal trial period for metabolism trial. Total collection of feces and urine were conducted from the 4th d of the formal trial, and gas exchange measures were determined in indirect respiratory chambers in the last 3 d of the formal trial. Results showed that cellulase addition had no effect (p>0.05) on nutrient digestibility. Dietary supplementation of cellulase did not affect (p>0.05) N intake and retention in goats. Gross energy (GE) intake, fecal energy and urinary energy excretion, heat production were not affected (p>0.05) by the cellulase supplementation. Total methane emission (g/d), CH4 emission as a proportion of live weight or feed intake (DM, organic matter [OM], digestible DM or digestible OM), or CH4 energy output (CH4-E) as a proportion of energy intake (GE, digestible energy, or metabolizable energy), were similar (p>0.05) among treatments. There was a significant (p<0.001) relationship between CH4 and live weight (y = 0.645x+0.2, R-2 = 0.54), CH4 and DM intake (y = 16.7x+1.4, R-2 = 0.51), CH4 and OM intake (y = 18.8x+1.3, R-2 = 0.51) and CH4-E and GE intake. Results from this study revealed that dietary supplementation of cellulase may have no effect on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention, energy metabolism, and methane emission in goat.

A field litter decomposition experiment was conducted during the winter in an alpine forest river on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Concentrations, release rates, and release rate per day of chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were investigated in the foliar litter of willow (Salix paraplesia), azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), cypress (Sabina saltuaria), and larch (Larix mastersiana) during the prefreezing, freezing, and thawing periods. Concentrations of Cr in willow, cypress, and larch; Cd in all foliar litter types; and Pb in azalea foliar litter increased following incubation over an entire winter. Both Cr and Pb showed patterns of accumulation during the prefreezing period and patterns of release in the freezing and thawing periods, but Cd showed accumulation in all three periods. Water temperature, pH, flow velocity, conductivity, and nutrient availability in the river were significantly related to the dynamics of these heavy metals in the decomposing foliar litter. The heavy metal accumulation pattern in running water suggested an absolute increase in metal mass, indicating that litter may act as an efficient metal "cleaner" and contribute to an ecosystem's capacity for self-purification.

FRUIT; LEAVES; QUALITY; CHITIN	Chitosan has been proposed to elicit defense responses in plants. In this study, we evaluated the potential roles of chitosan as a fertilizer supplement to stimulate Begonia x hiemalis Fotsch 'Schwabenland Red' growth and resistance to gray mold caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. We evaluated the effect of treatment with fertilizer containing various ratios of N, P, and K in combination with different concentrations of chitosan on plant growth and disease resistance. Of the sixteen treatments examined, the treatment consisting of an N:P:K ratio of 2.8:1.0:1.4 and chitosan concentration of 0.10 g center dot L-1 had the most positive effect on plant height, crown development, and other horticultural traits (i.e., flowering time, flower diameter, and flower quantity) at 20, 40, and 60 days after treatment, and significantly reduced the severity and incidence of gray mold compared to the controls and other treatments at 60 days after treatment. Furthermore, this treatment markedly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activities. Based on these findings, we suggest that the chemical composition of the fertilizer and concentration of chitosan used affect the degree to which Begonia x hiemalis growth is stimulated and pathogen resistance is improved.

A total of 540 young grass carp (255.63 +/- 0.41 g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of niacin (3.95, 14.92, 24.98, 35.03, 44.97 and 55.01 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks. Results observed that niacin deficiency decreased lysozyme (LA) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, and complement 3 (C3) content in the intestine (P < 0.05), down -regulated mRNA levels of liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2), hepcidin, interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta 1 and inhibitor of kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) (P < 0.05), up-regulated tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interferon gamma 2, interleukin 8, nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF-kappa B P65), IKB kinase alpha (IKK alpha), I kappa B kinase gamma (IKK gamma) and I kappa B kinase gamma (IK gamma) in all intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05). In addition, niacin deficiency increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) contents, decreased glutathione content, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities in the intestine of young grass carp (P < 0.05). Additionally, niacin deficiency decreased mRNA levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, GPx, CAT, GST, GR, Claudin b, Claudin 3, Claudin c, Occludin, ZO-1, Claudin 15 and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P < 0.05), and increased Claudin 12, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein la (Keap1a), myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) mRNA expression levels in the intestine of young grass carp (P < 0.05), while the mRNA level of Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1b (Keap1b) did not change (P > 0.05). In conclusion, niacin deficiency decreased intestinal mucosal immune and intestinal physical function, as well as regulated mRNA levels of NF-kappa B P65, I kappa B alpha, IKK alpha, IKK beta, IKK gamma, Nrf2, Keap1a, p38 MAPK and MLCK in the intestine of young grass carp. Based on the broken-line model analysis of intestinal lysozyme activity, the requirement of niacin for young grass carp (255.63 +/- 0.41 g) were estimated to be 39.80 mg/kg diet.

Fish were orally administered with seven different diets containing 0 g kg(-1) (control diet), 8.0, 16.0 and 32.0 g kg(-1) OKGM and L-OKGM diets for 60 days prior to injection. After 60 days, the control and the treated fish were intraperitoneally injected with 0.2 ml PBS or 2 x 10(7) cfu/ml bacteria per fish and sampled at time 6 h post-injection. The results showed that the serum lysozyme activity and complement C-3 level of fish fed 8.0 g kg(-1) L-OKGM was significantly increased after bacterial infection. Moreover, the injection with A. hydrophila generally up-regulated the expression of all measured genes when compared to their corresponding controls. When compared with the control group, the expression of TLR22, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was significantly increased in fish fed OKGM and L-OKGM diet after bacterial injection. Furthermore, the L-OKGM diet showed higher activity to trigger the immune response against bacteria, especially the low dosage L-OKGM diet. The results suggested that both of OKGM and L-OKGM are promising feed additive for S. prenanti in aquaculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results demonstrated for the first time that MI deficiency depressed the lysozyme and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities and the complement 3 (C3) and C4 contents in the head kidney and spleen compared with the optimal MI levels, indicating that MI deficiency decreased the immunity of these important fish immune organs. The depression in immunity due to MI deficiency was partially related to oxidative damage [indicated by increases in the malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) contents] that was in turn partially due to the decreased glutathione (GSH) content and the disturbances in antioxidant enzyme activities [total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZnSOD, MnSOD, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR)]. MI deficiency inhibited the antioxidant-related gene transcription [CuZnSOD, MnSOD, CAT, GPx1a, GR and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)] in the head kidney and spleen following infection of the fish with A. hydrophila. The oxidative damage due to MI deficiency also resulted in the inhibition of proliferation-associated signalling (cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin E and E2F4). Thus, MI deficiency partially inhibited damage repair. Excessive MI exhibited negative effects that were similar to MI deficiency, whereas the optimal MI content reversed those indicators. These observations indicated that an MI deficiency or excess could cause depression of the immune system that might be partially related to oxidative damage, antioxidant disturbances, and the inhibition of the proliferation-associated signalling in the head kidney and spleen following infection of fish with A. hydrophila.

The aim of this study was to characterize PHB in Echinococcus granulosus (EgPHB), a harmful cestode parasite of humans, many livestock species, and wild animals. We found that EgPHB is a conserved SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) domain-containing protein, consisting of 289 amino acids, which shares 42.66-99.31% identity with PHBs from other parasites and mammals. EgPHB was located mainly in the tegument issue of protoscoleces, in the inner body of adult worms, and was expressed widely in the germinal layer. This is the first report on prohibitin from E. granulosus, and EgPHB is considered to be a valuable protein to study more in the future.

According to the combined ARDRA and IGS-RFLP (CACAI) cluster analysis, Rhizobium, Pararhizobium and Mesorhizobium isolates outnumbered Bradyrhizobium isolates. In general, the isolates representing the same species from the same site clustered together. Furthermore, the four Desmodium species were all nodulated by more than one rhizobial species. AFLP and phenotypic analyses showed that the 34 isolates represented at least 32 distinct strains. None of the strains were found from more than one site or host, indicating a high degree of rhizobial diversity in Panxi. In the multilocus sequence analysis, the isolates were assigned to Pararhizobium giardinii, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Mesorhizobium septentrionale, and to undescribed species of the genera Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Agrobacterium.

The Q-dots form kind of "satellites" on the surface of the C-dot@SiO2 nanoparticles. The nanoparticle conjugates display dual emission (with peaks at 441 nm and 605 nm) under UV excitation and were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis absorption and FTIR spectroscopy. The C-dot@SiO2@Q-dots hybrid spheres are shown to represent a ratiometric fluorescent probe for Cu2+ in that the emission of the Q-dots is quenched by Cu2+, while the emission of the C-dots (which are coated with SiO2) is not quenched. The ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 441 and 655 nm is related to the concentration of Cu2+ in the range from 0.1 to 1.0 mu M, with a 0.096 mu M lower detection limit. The ratiometric probe was successfully applied to the determination of Cu2+ in (spiked) vegetable and fruit samples by the standard addition method, and recoveries ranged from 96.7 to 100.8 %.

Genetic analyses also revealed that BAK1 and its closest homolog BAK1-LIKE1 (BKK1) regulate a BR-independent cell-death control pathway. The double null mutant bak1 bkk1 displays a salicylic acid- and light-dependent cell-death phenotype even without pathogen invasion. Molecular mechanisms of the spontaneous cell death mediated by BAK1 and BKK1 remain unknown. Here we report our identification of a suppressor of bak1 bkk1 (sbb1-1). Genetic analyses indicated that cell-death symptoms in a weak double mutant, bak1-3 bkk1-1, were completely suppressed by the loss-of-function mutation in SBB1, which encodes a nucleoporin (NUP)85-like protein. Genetic analyses also demonstrated that individually knocking out three other nucleoporin genes from the SBB1-located sub-complex was also able to rescue the cell-death phenotype of bak1-3 bkk1-1. In addition, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, DRH1, was identified in the same protein complex as SBB1 via a proteomic approach. The drh1 mutation also rescues the cell-death symptoms of bak1-3 bkk1-1. Further analyses indicated that export of poly(A)(+) RNA was greatly blocked in the nup and drh1 mutants, resulting in accumulation of significant levels of mRNAs in the nuclei. Over-expression of a bacterial NahG gene to inactivate salicylic acid also rescues the cell-death phenotype of bak1-3 bkk1-1. Mutants suppressing cell-death symptoms always showed greatly reduced salicylic acid contents. These results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, especially of molecules directly or indirectly involved in endogenous salicylic acid accumulation, is critical in BAK1- and BKK1-mediated cell-death control.

To understand the role of beta-1, 3-1, 4-glucanase played on B. velezensis about the mechanism which exerts effect on fungi, we isolated and cloned the beta-1, 3-1, 4-glucanase gene (Bglu1) from B. velezensis ZJ20. The Bglu1 open reading frame was 732 bp that encoded a protein with 243 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 27.3 kDa. The same gene without the signal peptide, termed Bglu2, was also cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21. Among the two variants, only Bglu2 protein was expressed. Purified Bglu2 could be eluted with imidazole solution at concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 mM although the highest expression was observed at 150 and 200 mM and the purest was at 500 mM. In addition, activity of the crude enzyme was 1527 U ml(-1) and the highest activity of the purified enzyme was 1706 U ml(-1). The purified beta-1, 3-1, 4-glucanase had activity on a wide range of pH and temperatures and displayed optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 35 degrees C. More importantly, the mycelial morphology of three pathogenic fungi was destroyed by the purified beta-1, 3- 1, 4-glucanase. In conclusion, beta-1, 3- 1, 4-glucanase from B. velezensis ZJ20 can be highly expressed in E. coli BL21 and the recombinant protein is pathogenic to fungi.

A wide array of sheep breeds with abundant phenotypic diversity exists including domestication and selection as well as the indigenous breeds may harbor specific features as a result of adaptation to their environment. The objective of this study was to investigate the population structure of indigenous sheep in a large geographic location of the Chinese mainland. Six microsatellites were genotyped for 611 individuals from 14 populations. The mean number of alleles (+/- SD) ranged from 7.00 +/- 3.69 in Gangba sheep to 10.50 +/- 4.23 in Tibetan sheep. The observed heterozygote frequency (+/- SD) within a population ranged from 0.58 +/- 0.03 in Gangba sheep to 0.71 +/- 0.03 in Zazakh sheep and Minxian black fur sheep. In addition, there was a low pairwise difference among the Minxian black fur sheep, Mongolian sheep, Gansu alpine merino, and Lanzhou fat-tailed sheep. Bayesian analysis with the program STRUCTURE showed support for 3 clusters, revealing a vague genetic clustering pattern with geographic location. The results of the current study inferred high genetic diversity within these native sheep in the Chinese mainland.

A recent study has confirmed that SPX plays an important role in the feeding regulation. However, the reports about SPX are very limited. In the present study, we characterized the structure, distribution and mRNA expression responses to feeding status of SPX in Ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti). The full-length cDNA of Ya-fish SPX was 1330 base pairs (bp), which encoded 106 amino acid residues. These residues contained a 31-amino acid signal peptide region and a 14-amino acid mature peptide. The sequence alignment demonstrated that the Ya-fish SPX showed high conservation with other species. Our data revealed that SPX was widely expressed in all test tissues. The highest expression of SPX mRNA was observed in Ya-fish forebrain. Compared with the Ya-fish SPX mRNA expression in the forebrain between the preprandial and postprandial groups, the fed group was prominently increased than unfed groups after a meal, while the unfed group at 1 and 3 h substantially decreased than preprandial groups (P < 0.01). In addition, SPX mRNA expression in forebrain was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) during fasting for a week and sharply increased (P < 0.01) after refeeding on the 7th day, and then return to normal level on the 9th day. These results point toward that SPX mRNA expression is regulated by metabolic status or feeding conditions in Ya-fish.

In this study, effects of RSG on duck preadipocyte differentiation were investigated. We detected cell viability using CCK method and measured the mRNA expression of key genes and protein contents involved in preadipocyte differentiation via qRT-PCR and ELISA kits, respectively. Lipid accumulation was determined via Oil Red O staining extraction, and lipolysis was measured by free fatty acid release in the culture medium. Results showed that high concentrations of RSG (50, 100 mu M) significantly decreased cell viability. RSG (0-10 mu M) enhanced preadipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and thus promoted lipid accumulation. With increasing RSG concentrations, cellular lipid content gradually decreased and preadipocyte differentiation was suppressed. mRNA expression of key genes involved in preadipocyte differentiation including FAS, ACC, SCD1, LPL, PLIN, SREBP1c, and ATGL were significantly upregulated by RSG, and the protein content of FAS, ACC, and ATGL were also increased in response to RSG. Meanwhile, RSG exposure increased free fatty acid release in the culture medium. Similar results were obtained in response to RSG plus oleate that was used to induce cell differentiation. These findings suggest that RSG does not promote duck preadipocyte viability, but it does induce duck preadipocyte differentiation, which might influence both lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying ABA and GA antagonism still needs to be determined. Here, we report that ABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) is a central factor in GA/ABA homeostasis and antagonism in post-germination stages. ABI4 overexpression in Arabidopsis (OE-ABI4) leads to developmental defects including a decrease in plant height and poor seed production. The transcription of a key ABA biosynthetic gene, NCED6, and of a key GA catabolic gene, GA2ox7, is significantly enhanced by ABI4 overexpression. ABI4 activates NCED6 and GA2ox7 transcription by directly binding to the promoters, and genetic analysis revealed that mutation in these two genes partially rescues the dwarf phenotype of ABI4 overexpressing plants. Consistently, ABI4 overexpressing seedlings have a lower GA/ABA ratio than the wild type. We further show that ABA induces GA2ox7 transcription while GA represses NCED6 expression in an ABI4-dependent manner; and that ABA stabilizes the ABI4 protein whereas GA promotes its degradation. Taken together, these results suggest that ABA and GA antagonize each other by oppositely acting on ABI4 transcript and protein levels.

Four treatments were used in the experiment: ungrafted (UG), self-rooted grafting by the same S. photeinocarpum seedling (SG), self-rooted grafting by two different development stages of S. photeinocarpum seedlings (DG), and grafting on the rootstock of wild potato (PG). SG and DG decreased the root, scion stem, leaf, whole shoot, and whole plant biomasses compared with UG, but increased the rootstock stem biomass, while only PG increased the root and whole plant biomasses. SG and DG increased the Cd contents in the different organs of S. photeinocarpum compared with UG, while PG decreased the Cd content compared with UG. The Cd extraction by the whole plant of S. photeinocarpum was ranked as DG>SG>UG>PG. Additionally, the antioxidant enzyme activities in SG and DG were enhanced compared with UG, while that of PG was reduced compared with UG. The grafting increased the DNA methylation levels and changed the methylation patterns of S. photeinocarpum compared with UG. Therefore, SG and DG can increase the Cd accumulation in S. photeinocarpum, which can be used for the phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil.

This study has developed a rapid one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for the detection of PToV. A set of four primers specific to six regions within the PToV's highly conserved fragment of the M gene was designed for use with the RT-LAMP assay. The RT-LAMP assay was sensitive with a detection limit of 1 x 10(1) copies/mu L, which was 100-fold higher than reverse transcription PCR. No cross-reaction was observed with other similar viruses. A total of 175 clinical specimens were collected from the Sichuan province, and PToV was detected by the established RT-LAMP assay with a positive rate of 39.2% (69/175). This study developed the first rapid, sensitive, simple, cost-effective and accurate method for the detection of PToV. The results show that the RT-LAMP assay is highly feasible in clinical settings.

Among these are the maize kauralexins. However, no ent-kaurene synthases (KSs) have been identified from maize. The maize gibberellin-deficient dwarf-5 (d5) mutant has been associated with a loss of KS activity. The relevant genetic lesion has been previously mapped, and was found here to correlate with the location of the KS-like gene ZmKSL3. Intriguingly, this forms part of a tandem array with two other terpene synthases (TPSs). Although one of these, ZmTPS1, has been previously reported to encode a sesquiterpene synthase, and both ZmTPS1 and that encoded by the third gene, ZmKSL5, have lost theN-terminal g-domain prototypically associated with KS(L)s, all three genes fall within the KS(L) or TPS-e subfamily. Here it is reported that all three genes encode enzymes that are targeted to the plastid in planta, where diterpenoid biosynthesis is initiated, and which all readily catalyze the production of ent-kaurene. Consistent with the closer phylogenetic relationship of ZmKSL3 with previously identified KSs from cereals, only transcription of this gene is affected in d5 plants. On the other hand, the expression of all three of these genes is inducible, suggesting a role in more specialized metabolism, such as that of the kauralexins. Thus, these results clarify not only gibberellin phytohormone, but also diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in this important cereal crop plant.

A total of 200 one-day-old avian male broilers were randomly divided into 4 equal groups of 50 each and were fed for 21 days as follows: a control diet and three AFB(1) diets containing 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg AFB(1)/kg diet. Consumption of AFB(1) diets induced oxidative stress in the spleen of chicken as evidenced by reduced glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase activities, decreased glutathione contents, and increased malondialdehyde contents in explaining the pathogenesis. Flow cytometer method and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling assay revealed that the apoptotic splenocytes were increased in AFB(1) groups. The results suggest that AFB1 induced excessive apoptosis of splenic lymphocytes, which is correlated with increased oxidative stress. The present results may be helpful for explaining the pathogenesis of AFB(1)-induced immunosuppression.

Given the increased prevalence of drug resistance strains, vaccination is the best strategy to prevent R. anatipestifer infection in ducklings. In this study, we identified a gene in R. anatipestifer (B739-2187) that can restore the resistance of the Salmonella phoP mutant to polymyxin B using genetic complementation. Furthermore, the deletion of B739-2187 in R. anatipestifer resulted in a mutant exhibiting increased sensitivity to polymyxin B. The R. anatipestifer B739-2187 mutant did not exhibit phenotypic defects, as indicated by its growth curve, lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane protein profiles, and attachment and invasion of duck embryo fibroblast cells. The duck animal experiments demonstrated that the deletion of B739-2187 significantly decreased the virulence of R. anatipestifer, and the B739-2187 mutant provided 100% protection against challenge with wild-type R. anatipestifer, exhibiting the characteristics of an ideal live vaccine.

However, the mechanism of MeJA-mediated stilbenoid biosynthesis remains unclear. Genomic information for Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (P. multiflorum) is currently unavailable. To obtain insight into the global regulation mechanism of MeJA in the steady state of stilbene glucoside production (26 h after MeJA elicitation), especially on stilbene glucoside biosynthesis, we sequenced the transcriptomes of MeJA-treated and untreated P. multiflorum roots and obtained more than 51 million clean reads, from which 79,565 unigenes were obtained by de novo assembly. 56,972 unigenes were annotated against databases including Nr, Nt, Swiss-Prot, KEGG and COG. 18,677 genes expressed differentially between untreated and treated roots. Expression level analysis indicated that a large number of genes were associated with plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, stilbenoid backbone biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. 15 known genes involved in the biosynthesis of stilbenoid backbone were found with 7 genes showing increased transcript abundance following elicitation of MeJA. The significantly up (down)-regulated changes of 70 genes in stilbenoid biosynthesis were validated by qRT-PCR assays and PCR product sequencing. According to the expression changes and the previously proposed enzyme functions, multiple candidates for the unknown steps in stilbene glucoside biosynthesis were identified. We also found some genes putatively involved in the transcription factors. This comprehensive description of gene expression information could greatly facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MeJA-mediated stilbenoid biosynthesis in P. multiflorum roots. Our results shed new light on the global regulation mechanism by which MeJA regulates the physiology of P. multiflorum roots and is helpful to understand how MeJA elicits other plant species besides P. multiflorum.

Riemerella anatipestifer can be grown on blood-enriched media, in vitro, which provides a hemin source essential for the sustainment of R. anatipestifer and activation of hemin-uptake systems. However, the genes associated with hemin uptake cannot be identified exclusively through genome sequence analysis. Here, we show that R. anatipestifer encodes outer-membrane hemin-binding proteins. Hemin-binding proteins were identified in the cytoplasm with apparent molecular mass of similar to 45/37/33/23/20/13 kDa, and outer membrane with apparent molecular mass of similar to 90/70/60/50/15 kDa by batch affinity chromatography and hemin-blotting assays. Our results indicate that these proteins are involved in hemin acquisition. Finally, hemin-binding assay further showed that R. anatipestifer can bind hemin and this capability is increased in iron limited medium, indicating the hemin-uptake system of R. anatipestifer was regulated by iron.

A considerable amount of luffa sponge biomass can be grown in a vertical direction with approximately 70% polysaccharide content and low lignin content. When concentrated H3PO4 was employed to pretreat luffa sponge, hemicelluloses were the most sensitive component, followed by cellulose and lignin. Hemicellulose solubilization and cellulose loss positively responded to the elevated temperature, time, H3PO4 concentration, and dosage for pretreatment. However, lignin solubilization was not affected greatly. Although the initial hydrolysis rate was accelerated by increasing pretreatment temperature, the final glucose conversion was reduced as temperature was raised higher than 50 degrees C. Prolonging pretreatment time was positively correlated to enzymatic digestibility. When H3PO4 concentration was lower than 80%, the final glucose conversion was increased with increasing H3PO4 concentration. Increasing H3PO4 concentration to 84% for pretreatment caused the final glucose conversion to decrease slightly, although the hydrolysis rate was initially accelerated. Additionally, an improvement of glucose conversion was obtained with increasing the substrate-to-phosphoric acid ratio. However, the improvement was not cost-effective, as the ratio was lower than 1-to-8.

Moreover, the evolution in early stage of some allopolyploidization events is predicted to be effected by nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Maize and teosintes are well model system for study of genetic recombination in allopolyploidization. In order to investigate the effects of genome organization and cytoplasm on genome evolution in newly synthesized allopolyploids (neoallopolyploids), a series of neoallopolyploids were produced by reciprocal crosses of maize and Zea perennis. By using dual-color genomic in situ hybridization, intra- and intergenomic meiosis pairing of these polyploids were quantified and compared with regard to its genome organization and cytoplasm background. In the four neoallopolyploids, the stability of maize genome is consistently lower than that of Z. perennis genome. Additional, the stability of maize genome is affected by genome ploidy. The cytoplasm, genome composition and their interaction do have the special role in chromosome paring and the meiosis behaviors in Zea allopolyploids vary significantly and showed non-diploidization. Z. perennis cytoplasm may give a relatively relaxed environment for maize genome.

A total of 540 grass carp (295.85 +/- 2.07 g) were fed six diets with graded levels of leucine (7.1, 8.9, 11.0, 13.3, 15.2 and 17.1 g kg(-1) diet) for eight weeks. The result indicated that muscle protein, lipid content, muscle EAA (essential amino acid) levels, shear force, and hydroxyproline concentrationwere significantly improved by 11.0-17.1, 8.9-17.1, 8.9-17.1, 11.0-13.3, 8.9-13.3 g leucine kg(-1) diet supplementations, respectively. On the other hand, cooking loss, activities of cathepsin L, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents exhibited an opposite tendency. Moreover, the results indicated that compared with leucine unsupplemented group (7.1 g leucine kg(-1) diet), 8.9-17.1, 11.0-17.1, 11.0-15.2 and 8.9-15.2 g kg(-1) leucine supplementations significantly enhanced the activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione content, respectively. Furthermore, the changes in the relative mRNA expressions of SOD1, CAT, GPx, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), target of rapamycin (TOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) induced by leucine were similar to those noted in their enzyme activities. Conversely, the mRNA levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) were significantly down-regulated by leucine supplementation. In conclusion, optimum leucine improved flesh quality, partly due to the enhancement of antioxidant capacity through regulating antioxidant-related signaling molecule. Based on muscle MDA, the optimum dietary leucine requirements of young grass carp (296-690 g) for flesh quality were estimated to be 12.8 g kg(-1) diet, corresponding to 39.3 g kg(-1) of dietary protein.

This study was designed to determine the effect of lactic acid-based spray washing. First, the reduction of microbial counts on chicken carcasses was evaluated through lactic acid-based spray washing. Second, bacterial diversity on chicken carcasses in different steps in a chicken-slaughtering chain was investigated through polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The effect of spray washing on quick-frozen chicken quality was also examined. Results revealed that microbial counts decreased significantly after the chickens were spray-washed with 1.5% lactic acid at 50 degrees C for 15s. PCR-DGGE revealed a decrease in microbial counts of several bacterial species, such as uncultured bacterium, uncultured Clostridiales sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Ruminococcus sp., and uncultured Ruminococcus sp. The spray washing performed did not remarkably affect the pH and total volatile basic nitrogen of quick-frozen chicken during storage. Therefore, the proposed technique may be applied to chicken-slaughtering chains and may be used to investigate bacterial diversity on chicken carcasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To reduce the risk of OTA contamination, a rapid, inexpensive, suitable and on-site assay for its detection is required. RESULTSIn this study a dot immunogold filtration assay (DIGFA) of OTA on high-flow nitrocellulose membrane was developed. Firstly colloidal gold was synthesized and colloidal gold-polyclonal antibody (PcAb) conjugates against OTA were prepared at the optimal colloidal gold-labeled pH value and package amount. Then the colloidal gold-PcAb conjugates were used to develop the OTA DIGFA. The results demonstrated a visual detection limit of approximately 10ng mL(-1) OTA. In addition, this method had no cross-reaction with zearalenone, aflatoxin B1 or citrinin. CONCLUSIONThese results indicated that the developed DIGFA could be applied for the actual detection of samples without complicated steps.

However, how the overall terrestrial ecosystem C pools and fluxes respond to N addition remains unclear. By synthesizing data from multiple terrestrial ecosystems, we quantified the response of C pools and fluxes to experimental N addition using a comprehensive meta-analysis method. Our results showed that N addition significantly stimulated soil total C storage by 5.82% ([2.47%, 9.27%], 95% CI, the same below) and increased the C contents of the above-and below-ground parts of plants by 25.65% [11.07%, 42.12%] and 15.93% [6.80%, 25.85%], respectively. Furthermore, N addition significantly increased aboveground net primary production by 52.38% [40.58%, 65.19%] and litterfall by 14.67% [9.24%, 20.38%] at a global scale. However, the C influx from the plant litter to the soil through litter decomposition and the efflux from the soil due to microbial respiration and soil respiration showed insignificant responses to N addition. Overall, our meta-analysis suggested that N addition will increase soil C storage and plant C in both above-and below-ground parts, indicating that terrestrial ecosystems might act to strengthen as a C sink under increasing N deposition.

First, grass carp were fed diets containing six graded levels of lysine (7.1-19.6 g kg(-1) diet) for 56 days. Second, the enterocytes were treated with different concentrations of lysine (0-300 mg/L in media) prior to (pre-treatment), along with (co-treatment) or following (post-treatment) with 6 mg/L of Cu for 24 h. The results indicated that lysine improved grass carp growth performance. Meanwhile, lysine ameliorated lipid and protein oxidation by elevating the gene expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathioneperoxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and reductase (GR)), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels in fish intestine. The in vitro studies showed that co- and post-treatment with lysine conferred significant protection against Cu-induced oxidative damage in fish primary enterocytes as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) OD values, along with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase activities, and the depletion of protein carbonyl (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine contents. Moreover, lysine co-treatment decreased the activities and mRNA level of cellular SOD, GPx, GST and GR compared with the Cu- only exposed group. Gene expression of the signalling molecule Nrf2 showed the same pattern as that of SOD activity, whereas Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1b (Keap1b) followed the opposite trend, indicating that co-treatment with lysine induced antioxidant enzymes that protected against oxidative stress through Nrf2 pathway. In addition, posttreatment with lysine increased proteasomal activity and blocked the Cu-stimulated increase in mRNA levels of GST and associated catalase (CAT) and GST activities (P<0.01 and P<0.001). GR activity and gene expression, and glutathione (GSH) content followed an opposite trend to GST activity (P<0.05). Thus, post-treatment of lysine elevated protein and DNA repair abilities and ameliorated the cellular redox state of enterocytes. The overall results suggest that lysine plays a significant role in the protection of fish intestine in vivo and in vitro through the induction of key antioxidant protection.

Traditional diagnostic methods for scabies are inefficient and ineffective, and so far there is no commercial immunodiagnostic or molecular based test for scabies. Methods: Here, we used recombinant Sarcoptes scabiei cofilin protein as an antigen to establish indirect ELISA. S. scabiei cofilin is highly homologous to Dermatophagoides farinae Der f 31 allergen (90 % identity). The S. scabiei cofilin gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to obtain recombinant protein. Western blotting and fluorescence immunohistochemistry were carried out, and we established an indirect ELISA method and detected 33 serum samples from scabies infected rabbits and 30 serum samples from naive rabbits. Results: Western blotting demonstrated that S. scabiei cofilin possessed good immunogenicity and fluorescence immunohistochemistry showed the S. scabiei cofilin is widespread in the splanchnic area of mites. In ELISA, a cut-off value of 0.188 was determined to judge experimental positive and negative serum values. Specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA were 87.9 and 83.33 %, respectively. Conclusions: Recombinant S. scabiei cofilin showed potential value as a diagnostic antigen. The ELISA method established could be used in clinical diagnosis and provide experimental information in minimal or asymptomatic infection.

However, limited information is available for duck breeders. In this study, a total of 1,560 Cherry Valley SM3 duck breeder females and 312 males were used to assess if the addition of CX and 25-OH-D-3 could increase the performance of duck breeders under two different dietary vitamin regimens. Four diets were used under a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 2 kinds of vitamin premixes (REGULAR and HIGH; HIGH premix had higher levels of all vitamins except K-3 than REGULAR premix), and with or without the supplementation of the mixture of CX (6 mg/kg) and 25-OH-D-3 (0.069 mg/kg). The ducks were fed ad libitum with pelleted diets based on corn-soybean meal from 38 to 77 wk of age. Results: HIGH vitamin premix decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level (P < 0.001) of egg yolk, increased hatchability of fertile eggs (P = 0.029), increased hatchability of total eggs (P = 0.029), and decreased serum protein carbonyl level (P = 0.037) of breeder males. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D-3 increased serum calcium of breeder females (P = 0.010), decreased the cracked egg rate (P = 0.001), increased the pigmentation of egg yolk (P < 0.001) and male bill (P < 0.001), and decreased MDA level of egg yolk (P < 0.001) and male serum (P = 0.034). Interactive effects were observed in cracked egg rate (P = 0.038), shell thickness (P = 0.011) and serum phosphorus (P = 0.026) of breeder females. HIGH vitamin premix together with the mixture of CX and 25-OH-D-3 decreased cracked egg rate and increased shell thickness of duck breeders. Serum phosphorus was decreased in duck breeder females fed REGULAR vitamin premix without the addition of the CX and 25-OH-D-3 mixture. Conclusions: Dietary HIGH vitamin premix increased antioxidant status of eggs and breeder males, and increased hatchability. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D-3 enhanced egg shell quality, and promoted pigmentation and antioxidant status of eggs and breeder males.

We conducted a field litterbag experiment in an alpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau from November 2012 to October 2014. Six dominant types of foliar litter were placed on the forest floor in various forest gap positions, including gap centre, canopy gap, expanded gap and closed canopy. Over two years of incubation, all foliar litters were substantially humified especially during the first winter, although the newly accumulated humic substances were young and could be decomposed further. The forest gaps exhibited significant effects on early litter humification, but the effects were regulated by sampling seasons and litter types. Compared with the litter under the closed canopy, humification was suppressed in the gap centre after two years of field incubation. The results presented here suggest that gap formation delays the accumulation of soil organic matter, and reduces soil carbon sequestration in these alpine forests.

Brucella, the etiological pathogen of brucellosis, has unique virulence characteristics, including the ability to survive within the host cell. Hfq is a bacterial chaperone protein that is involved in the survival of the pathogen under stress conditions. Moreover, hfq affects the expression of a large number of target genes. In the present study, we characterized the expression and regulatory patterns of the target genes of Hfq during brucellosis. The results revealed that hfq expression is highly induced in macrophages at the early infection stage and at the late stage of mouse infection. Several genes related to virulence, including omp25, omp31, OR, htrA, gntR, and dnaK, were found to be regulated by hfq during infection in BALB/c mice. Gene expression and cytokine secretion analysis revealed that an hfq-deletion mutant induced different cytokine profiles compared with that induced by 16M. Infection with the hfq-deletion mutant induced protective immune responses against 16M challenge. Together, these results suggest that hfq is induced during infection and its deletion results in significant attenuation which affects the host immune response caused by Brucella infection. By regulating genes related to virulence, hfq promotes the virulence of Brucella. The unique characteristics of the hfq-deletion mutant, including its decreased virulence and the ability to induce protective immune response upon infection, suggest that it represents an attractive candidate for the design of a live attenuated vaccine against Brucella.

It is very necessary to explore those underlying obstacles which hinder the sustainable development of this industry from a systematic point. This paper adopted an improved emergy based method and a set of indicator system to evaluate the sustainability of steel production enterprises, in which dilution method, disability adjusted life years (DALY) method and potentially disappeared fraction (PDF) method were integrated into classic emergy analysis to quantify the impact of emissions, and then the related indicator system characterizing the industrial production process was put forward. One steel production enterprise in Sichuan Province, China, as a case, was studied using the proposed methods and indicator system. The research results show that this enterprise is not sustainable in the long term, due to large share of nonrenewable inputs and strong dependence on imported inputs; emissions' impact further aggravates this situation due to the increasing environmental loading; the proposed methods and indicator system can act as one of helpful tools for decision-making in steel & iron industry. Finally, this paper gives some corresponding suggestions so as to improve the comprehensive performance of this enterprise. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The average molecular weight (Mw) of EUPS was 11.4632 x 10(5) Da. The monosaccharide components of EUPS were glucose, fructose, manno se, fuco se, galactose and arabino se with a relative mass of 36.6%, 16.6%, 14.2%, 15.7%, 9.5% and 7.4%, respectively. In in vitro experiments, EUPS (1.2-75 mu g/mL) treatment of dendritic cells (DC) increased their surface expression of MHC I/II, CD80, CD40, and CD86 and indicated that EUPS induced DC maturation. Furthermore, EUPS also significantly enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and significantly enhanced cytokine (IL-4 and IFN-gamma) production. In in vivo experiments, our data showed that EUPS could significantly enhance the FMDV-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers and T cell proliferation. Together, these results suggest that EUPS is a strong immunostimulant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the 1RS arm in wheat has end-use quality defects that are partially attributable to the presence of omega-secalins, which are encoded by genes at the Sec-1 locus. Various attempts in removing the Sec-1 genes from the 1RS. 1BL translocation chromosome have been made. In the present study, two new primary 1RS. 1BL translocation lines, T917-26 and T917-15, were developed from a cross between wheat variety "A42912" and Chinese local rye "Weining." The lines T917-15 and T917-26 carried a pair of intact and homogeneous 1RS. 1BL chromosomes. The line T917-26 also harbored an expression deletion of some genes at the Sec-1 locus, which originated from a mutation that occurred simultaneously with wheat-rye chromosome translocations. These results suggest that the accompanying mutations of the evolutionarily significant translocations are remarkable resources for plant improvement. Comparison of translocation lines with its wheat parent showed improvements in the end-use quality parameters, which included protein content (PC), water absorption (WA), sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation (SDSS), wet gluten (WG), dry gluten (DG) and dough stickiness (DS), whereas significant reduction in gluten index (GI) and stability time (ST) were observed. These findings indicate that 1RS in wheat has produced a higher amount of protein, although these comprised worse compositions. However, in the T917-26 line that harbored an expression deletion mutation in the Sec-1 genes, the quality parameters were markedly improved relative to its sister line, T917-15, especially for GI and DS (P < 0.05). These results indicated that expression deletion of Sec-1 genes significantly improves the end-use quality of wheat cultivars harboring the 1RS. 1BL translocation. Strategies to remove the Sec-1 genes from the 1RS. 1BL translocation in wheat improvement are discussed.

Here, using a combination of electron microscopy, immunofluorescence assay, siRNA interference, specific pharmacological inhibitors, and dominant negative mutation, we demonstrated that the entry of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) triggered a substantial amount of plasma membrane ruffling. We also found that the internalization of FMDV induced a robust increase in fluid-phase uptake, and virions internalized within macropinosomes colocalized with phase uptake marker dextran. During this stage, the Rac1-Pak1 signaling pathway was activated. After specific inhibition on actin, Na+/H+ exchanger, receptor tyrosine kinase, Rac1, Pak1, myosin II, and protein kinase C, the entry and infection of FMDV significantly decreased. However, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) did not reduce FMDV internalization but increased the viral entry and infection to a certain extent, implying that FMDV entry did not require PI3K activity. Results showed that internalization of FMDV exhibited the main hallmarks of macropinocytosis. Moreover, intracellular trafficking of FMDV involves EEA1/Rab5-positive vesicles. The present study demonstrated macropinocytosis as another endocytic pathway apart from the clathrin-mediated pathway. The findings greatly expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of FMDV entry into cells, as well as provide potential insights into the entry mechanisms of other picornaviruses.

The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene plays a crucial role in determining coat color of mammals. Here, we investigated genetic diversity and selection at the coding region of the porcine melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) in Tibetan pigs and Landrace pigs. By contrast, genetic variability was much lower in Landrace pigs than in Tibetan pigs. Meanwhile, haplotype analysis showed that Tibetan pigs possessed shared haplotypes, suggesting a possibility of recent introgression event by way of crossbreeding with neighboring domestic pigs or shared ancestral polymorphism. Additionally, we detected positive selection at the MC1R in both Tibetan pigs and Landrace pigs through the dN/dS analysis. These findings suggested that novel phenotypic change (dark coat color) caused by novel mutations may help Tibetan pigs against intensive solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and camouflage in wild environment, whereas white coat color in Landrace were intentionally selected by human after domestication. Furthermore, both the phylogenetic analysis and the network analysis provided clues that MC1R in Asian and European wild boars may have initially experienced different selective pressures, and MC1R alleles diversified in modern domesticated pigs.

Since previous studies regarding the role of miRNAs in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation have shown that miRNA-27a, one member of miRNA-23a similar to 27a similar to 24 cluster, could suppress adipogenesis. We now investigated whether miRNA-23a regulates adipogenic differentiation. In the present study, we showed that the expression of miRNA-23a is decreased during the process of adipogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miRNA-23a decreased lipid accumulation and triglyceride content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results also demonstrated that miRNA-23a decreases mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific genes involved in lipogenic transcription, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid transport. These findings suggested miRNA-23a to be a new type of adipogenic depressor and to play an important role in regulating adipocyte differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unmated male forest musk deer generate a greater amount of musk than mated males, potentially allowing them to attract a greater number of females. In this study, we used gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to explore musk chemical composition of the musk pods of captive mated and unmated sexually mature Chinese forest musk deer and used next-generation sequencing to intensively survey the bacterial communities within them. Analysis of the chemical composition of the musk showed that unmated males have more muscone and cholesterol. Features of the musk16S rRNA gene showed that mated Chinese forest musk deer have both a greater Shannon diversity (p < 0.01) and a greater number of estimated operational taxonomic units than unmated ones; many bacterial genera were overrepresented in unmated Chinese forest musk deer males. Members of these genera might be involved in musk odor fermentation.

Various studies of porcine muscle development have mainly focused on identifying miRNAs that are important for fetal and adult muscle development; however, little is known about the role of miRNAs in middle-aged muscle development. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of miRNA transcriptomes across five porcine muscle development stages, including one prenatal and four postnatal stages. We identified 404 known porcine miRNAs, 118 novel miRNAs, and 101 miRNAs that are conserved in other mammals. A set of universally abundant miRNAs was found across the distinct muscle development stages. This set of miRNAs may play important housekeeping roles that are involved in myogenesis. A short time-series expression miner analysis indicated significant variations in miRNA expression across distinct muscle development stages. We also found enhanced differentiation- and morphogenesis-related miRNA levels in the embryonic stage; conversely, apoptosis-related miRNA levels increased relatively later in muscle development. These results provide integral insight into miRNA function throughout pig muscle development stages. Our findings will promote further development of the pig as a model organism for human age-related muscle disease research.

However, our knowledge of the diversity and epidemiology of PoAstV in China is limited. Results: In this study, fecal samples from 21/120 (17.5 %) domestic pigs, including 18/100 (18 %) diarrheic and 3/20 (15 %) healthy pigs, and from 1/9 (11.1 %) healthy wild boars tested in Sichuan Province were positive for PoAstV on reverse transcription-PCR. Of the 22 positive samples, 13.6 % were positive for PoAstV only, whereas 40.9 % also contained Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), 22.7 % also contained porcine group A rotavirus (PRoVA), and 22.7 % also contained PEDV and PRoVA. A phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene revealed genetic heterogeneity among the PoAstV sequences and two lineages were detected in this study, with PoAstV-2 predominant. PoAstV-5 was detected in wild boars for the first time. Conclusions: PoAstV infections exist in Sichuan Province regardless of the disease status in the pig population, either alone or in combination with other enteric viruses, and may be associated with diarrhea.

The results showed that dietary NiCl2 in 300 mg/kg and over induced toxic suppression in the bursal development, which was characterized by decreasing lymphocytes histopathologically and relative weight, increasing G(0)/G(1) phase (a prolonged nondividing state), reducing S phase (DNA replication) and proliferating index, and increasing percentages of apoptotic cells. Concurrently, the mRNA expression levels of bax, cytochrome c (cyt c), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7 and caspase-9 were increased and the bcl-2 mRNA expression levels were decreased. The toxic suppression of bursal development finally impaired humoral immunity duo to the reduction of B lymphocyte population and B lymphocyte activity in the broiler chicken. This study provides new evidences for further studying the effect mechanism of Ni and Ni compounds on B-cell or bursa of Fabricius.

A total of 240 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed a corn-soybean basal diet as the control diet or three experimental diets supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. Ultrastructurally, the microvilli were apparently exfoliated, and the mitochondria were swollen and the number of lysosomes increased in the intestinal cells of three experimental groups. As measured by TUNEL and flow cytometry (FCM), the percentage of apoptotic cells in the small intestine and the lymphocytes in the ileum were significantly increased in three experimental groups when compared with those of the control group. Meanwhile, immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) tests showed that the protein expression, mRNA expression levels were decreased in the bcl-2, whereas those of bax and caspase-3, and the cytochrome C, bak and caspase-9 mRNA expression levels were increased in three experimental groups. The abovementioned results show that pathway of dietary NiCl2-induced small intestine apoptosis is related to the mitochondrial damage and promotion of the cytochrome C release from mitochondria, which activates the mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis pathway.

Seed dormancy and germination are distinct physiological processes, and the transition from dormancy to germination is not only a critical developmental step in the life cycle of plants but is also important for agricultural production. These processes are precisely regulated by diverse endogenous hormones and environmental cues. Although ABA (abscisic acid) and GAs (gibberellins) are known to be the primary phytohormones that antagonistically regulate seed dormancy, recent findings demonstrate that another phytohormone, auxin, is also critical for inducing and maintaining seed dormancy, and therefore might act as a key protector of seed dormancy. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the sophisticated molecular networks involving the critical roles of phytohormones in regulating seed dormancy and germination, in which AP2-domain-containing transcription factors play key roles. We also discuss the interactions (crosstalk) of diverse hormonal signals in seed dormancy and germination, focusing on the ABA/GA balance that constitutes the central node.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether dietary LGG supplementation could alleviate diarrhea via improving jejunal mucosal barrier function in the weaned piglets challenged by RV, and further analyze the potential roles for apoptosis of jejunal mucosal cells and intestinal microbiota. A total of 24 crossbred barrows weaned at 21 d of age were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 diets: the basal diet and LGG supplementing diet. On day 11, all pigs were orally infused RV or the sterile essential medium. RV infusion increased the diarrhea rate, increased the RV-Ab, NSP4 and IL-2 concentrations and the Bax mRNA levels of jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05), decreased the villus height, villus height: crypt depth, the sIgA, IL-4 and mucin 1 concentrations and the ZO-1, occludin and Bcl-2 mRNA levels of jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05), and affected the microbiota of ileum and cecum (P< 0.05) in the weaned pigs. Dietary LGG supplementation increased the villus height and villus height: crypt depth, the sIgA, IL-4, mucin 1 and mucin 2 concentrations, and the ZO-1, occludin and Bcl-2 mRNA levels of the jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05) reduced the Bax mRNA levels of the jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05) in weaned pigs. Furthermore, dietary LGG supplementation alleviated the increase of diarrhea rate in the weaned pigs challenged by RV (P< 0.05), and relieve the effect of RV infection on the villus height, crypt depth and the villus height: crypt depth of the jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05), the NSP4, sIgA, IL-2, IL-4, mucin 1 and mucin 2 concentrations of jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05), the ZO-1, occludin, Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels of the jejunal mucosa (P< 0.05), and the microbiota of ileum and cecum (P< 0.05) in the weaned pigs challenged by RV. These results suggest that supplementing LGG in diets alleviated the diarrhea of weaned piglets challenged by RV via inhibiting the virus multiplication and improving the jejunal mucosal barrier function, which was possibly due to the decreasing apoptosis of jejunal mucosal cells and the improvement of intestinal microbiota.

However, considering the additional vertebrate groups, new perception regarding selection challenged by high-altitude stress on mitochondrial genome can be gained. To test this hypothesis, we compiled and analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of 5 alpine pheasants and 12 low-altitude species in Phasianidae. The results that evolutionary rates of ATP6 and ND6 showing significant fluctuation among branches when involved with five alpine pheasants revealed both genes might have implications with adapting to highland environment. The radical physico-chemical property changes identified by the modified MM01 model, including composition (C) and equilibrium constant (ionization of COOH) (Pk) in ATP6 and beta-structure tendencies (P), Pk, and long-range non-bonded energy (E-l) in ND6, suggested that minor overall adjustments in size, protein conformation and relative orientation of reaction interfaces have been optimized to provide the ideal environments for electron transfer, proton translocation and generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Additionally, three unique substitution sites were identified under selection in ND6, which could be potentially important adaptive changes contributing to cellular energy production. Our findings suggested that adaptive evolution may occur in alpine pheasants, which are an important complement to the knowledge of genetic mechanisms against the high-altitude environment in non-mammal animals.

The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multi-PCR) assay was carried out to trace the impure DNA in mutton. A universal primer pair yielded an approximate 610bp fragment in mutton, pork, duck, chicken, horse and cat meats. The amplicons of multi-PCR assay represented the species-specific products, which could be discriminated by the size ranging from 106bp to 532bp. Subsequently, the authentication of each fragment was also confirmed by sequencing. Random analyses of adulterants with various meats yielded the identical results to their components, showing the suitability of the multi-PCR assay for tracing of adulterant meats with high-accuracy and precision. This assay was sensitive to detect the species-specific DNA in different proportional mixtures of mutton and duck/pork (9.1%-90.9%).

We determined the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from six wild Tibetan pigs from the Tibetan plateau and four domestic pig breeds from the lowland of neighboring southwest China. Nucleotide diversity analysis using the sliding window method showed that the nucleotide diversity of wild Tibetan pigs in most regions of the mitogenome was higher than that of domestic pigs. The 12s ribosomal RNA showed relatively lower nucleotide diversity in Tibetan pigs, suggesting purifying selection of these genes during high-altitude adaptation. More non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in the ATP6 were found in wild Tibetan pigs, indicating adaptive selection in Tibetan pigs. The results suggested distinct impacts of natural selection and artificial selection upon the mitogenome, especially the mitochondrial signatures of adaptive evolution in wild Tibetan pigs under natural selection.

J	Shui, W; Xu, GW				Shui, Wei; Xu, Guowei			Analysis of the influential factors for changes to land use in China's Xingwen Global Geopark against a tourism development background	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						land use; GIS; tourism; Xingwen Global Geopark; Shihai; Xingwen County	COVER CHANGE; DRIVEN; BASIN	This study employs geographic information system software to explore the influences of elevation, slope, the river system, traffic arteries and the central development zone on the land-use changes in Shihai between 1995 and 2010. Data were drawn from statistics from the first two remote sensing investigations of land use in the town of Shihai in China's Xingwen Global Geopark and its digital elevation model data. An analysis of the relationships between changes in land use was performed using relevant models, including a comprehensive land-use dynamic degree model, a single land-use dynamic degree model and a comprehensive index model for the extent of land use. The results suggest that a combination of natural and human factors influenced the changes in Shihai's land use during the time from 1995 to 2010. First, elevation and slope exerted environmental resistance. Specifically, as elevation or slope increased, the extent of change in land use decreased, despite local policies that have reduced the extent of this resistance. Second, the river system influenced land use such that, as distance from the river increased, changes in land use decreased and then increased, suggesting that the river has a resistant as well as propulsive influence. Third, traffic arteries and the central development zone created an environmental motivation to the changes in Shihai's land use; specifically, the evolving tourism industry results in increasing numbers of tourist trails and roads and continually expanding Geopark services' infrastructure. Thus, relatively more dramatic changes are experienced in the Geopark's proximate land use than in its surroundings.

VP16 and pUL14 are both predicted to be tegument proteins of DEV. Methods: An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed for preliminary analysis of the colocalization of pUL14 and VP16, which detected their subcellular localization in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) during virus replication. The coexpression of pUL14 and VP16 was detected in transfected DEFs. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay was used to confirm a direct interaction between pUL14 and VP16. To better characterize the nuclear localization domain of pUL14, we designed a series of deletion mutants and transfected them with VP16. Results: Our IFA findings indicated that pUL14 binds to VP16 in the cytoplasm and that pUL14 leads VP16 import into the nucleus during DEV replication. The BiFC assay revealed the presence of pUL14 and VP16 complexes. Furthermore, 1-98 amino acid (aa) at the N-terminus of pUL14 played a role in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) region and promoted translocation of VP16 into the nucleus to complete the virus life cycle. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that pUL14 could transport VP16 into the nucleus and that the N-terminal 1-98 aa may contain the NLS domain of pUL14. (C) 2017 S.

Understanding the genetic basis for the underlying mechanism of tolerance for lead responses in maize (Zea mays L) may provide important insights for protecting the environment. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Pb accumulation in maize were identified using 207 IBM10 DH at maturity stage. The IBM10 DH and parents were planted in pots which were filled up with soil which was stressed with a Pb(NO3)(2) solution (500 mg kg(-1)). Pb concentrations in roots, stems, leaves, and kernels were measured. There was a wide distribution of Pb concentration among the mentioned four tissues and all the DH lines (P < 0.01). Pb concentration of kernels displayed significant positive relationships with stems and leaves (P < 0.01). The present study has demonstrated that the trend of Pb concentration in different tissues of maize were roots > leaves > stems > kernels. The Pb concentration of kernels was higher significantly correlated with stems. A total of 20 QTLs at logarithm of odds (LOD) ratio >= 3 were detected for Pb concentration in different tissues, including roots, stems, leaves, and kernels. Furthermore, RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR analysis led to the identification of two Pb-responsive genes from those QTLs, GRMZM2G137161 and GRMZM2G132995, which were located on chromosome 2 and 6 respectively. The two genes were dramatically up-regulated during Pb stress.

The complete chloroplast (cp) genome was generated by de novo assembly using low coverage whole genome sequencing data and manual correction. The cp genome was 158 084 bp in length, with GC content of 36.63%. It exhibited a typical quadripartite structure: a pair of large inverted repeat regions (IRs, 26 246 bp each), a large single-copy region (LSC, 86 713 bp), and a small single-copy region (SSC, 18 879 bp). A total of 114 genes were predicted, which included 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that M. hypoleuca is most closely related to Prunus padus within the Prunoideae subfamily, which conforms to the traditional classification.

Despite its clinical use, concerns remain regarding the potential toxic side-effects, such as nephrotoxicity. Early detection of renal damage is critical in preclinical drug development. This study was aimed to determine whether kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may be early indicators in the assessment of Gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity. Methods: In our study, a model of Gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in male Sprague Dawley rats treated for up to 7 days at 50 or 100mg/kg/day was used to monitor the expressions of novel biomarkers of renal toxicity during the progression of acute kidney injury (AKI). Additionally, biomarkers were assessed in human kidney proximal epithelial cells (HK-2) treated with Gentamicin for 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 or 48h in vitro. Results: Repeated administration of Gentamicin to rats for 1, 3, or 7 days resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in the expression of KIM-1 and NGAL. The expressions of the two biomarkers changed prior to renal tubule damage and increases in serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, suggesting their usefulness for predicting Gentamicin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in vivo. Conclusions: In contrast, no significant increase in the expression of the biomarker genes and proteins were evident in HK-2 cells after treated by Gentamycin for up to 48h, suggesting that they may not be suitable endpoints for sensitive detection of nephrotoxic effects in vitro.

With development of classical quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and modern RNA-seq, numerous QTL and tissue-specific gene expression data were accumulated in previous studies. In this paper, a total of initial 373 QTL for grain yield (GY) and kernel row number (KRN) were collected based on 29 previous literatures. Fifty-four meta-QTL (MQTL) were detected via the meta-analysis method with IBM2 2008 Neighbors as a reference map, including 19 for GY and 35 for KRN. These MQTL were unevenly distributed on all 10 chromosomes. Chromosome 1 harbored the most initial QTL and MQTL, and chromosome 7 contained the least. Three MQTL for KRN have been overlapped with MQTL for GY on chromosomes 1 and 3. A total of 1,588 (46.07%) out of 3,447 genes located in the KRN MQTL regions were identified by gene expression data, and categorized into 101 significant GO terms. Meanwhile, six candidate genes were identified from MQTL regions, which are homologous to three functionally characterized genes found to participate in plant inflorescence development. The identified MQTL could be applied to marker-assisted selection (MAS) to facilitate yield architecture, QTL fine mapping and gene cloning in the maize community. Furthermore, the identified candidate genes could enhance the selection efficiency by MAS directly, and could illuminate molecular mechanisms of grain yield in maize.

Our study indicated that low nitrogen increases the NADPH/NADPC and ATP/AMP ratios which affect adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and phosphorylation and abundance of nuclear CRY1 protein. Then CRY1 acts in the N signal input pathway to the circadian clock. Here we further discuss: (1) the role of C/N ratio in flowering, (2) circadian oscillation of plant AMPK transcripts and proteins, (3) conservation of nutrition-mediated CRY1 phosphorylation and degradation, and (4) crosstalks between nitrogen signals and nitric oxide (NO) signals in flowering.

Seedlings of Lolium perenne, a common perennial grass species, were grown for eight weeks under three different light environments (natural light, red light and shading) and two different defoliation treatments (no defoliation versus 50% aboveground biomass removal). This study was conducted to examine (1) the effects of light regimes and defoliation on biomass accumulation, biomass allocation and internal C/N ratio status in plants; (2) how the light regimes influence the pattern of compensatory growth after defoliation; and (3) the relationship between compensatory growth and the internal C/N ratio status. We found that red light altered the shoot-to root allometry, enhanced the leaf C concentrations and induced N deficiency. By contrast, the leaf N concentrations of L. perenne were greater during shading treatment, which simultaneously enhanced shoot growth and stopped root growth. Under defoliation, red light increased shoot growth, not at the expense of root growth, which was not the same as in natural light and shading treatment. Moreover, regardless of the unclipped (no defoliation) and defoliation conditions, the L. perenne biomass partitioning between roots and shoots was significantly correlated with the leaf N concentrations and C/N ratio, indicating that allometric biomass allocation can be largely modulated by signals related to the C and N status of the plants. These results demonstrated that the leaf C and N status would be an appropriate indicator of compensatory growth after defoliation.

Effect of spermine on liver and spleen antioxidant status in weaned rats	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						spermine; antioxidant status; liver; spleen; weaned rats	NATURAL POLYAMINE SPERMINE; SUCKLING RATS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PIGLETS; INSIGHTS; IMPACT; PIGS	Whereas strong antioxidant properties of spermine have been reported mostly in in vitro studies, there is lack of the in vivo studies on spermine influence conducted on mammals. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of spermine and the period of its supplementation on the liver and spleen antioxidant capacity in weaned rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats at the age of 19 days received intragastrically spermine at the dose of 0.2 or 0.4 mu mol . g(-1) body weight for 3 or 7 days, respectively. Control rats received saline in analogical way. It was found that liver anti-superoxide anion (ASA) capacity, catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione (GSH) content and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were increased in group supplemented with higher dose of spermine after 3 days, and anti-hydroxy radical (AHR) capacity was increased when treatment lasted for 7 days. In the spleen the higher spermine dose supplementation increased ASA capacity and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity (after 3 and 7 days), AHR capacity (after 7 days) and T-AOC (after 3 days) in comparison to the corresponding control groups (P < 0.05). Only in the spleen the lower spermine dose reduced lipid peroxidation level and increased CAT activity and GSH content regardless treatment duration (P < 0.05). The obtained results suggest that spermine supplementation can improve the antioxidant properties of the liver and spleen of weaned rats in a dose-, time- and tissue-dependent manner.

The transport equations are solved numerically by finite volume approach using the SIMPLEC algorithm. Calculations are performed for the Rayleigh number from 10(4) to 10(6), nanoparticle volume fractions from 0 to 0.2, dimensionless amplitude from 0 to 1.0, and dimensionless frequency from 0.1 to 200. The fluctuating behaviors are found for the flow fields and temperature fields as a result of the alternating temperature. The utilization of nanoparticles enhances heat transfer especially at high Rayleigh numbers, and the percentage increase in the time-averaged Nusselt number is 37.61%, when the solid volume fraction is increased from 0 to 0.2. In addition, the alternating temperature amplitude and frequency affect heat transfer of nanofluids. When the dimensionless amplitude is increased from 0 to 1, the percentage increase in the time-averaged Nusselt number is 12.24%. The double-humped resonance phenomenon of nanofluids heat transfer is observed for variation of the temperature oscillation frequency.

The antibacterial susceptibility test indicated the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of berberine against P. multocida was 39 mu g/mL and the antibacterial kinetic curves showed that the antibacterial activity of berberine was in a concentration-time-dependent manner. After treatment with berberine (39 mu g/mL), the bacteria cells were severely damaged, irregular cell shape, ruptured cell wall and membrane, condensed cytoplasm or lost cytoplasm were observed under the transmission electron microscopy. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine (DAPI) stain assays demonstrated that berberine could inhibit the synthesis of protein and DNA. In conclusion, these results suggested that berberine inhibit the cell function of P. multocida by damaging the cell structure and inhibiting synthesis of protein and DNA, resulting in the cell death.

TURKISH JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY			English	Article						Annexin; Tartary buckwheat; FtANX1; stress responses	UV-B RADIATION; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; MEDICAGO-TRUNCATULA; STRESS; PROTEIN; FAMILY; IDENTIFICATION; INDUCTION; RESPONSES; DROUGHT	Annexins are generally thought to play an essential role in the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress responses. Here we describe an annexin gene from Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn.), designated as FtANX1. The full-length coding sequence of FtANX1 is 942 bp in size, encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 36.0 kDa and pI 5.94. In silico analysis of the sequence revealed that FtANX1 contains four repeats, with a type-II Ca2+-binding site in repeat I. Expression pattern analysis provided evidence that FtANX1 was predominantly expressed in immature achenes, while its level was lowest in leaves. In addition, FtANX1 was found to be associated with stress responses in Tartary buckwheat, such as drought, cold, UV-B radiation, jasmonic acid, and heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd). Several stress-related regulatory elements (ABRE, W-box, GATA-box, and CuRE elements) were found by in silico analysis in the FtANX1 promoter region. Our results showed that FtANX1, a novel annexin gene, may play an important role in the growth and stress tolerance of Tartary buckwheat.

In this study, we successfully isolated two bHLH transcription factor genes, designated as FtbHLH1 and FtbHLH2, from Tartary buckwheat. Their encoding proteins were found to have a motif to interact with R2R3-MYB at the N-terminus and a typical bHLH motif at the C-terminus. Yeast one-hybrid assay proved that the two bHLH proteins exhibited obvious transcriptional activation activities. The abiotic stresses indicated that FtbHLH1 expression would be mainly affected by drought and UV-B, whereas FtbHLH2 expression would present a sensitive response to cold and UV-B. Additionally, FtbHLH2 showed a more intense response to jasmonic acid treatment than FtbHLH1.

We observed that glucose increased lipogenesis, decreased fatty acid oxidation and increased very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) assembly and secretion. Co-treatment with glucose and inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (LY294002, rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235) decreased the levels of factors involved in lipogenesis and increased the levels of factors involved in fatty acid oxidation and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion. These findings show that inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway decreased glucose-induced lipogenesis, inhibited the downregulation of fatty acid oxidation by glucose and increased the upregulation of VLDL-TG assembly and secretion by glucose. The results presented herein provide further support for the role of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in lipid metabolism as we showed that in goose primary hepatocytes, glucose acts through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-dependent pathway to stimulate lipid deposition by increasing lipogenesis and decreasing fatty acid oxidation and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion.

Curcumin is a natural product from spice turmeric that can block biological events in which NF-kappa B plays a critical role. Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate the beneficial effects of curcumin on the NF-kappa B-dependent MW in rats. Methods: The MW rats were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and rats were fed 15 g curcumin per kg diet for 16 d. Results: LPS not only decreased the growth performance of rat, but significantly elevated its serum IL-1 concentration and muscle proteolysis rate. Interestingly, curcumin significantly prevented the muscle proteolysis rate and down-regulated expression levels of two critical muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases (Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1). When muscles from MW rats were incubated with curcumin in vitro, the calpain-, cathepsin L-, and proteasome-dependent muscle proteolysis were significantly decreased. Moreover, the nuclear NF-kappa B/p65 protein abundance were also decreased by curcumin. Conclusion: The results not only suggest a molecular mechanism by which curcumin modulates the inflammatory responses, but also offer a feasible avenue to ameliorate the NF-kappa B-dependent muscle proteolysis.

However, the genetic mechanism of heterosis remains unclear up to now. In this study, a set of 184 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) population, which derived from two inbred lines Ix9801 (the recurrent parent) and Chang 72 (the donor parent), were used as basal material to construct two test populations with the inbred lines Zheng 58 and Xun 9058. The two test populations were evaluated in two locations over two years, and the heterotic loci for plant height and ear height were identified by comparing the performance of each test hybrid with the corresponding CK at P<0.05 significant level using one-way ANOVA analysis and Duncan's multiple comparisons. There were 24 and 29 different heterotic loci (HL) identified for plant height and ear height in the two populations at two locations over two years. Three HL (hIPH4a, hIPH7c, hIPH1b) for plant height and three (hIEH1d, hIEH6b, hIEH1b) for ear height were identified in the CSSLsxZheng 58 and CSSLsxXun 9058 populations as contributing highly to heterosis performance of plant height and ear height across four environments. Among the 29 HL identified for ear height, 12 HL (41.4%) shared the same chromosomal region associated with the HL (50.0%) identified for plant height in the same test population and environment.

There is an additive isomorphism between the Chen-Ruan cohomologies phi : H*(CR)(X-s) -+ H*(CR)(X-sf). We study the three-point orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of the exceptional curves Gamma(s) on X-s and F-sf on X-sf and show that the corresponding Ruan cohomology ring structures on the Chen-Ruan cohomologies of X-s and X-sf, defined by these three-point functions, are isomorphic to each other under the map phi and the identification [Gamma(S)] <-> - [Gamma(sf)].

In this study, we sequenced 741 bp fragment of the MC1R for 39 individuals with five plumage color patterns (gray plumage, n = 12; black plumage, n = 9; white plumage, n = 3; spotted plumage, n = 12; red plumage, n= 3). A total of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, including G199A,G225A, and A466G, which subsequently determined four haplotypes (H1-H4). Among them, H1 is the predominant haplotype. Association analysis revealed that H1 and H3 were significantly associated with the black plumage trait (P < 0.05), while the H4 was significantly associated with gray plumage trait (P < 0.05). Furthermore, only diplotype H1H1 was significantly associated with black and gray traits of pigeons. Collectively, our study suggested an association between genetic variation of MC1R and plumage color in pigeon.

The tripartite motif containing 25 proteins (TRIM25) was reported to modify caspase activation and RIG-I recruitment domains (CARDs) via ubiquitin. These modifications allow TRIM25 to interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling molecules (MAVs) and form CARD-CARD tetramers. Goose TRIM25 was cloned from gosling lungs, which possess a 1662 bp open reading flame (ORF). This ORF encodes a predicted 554 amino acid protein consisting of a B-box domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a PRY/SPRY domain. The protein sequence has 89.25% sequence identity with Anas platyrhynchos TRIM25, 78.57% with Gallus gallus TRIM25, and 46.92% with Homo sapiens TRIM25. TRIM25 is expressed in all gosling and adult goose tissues examined. QRT-PCR revealed that goose TRIM25 transcription could be induced by goose IFN-alpha, goose IFN-gamma, and goose IFN-lambda, as well as a35 s polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), oligodeoxynucleotides 2006 (ODN 2006), and resiquimod (R848) in vitro; however, it is inhibited in H9N2 infected goslings for unknown reasons. These data suggest that goose TRIM25 might play a positive role in the regulation of the antiviral immune response.

They can also secrete" multiple bioactive molecules that exert specific physiological functions. Thus, UCMSCs represent excellent candidates for cell therapy in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Abundant preclinical research on different disease models has shown that UCMSCs can accelerate wound or nerve damage recovery and suppress tumor progression. In fact, UCMSCs are thought to possess a higher therapeutic potential than MSCs derived from other tissues. Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism underlying UCSMCs efficacy depends mostly on cell secretions, in contrast to the early paradigm of cell replacement and differentiation. In this review, we discuss UCMSCs biological characteristics, their secretome-based therapeutic mechanism, and potential applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

However, little information has been reported on the systematic analysis of LRRDR genes in maize. In this study, 235 LRRDR genes were identified in the complete genome sequence of maize (Zea mays cv. B73), classified as six different structural types, and then characterized based on conserved protein motifs, chromosomal locations and gene duplications. Subsequent phylogenetic comparisons indicated that similar to 20 pairs of maize LRRDR proteins possessed high similarities to LRRDR proteins with known functions. Analyses of the physical locations and duplications of LRRDR genes indicated that gene duplication events involving LRRDR genes were high in maize and 84% occurred between chromosomes, which may ensure the functional performance and enhancement of maize LRRDR genes. Meanwhile, the functions and expression patterns of the LRRDR genes were associated with their conserved protein secondary structures, suggesting that different conserved domains might distinguish their biological functions. Transcripts of 13 genes were regulated by two or more fungal pathogens, respectively, indicating that one LRRDR gene might mediate resistance to multiple fungal pathogens, suggesting that the signal networks of the maize-fungal pathogen interactions were partially crossed. Additionally, we screened five candidate LRRDR genes for ear rot resistance. The results reported in this study contribute to an improved understanding of the LRRDR gene family in maize.

A set of LAMP primers was designed based on the sequence of the ASFV gene K205R. Reaction temperature and time were optimized to 64 degrees C and 60 min, respectively. LAMP products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis or visually with the addition of fluorescent dye. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was approximately 6 copies of the target gene per microliter, 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR. LAMP is a simple and inexpensive molecular assay format for ASFV detection. To date, African swine fever has not been reported in China. LAMP can be used to monitor ASFV spread into China, thereby reducing the threat of ASF.

Cinnamomum longepaniculatum (oil camphor) is a plant widely distributed in China and used as folk medicine throughout the world. However, the antitumor activities of essential oil and its major compounds from C. longepaniculatum and the inhibitory mechanisms have not been reported before. In this report, we found that C. longepaniculatum essential oil and its major compounds terpinene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and safrole induced substantial apoptosis or necrosis of both human A549 lung cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However, 1,8-cineole did not show obvious inhibitory effects on both A549 and MCF-7 cells growth. After the treatments, the cell size and quantity were reduced, the cells were gradually rounded-up, and the nuclei became pyknotic in a dose-dependent manner. C. longepaniculatum essential oil showed significant in vitro antiproliferative activity towards A549 and MCF-7 cancer cells by increasing the proportion of their sub-G(1) phase. Western blotting indicated that essential oil compounds (especially the safrole) induced up-regulation of cell-cycle-related proteins P53 and P21. Among the major compounds, the costs of safrole were the lowest for both A549 and MCF-7 cell lines. Therefore, the essential oil from C. longepaniculatum and its key ingredients exhibit various degrees of inhibitory activity on the growth of A549 lung cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells by cell-cycle arresting. Among them, terpinene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and safrole manifested the most potent suppressive effect.

Results showed that main pharmacokinetic parameters in the model group when compared with those of the normal group were: absorption half-life (T-1/2 alpha) of (3.811 +/- 1.607) h vs. (1.431 +/- 0.074) h, elimination half-life (T-1/2 beta) of (29.803 +/- 5.750) h vs. (57.142 +/- 5.528) h, absorption rate constant (Ka) of (0.251 +/- 0.070) h(-1) 1 vs. (0.602 +/- 0.022) h(-1), time of maximum plasma concentration (T-max) of 3 h vs. 2 h, calculated maximum plasma concentration (C-max) of (3.945 +/- 0.644) mg/L vs. (1.215 +/- 0.058) mg/L, and area under the concentration-time to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of (42.520 +/- 0.792) mg/L vs. (47.961 +/- 0.781) mg/L, respectively. It is indicated that absorption and distribution of doxycycline hydrochloride in cherry valley duckling were slowed due to aflatoxicosis, and liver damage caused by alfatoxin significantly affected doxycycline hydrochloride in enterohepatic cycling, which would accelerate its elimination in vivo.

Nutrients, as an external regulator, potently regulate skeletal muscle development through various internal regulatory factors, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and microRNAs (miRNAs). As a nutrient sensor, mTOR, integrates nutrient availability to regulate myogenesis and directly or indirectly influences microRNA expression. MiRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs mediating gene silencing, are implicated in myogenesis and muscle-related diseases. Meanwhile, growing evidence has emerged supporting the notion that the expression of myogenic miRNAs could be regulated by nutrients in an epigenetic mechanism. Therefore, this review presents a novel insight into the cell signaling network underlying nutrient-mTOR-miRNA pathway regulation of skeletal myogenesis and summarizes the epigenetic modifications in myogenic differentiation, which will provide valuable information for potential therapeutic intervention.

CD8 is composed of two chains. Of these, the CD8 alpha chain was chosen for the detection because it involved in both the CD8 alpha alpha homodimer and the CD8 alpha beta heterodimer. Here, we established a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) for specific detection of goose CD8 alpha (goCD8 alpha). The results showed that the optimal coated antibody and antigen dilutions were 1:50 (the antibody titer was 1:12800) and 1:32 (0.3 ng mL(-1)),. respectively, while the optimal capture antibody and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG dilutions were 1:50 (the antibody titer was 1:51200) and 1:4000 (the antibody titer was 1:5000), respectively. The optimal blocking buffer was 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The best incubating condition was overnight at 4 degrees C, the best blocking time was 120 min and the best anti-capture antibody working time was 150 min. In addition, the minimum dose detectable by DAS-ELISA was 5x10(-3) ng mL(-1). Most importantly, goCD8 alpha expression levels in goose spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) post-Goose parvoviruse (GPV) infection were found to be significantly up-regulated using the DAS-ELISA method, which was consistent with previous results obtained using real-time quantitative PCR. In conclusion, the DAS-ELISA method reported here is a novel, specific technique for the clinical detection of goCD8 alpha.

In addition, the logistic cost, including harvest, transportation, and storage, was also evaluated to check the economic feasibility once biomass densification was employed for biogas production. The results demonstrated that the main composition, including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, of the pelleted and briquetted corn stover exhibited some degradation compared with their corresponding undensified corn stover. Both pellets and briquettes had no adverse impacts on anaerobic digestion. The cumulative biogas production from pellets was 349.9 mL g(-1) VS (VS: volatile solid), which was 25.8% higher than unpelleted corn stover (278.1 mL g(-1) VS, respectively), moreover, the cumulative CH4 production from pellets was 185.7 mL g(-1) VS compared with 135.1 mL g(-1) VS of unpelleted corn stover. Biogas production from briquettes was also slightly higher than that of the unbriquetted corn stover, however, improvement was not statistically significant. Increasing the organic loading, relatively higher biogas and CH4 production can be achieved from briquettes compared with the unbriquetted corn stover. This was mainly attributed to more free water in the anaerobic digestion of briquettes. Especially, there was 11.7% improvement on biogas production as the organic loading was increased to 80 g TS per kg (TS: total solid). As the briquettes were employed for biogas production with the digestor scale of 3000 m(3), the logistic cost could be curtailed by 36.1%. Evidently, the biomass densification can be employed in anaerobic digestion for biogas production to potentially solve the extra high cost of logistic issues.

De novo transcriptome analysis of tobacco seedlings and identification of the early response gene network under low-potassium stress	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Tobacco; Potassium deficiency; Gene expression; Illumina sequencing technology; Transcriptome	DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASES; RNA-SEQ; ARABIDOPSIS; CHANNEL; MODULATION; EXPRESSION; TRANSPORT; INTERACTS; DROUGHT; PLANTS	Tobacco is an economically important crop, and its potassium content can greatly affect the quality of tobacco leaves. However, the molecular mechanism involved in potassium starvation in tobacco has not been elucidated to date. In this study, Illumina (Solexa) sequencing technology was used to analyze the transcriptome of tobacco seedlings under low-potassium stress for 6, 12, and 24 h. After analysis, 107,824 assembled unigenes were categorized into 57 GO functional groups, and 31,379 unigenes (29.08%) were clustered into 25 COG categories. A total of 9945 genes were classified into 233 KEGG pathways, and 15,209 SSRs were found among the 107,824 unigenes. Between the two samples, 1034 genes were differentially expressed. Twelve randomly selected gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, and the results were highly consistent with those obtained by Solexa sequencing. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the gene-regulatory network of tobacco seedlings under low-potassium stress.	[Li, L. Q.; Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Lu, Y. F.; Lu, L.

Comparative quantitative trait locus mapping of maize flowering-related traits in an F-2:3 and recombinant inbred line population	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Maize; Flowering-related traits; F-2:3; RIL; QTL; MQTL	ZEA-MAYS L.; GRAIN-YIELD; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; TROPICAL MAIZE; QTL ANALYSIS; TIME; TEMPERATURE; COMPONENTS; IDENTIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTS	Flowering-related traits in maize are affected by complex factors and are important for the improvement of cropping systems in the maize zone. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detected using different materials and methods usually vary. In the present study, 266 maize (Zea mays) F-2:3 families and 301 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross between 08-641 (founding parent from southeast China) and Ye478 (founding parent from China) were evaluated for four flowering-related traits, including days to tasseling (DTT), days to pollen shedding (DPS), days to silking (DTS), and anthesis-silking interval. Sixty-six QTLs controlling the target traits were detected in the F-2:3 and RIL populations via single environment analysis and joint analysis across all environments (JAAE). The QTLs explained 0.8-13.47% of the phenotypic variation, with 12 QTLs explaining more than 10%. The results of meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis indicated that 41 QTLs could be integrated into 14 MQTLs. One MQTL included 2.9 QTLs, ranging from two to ten QTLs for one to three traits. QTLs, including MQTL1-1 and MQTL9-1, were detected across the F-2:3 and RIL populations via SAE and JAAE. Among the MQTLs, nine QTLs were integrated into MQTL9-1 and affected DTT, DPS, and DTS, with the favored allele being derived from 08-641. MQTL3-2 showed high phenotypic variation and was suitable for fine mapping to determine the genetic mechanisms of flowering. MQTL3-2 could be applied to improve inbred lines using marker-assisted selection.	[Liu, Y. H.] Sichuan Agr Univ, Maize Res Inst, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yi, Q.; Hou, X. B.; Zhang, X.

Analysis of pecan cultivars Mahan and Western in East China	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Carya illinoensis; Nut quality; Soil-applied paclobutrazol; Pinching; Supplementary pollination	SHOOT GROWTH; PACLOBUTRAZOL; TREES; YIELD; SEEDLINGS	Pecan (Carya illinoensis) has been introduced to East China for over one hundred years, but its planting is still only occurring at a small scale. The key limiting factor is its low yield. To enhance the yield pecan in East China, two pecan cultivars, Mahan and Western, were examined. Twenty traits describing phasic development, yield, nut quality, and cultural practice were investigated. We found that pecan cultivar Mahan gives a higher yield and nut quality than cultivar Western. We recommend interplanting of cultivar Pawnee to act as a pollinator tree. Appropriate cultivation practices that can be implemented to enhance fruit yield of cultivars Mahan and Western include soil-applied paclobutrazol (PBZ) at certain concentrations, pinching, and supplementary pollination. For example, the addition of 1.25 g/m(2) of PBZ inhibits pecan branch growth and stimulates short bearing branches, which promotes fruit yield. We found that soil-applied PBZ reached optimal performance 82 days after application. A pinching length of 40 cm resulted in a fruit yield increase. In addition, grafting and transplantation may promote male flowering, but delays female flowering. These cultural practices may provide insights that can be used to improve pecan cultivation in East China.

Identification of low potassium stress-responsive proteins in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) seedling roots using an iTRAQ-based analysis	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Potassium; iTRAQ; Root; Quantitative real-time PCR; Tobacco	COMPARATIVE PROTEOME ANALYSIS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; DEHYDROGENASE GENE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SALT STRESS; EXPRESSION; TOLERANCE; CYCLOPHILIN; LEAVES; PLANTS	Potassium is one of the three main mineral nutrients, and is vital for leaf growth and the quality of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. In recent years, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method has been one of the most popular techniques for quantitative proteomic analysis. In this study, we used iTRAQ to compare protein abundances in the roots of control and low potassium-treated tobacco seedlings, and found that 108 proteins were differentially expressed between the two treatments. Of these, 34 were upregulated and 74 were downregulated, and 39 (36%) were in the chloroplasts. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment results suggested that metabolic pathways were the dominant pathways (10 upregulated and 14 downregulated proteins). Ten proteins involved in the pyruvate metabolism pathway increased their expression levels, and 17 upregulated proteins were enriched in the ribosomes category. To evaluate correlations between protein and gene transcript abundances, the expression patterns of 12 randomly chosen genes were examined. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the 12 genes were induced after low potassium treatment for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Our results demonstrate that low potassium levels affect protein profiles in tobacco roots.	[Ren, X. L.; Guo, Y. S.] Guizhou Acad Tobacco Sci, Guiyang, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China; [Li, L.

However, it is not clear how this signaling pathway affects the ER stress. The present study aimed to determine whether the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway regulates tunicamycin (TM)-induced increases in mRNA levels of genes involved in the ER stress, to help elucidate the mechanism by which this pathway affects the ER stress in primary goose hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from geese and cultured in vitro. After 12 h in a serum-free medium, the hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h in a medium with either no addition (control) or with supplementation of TM or TM together with PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway inhibitors (LY294002, rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235). Thereafter, the expression levels of genes involved in the ER stress (BIP, EIF2a, ATF6, and XBP1) were assessed. The results indicated that the mRNA level of BIP was up-regulated in 0.2, 2, and 20 mu M TM treatment group (P < 0.05), whereas the mRNA levels of EIF2a, ATF6, and XBP1 were up-regulated in the 2 mu M TM treatment group (P < 0.05). However, the TM mediated induction of mRNA levels of genes involved in the ER stress (BIP, EIF2a, ATF6, and XBP1) was down-regulated after the treatment with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors (LY294002, NVP-BEZ235, and rapamycin). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the PI3K-Aktm-TOR signaling pathway might be involved in the down-regulation of the TM-induced ER stress in primary goose hepatocytes.	[Song, Q.; Han, C.

Identification and characterization of SREBF2 expression and its association with chicken carcass traits	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Chicken; SREBF2 gene; Cloning; Expression; Polymorphism	LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; HAPLOTYPE DISTRIBUTION; GROWTH TRAITS; GENE; POLYMORPHISMS; DISEASE; CATTLE; LOCUS	The sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 gene (SREBF2) plays an important role in regulating lipid homeostasis. To reveal the genetic factors that underlie carcass fat deposition in chickens, we cloned the coding DNA sequence of chicken SREBF2, investigated SREBF2 mRNA expression levels in various tissues, detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the exon regions of the gene, and conducted association analyses between single markers/haplotypes and carcass traits. The entire 2859-bp cDNA sequence of chicken SREBF2 that encoded 952 amino acids was obtained and characterized. SREBF2 mRNA was highly expressed in the uropygial gland, followed by the liver, breast muscle, and leg muscle. Ten SNPs were detected, and four (g. 49363077T>A, g. 49357503C>T, g. 49355533G>A, and g. 49354641G>A) were novel. When analyzing the associations between the single mutations and carcass traits, significant differences were found in three SNPs and g. 49357915G>A was highly significantly associated with most carcass traits, except for abdominal fat weight and sebum thickness. In addition, haplotype combinations that were constructed using the SREBF2 SNPs were associated with breast muscle weight. Chickens with the combined genotype H21H21 had the highest live weight, carcass weight, eviscerated weight, and semi-eviscerated weight values. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted on chicken SREBF2 polymorphisms, which are predictive of the genetics that underlie the economic performance of chickens.

Methylation differences and expression profiles of the caprine DIO3 gene	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						DIO3; Chinese Nanjiang Yellow goat; Methylation; Gene expression; Correlation	TYPE-3 IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE; THYROID-HORMONE; DNA METHYLATION; MAMMALIAN DEVELOPMENT; MOLECULAR-CLONING; MOUSE; CELLS; INACTIVATION; METABOLISM; MATURATION	gene, located in the DLK1-DIO3 (delta-like 1 homologtype 3 iodothyronine deiodinase) imprinted domain, and is potentially involved in degrading excessive amounts of thyroid hormone to protect embryogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the imprinted DIO3 gene expression during fetal and neonatal development in goats has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the DNA methylation patterns of the caprine DIO3 intragenic CpG island and quantified gene expression level in six tissues from Chinese Nanjiang Yellow 3-day old kids. The expression of the DIO3 gene was determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs), while the identification of methylation patterns was determined using bisulfite-sequencing PCRs. Modest, and non-significant (P > 0.05), methylation patterns were noted for the DIO3 CpG island methylation in the brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, and longissimus dorsi tissues (ranging from 26.48 to 34.92%). The expression level of the DIO3 mRNA was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the liver tissue than in the other five tissues. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant relationship between methylation and gene expression (P > 0.05), which indicated that the expression of the caprine DIO3 gene was likely modified by other regulatory elements. This study identified DNA methylation and expression patterns of the DIO3 gene in goats and provided insights into further regulatory mechanisms of expression and imprinting in the DLK1-DIO3 domain.

Research on intelligent watermelon identification and positioning method in natural scene	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine vision; intelligent identification and positioning; squint binocular positioning; natural watermelon image		The intelligent identification and positioning for melons and other fruits are important links for the melon and fruit picking robot to naturalize smooth picking, thus directly affecting the picking efficiency and success rate. Considering that the picking robot has low identification rate and low positioning accuracy for melons and fruits, this paper designed an intelligent watermelon identification and positioning method in a natural scene. This method included the following steps: first, the natural watermelon images shot by the left and right cameras were captured to increase the proportion of the watermelon region in the image; second, erosion, adaptive noise cancellation and filling, as well as other techniques were used for the captured watermelon image to identify the watermelon region and calculate its values of barycentric coordinates; third, the squint binocular positioning algorithm was designed based on the values of watermelon barycentric coordinates in two images to obtain the actual watermelon three-dimensional space coordinates, using the left camera as the origin of coordinates. The experiment verified that the relative positioning errors of this method were within +/- 15% for the watermelon three-dimensional space coordinates in a natural scene, thereby providing a key intelligent identification and positioning method for the watermelon picking robot.

In the present study, we fully characterised the effects of dietary ALGO supplementation on certain parameters of weaned pigs. In a 21-day experiment, 16 Landrace x Yorkshire weaned pigs were divided into two groups (n = 8) and fed either with a corn-soybean basal diet (CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 100 mg kg(-1) ALGO. We show that dietary ALGO supplementation markedly enhanced (P < 0.05) the average daily body weight gain (ADG) of weaned pigs over the experimental periods. ALGO supplementation not only elevated (P < 0.05) the concentrations of IL-10, IgG and IgA but also increased (P < 0.05) the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the serum. Moreover, the concentration of serum malonic dialdehyde (MDA) was lower (P < 0.05) in the ALGO group than in the CON group. ALGO supplementation also significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) content, villus height and disaccharidase activities (lactase and sucrase) in the small intestine. Interestingly, dietary ALGO supplementation up-regulated (P < 0.05) the expression levels of tight junction protein occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) in the small intestine. Importantly, ALGO not only increased (P < 0.05) the populations of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus but also decreased (P < 0.05) the populations of total bacteria and Escherichia coli in the intestine. Overall, the positive effects of ALGO on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immunity and intestinal development in weaned pigs suggest that ALGO could serve as an attractive bioactive feed additive in the pig industry, which may be beneficial to human health.

Plasma and milk were collected from healthy cows, cows suffering from mild E. coli mastitis, and cows suffering from severe E. coli mastitis. Protein composition was examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Plasma haptoglobin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein demonstrated greater expression in mastitic cows compared with controls, but there were no difference between mildly and severely mastitic cows. Milk from mildly mastitic cows showed increased albumin and casein variants. Severely mastitic cows showed lower casein levels and increased anti-microbial and acute phase proteins. Milk alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and cathelicidins were associated with severe mastitis. A greater number of beta-casein fragments that corresponded to beta-casein isoforms were found in milk from mildly mastitic cows. These results suggest that caseins levels decreased and the concentrations of anti-microbial and acute phase proteins increased corresponding to the degree of E. coli mastitis. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine whether cathelicidin could serve as a diagnostic marker for mastitis.

The increase of cytosolic Ca2(+) results from intracellular Ca2(+) release with subsequent activation of store-operated Ca2(+) entry (SOCE). Previous studies suggested miRNAs are required for the development and functions of CD4(+) T cells. An enzyme called Dicer is required during the process of manufacturing mature miRNAs from the precursor miRNAs. In this study, we explored whether loss of Dicer in CD4(+) T cells affects SOCE and thus Ca2(+) dependent regulation of cellular functions. Methods: We tested the expression of Orai1 by q-RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Further, we measured SOCE by an inverted phase-contrast microscope with the Incident-light fluorescence illumination system using Fura-2. Intracellular Ca2(+) was also measured by flow cytometry using Ca2(+) sensitive dye Fluo-4. Results: We found that in Dicer deficient (Dicer(Delta/Delta\)) mice Orai1 was downregulated at mRNA and protein level in CD4(+) T cells. Further, SOCE was significantly smaller in Dicer(Delta/Delta) CD4(+) T cells than in CD4(+) T cells isolated from wild-type (Dicer(fl/fl)) mice. Conclusion: Our data suggest that miRNAs are required for adequate Ca2(+) entry into CD4(+) T cells and thus triggering of Ca2(+) sensitive immune functions.

A total of 160 one-day-old Cobb male broilers (n = 80 per group) were fed a Se-deficient corn-soybean basal diet supplemented with 0.3 (adequate), and 3.0 (excess) mg kg (-1) sodium selenite for 6 weeks. Pancreas, liver and muscle were collected, and the effects of supranutritional Se on mRNA abundance of 23 selenoprotein genes and 17 insulin-related genes were compared at day 42. Also, enzyme activities and plasma biochemical measurements were measured at days 14, 28, and 42. The results showed that a high-Se diet depressed the growth performance of broilers and elevated (P < 0.05) the activities of superoxidase dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), mainly in the early stages. A high-Se diet up-regulated 12 selenoprotein genes in muscle, 7 genes in liver and Sephs2 in the pancreas, and down-regulated 3 selenoprotein genes in muscle, 4 genes in liver and 7 genes in the pancreas. Meanwhile, 4, 3 and 2 insulin signal-related genes were up-regulated in muscle, liver and the pancreas, respectively, 3 and 5 genes were down-regulated in muscle and the pancreas. Accompany the aberrant expression of selenoprotein and insulin signal-related genes, the birds exhibited a higher plasma insulin, total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) concentrations by high Se. In conclusion, the high Se diet induced hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia in birds via a mediating aberrant expression of selenoprotein genes associated with insulin signal-related genes, which indicated potential roles of those selenoprotein genes in the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism regulation in birds.

In some economic entities, the growth rate of energy consumption is equal to the corresponding growth rate of energy intensity and economic output, and their product. Based on the "3GR" model, some conclusions could be obtained: (1) for the expected goal of growth rate of economic output and energy intensity of some economic entities, there is a linear relationship among the growth rate of energy intensity or economic output; (2) for the expected goal of growth rate of energy consumption of some economic entities, there is an inverse relationship between the growth rate of economic output and energy intensity; (3) energy consumption of an economy is equal to the product of the initial level of energy consumption, product of "one plus growth rate of economic output", and product of "one plus growth rate of energy intensity".

However, its effect on porcine intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation remains poorly understood. In this study, the plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)-pPID1 was transfected into porcine intramuscular preadipocytes with Lipofectamine 3000 reagent to over-express porcine PID1 (pPID1). Over-expression of pPID1 significantly promoted porcine intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation. Expression of pPID1 mRNA was significantly increased upon porcine intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation. Indirect fluorescent immunocytochemistry demonstrated that pPID1 protein was localized predominantly in the nucleus of porcine intramuscular preadipocyte. The mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor , CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and lipoprotein lipase were significantly increased by pPID1 over-expression. Over-expression of pPID1 also led to an increase in lipid accumulation which was detected by Oil Red O staining, and significantly increased the intramuscular triacylglycerol content. These results indicate that pPID1 may play a role in enhancing porcine intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.

We detected one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP: g.16443397 T>G) located at 271bp in intron 8 in the Hyla, Champagne and Tianfu Black rabbit breeds. This SNP was significantly related to pH and intramuscular fat in rabbit meat from the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles. Rabbits with the GG and TT genotypes had lower pH and intramuscular fat content than GT rabbits. A comparison of meat quality trait least squares means for the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles indicated that pH values were similar in both longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles, color lightness in the biceps femoris muscle was higher than that in m. longissimus dorsi, while color redness and yellowness in m. longissimus dorsi were higher than in the biceps femoris muscle. Thus, results reported here indicated that this CAST SNP may be of potential use in marker assisted selection for meat quality traits in rabbits.

However, a Dongting loquat mutant, which involved bud sport and growing white-fleshed fruit in the central region of the trunk (as wild loquat bears yellow-fleshed fruits naturally), was discovered in the preliminary study. The study cloned the coding sequence (CDS) of NAD(+)-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase (NAD(+)-SDH) gene from the selected materials of mutant loquat, wild loquat and other nine loquat cultivars/accessions, and found that the CDS of NAD(+)-SDH gene from the mutant loquat, other than the rest two types of materials, had three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci; in addition, the amino acid encoded at variation loci changed accordingly. NAD(+)-SDH plays an active role in converting sorbitol into fructose in loquat cultivars. For the mutant white-fleshed loquat, the activity of NAD(+)-SDH rises first and then drops, the sorbitol content decreases steadily, and its fructose content is higher than that in wild loquat from coloration to maturation stage. As demonstrated by the real-time fluorescence quantification PCR analysis, the expression level of NAD(+)-SDH gene at maturation stage is about 5-fold lower than wild type. It may be assumed that, the three SNPs loci might lead to excessive conversion of sorbitol into fructose under the catalytic action of NAD(+)-SDH of white-fleshed mutant loquat at maturation stage, resulting in the increase of fructose content and reduced expression abundance of mRNA after transcription. Besides, NAD(+)-SDH gene may be related to flesh color and carbohydrate variation of white-fleshed mutant loquat.

To investigate response and tolerance to low -temperature stress, the four varieties of Iceland poppy, Champagne Bubbles (CB), Domestic Variety (DV), Wonderland (WL), and Garden Gnome (GG), were subjected to low -temperature treatment from 0 degrees C to -9 degrees C. The relative electrical conductivities in four varieties increased along with the decrease in temperature. Treated by 3 degrees C, the morphological changes of seedlings at different time points were investigated. Four varieties were differentially injured by freezing temperature. The dynamic accumulations of malondialdehyde (MDA), free praline (FP), soluble proteins (SP), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) during low-temperature treatment were measured and compared. A minor change in SP content during treatment was found, whereas MDA and FP were significantly induced. Complex patterns of activity alternations of SOD, POD, and CAT were found. Based on the calculation of semi-lethal temperature and comprehensive physiological parameters investigation, the tolerance of four varieties was evaluated as CB > GG and DV> WL.

In the present study, we explored the effects of dietary COS supplementation on the reproductive performance and gene expression of certain biochemical markers in the placenta and foetus of sows. Fifty-two Yorkshire multiparous sows were randomly allocated into two groups after mating (n = 26) and fed either with a corn-soybean basal diet (CON) or the basal diet supplemented with 100 mg kg(-1) COS (COS). We show that COS supplementation significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the foetal survival rate and size (crown-to-rump length) after 35 days of gestation. COS supplementation also significantly elevated (P < 0.05) the number of viable piglets born per litter and the average weights for piglets born alive. Interestingly, COS supplementation not only elevated (P < 0.05) serum leptin and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) concentrations but also increased (P < 0.05) the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) at 35 days of gestation. Moreover, the serum leptin and IgG concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in COS than in the CON group at 85 days of gestation. Importantly, dietary COS supplementation not only upregulated (P < 0.05) the expression levels of leptin and VEGFA in the placenta but also elevated (P < 0.05) the expression of critical foetal development-related genes (STAT3, TGF-beta, and FGFR2) in the foetus at 35 days of gestation. Collectively, these results furthered our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of COS on foetal development and reproductive performance in pregnant sows.

However, the systemic metabolic changes related to oxidative stress and glutamine intervention remain largely unknown. Rats were fed a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 1% glutamine for 30 days. On day 28, the rats were intraperitoneally injected with either diquat or saline. Oxidative stress alters common systemic metabolic processes, including energy, amino acid, and gut microbiota metabolisms. Compared with the diquat group, the glutamine + diquat group had significantly higher plasma levels of citrate and isobutyrate and urine levels of homogentisate and alpha-ketoglutarate while lower plasma levels of acetate, creatine, formate, glutamate, leucine, O-acetyl glycoprotein, phenylalanine, pyruvate, alpha-glucose, and beta-glucose and urine levels of benzoate and trigonelline. Glutamine can partially counteract the metabolic effects of oxidative stress. These findings provide new insights into the complex metabolic changes after glutamine supplementation in rats under oxidative stress.

There are no reports on the effects of nickel or nickel compounds on the lung via dietary administration at present. This study aimed to investigate pulmonary toxicity induced by dietary NiCl2 in broiler chickens by using histopathology, qRT-PCR, and ELISA. In comparison with the control group, NiCl2 intake induced oxidative damage to DNA (upregulation of 8-OHdG) and lipid peroxidation (upregulation of MDA), which was associated with the upregulation of NO and the downregulation of the expression levels and activities of pulmonary CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, GR and GST mRNA. Also, the T-AOC activity, GSH content, ability to inhibit the generation of hydroxyl radicals, and ratio of GSH/GSSG were decreased in the groups treated with NiCl2. Concurrently, the mRNA expression levels of iNOS, TNF-alpha, COX-2, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and IFN-gamma. were increased via the activation of NF-kappa B, and the mRNA expression levels of anti-inflammatory mediators including IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 were decreased in the groups treated with NiCl2. The above-mentioned results were the first to demonstrate that NiCl2 intake induced pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammatory responses via the dietary pathway, which subsequently contributed to histopathological lesions and dysfunction.

In order to optimize the beneficial effects of ZnO and minimize any resultant environmental pollution, ZnO nanoparticles are often used for delivery of the zinc. However, the possible toxic effects of ZnO nanoparticles, including effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, have not been evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effect of ZnO nanoparticles, in doses used in animal feeds, on CYP450 enzymes, liver and intestinal enzymes, liver and kidney histopathology, and hematologic indices in rats. We found that liver and kidney injury occurred when the concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles in feed were 300-600 mg/kg. Also, liver mRNA expression for constitutive androstane receptor was suppressed and mRNA expression for pregnane X receptor was induced when feed containing ZnO nanoparticles was given at a concentration of 600 mg/kg. Although the expression of mRNA for CYP 2C11 and 3A2 enzymes was induced by ZnO nanoparticles, the activities of CYP 2C11 and 3A2 were suppressed. While liver CYP 1A2 mRNA expression was suppressed, CYP 1A2 activity remained unchanged at all ZnO nanoparticle doses. Therefore, it has been concluded that ZnO nanoparticles, in the doses customarily added to animal feed, changed the indices of hematology and blood chemistry, altered the expression and activity of hepatic CYP enzymes, and induced pathological changes in liver and kidney tissues of rats. These findings suggest that greater attention needs to be paid to the toxic effects of ZnO nanoparticles in animal feed, with the possibility that the doses of ZnO should be reduced.

And the active joints with damping springs as the reduction vibration actuator, the reduction vibration seat model with the 3-PRPS parallel mechanism which had six degree of freedom was established. Based on the above analysis, the simulation model can be obtained. In order to verify the reliability of the simulation model, the experiment of vibration acceleration transmissibility was conducted and the result was then compared with that of the numerical computation. Their results were consistent with each other. It indicated that the simulation model was reliable and could be used for the subsequent analysis. Then, influence factor of vibration acceleration transmissibility was researched based on the verified simulation model. In order to obtain a suspension system with better reduction vibration performance, making the maximum vibration acceleration transmissibility in the vertical and horizontal be minimum was set as the optimisation objective. And the above influence factors were taken as the design variables. Finally, the ride comfort of vehicles was improved. Meanwhile, this research can also provide some references for the similar engineering problems.

A deeper understanding of when customers will review and what motivates them to write online reviews is of both theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, we present a novel methodological framework, which consists of theoretical modeling and text-mining technologies, to study the relationships among customers' review promptness, their review opinions, and their review motivations. We first study customers' online "purchase-review" behavior dynamics; then, we introduce the LDA method to mine customers' opinion from their review text; finally, we propose a theoretical model to explore some motivations for those people publishing review online. The analytical and experimental results with real data from a Chinese B2C website demonstrate that the behavior dynamics of customers' online review are influenced by the multidimensional motivations, and some of them can be observed from their review behaviors, such as review promptness.

However, Coptis chinensis Franch has not previously been evaluated for safety through systematic toxicological studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute and subchronic toxicity of Coptis chinensis Franch Solution (CCFS) in specific pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In addition, we conducted a safety pharmacological evaluation of CCFS to supplement the toxicity tests. The acute administration of CCFS was performed at top dose of 5000 mg per kg/bodyweight (bw) and Groups of male and female SPF SD rats received 3000, 4000 and 5000 mg/kg doses of CCFS orally for 30 days. The acute toxicity study showed that the LD50 of CCFS was greater than 5000 mg/kg, whereas the subchronic oral toxicity study suggested that the growth of rats could be related to different doses of CCFS. The clinical pathology showed that a CCFS dose of 5000 mg/kg could cause reversible damage to the liver, kidney, spleen, testis and ovary lesions. The NOAEL of CCFS is greater than 3000 mg/kg body weight but less than 4000 mg/kg body weight. Safety pharmacological findings indicated that CCFS has no side effects on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and respiratory system. These results suggest that CCFS is a safe veterinary medicine for external use.

At present, little is known about the effect of tillage and straw mulch on the root system of wheat under dryland areas in southwestern China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three tillage treatments (no-till, NT; rotary till, RT; conventional till, CT) and two crop residue management practices (straw mulch, ML; non-straw mulch, NML) on stand establishment, root growth and grain yield of wheat. NT resulted in lower soil cover thickness for the wheat seed, higher number of uncovered seeds, lower percentage of seedling-less ridges and lower tiller density compared to RT and CT; ML resulted in higher tiller density compared to NML. Straw mulching resulted in more soil water content and root length density (RLD) at most of the growth stages and soil depths. The maximum RLD, root surface area density and root dry matter density were obtained under NT. In the topmost 10 cm soil layer, higher RLD values were found under NT than those under RT and CT. There were no significant differences in the yield or yield components of wheat among the tillage treatments in 2011-2012, but NT resulted in a significant higher yield compared to RT and CT in 2012-2013. Grain yield was significantly higher in ML compared to in NML. A strong relationship was observed between the water-use efficiency and the grain yield. Both NT and ML proved beneficial for wheat in term of maintaining higher tiller density, better soil water status and root growth, leading to a higher grain yield and enhanced water-use efficiency, especially in a low rainfall year.

Quality potential of synthetic-derived commercial wheat cultivars in south-western China	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						commercial cultivar; quality potential; Southwest China; synthetic wheat	X TRITICUM-TAUSCHII; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; MAKING QUALITY; GENOTYPE; TRAITS; YIELD; GRAIN; LINES; LOCI	Multi-environment trials were conducted to investigate the quality potential of synthetic-derived cultivars (SDCs) and non-synthetic-derived cultivars (NSCs) in south-western China. The environmental effect was greater than genotypic for most protein quantity and quality parameters. The genotype effect was greater for falling number and the parameters from the rapid visco analyser (RVA). In terms of group means, grain protein content, wet gluten content, falling number, and RVA parameters were all significantly lower in SDCs than NSCs. No differences in the parameters reflecting dough strength (Zeleny sedimentation volume and farinograph parameters) were found between the two groups. Significant differences existed within each group, and the degree of variation was especially great in SDCs, among which Chuanmai 104 performed well in various quality parameters. Germination index at physiological maturity varied greatly among cultivars, with the lowest being Chuanmai 104, and the SDCs significantly lower than the NSCs. Although delayed harvest resulted in a significant reduction in falling number, partial SDCs such as Chuanmai 104 and Chuanmai 42 expressed relatively small reductions. In summary, SDCs exhibit a higher degree of variation in quality parameters; these findings indicate their large potential for breeding high-quality cultivars in south-western China.	[Tang, Y.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors formulate a model to introduce carbon emissions-sensitive demand into the newsvendor framework with strategic customer behavior. The authors characterize the rational expectations equilibrium to derive the optimal solutions to the manufacturer. The authors analyze the effects of carbon emissions-sensitive demand on the manufacturer's optimal strategies, total carbon emissions and maximum expected profit by comparative analysis. Findings - The authors obtain the manufacturer's optimal production, pricing and green technology investment strategies under rational expectations equilibrium in scenario of price-sensitive demand and that of carbon emissions-sensitive demand, respectively. The authors find that as customer demand changes from price-sensitive demand to carbon emissions-sensitive demand, the manufacturer's optimal prices are the same but optimal production quantity, optimal unit carbon emissions and maximum expected profit go down. Though the total emissions decrease, the carbon emissions reduction would not increase as the demand is more carbon emissions-sensitive. Whether it increases or decreases depends on the model parameters. Originality/value - Carbon emissions-sensitive demand and strategic customer behavior are considered simultaneously in an integrated model. The result can guide the manufacturer decision-making. The proposed model are hoped to shed light to the future works in the field of sustainable supply chain management.

A pot experiment was conducted with the purpose to examine the impact of sulfur on improving Pb solubility in soil, and uptake and accumulation in wheat plants. The effect of three levels of lead (0, 50, and 100mg/kg soil) and sulfur (0, 150, and 300mmol/kg soil) was tested in all possible combinations. Root dry matter, straw, and grain yields, and the photosynthetic and transpiration rates decreased significantly with increase in the concentration of Pb in the soil. However, sulfur fertilization in the presence of Pb improved the photosynthetic and transpiration rates and consequently increased the straw and grain yields of wheat. It also enhanced Pb accumulation in roots, its translocation from roots to shoot, and accumulation in grain. S and Zn contents of different plant parts were also enhanced. Thus, by mitigating the toxic effect of Pb and improving wheat growth, sulfur enhances Pb accumulation by the aboveground plant parts and hence the phytoextraction capacity of wheat. However, total accumulation of Pb shows that wheat plant cannot be considered as a suitable candidate for phytoremediation.

In this study, a transcriptome, including 76,014 unigenes, was assembled from dwarf polish wheat (DPW) roots, stems, and leaves using the software of Trinity. Among these unigenes, 61,748 (81.23%) unigenes were functionally annotated in public databases and classified into differentially functional types. Aligning this transcriptome against draft wheat genome released by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), 57,331 (75.42%) unigenes, including 26,122 AB-specific and 2,622 D-specific unigenes, were mapped on A, B, and/or D genomes. Compared with the transcriptome of T. turgidum, 56,343 unigenes were matched with 103,327 unigenes of T. turgidum. Compared with the genomes of rice and barley, 14,404 and 7,007 unigenes were matched with 14,608 genes of barley and 7,708 genes of rice, respectively. On the other hand, 2,148, 1,611, and 2,707 unigenes were expressed specifically in roots, stems, and leaves, respectively. Finally, 5,531 SSR sequences were observed from 4,531 unigenes, and 518 primer pairs were designed.

Here we report the expression and purification of a His-tagged version of recombinant porcine Sox6 (pSox6) in Escherichia coli. The recombinant pSox6 was expressed as a C-terminal fusion protein with His6 tag in the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) host strain. The protein was purified by Ni affinity chromatography, yielding approximately 5 mu g/mL. The protein was identified by western blot analysis and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer analysis. In vitro biological activity assay demonstrated that the refolded purified recombinant pSox6 downregulated MyHC I, Tnnt1, Tnnc1, and Tnni1 mRNA expressions in porcine myotubes, suggesting that it was active. The present study provides a reliable technique for the recombinant expression and purification of pSox6 protein.

However, the molecular basis of tolerance to low-K+ stresses in tobacco still remains unknown. Here, we report the role of a member of the A. thaliana CBL (calcineurin B-like) interacting protein kinase (CIPK) family, AtCIPK23, in low-K+ stress responses in tobacco. Molecular analyses revealed that the AtCIPK23 gene was successfully transferred into a tobacco cultivar K326 via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Overexpression of AtCIPK23 in tobacco resulted in increased low-K+ tolerance, which was demonstrated by higher dry biomass, longer primary root length, higher K+ content and better growth status of transgenic tobacco plants compared to controls when both were treated in low-K+ MS medium and low-K+ hydroponics. Moreover, transgenic lines conferred tolerance to low-K+ stress by increasing the K+ uptake rate under low-K+ conditions. Taken together, these results provide evidence that AtCIPK23 may be involved in the CBL-CIPK signalling network in tobacco responses to low-K+ stress.

Use of reverse genetic-based gene cloning and function verification to discover waterlogging tolerance genes in Z. nicaraguensis is currently impractical, because little gene sequence information for Z. nicaraguensis is available in public databases. In this study, Z. nicaraguensis seedlings were subjected to simulated waterlogging stress and total RNAs were isolated from roots stressed and non-stressed controls. In total, 80 mol L-1 Illumina 100-bp paired-end reads were generated. De novo assembly of the reads generated 81002 final non-redundant contigs, from which 5 261 full-length transcripts were identified. Among these full-length transcripts, 3 169 had at least one Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, 2354 received cluster of orthologous groups (COG) terms, and 1 992 were assigned a Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) Orthology number. These sequence data represent a valuable resource for identification of Z. nicaraguensis genes involved in waterlogging response.

Although antibiotics are widely used to control infections, outbreaks of this disease repeatedly happen. In this study, emodin from Polygonum cuspidatum showed potent inhibitory effect against H. parasuis. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of emodin were 32 and 64 mu g/mL, respectively. The antibacterial kinetic curves indicated the antibacterial activity of emodin was in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell membrane permeability and flow cytometry assays proved that emodin could destroy cell membrane integrity and increase membrane permeability, and fluorescence spectra assay indicated emodin has influenced conformation of membrane protein. Under transmission electron microscopy, serious lesions of H. parasuis exposed to emodin (64 mu g/mL) were found, including irregular cell shape, plasmolysis, ruptured cell wall and membrane and cytoplasmic vacuolation. These results suggested that emodin could be used as candidate for treating Glasser's disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

We previously reported that trigeneric germplasms were produced by crossing wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica amphiploids (PHW-SA, 2n = 8x = 56, AABBDDNsNs) with hexaploid triticale (Zhongsi 828, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBRR). In the present study, chromosome pairing behavior and the genome constitution of the F-4 progenies of wheat-rye-P. huashanica trigeneric hybrids were studied. Cytological analysis showed that the chromosome number of F-4 progenies ranged from 39 to 46, and 57.5% of them had 42 chromosomes. The mean meiotic configuration of F-4 lines was 1.71 univalents, 20.26 bivalents, 0.04 trivalents, and 0.001 quadrivalents per pollen mother cell. Among the lines with 2n = 42, the average pairing configuration was 1.21 univalents, 16.22 ring bivalents, 4.16 rod bivalents, and 0.01 trivalents. This result indicated that these lines were cytologically stable. Other lines with 2n = 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, and 46, bearing a high number of univalents or multivalents, showed abnormal meiotic behavior. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) revealed that all F-4 lines had 11-14 rye chromosomes, but no P. huashanica chromosomes. The complete set of 14 rye chromosomes was found in 19 lines. At meiosis, GISH detected 1-6 univalents with hybridization signals of rye in 13 lines. Bivalents with fluorescence signals were identified in each line, ranging from 3 to 7. A quadrivalent with hybridization signals was observed in only 1 line, K13-714-8. Lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, micronuclei, and chromosome fragments hybridizing with the probe were not discovered in any of the lines. These results inferred that the behavior of rye chromosomes was normal during meiosis. In addition, 21 lines of 2n = 42 (91.3%) with 12 or 14 rye chromosomes, always contained 6 or 7 bivalents bearing fluorescence signals. This suggested that the rye chromosomes exhibiting complete pairing in these lines were cytologically stable during meiosis and may therefore be considered as new hexaploid triticales. Thus, these lines might be potential materials for further hexaploid triticale improvement. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Previous studies suggest that both land use change and climate contribute to the changes of water supply in this critical watershed. However, the specific causes of the decline in the Miyun Reservoir are debatable under a non-stationary climate in the past 4 decades. The central objective of this study was to quantify the separate and collective contributions of land use change and climate variability to the decreasing inflow into the Miyun Reservoir during 1961-2008. Different from previous studies on this watershed, we used a comprehensive approach to quantify the timing of changes in hydrology and associated environmental variables using the long-term historical hydrometeorology and remote-sensing-based land use records. To effectively quantify the different impacts of the climate variation and land use change on streamflow during different sub-periods, an annual water balance model (AWB), the climate elasticity model (CEM), and a rainfall-runoff model (RRM) were employed to conduct attribution analysis synthetically. We found a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in annual streamflow, a significant positive trend in annual potential evapo-transpiration (p < 0.01), and an insignificant (p > 0.1) negative trend in annual precipitation during 1961-2008. We identified two streamflow breakpoints, 1983 and 1999, by the sequential Mann-Kendall test and double-mass curve. Climate variability alone did not explain the decrease in inflow to the Miyun Reservoir. Reduction of water yield was closely related to increase in actual evapotranspiration due to the expansion of forestland and reduction in cropland and grassland, and was likely exacerbated by increased water consumption for domestic and industrial uses in the basin. The contribution to the observed streamflow decline from land use change fell from 64-92% during 1984-1999 to 36-58% during 2000-2008, whereas the contribution from climate variation climbed from 8-36% during the 1984-1999 to 42-64% during 2000-2008. Model uncertainty analysis further demonstrated that climate warming played a dominant role in streamflow reduction in the most recent decade (i.e., 2000s). We conclude that future climate change and variability will further challenge the water supply capacity of the Miyun Reservoir to meet water demand. A comprehensive watershed management strategy needs to consider the climate variations besides vegetation management in the study basin.

In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of this species (GenBank: KP979646) and found it contains 16,265 base pairs, which encode 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA) and 1 control region (CR). We also found that almost all PCGs and tRNA genes are located on the H-strand, except for ND6 subunit gene and eight tRNA genes, which were distributed on the L-strand. The PCGs used "ATG" and "GTG" as the start codon, while used four types of stop codons. Almost all tRNA genes were folded into typical cloverleaf secondary structures. The L-strand replication origin (OL) and a non-coding region were also found. The new mitogenomic phylogenetic tree confirms the reciprocally monophyly of the genus Tylototriton, Echinotriton and Pleurodeles with high bootstrap value. The present study will provide information for future studies on the conservation genetics and phylogeny of this species and its relatives.

As one of the best chicken breeds with adaptability to highland environment, the Tibetan chicken, is genetically different from lowland chicken breeds. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of hypoxic adaptability in high altitude, in the present study, we focused on the MT-COI together with ATP-6 gene to explore the regulatory mechanisms for hypoxia adaptability in Tibet chicken. Here, we sequenced MT-COI of 29 Tibetan chickens and 30 Chinese domestic chickens and ATP-6 gene of 28 Tibetan chickens and 29 Chinese domestic chickens. In MT-COI gene, 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected though none of these was a missense mutation, confirming the fact that MT-COI gene is a largely conservative sequence. In ATP-6 gene, 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and we found a missense mutation (m.9441G>) in the ATP-6 gene of Tibetan chicken resulting in an amino acid substitution. Due to the critical role of ATP-6 gene in the proton translocation and energy metabolism, we speculated the possibility of this mutation playing an important role in easier energy conversion and metabolism in Tibetan chickens than Chinese domestic chickens so as to better adapt to the harsh environment of the high-altitude areas. The Median-joining profile also suggested that haplotype Ha2 has the ancestral position to the other haplotypes and has significant relationship with high-altitude adaptation in ATP-6 gene. Therefore, we considered that the polymorphism (m.9441G>) in the ATP-6 gene may affect the specific functions of ATP-6 enzyme relating to high-altitude adaptation of Tibetan chicken and MT-COI gene is a largely conservative sequence.

However, limited available sequence information in Heterakis gallinarum has greatly impeded the study in this area. In this study, we first investigated the genetic variability and genetic structure of H. gallinarum. The 1325 bp fragments of the mitochondrial COX1 gene were amplified in 56 isolates of H. gallinarum from seven different geographical regions in Sichuan province, China. The 56 sequences were classified into 22 haplotypes (H1-H22). The values of haplotype diversity (0.712) and nucleotide diversity (0.00158) in Sichuan population indicate a rapid expansion occurred from a relatively small, short-term effective population in the past. The haplotype network formed a distribution around H1 in a star-like topology, and the haplotypes did not cluster according to their geographical location. Similar conclusions could be made from MP phylogenetic tree. The F-st value (F-st<0.16965) and AMOVA analysis revealed that no significant genetic differentiation was observed among the seven different geographical populations. Neutrality tests (Tajima's D and Fu's Fs) and mismatch analysis indicated that H. gallinarum experienced a population expansion in the past. Our results indicated that H. gallinarum experienced a rapid population expansion in the past, and there was a low genetic diversity and an absence of population structure across the population.

Our study focused on exploring the mt-ND2 tissue expression patterns and the effects of energy restriction and dietary fat (linseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil or lard) level (2.5% and 5%) on its expression in chicken. The results showed that mt-ND2 gene was expressed in the 15 tissues of hybrid chickens with the highest level in heart and lowest level in pancreas tissue; 30% energy restriction did not significantly affect mt-ND2 mRNA level in chicken liver tissue. Both the mt-ND2 mRNA levels in chicken pectoralis (p<0.05) and hepatic tissues (p<0.05) at 42 d-old were affected by the type of dietary fats in 5% level, while not in abdominal fat tissues. The expression of mt-ND2 in hepatic tissues was down-regulated with chicken age (p<0.01). The interactive effect of dietary fat types with chicken age (p<0.05) was significant on mt-ND2 mRNA level. The study demonstrated that mt-ND2 gene was extensively expressed in tissues, and the expression was affected by dietary fat types and chicken age.

Mushroom tumor on Flammulina velutipes has become the main disease during the off-season cultivation of F. velutipes while the causal organism has remained unknown. The present study was aimed at identifying the pathogen confirming its pathogenisity following Koch's Postulates, characterizing it using morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular features, and studying its current distribution. We determined that mushroom tumor is a new bacterial infection disease caused by Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense. It produces tumor-like structures on the surface of the substrate, and inhibits the formation of primordia and fruiting of F. velutipes. The molecular studies showed that this new pathogen is closely related to Ochrobactrum based on 16S rRNA sequences. This is the first time that Ochrobactrum has been shown to be a pathogen of a mushroom.

Afterwards, the photocatalytic performances of the produced ZnS powders were investigated using methylene blue (MB) visible light induced photodegradation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis-DRS) were used for characterization of the as-prepared ZnS powders. The specific surface areas of dandelion-ZnS, raspberry-ZnS, ball-ZnS and flower-ZnS were found to be 112, 119, 5.89 and 37.4 m(2) g(-1), respectively. The MB photodegradation by ZnS fitted well with a pseudo-first-order model. The high specific surface areas, unique morphology, porous structures and high hydrophilicity contribute to the photocatalytic abilities of ZnS. However, it shows that ZnS with simple structures has better reusability.

However, the antioxidant effect of NCG remains largely unknown. This study aims to survey the effects of ARG and NCG supplementation on the antioxidant statuses of the liver and plasma in rats under oxidative stress. Rats were fed for 30 days with one of the three iso-nitrogenous diets: basal diet (BD), BD plus 1% ARG, and BD plus 0.1% NCG. On day 28, half of the rats fed with BD were intraperitoneally injected with 12 mg per kg body weight of diquat (diquat group) and the other half was injected intraperitoneally with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (control group). The other diet groups also received an intraperitoneal injection of 12 mg per kg body weight of diquat, as follows: diquat + 1% ARG (DT + ARG), and diquat + 0.1% NCG (DT + NCG). Rat liver and plasma samples obtained 48 h after diquat injection were analyzed. Results indicated that diquat significantly affected the plasma conventional biochemical components (relative to the controls), which were partially alleviated in both the DT + ARG and DT + NCG groups (P < 0.05). Diquat also significantly decreased the glutathione (GSH) content (by 30.0%), and decreased anti-superoxide anion (ASA; by 13.8%) and anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR; by 38.9%) abilities in the plasma, and also decreased catalase (CAT) activity both in the liver (by 17.5%) and plasma (by 33.4%) compared with the control group. By contrast, diquat increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content (by 23.0%) in the plasma (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Relative to those of the diquat group, higher CAT activity and GSH content were noted in the plasma of the DT + ARG group and in the liver of both DT + ARG and DT + NCG groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the DT + ARG group exhibited significantly enhanced plasma ASA activity (P < 0.05). The DT + NCG group showed significantly improved total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver and plasma (P < 0.05). Increased GSH content and elevated ASA and AHR activities were also found, but the MDA content in the plasma was depleted (P < 0.05). Compared with the DT + ARG group, the DT + NCG group showed increased liver and plasma T-AOC, enhanced plasma AHR activity, increased liver ASA activity, and decreased plasma MDA content (P < 0.05). Overall, supplementation of 1% ARG and 0.1% NCG can partially protect the liver and plasma from oxidative stress. Furthermore, compared with 1% ARG, 0.1% NCG more effectively alleviated oxidative stress.

To further investigate the phylogenetic relationship between Rubus coreanus and its relatives in the section Idaeobatus, we used genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) to ascertain the degree of their genomic homology. Genomic DNA from R. parvifolius and R. inopertus hybridized throughout the centromeric and sub-terminal regions on 14 and 12 chromosomes of R. coreanus, respectively. The probes from R. niveus and R. ellipticus var. obcordatus gave robust signals at the same region of eight chromosomes. R. ellipticus and R. pinfaensis generated strong signals at the centromeric and sub-terminal parts of six chromosomes. The hybridization signals from the R. tsangii and R. corchorifolius probes existed only at the telomeric parts of four chromosomes. The two signals at the sub-terminal region on chromosome 6 of R. coreanus might be 45S rDNA repeats. These results indicated that R. coreanus and R. parvifolius shared many repeat sequences. It could be deduced that the genome of R. parvifolius was most closely related to that of R. coreanus among the species tested, R. inopertus came next, while R. tsangii and R. corchorifolius showed the farthest relationship. The phylogenetic relationships between R. parvifolius and R. coreanus, as well as among the five subsections were mainly discussed.

Apoptotic pathways mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Fas, and c-Myc participate in Ni-induced cell apoptosis. However, the exact mechanism of apoptosis caused by Ni is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of Ni-induced apoptosis may help in designing measures to prevent Ni toxicity.

Global gene regulators, including PhoP are important in regulating bacterial virulence and are good targets for developing attenuated vaccines against many pathogenic bacteria. However, the biological significance of phoP gene has not been identified in P. multocida. Here, we identified the phoP gene in P. multocida, and we evaluated the roles of phoP in P. multocida by deleting the phoP gene. The P. multocida phoP mutant exhibited similar growth curves and lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane protein profiles but displayed defective polymyxin resistance in vitro compared with the parent strain. Additionally, the phoP deletion resulted in decreased virulence. The LD50 of the D phoP mutant was 32- and 154-fold higher than the parent strain via the oral and intranasal routes, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that 161 genes were up-regulated and 173 genes were down-regulated in the absence of the phoP gene. Finally, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the D phoP mutant were evaluated. Immunized ducks produced significantly higher levels of serum IgY and bile IgA compared to the control ducks, and immunization with the D phoP mutant conferred 54.5% protection efficiency against challenge with the virulent P. multocida. This work provides a platform to dissect the function of phoP and develop a new vaccine against P. multocida.

In order to know the effects of recovery growth of the late-planted soya bean in maize-soya bean relay intercropping, a field experiment was carried out to observe architectural, morphological, physiological and anatomical traits of soya bean plants related to shade and subsequent removal in intercropping before and after maize harvest, respectively. During shade period, soya bean biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a: b ratio. Whole-plant leaf area analysis found that soya bean increased leaf area ratio by adjusting leaf morphology rather than by dry mass allocation. After maize harvest, leaf area and leaf mass increased rapidly, contributing to compensation growth in intercropped soya bean. Meanwhile, physiological and anatomical traits of leaf went back to similar levels as grown in sole cropping. However, stem morphological traits were irreversible after removal of shade. Finally, no difference on seed weight per plant of soya bean was observed between relay intercropping and sole cropping. Based on these findings, we speculated the recovery growth might be the direct determining factor on pod formation in soya bean, and improvement on the capacity of recovery growth could increase yield of relay intercropped soya bean.

To find out whether male acoustic signals could be a quality-assessment cue of callers, we conducted a study on Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) characterised by a polygynous mating system and high male-male competition during the rutting season. We investigated the relationship between the stag's acoustic properties and the dominance rank as an indication of quality. Results showed that (1) there were two types of calls, the common roar and the chasing bark, (2) there was no significant difference between the call duration of the common roar and the chasing bark among different dominance ranks, (3) in the common roar, the value of the fundamental frequency, formant frequencies and formant spacing decreased significantly with the rise of dominance ranks and (4) vocal intensity of the common roar differed significantly among the three dominance ranks such as the harem master, the challengers and the bachelors. Our results suggested that some acoustic features, such as formant frequencies, formant spacing and vocal intensity of the common roar were closely related to the dominance rank and could be effective indicators of male competitive ability.

In this study, we found that the expression of miR-145a-5p was gradually increased during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, and miR-145a-5p inhibitors or mimics significantly suppressed or promoted the relative expression of specific myogenesis related marker genes. Moreover, overexpression or inhibition of miR-145a-5p enhanced or repressed the expression of some special genes involved in the endogenous Wnt signaling pathway during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, including Wnt5a, LRP5, Axin2, and beta-catenin. These results indicated that miR-145a-5p might be considered as a newmyogenic differentiation-associated microRNA that can promote C2C12 myoblast differentiation by enhancing genes related to myoblasts differentiation.

Molecular cloning, characterisation and functional analysis of the duck Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) gene	BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article							SKELETAL-MUSCLE; DRUG DISCOVERY; IN-VITRO; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; CELLS; BIOINFORMATICS; ZEBRAFISH; SURVIVAL; EMBRYO	1. The Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) transcription factor is a crucial regulator of cell fate that controls proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. However, the role of FOXO3 regulation in duck myoblasts is not fully understood. 2. The aim of this study was to clone and determine the complete coding sequence (CDS) of the duck FOXO3 gene and to assess its function in myoblasts. 3. Primers specific for the predicted duck FOXO3 gene were designed using the public mallard duck reference sequence in GenBank. The CDS was cloned by RT-PCR and double digested to generate the expression vector pEGFP-N1-FOXO3. 4. Sequence analysis showed that the full-length FOXO3 CDS is 1467 bp, encoding 488 amino acids and is highly conserved across many bird species. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a DNA-binding domain (aa 1-77). 5. Myoblast transfection with pEGFP-N1-FOXO3 showed that FOXO3 mRNA expression at 24 h was elevated in pEGFP-N1-FOXO3-transfected myoblasts compared to pEGFP-N1-transfected cells or controls. MRF4, MyoD, MyoG, Myf5 and PAX7 mRNA expression in the pEGFP-N1-FOXO3 group was lowest. However, myostatin (MSTN) and PAX3 mRNA expression did not differ. 6. These results suggest that FOXO3 plays a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of duck myoblasts.

Each internode of DPW was significantly shorter than it in high Polish wheat (HPW), and the dwarfism was insensitive to photoperiod, abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), cytokinin (CK), auxin and brassinolide (BR). To understand the mechanism, three sets of transcripts, DPW, HPW, and a chimeric set (a combination of DPW and HPW), were constructed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Based on the chimeric transcripts, 2,446 proteins were identified using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). A total of 108 unigenes and 12 proteins were considered as dwarfism-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), respectively. Among of these DEGs and DEPs, 6 DEGs and 6 DEPs were found to be involved in flavonoid and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) metabolisms; 5 DEGs and 3 DEPs were involved in cellulose metabolism, cell wall plasticity and cell expansion; 2 DEGs were auxin transporters; 2 DEPs were histones; 1 DEP was a peroxidase. These DEGs and DEPs reduced lignin and cellulose contents, increased flavonoid content, possibly decreased S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and polyamine contents and increased S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) content in DPW stems, which could limit auxin transport and reduce extensibility of the cell wall, finally limited cell expansion (the cell size of DPW was significantly smaller than HPW cells) and caused dwarfism in DPW.

The outer membrane protein H (OmpH) of RA, expressed in E. coli strain BL21, was first used as coating antigen to develop an indirect ELISA assay for serological detection of RA infection. The sensitivity test indicated that the detection limit of the OmpH protein based ELISA assay (OmpH-ELISA) was twice higher than that of the OmpA protein based ELISA assay (OmpA-ELISA), and 2600 times higher than that of the conventional tube agglutination (TA) assay. In addition, the OmpH-ELISA assay displayed no cross-reaction with E. coli, S. anatum, duck hepatitis virus (DHV), avian influenza virus (AIV), Pasteurellamultocida (P. multocida) and duck plague virus (DPV) antisera, while positive with RA ATCC and RA CH-2 antisera. For detection of clinical serum samples, 115 of 156 samples were positive by OmpH-ELISA (73.7%), 105 serum samples (67.3%) were positive by OmpA-ELISA assay, only 89 serum samples (57.05%) were detected positively by TA assay. All of these features suggested that the OmpH protein is a conserved protein among different serotypes of RA, and could be used as an ELISA coating antigen for serological detection of RA infection.

Complexes 1-5 are isomorphic, featuring a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure with a dia topological framework, while the isomorphic complexes 6-9 show a 3D 3,4-connected topological framework with a point symbol of {7(2)center dot 8}(2){7(3)center dot 8(3)}. Photoluminescence spectra of complexes 1 and 3 exhibit the strong luminescence characteristic of Eu(III) and Tb(III) ions, respectively, suggesting that HL- and L2- anions are able to efficiently sensitize the luminescence of lanthanide ions.

In this study, we conducted proteome analysis of the roots of the non-hyperaccumulator inbred maize line 9782 at four developmental stages (0, 12, 24, and 48 h) under Pb pollution using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification technology. A total of 252, 72 and 116 proteins were differentially expressed between M12 (after 12-h Pb treatment) and CK (water-mocked treatment), M24 (after 24-h Pb treatment) and CK, and M48 (after 48-h Pb treatment) and CK, respectively. In addition, 14 differentially expressed proteins were common within each comparison group. Moreover, Cluster of Orthologous Groups enrichment analysis revealed predominance of the proteins involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones. Additionally, the changes in protein profiles showed a lower concordance with corresponding alterations in transcript levels, indicating important roles for transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation in the response of maize roots to Pb pollution. Furthermore, enriched functional categories between the successive comparisons showed that the proteins in functional categories of stress, redox, signaling, and transport were highly up-regulated, while those in the functional categories of nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, RNA, and protein metabolism were down-regulated. This information will help in furthering our understanding of the detailed mechanisms of plant responses to heavy metal stress by combining protein and mRNA profiles.	[Li, G. K.; Peng, H.; Shen, Y.

Effects of grafting on key photosynthetic enzymes and gene expression in the citrus cultivar Huangguogan	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Gene cloning; Changing patterns; Standard cultivation; Total soluble solid; Seedless citrus hybrid	CARBOXYLASE-OXYGENASE; BUNDLE-SHEATH; RIBULOSE-1,5-BISPHOSPHATE CARBOXYLASE/OXYGENASE; UNTRANSLATED REGIONS; RUBISCO ACTIVASE; ABUNDANT PROTEIN; MESSENGER-RNAS; ROOTSTOCKS; TREES; PERFORMANCE	Grafting influences scion photosynthetic capacity and fruit quality. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which strongly affects photosynthetic rate, and Rubisco activase (RCA), which regulates Rubisco activity, are two key photosynthetic enzymes. However, little information is available regarding the effect of grafting on the concentration and expression of Rubisco and RCA in the citrus cultivar Huangguogan. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of grafting Huangguogan plants onto trifoliate orange, tangerine, and orange on: 1) the concentration of Rubisco and RCA; 2) the mRNA levels of rbcL, rbcS, and rca; and 3) fruit quality. Overall, the results showed that when Huangguogan plants budded on tangerine and orange, they had better fruit quality, while on trifoliate orange they had higher Rubisco concentration. Tangerine and orange are probably the most suitable rootstocks for Huangguogan plants given the environmental conditions of Sichuan Province, China.	[Liao, L.; Cao, S. Y.; Rong, Y.; Wang, Z.

Here, we report that SODIUM POTASSIUM ROOT DEFECTIVE3 (NaKR3), which encodes a heavy metal-associated domain protein, is involved in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. The results of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that NaKR3 was induced by high salinity and osmotic stresses, but not by Cu2+ stress. Transient expression of NaKR3-GFP in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that the NaKR3 protein was localized in the cytosol. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing NaKR3 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter exhibited increased tolerance to salt treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of NaKR3 increased the expression of SOS1 and SOS3, but decreased the accumulation of salt-induced proline. Taken together, our results indicate that NaKR3 is involved in the salt stress response in Arabidopsis.	[Luo, Q.; Zhao, Z.; Li, D. K.; Zhang, Y.; Xie, L. F.; Peng, M.

Developmental methylation pattern regulates porcine GPR120 expression	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						GPR120; Methylation; CpG islands; Adipose tissue; Pig	DNA METHYLATION; SECRETION; CELLS; SWINE	DNA methylation is an important component of the epigenetic machinery and plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation. It mostly occurs in CpG abundant regions, known as CpG islands (CGIs). G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) functions as an omega-3 fatty acid receptor and is involved in multiple-biological processes, including lipogenesis. Herein, we show that GPR120 is highly expressed in porcine mature adipose tissue and is positively associated with adipose tissue development (r = 0.86, P < 0.01). We also predicted 5 CGIs across the GPR120 genomic sequence and investigated their methylation status using the MassArray approach. Our results show that these CGIs exhibit significantly different methylation states (P-CGI < 0.01), and that the DNA methylation of GPR1205'-untranslated and first exon regions can negatively regulate its expression levels. This study will aid further investigations on the epigenetic mechanism regulating GPR120 expression.	[Wang, H. M.; Ma, J. D.; Jin, L.; Liu, Y. H.; Che, T. D.; Li, M. Z.; Li, X.

To investigate the salt tolerance mechanism in annual ryegrass under salt stress, salt-tolerant genotype 'R102-3' and salt-sensitive genotype 'Tetragold' were subject to 300mmol/L NaCl in a controlled growth chamber for 12 days. The results showed high concentrations of NaCl decreased relative water content (RWC), and increased the electrolyte leakage (EL) in both genotypes. However the 'Tetragold' had a greater increased extent of malondialdehyde (MDA) and EL than in 'R102-3', in contrast, the activities of Superoxide (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), Catalase (CAT) and Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were higher in salt resistant compared to sensitive ones. For ensure the accurate of qRT-PCR, we used RefFinder to choose the most stably reference genes eEF1A(s) and GAPDH to normalize the antioxidant genes expression data. The results indicated that higher expression of Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, Chl-Cu/Zn SOD, Cyt-Cu/Zn SOD, POD and CAT in 'R102-3' when compared with 'Tetragold', which may play an important role in defensed damage of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress. Thus, the salt-tolerant genotype could effectively resist oxidative damage induced by salt tress relative to salt-sensitive genotype.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that HhERF2 was classified into the B-2 group of ERF subfamily. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that HhERF2 was greatly induced by treatments with high-salt, drought and low temperature in H. halodendron seedlings. The expression vector containing HhERF2 and Populus euphratica dehydration-responsive element binding protein (PeDREB2a) genes driven by rd29A promoter was constructed and transferred into cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) by non-tissue culture Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system. The transformation and expression of HhERF2 and PeDREB2a were identified by PCR and RT-PCR. Analyses of physiological function indicated that transgenic cottons had improved seeds germination, tolerance to drought and high-salt stresses. Agronomic evaluation in the field exhibited that transgenic lines presented a dwarf phenotype and improved further in the yield and characters. These results demonstrated that overexpressed both HhERF2 and PeDREB2a transcription factor genes in cotton induced elevated tolerance to drought and high-salt stresses.

The plantlet regeneration of tartary buckwheat via somatic embryogenesis or multiple shoot induction was investigated in two different tartary buckwheats, Yuanzi and Xichang. The regeneration ability of Yuanzi was better than Xichang tartary buckwheat, and the hypocotyls were better than cotyledons as tartary buckwheat plantlet regeneration explants via somatic embryogenesis. The most suitable medium for callus induction was Murashige and Skoog basal medium added 2 mg/L 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 1 mg/L Kinetin, which could reach up to 98.96% callus induction percentage. The plantlet regeneration percentage from callus of tartary buckwheat could reach up to 55.77%, which induced on 2.0 mg/L Benzyladenine and 1.0 mg/L KT in MS basal medium. In addition, maximum of multiple shoot induction percentage was 69.05%, which was observed in case of Yuanzi tartary buckwheat in MS basal medium with added 3.0 mg/L 6-BA and 1.0 mg/L Thidiazuron. Roots induction of regenerated plants were achieved on 1/2 MS basal medium with added 1mg/L Indole-3-Butytric acid, which has 75% survival after transferred regenerated plants to soil under field conditions.

The differential expression of proteins in their roots were analyzed by Proteomic Approach. The protein that was directly involved in the cellular defense under the Pb and Zn combined stress was separated, and expression of those genes was analyzed with Carex Ever-gold as control. The results were obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. After applying Pb and Zn combined stress, the expression of 9 protein spots (including 7 different proteins, 2 identical proteins, 1 unknown protein) in Carex putuoshan root was found to be significantly up-regulated. Five proteins were obtained from the 9 proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism, including malate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, frutose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, enolase, and 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Two proteins were related to protein biosynthesis, including isoflavone reductase and phytochelatin synthase (PCS). From these proteins, the most important protein is PCS, which is a key enzyme in the synthesis of phytochelatins (PCs) and plays an important role in chelation. It is directly involved in cellular defense under Pb and Zn stress. After Pb and Zn combined stress, the CpPCS in Carex putuoshan was cloned. The full length of cDNA is 1461 bps, and it encodes 486 amino acids with molecular weight of 53.86 kD and pI value of 6.12. Two typical phytochelatin synthase subfamily domains constitute CpPCS protein, which includes three adjacent Cys-Cys elements in the C-terminal region. Phylogenetic analysis of PCS proteins from different species showed that it had the closest relationship with the Oryza sativa and Triticum aestivum. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that CpPCS and CePCS (Carex Evergold) genes were expressed in the root. The CpPCS and CePCS genes were up-regulated by Pb and Zn treatments. The expression of CpPCS was higher than that of CePCS under the same condition. The study found that CpPCS expression was increased by Pb and Zn stress in the Carex putuoshan enrichment process of Pb, which lead to high expression of PCS protein. CpPCS improved the accumulation ability and resistance of Carex putuoshan to heavy metals with the expression level of glucose metabolism related proteins increasing after Pb and Zn stress.

The theabrownin, an important pigment of dark tea, has been proven for the role of the hypolipidemic property in Sichuan Dark Tea. The objective of the study investigated the extraction process of theabrownin. Materials and Methods: Theabrownin was extracted from Sichuan Dark Tea with water and organic solvents. The quadratic regression orthogonally rotational combinational design experiment was performed to obtain the optimal extraction parameters. Results: The extraction yield of theabrownin was significantly influenced by both water extraction temperature and solid-liquid ratio, and the contribution of these factors on theabrownin yield was as follows: water temperature. solid-liquid ratio. organic solvent temperature. Moreover, the polynomial regression model established could predict the experimental value accurately. Conclusion: The optimum extraction process of theabrownin from Sichuan Dark Tea was established, which water temperature at 65.69-77.88., organic solvent temperature at 13.65-17.48. and a solid-liquid ratio of 1:43.58-1:50.75(g/mL).

Software GATK, SOAPsnp, samtools, and others are often used to deal with the NGS data. In this study, BLAST was applied to call SNPs from 16 mixed functional gene's sequence data of polyploidy wheat. In total 1.2 million reads were obtained with the average of 7500 reads per genes. To get accurate information, 390,992 pair reads were successfully assembled before aligning to those functional genes. Standalone BLAST tools were used to map assembled sequence to functional genes, respectively. Polynomial fitting was applied to find the suitable minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold at 6% for assembled reads of each functional gene. SNPs accuracy form assembled reads, pretrimmed reads, and original reads were compared, which declared that SNPs mined from the assembled reads were more reliable than others. It was also demonstrated that mixed samples' NGS sequences and then analysis by BLAST were an effective, low-cost, and accurate way to mine SNPs for nonmodel species. Assembled reads and polynomial fitting threshold were recommended for more accurate SNPs target.

Dwarf bamboo (Fargesia nitida) and willow (Salix paraplesia) foliar litterbags were placed on the forest floor from the gap center to the closed canopy. The litterbags were sampled during snow formation, snow coverage, snow melting and the growing season from October 2010 to October 2012. The lignin concentrations and loss in the litter were measured. Over 2 years, lignin loss was lower in the bamboo litter (34.64-43.89%) than in the willow litter (38.91-55.10%). In the bamboo litter, lignin loss mainly occurred during the first decomposition year, whereas it occurred during the second decomposition year in the willow litter. Both bamboo and willow litter lignin loss decreased from the gap center to the closed canopy during the first year and over the entire 2-year decomposition period. Compared with the closed canopy, the gap center showed higher lignin loss for both bamboo and willow litter during the two winters, but lower lignin loss during the early growing period. Additionally, the dynamics of microbial biomass carbon during litter decomposition followed the same trend as litter lignin loss during the two winters and growing period. These results indicated that alpine forest gaps had significant effects on shrub litter lignin loss and that reduced snow cover during winter warming would inhibit shrub lignin degradation in this alpine forest.

However, little is known about its regulatory mechanism associated with muscular protein synthesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of overexpression of Six1 on the expression of key protein metabolism-related genes in duck myoblasts. Through an experimental model where duck myoblasts were transfected with a pEGFP-duSix1 construct, we found that overexpression of duck Six1 could enhance cell proliferation activity and increase mRNA expression levels of key genes involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, while the expression of FOXO1, MuRF1 and MAFbx was not significantly altered, indicating that Six1 could promote protein synthesis in myoblasts through up-regulating the expression of several related genes. Additionally, in duck myoblasts treated with LY294002 and rapamycin, the specific inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, respectively, the overexpression of Six1 could significantly ameliorate inhibitive effects of these inhibitors on protein synthesis. Especially, the mRNA expression levels of mTOR and S6K1 were observed to undergo a visible change, and a significant increase in protein expression of S6K1 was seen. These data suggested that Six1 plays an important role in protein synthesis, which may be mainly due to activation of the mTOR signaling pathway.

Eighty piglets were randomly assigned to two groups, i.e., those with adequate nutrient intake supplemented with spermine (0.4 mmol kg(-1) body weight) or those with restricted nutrient intake supplemented with saline. The piglets were fed in pairs for 7 h or 3, 6, or 9 days. The results of analysis are as follows: (1) the villus height, villus width, villus : crypt ratio, and villus surface area in the jejunum of spermine-treated piglets significantly increased by 17.39%, 21.56%, 45.22%, and 45.45%, respectively, compared with those of the control. The specific activities of sucrase, maltase, and diamine oxidase in this organ also significantly increased by 34.55%, 12.77%, and 10.00%, respectively, but lactase activity decreased by 22.56% (spermine group vs. the control group). Extended spermine administration significantly increased jejunal development. (2) Compared with those of the control group, the ileum of the piglets in the spermine group showed significant increases in villus height, villus width, villus : crypt ratio, and villus surface area of 25.64%, 21.61%, 61.05%, and 52.94%, respectively. The specific activities of sucrase, alkaline phosphatase, and diamine oxidase in this organ significantly increased by 24.36%, 5.56%, and 20.23%, respectively, but lactase activity decreased by 39.08%. Extended spermine administration also significantly enhanced ileal development. (3) Compared with the control piglets, spermine promoted increases in catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and anti-superoxide anion (ASA) activities and glutathione (GSH) content (by 23.19%, 30.63%, 5.64%, 10.31%, and 33.70%, respectively, P < 0.05), as well as decreases in malondialdehyde (MDA) activity (by 23.01%; P < 0.05) in piglet serum. Extended spermine administration significantly enhanced antioxidant capacity of serum. Collectively, these results suggest that spermine ingestion and extended spermine supplementation can accelerate gut maturation and enhance the antioxidant status of piglets.

The four basic pigment cell types found in poikilothermic vertebrates are melanomas (melanophoromas), iridophoromas, xanthophoroma, and erythrophoromas. In the present study, we diagnosed spontaneous lesions in the skin of a group of ornamental colored crucian carp, Carassius auratus, from an artificial ornamental fish pond located in Southeastern China. Necropsy, paraffin section, and hematoxylin-eosin staining methods were used to evaluate the neoplasm. Histological changes were observed and photographed using a Nikon microscope image system. The results showed oval nodular masses observed on the various parts of the body including flank, caudal peduncle, and tail. Histologically, neoplastic stromata were composed of bundles of compact parallel arrays cells. Dendric or spindle-shaped erythrophoroma cells were arranged as sheets or clusters with interlacing connective tissue. Congested capillaries and focal areas of hemorrhage were interspersed through the tissue. The tumor foci were infiltrated with neoplastic cells, inflammation cells, and necrotic tissue cells. Some olive to red intracytoplasmic pigment with polarized light could be seen on many parts of the erythrophoroma tissue. From the gross and histological pathology, we could conclude that the colored crucian carp suffered erythrophoromas. Further study is needed to confirm the etiology of this case.

A common bacterial disease caused by A. veronii has appeared in cultured channel catfish producing symptoms of erythema, hemorrhages, skin ulcers and high mortality (> 30%) in China, causing great economic loss. From 2007 to 2013, diseased channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, displaying symptoms of septicemia, ulceration, or abdominal dropsy were collected from Southwestern China. The goals of this study were to identify the bacterial strains isolated from diseased fish and to determine the susceptibility of the pathogenic strains to many currently available antimicrobial agents. 18 bacterial isolates were obtained from diseased fish. Based on phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, all isolates were identified as A. veronii. These results indicate that the microbiological risk posed by A. veronii is considerable for channel catfish cultured in Southwestern China. Susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. All 18 A. veronii isolates were sensitive to florfenicol, norfloxacin and chloramphenicol, and were resistant to cefradine, clindamycin, midecamycin, penbritin, and amoxicillin. There were sensitivity diversities of the 18 A. veronii isolates to other test antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole, deoxycycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, and more. This in vitro study provides enough data to recommend the use of these antibiotics for treating infectious diseases caused by A. veronii.

Some physicochemical parameters were ascertained, and the hydrolysis and pharmacodynamic studies were examined as well. The hydrolysis of PHI was accorded with first-order kinetic equation at 37 and 60 degrees C in different pH phosphate buffer solution, and relative stability of pH value for PHI was from 4.0 to 6.0. In mice ear edema test, PHI had evidently superior analgesic effect than control group (P < 0.01) and there was no significant difference both the co-drug and the equivalent of the physical mixture (P > 0.05). The toxicology experiments showed that there were no obvious pathological changes in stomach, liver and kidney in the PHI group, while the damage of the liver and stomach mucosal layer from the physical mixture group was greater compared to the IPF and PCM group. These results confirmed the promising potential of the co-drug in the management of analgesia and less side effects.

Solubilization studies revealed that poloxamer 407 had much higher solubilization capacity than poloxamer 188, as well as adding 0.1% NaDC. Permeability experiments confirmed that poloxamer 188 monomers presented higher permeability enhancement than poloxamer 407 micelles at the same concentration level. However, compared with the same poloxamer concentration, inhibitory effects of permeability in poloxamer (188 and 407) + NaDC solutions at different degree were observed in this study. These results maybe ascribed to the formation of mixed micelles between poloxamer and NaDC in the phosphate buffer solution. All in all, an increase in solubility does not necessarily result in a higher drug permeability by the combination of different surfactants.

The pK205R protein of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is largely expressed in the early stages of infection, which has given the K205R gene extensive attention. In this study, the ASFV K205R was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Expression of histidine-tagged pK205R with a molecular mass of 44 kDa was determined by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. Optimisation of culture conditions allowed induction of the recombinant protein with 0.4 mM Isopropyl P-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 37 degrees C for 2 h. The protein existed in cellular supernatant and was purified using a Ni-NTA resin column. The purified protein was used to immunize rabbits four times to enable the production of polyclonal antibodies, and the antiserum titre was detected by ELISA. The results showed that the purified pK205R can react with ASFV positive serum specifically by Western blotting. The pK205R had high antigenicity, which indicated that pK205R could be used as an antigen for detection of ASFV-specific antibodies in ELISA testing, and the recombinant protein could contribute to further research of the action and structure of pK205R.

Moreover, calcium carbonate was added in the pyrite tailings to determine the reduction effect on the release of heavy metals. The results show that Fe, Cr, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Ni were the major heavy metals in the pyrite tailings. Low initial pH and high LS ratio significantly promoted Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn release, and high temperature significantly promoted Fe, Cu, Mn, and Ni release. Only small amounts of Cr were detected at low LS ratios. With the increase of soaking time, the released amount of Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn increased to the maximum value within 48 h, respectively. After adding calcium carbonate, the released amounts of Fe, Cu, and Zn reduced at least 70.80% within 48 h soaking time. The results indicate that summer and the early soaking stage are the main phases for the release of heavy metals from the pyrite tailings. In the pyrite tailings, Cr is difficult to release. Adding calcium carbonate can effectively reduce the release of Fe, Cu, and Zn.

In order to explore new stress tolerance genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), expression profiles were obtained for leaf and panicle tissues. They were taken at seedling, booting, heading and flowering stages of indica cultivar Pei'ai 64S plants under cold, drought and heat stresses by using the GeneChip Rice Genome Array (Affymetrix), which includes 51,279 transcripts from japonica and indica rice. O. sativa L. cytosolic sulphotransferase-like gene (OsSOT9) was highly induced in leafs and panicles during different developmental stages, in response to all stresses, especially at booting stage under cold stress. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that this result was almost consensus with GeneChip Rice Genome Array. cDNA of OsSOT9 was cloned to study its function in stress tolerance through reverse transcription PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA encoded a protein with molecular weight of about 37.78 kDa and pl of about 6.6, which was composed of 343 amino acid residues. Bioinformatics data showed that the protein contained a conservative domain of the sulphotransferase (SOT) family gene. OsSOT9 was found to be closely related to the cytosolic sulphotransferase after comparison of the protein sequences. Analysis of the putative promoter region found 12 kinds of cis-elements related to stress response. On the basis of the above analyses, we suggested that OsSOT9 is a novel candidate gene involved in stress tolerance in rice.

Because the physiological status of liver cells in vitro is different from that in vivo, a simplified cell model in vitro was established. Methods: Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and incubated in either no addition as a control or insulin or PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors or co-treatment with glucose and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors; Then, cell DNA synthesis and cell cycle analysis were detected by BrdU-incorporation Assay and Flow cytometric analysis; the mRNA expression and protein expression of factors involved in the cell cycle were determined by Real-Time RT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot. Results: Here we first showed that insulin evidently increased the cell DNA synthesis, the mRNA level and protein content of factors involved in the cell proliferation of goose primary hepatocytes. Meanwhile, insulin evidently increased the mRNA level and protein content of factors involved in PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. However, the up-regulation of insulin on cell proliferation was decreased significantly by the inhibitors of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, LY294002, rapamycin or NVP-BEZ235. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway plays an essential role in insulin-regulated cell proliferation of goose hepatocyte. (C) 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

In order to reduce carbon emissions, cap and trade policy is implemented by governments in many countries, which has significant impacts on the decisions of companies at all levels of the low carbon supply chain. This paper investigates the decision-making and coordination of a low carbon supply chain consisting of a low carbon manufacturer who produces one product and is allowed to invest in green technology to reduce carbon emissions in production and a retailer who faces stochastic demands formed by homogeneous strategic customers. We investigate the optimal production, pricing, carbon trading, and green technology investment strategies of the low carbon supply chain in centralized (including Rational Expected Equilibrium scenario and quantity commitment scenario) and decentralized settings. It is demonstrated that quantity commitment strategy can improve the profit of the low carbon supply chain with strategic customer behavior. We also show that the performance of decentralized supply chain is lower than that of quantity commitment scenario. We prove that the low carbon supply chain cannot be coordinated by revenue sharing contract but by revenue sharing-cost sharing contract.

Arginine and N-carbamylglutamate can alleviate the effects of oxidative stress. However, the systematic changes in metabolic biochemistry linked to oxidative stress and arginine and N-carbamylglutamate treatment remain largely unknown. This study aims to examine the effects of arginine and N-carbamylglutamate on rat metabolism under oxidative stress. Thirty rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups (n = 10 each). The rats were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 1% arginine, or 0.1% N-carbamylglutamate for 30 days. On day 28, the rats in each treatment were intraperitoneally injected with diquat at 12 mg per kg body weight or sterile solution. Urine and plasma samples were analyzed by metabolomics. Compared with the diquat group, the arginine + diquat group had significantly lower levels of acetamide, alanine, lysine, pyruvate, tyrosine, a-glucose, and beta-glucose in plasma; N-carbamylglutamate + diquat had higher levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-methylhistidine, acetone, allantoin, asparagine, citrate, phenylalanine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and tyrosine, and lower levels of low density lipoprotein, lipid, lysine, threonine, unsaturated lipid, urea, and very low density lipoprotein (P < 0.05) in plasma. Compared with the diquat group, the arginine + diquat group had significantly higher levels of citrate, creatinine, homogentisate, and a-ketoglutarate while lower levels of acetamide, citrulline, ethanol, glycine, isobutyrate, lactate, malonate, methymalonate, N-acetylglutamate, N-methylnicotinamide, propionate, and beta-glucose (P < 0.05) in urine. Compared with the diquat group, the N-carbamylglutamate + diquat group had significantly higher levels of allantoin, citrate, homogentisate, phenylacetylglycine, a-ketoglutarate, and beta-glucose while lower levels of acetamide, acetate, acetone, benzoate, citrulline, ethanol, hippurate, lactate, N-acetylglutamate, nicotinamide, ornithine, and trigonelline (P < 0.05) in urine. Overall, these results suggest that arginine and N-carbamylglutamate can alter the metabolome associated with energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microbiota metabolism under oxidative stress.

Putative homologues of the Drosophila timeless gene have been identified in both mice and humans. While Drosophila contains two paralogs, timeless and timeout, acting in clock/light entrainment and chromosome integrity/photoreception, respectively, mammals contain only one Tim homolog. In this paper, we study the phylogeny of the timeless/timeout family in 48 species [including 1 protozoan (Guillardia theta), 1 nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), 8 arthropods and 38 chordates], for which whole genome data are available by using MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis). Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) was used to analyze the selective pressure acting on metazoan timeless/timeout genes. Our phylogeny clearly separates insect timeless and timeout lineages and shows that non-insect animal Tim genes are homologs of insect timeout. In this study, we explored the relatively rapidly evolving timeless lineage that was apparently lost from most deuterostomes, including chordates, and from Caenorhabditis elegans. In contrast, we found that the timeout protein, often confusingly called "timeless" in the vertebrate literature, is present throughout the available animal genomes. Selection results showed that timeout is under weaker negative selection than timeless. Finally, our phylogeny of timeless/timeout showed an evolutionary conservation of the circadian clock gene timeout in Metazoa. This conservation is in line with its multifunctionality, being essential for embryonic development and maintenance of chromosome integrity, among others.

UTILIS; L ENDOSPERM TYPES; RESISTANT STARCH; AMYLOSE CONTENT; AMINO-ACIDS; WEANED PIGS; FATTY-ACIDS; IN-VITRO; ENZYME SUPPLEMENTATION	A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary corn type (waxy corn [WC] vs. nonwaxy corn [NC]) and fasting period (2 h vs. 12-16 h) before slaughter on growth and plasma index in weaning pigs. Twenty-four crossbred barrows (8.26 +/- 0.47 kg) were allotted to 4 treatments with 6 replications of 1 pig per replicate metabolism cage. Waxy corn contained less fat, a lower amylase: amylopectin ratio, more CP, and more starch than NC. Pigs fed the WC diet had lower jejunum digesta pH compared with those fed the NC diet (P < 0.05). Maltase activity in the jejunum and ileum mucosa (P < 0.01), sucrose activity in the ileum mucosa (P < 0.01), and amylase activity in the pancreas and jejunum digesta (P < 0.05) were increased in pigs fed the WC diet relative to those fed the NC diet. But the total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) of starch and CP was lower for the WC group (P < 0.05). Ingestion of the NC diet resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ADG and ADFI in the second week but did not affect ADG (P = 0.091) and the feed: gain ratio (F: G; P = 0.077) during the whole experiment period. The plasma glucose (P < 0.01) concentration was higher and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; P < 0.01) concentrations was lower in the hepatic portal vein in pigs fed the WC diet relative to those fed the NC diet. Fasting 2 h before slaughter decreased the jejunum and ileum digesta pH compared with the 12-h fasting group (P < 0.01). Villus height increased in the duodenum (P < 0.01) and jejunum (P < 0.05) and the villus height: crypt depth ratio increased in the duodenum (P < 0.05) of pigs after shortening the fasting period before slaughter. Shortening the fasting time before slaughter resulted in higher plasma glucose (P < 0.05) concentrations and a higher HDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ratio (P < 0.05) whereas the LDL-C (P < 0.05) concentrations were reduced in the hepatic portal vein. The results of this experiment indicate that although the production performance of both WC and NC diets is equal, the glucose concentration is higher and HDL-C is lower in the portal vein for the WC diet, and fasting time before slaughter has an influence on the plasma index and intestinal morphology in weaning pigs.

Dietary spray-dried chicken plasma improves intestinal barrier function and modulates immune status in weaning piglets	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						barrier function; immunity; intestine development; spray-dried chicken plasma; spray-dried porcine plasma; weaning pigs	EARLY-WEANED PIGS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI INFECTION; EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; ANIMAL PLASMA; PORCINE PLASMA; NEONATAL PIGLETS; WEANLING PIGLETS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; PERFORMANCE	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary addition of spray-dried chicken plasma (SDCP) as a replacement for spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) on serum biochemistry, intestinal barrier function, immune parameters, and the expression of intestinal development-related genes in weaning pigs. One hundred and forty-four 25-d-old weaning piglets with BW of 6.43 +/- 0.39 kg were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: 1) CON (basal diet; control), 2) SDPP (containing 5% SDPP), 3) SDPP + SDCP (containing 2.5% SDPP and 2.5% SDCP), and 4) SDCP (containing 5% SDCP). After a 28-d trial, 6 pigs from each treatment were randomly selected to collect serum and intestinal samples. On d 14 after the initiation of the trial, pigs in the SDPP, SDPP + SDCP, and SDCP groups had an increase (P < 0.05) in serum concentrations of total protein and IgG and a decrease (P < 0.05) in activities of alanine aminotransferase and diamine oxidase compared with the CON group. In the jejunum, supplementation with SDPP and SDCP reduced (P < 0.05) the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and upregulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA levels of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), zonula occludens 2 (ZO-2), occludin (OCLN), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP2), and IGF-1 compared with the CON group. In the ileum, feeding SDPP, SDPP + SDCP, and SDCP decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of TNF-alpha and secretory IgA (sIgA) and upregulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA levels of claudin 1 (CLDN-1) and TLR2 compared with feeding CON. However, there were no differences among the SDPP, SDPP + SDCP, and SDCP groups. Furthermore, supplementation with SDCP reduced (P < 0.05) the concentration of IL-10 and upregulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA levels of GLP-2, mucin 2 (MUC2), and trefoil factor family 3 (TFF3) in the ileum compared with feeding CON. Collectively, the current results indicate that dietary addition of SDCP has a beneficial influence on the health condition of weaning pigs by alleviating liver damage, promoting intestinal development, improving intestinal barrier function, and reducing overstimulation of immune response. The efficacy of SDCP is comparable to that of SDPP.	[Zhang, Y.; Zheng, P.; Yu, B.; He, J.; Yu, J.; Mao, X. B.; Luo, J. Q.; Huang, Z. Q.; Chen, D.

However, limited information is available on changes in the bacterial community from winter to the growing season as litter decomposition proceeds in cold climates. Here, we investigated the abundance and structure of bacterial communities using real-time quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) during a 2-year field study of the decomposition of litter of 4 species in the winter and growing seasons of an alpine forest of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The abundance of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was relatively high during decomposition of cypress and birch litter in the first winter, but for the other litters 16S rRNA abundance during both winters was significantly lower than during the following growing season. A large number of bands were observed on the DGGE gels, and their intensities and number from the winter samples were lower than those from the growing season during the 2-year decomposition experiment. Eighty-nine sequences from the bands of bacteria that had been cut from the DGGE gels were affiliated with 10 distinct classes of bacteria and an unknown group. A redundancy analysis indicated that the moisture, mass loss, and elemental content (e. g., C, N, and P) of the litter significantly affected the bacterial communities. Collectively, the results suggest that uneven seasonal changes in climate regulate bacterial communities and other decomposers, thus affecting their contribution to litter decomposition processes in the alpine forest.

The Fusarium toxin zearalenone and deoxynivalenol affect murine splenic antioxidant functions, interferon levels, and T-cell subsets	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Zearalenone; Deoxynivalenol; Antioxidant functions; Interferon; T-cell subsets; Mice	COMBINATIONS; LYMPHOCYTES; MECHANISMS; EXPOSURE; MICE	This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the Fusarium toxin zearalenone (ZEA) and deoxynivalenol (DON) on splenic antioxidant functions, IFN levels, and T-cell subsets in mice. Herein, 360 mice were assigned to nine groups for a 12-day study. Mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection for 4 consecutive days with different concentrations of ZEA alone, DON alone, or ZEA+DON. Spleen and blood samples were collected on days 0, 3, 5, 8, and 12. Mice in each of the experimental groups showed dysreglated splenic antioxidant functions, IFN levels, and T-cell subset frequencies, suggesting that the immune system had been affected. The ZEA+DON-treated groups, especially the group that received a higher concentration of ZEA+DON (Group D2Z2), showed more obvious effects on the dysregulation of splenic antioxidant functions, IFN levels, and T-cell subsets. This finding suggested that DON and ZEA exerted synergistic effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ren, Z. H.; Deng, H. D.; Wang, Y. C.; Deng, J. L.; Zuo, Z.

In this study, genetic diversity was assessed and the marker-trait associations for rust were examined using 18 EST-SSR and 21 SCoT markers in 75 orchardgrass accessions. A high level of genetic diversity was detected in orchardgrass with an average genetic diversity index of 0.369. For the EST-SSR and SCoT markers, 164 and 289 total bands were obtained, of which 148 (90.24%) and 272 (94.12%) were polymorphic, respectively. Results from an AMOVA analysis showed that more genetic variance existed within populations (87.57%) than among populations (12.43%). Using a parameter marker index, the efficiencies of the EST-SSR and SCoT markers were compared to show that SCoTs have higher marker efficiency (8.07) than EST-SSRs (4.82). The results of a UPGMA cluster analysis and a STRUCTURE analysis were both correlated with the geographic distribution of the orchardgrass accessions. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed an average r(2) of 0.1627 across all band pairs, indicating a high extent of linkage disequilibrium in the material. An association analysis between the rust trait and 410 bands from the EST-SSR and SCoT markers using TASSEL software revealed 20 band panels were associated with the rust trait in both 2011 and 2012. The 20 bands obtained from association analysis could be used in breeding programs for lineage selection to prevent great losses of orchardgrass caused by rust, and provide valuable information for further association mapping using this collection of orchardgrass.

Twenty-four weaned pigs were randomly assigned to one of four treatments, including a corn-soybean basal diet (Con), the basal diet supplemented with antibiotics (60 mg/kg colistin sulfate, Ant), probiotics (Bacillus subtilis >= 10(9) CFU/g, Pro) and recombinant plectasin (60 mg/kg, Ple). The study lasted 21 d. Results showed that dietary supplementation with antibiotics and Ple had positive effects on the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and body-weight gain (ADG) (P<0.05). Compared with the Con, the ratio of feed to gain (F/G) and diarrhea rate in both groups were significantly reduced. Pigs fed the diets containing antibiotics and Ple had a higher villus height (P<0.05) and a higher disaccharidase activity (P<0.05) in small intestinal mucosa. Ple supplementation also increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium in the ileum (P<0.05). Interestingly, Ple elevated the absoption of xylose (P<0.05) and the expression levels of tight junction protein CLDN1 and ZO-1 (P<0.05) in the small intestinal mucosa. The results suggest Ple may be an effective alternative to antibiotics for the pork industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first method was carried out by immersing roots in Hoagland's nutrient solution containing 0, 0.25, or 2.5 mM SA, and the second method was performed by spraying two-week-old seedlings with the same SA concentrations. After 24 h, chlorophyll fluorescence, thylakoid membrane proteins, antioxidant enzyme activities, and reactive oxygen species were measured. The low concentration of SA caused a significant increase in the antioxidant enzyme activities. However, the treatment with 2.5 mM SA resulted in an increase in the non-photochemical quenching coefficient and a decrease in the antioxidant enzyme activities, the quantum yield of PS II photochemistry, and the photochemical quenching, especially in the first method of application. All these results indicate that the effects of SA on PS II and the antioxidative defense system were dependent on the concentration used and the method of application.	[Chen, Y. E.; Cui, J.

This sensor is based on a novel signal-amplification mechanism involving reactive halide species (RHSs) including chlorides or bromides, which accelerate copper Fenton reactions oxidizing the chromogenic substrate to develop colour. The results of this study expand our understanding of copper-based Fenton chemistry.

J	Li, Z; Peng, Y; Huang, BR				Li, Zhou; Peng, Yan; Huang, Bingru			Physiological Effects of gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Application on Improving Heat and Drought Tolerance in Creeping Bentgrass	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						chlorophyll; electrolyte leakage; leaf senescence; osmotic adjustment; turf quality	OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; TRINEXAPAC-ETHYL; LEAF SENESCENCE; EXOGENOUS GABA; WATER-USE; STRESS; CYTOKININ; PLANTS; EXPRESSION	Gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a nonprotein amino acid in plant cells, which responds to changes in environmental factors. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of foliar spray of GAGA on drought and heat tolerance in creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), and to investigate physiological factors altered by GABA application that contribute to improved drought tolerance and heat tolerance. GABA-treated plants (cv. Penncross) or non-GABA-treated control plants were then subjected to the following three treatments in growth chambers: 1) nonstress control [plants irrigated every 2 days to maintain soil water content at the pot capacity and maintained at 21/19 degrees C (day/night) for 35 days], 2) heat stress [plants exposed to 35/30 degrees C (day/night) and well-watered conditions for 35 days], and 3) drought stress [plants unirrigated for 9 days and maintained at 21/19 degrees C (day/night), and then rewatered for 2 days]. As compared with untreated plants, GABA-treated plants showed 22% to 39% and 8% to 21% significantly lower leaf electrolyte leakage (EL) and 35% to 143% and 21% to 24% significantly higher turf quality (TQ), 8% to 17% and 17% to 24% relative water content (RWC), 22% to 39% and 25% to 27% chlorophyll content, 7% to 11% and 6% to 17% photochemical efficiency, and an 84% to 683% and 57% to 76% osmotic adjustment (OA) exposed to heat or drought stress across days of treatment, respectively. GABA-treated plants accumulated 7% to 10% more water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and 11% to,43% more free proline than nontreated plants under heat stress, and 12% to 30% higher accumulation of WSC under drought stress. After 2 days of rewatering, a significantly better recovery also was observed in GABA-treated plants than that in nontreated plants previously exposed to drought stress. The results suggest that foliar application of GABA significantly improved heat and drought tolerance of creeping bentgrass, which was associated with maintenance of cell membrane stability, delaying in leaf senescence, and enhancing OA. The effectiveness of exogenous GABA application was more pronounced under heat stress than under drought stress.

Therefore, antioxidant is an important medicine to ROS-related diseases. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C, VC) was suggested as the candidate antioxidant to treat multiple diseases. However, long-term use of high-dose VC causes many side effects. In this review, we compare and analyze all kinds of mitochondrion-permeable antioxidants, including edaravone, idebenone, alpha-Lipoic acid, carotenoids, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10, and mitochondria-targeted antioxidants MitoQ and SkQ and propose astaxanthin (a special carotenoid) to be the best antioxidant for ROS-burst-mediated acute diseases, like avian influenza infection and ischemia-reperfusion. Nevertheless, astaxanthins are so unstable that most of them are inactivated after oral administration. Therefore, astaxanthin injection is suggested hypothetically. The drawbacks of the antioxidants are also reviewed, which limit the use of antioxidants as coadjuvants in the treatment of ROS-associated disorders.

Herein, the first highly chemoselective tandem C(sp(3))-H arylation/[1,2]-Wittig rearrangement of pyridylmethyl ethers is presented. The efficient and operationally simple protocols enable generation of either arylation products or tandem arylation/[1,2]-Wittig rearrangement products with remarkable selectivity and good to excellent yields (60-99%). Choice of base, solvent, and reaction temperature play a pivotal role in tuning the reactivity of intermediates and controlling the relative rates of competing processes. The novel arylation step is catalyzed by a Pd(OAc)(2)/NIXANTPHOS-based system via a deprotonative cross-coupling process. The method provides rapid access to skeletally diverse aryl(pyridyl)methanol core structures, which are central components of several medications.

JIAN; TRANSCRIPT ABUNDANCE	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary phospholipids (PL) on the gill immune response and physical barrier of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodort idella). A total of 1080 juvenile grass carp with an average initial weight of 9.34 +/- 0.03 g were fed six semi-purified diets containing 0.40% (unsupplemented control group), 1.43%, 238%, 3.29%, 4.37% and 5.42% PL for 2 months. Compared with the control group, optimal PL supplementation increased (P < 0.05): (1) the lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase activity, complement component 3 (C3) content, liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 1 (LEAP-1) and LEAP-2 mRNA expression; (2) the relative mRNA expression of interleukin 10, transforming growth factor 1:11, inhibitor factor kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) and target of rapamycin (TOR); (3) the activities of anti-superoxideanion (ASA), anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione content and mRNA levels of SOD1, CAT, GPx, GR and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) genes; (4) the transcription abundance of occludin, claudin b, claudin c, claudin 12 and zonula occludens 1 genes. At the same time, appropriate PL supplementation decreased (P < 0.05): (1) tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 113, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF -kappa B p65), I kappa B kinase (3 (IKK beta) and I kappa B kinase gamma (IKK gamma) mRNA expression; (2) malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and the relative mRNA expression of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein la (Keap1a) and Keap1b; (3) the transcription abundance of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) genes. In conclusion, the positive effect of PL on gill health is associated with the improvement of the immunity, antioxidant status and tight junction barrier of fish gills. Finally, based on ACP activity, C3 content, PC content and ASA activity in the gills, the optimal dietary PL level for juvenile grass carp (9.34-87.50 g) was estimated to be 3.62%, 430%, 3.91% and 3.86%, respectively.

In this work, the solubilities of TMP in five pure solvents (ethanol, water, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, and 2-propanol) and two binary mixtures (ethanol + water and 2-propanol + water) were measured by an equilibrium method over the temperature range from (293.15 to 322.65) K under atmospheric pressure. The experimental results show that in the pure solvents the solubility of TMP increases with increasing temperature, and the solubility decreases in the following order: ethanol > acetonitrile > 2-propanol > ethyl acetate > water. In the mixed solvents, the solubility of TMP increases with increasing temperature and mass fraction of the organic solvent. The mole-fraction solubility of TMP was observed to be the highest in the mixed solvent 50% ethanol/2-propanol, and the lowest mole-fraction solubility of TMP was found in water. Three correlating models (the modified Apelblat equation, the ?h equation, and the ideal model) were used to correlate the experimental solubility values in the pure solvents, and four models (the modified Apelblat equation, the lambda h equation, the ideal model, and the CNIBS/R-K model) were applied to correlate the experimental solubilities in the mixed solvents. All of these thermodynamic models gave satisfactory correlation results, with the modified Apelblat equation showing better fitting degree than the other three equations. Furthermore, the standard molar enthalpy of the TMP during the dissolving process (Delta Hsol degrees) was also determined in this work, and the results show that the dissolution process is endothermic.

The two genera undoubtedly represent a closely allied complex of related species. The objective of this study was to obtain an overview of the diversity and genetic relationships among 59 accessions of 32 species of the Lolium-Festuca complex using sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. In total, 22 primer combinations amplified 269 polymorphic bands which were detected with an average of 12.23 alleles per SRAP locus. The average polymorphic rate (P) between the species studied was 100 %, demonstrating their high degree of genetic diversity. According to the POPGENE and AMOVA analyses, the inter-genera diversity and the variance between the two genera were both under 50 %. The dendrograms derived either by NTSYS or MEGA in addition to the PCO were consistent and clearly illustrated the relationships among representatives of the Lolium genus as well as the subgenus Festuca, Schedonorus and Leucopoa within the Festuca genus. The result of this study strongly supported the previous morphological separation into a "broad leaved'' and "fine-leaved'' clades, and it once again demonstrated the close relationship between the Lolium genus and the Schedonorus subgenus. This study also suggested the inclusion of F. mairei in subg. Schedonorus and to divide subgenus Leucopoa by moving sect. Leucopoa and sect. Breviaristatae into different subgenera. The analysis method described provides new methodologies for determining the phylogeny of these outbreeding species.

Such selections are likely to have imposed distinctive selection signatures on the sheep genome. Therefore, detecting selection signatures across the genome may help elucidate mechanisms of selection and pinpoint candidate genes of interest for further investigation. Here, detection of selection signatures was conducted in three sheep breeds, Sunite (n=66), German Mutton (n=159), and Dorper (n=93), using the Illumina OvineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip array. Each animal provided genotype information for 43 273 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We adopted two complementary haplotype-based statistics of relative extended haplotype homozygosity (REHH) and the cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) tests. In total, 707, 755, and 438 genomic regions subjected to positive selection were identified in Sunite, German Mutton, and Dorper sheep, respectively, and 42 of these regions were detected using both REHH and XP-EHH analyses. These genomic regions harbored many important genes, which were enriched in gene ontology terms involved in muscle development, growth, and fat metabolism. Fourteen of these genomic regions overlapped with those identified in our previous genonne-wide association studies, further indicating that these genes under positive selection may underlie growth developmental traits.

Each treatment was composed of 10 replicates of 10 birds per replicate. Samples of lung were collected after the broilers were killed at d 21. LAT increased the ratio of vessel wall area to vessel total area (WA/TA, %) and mean media thickness in pulmonary arterioles (mMTPA, %) (P<0.05). Dietary VC supplementation decreased mMTPA (P<0.05), but had no effect on the WA/TA. LAT increased (P<0.05) the relative nnRNA expression of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF and VEGFR-2, while adding VC to the diet could decrease (P<0.05) their relative nnRNA expression: A significant positive correlation existed between the level of VEGF mRNA expression and the value of WA/WT (P<0.05) or mMTPA (P<0.05). These results suggested LAT resulted in pulmonary vascular remodeling, and the increase of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF and VEGFR-2 mRNA expression, and dietary VC supplementation can alleviate pulmonary vascular remodeling in broiler by affecting these gene expression.

Previous studies indicated that during greening, chlorophyll accumulation was largely delayed in plants whose mitochondrial cyanide-resistant respiration was inhibited by knocking out nuclear encoded AOX gene. Here, we showed that this delay of chlorophyll accumulation was more significant under high light condition. Inhibition of cyanide-resistant respiration was also accompanied by the increase of plastid NADPH/NADP(+) ratio, especially under high light treatment which subsequently blocked the import of multiple plastidial proteins, such as some components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, the Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes and malate/oxaloacetate shuttle components. Overexpression of AOX1a rescued the aox1a mutant phenotype, including the chlorophyll accumulation during greening and plastidial protein import. It thus suggests that light intensity affects chlorophyll synthesis during greening process by a metabolic signal, the AOX-derived plastidial NADPH/NADP(+) ratio change. Further, our results thus revealed a molecular mechanism of chloroplast-mitochondria interactions.

Mammalian Sox6 has been isolated and characterized from mice, rats, and humans. In this study, the porcine Sox6 (pSox6) cDNA was cloned by degenerate PCR. The entire open reading frame (ORF) of pSox6 is 2406 bp. The predicted protein is composed of 801 amino acids and contains the HMG box, leucine-zipper motif, and glutamine-rich Q-box. The amino acid similarities between the Sox6 from pig and other mammals range from 90% to 95%. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that pSox6 mRNA was most abundant in the heart and skeletal muscles. Overexpression of pSox6 led to downregulation of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) I expression and upregulation of MyHC IIa, MyHC IIx, and MyHC IIb expressions. This is the first report on molecular cloning and characterization of porcine Sox6.

It is of great interest to breeders to integrate the resistance locus (loci) from Th. elongatum into commercial wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to identify candidate genes expressed from the 7EL chromosome of CS-7EL, to develop 7EL-specific molecular markers, and to validate their usefulness for characterizing recombination between one of the group 7 chromosomes of wheat and Th. elongatum. High-throughput sequencing of Fusarium graminearum-infected and control CS and CS-7EL cDNA libraries was performed using RNA-Seq. A stepwise bioinformatics strategy was applied to assemble the sequences obtained from RNA-Seq and to create a conservative list of candidate genes expressed from the foreign chromosome 7EL. Polymerase chain reaction primer pairs were designed and tested for 135 candidate genes. A total of 48 expressed molecular markers specific for the chromosome 7EL were successfully developed. Screening of progenies from two BC1F2 families from the cross CS-7E(7D) x 2*CSph1b showed that these markers are useful for characterizing recombination events between the chromosomes 7D from wheat and 7E from Th. elongatum.

However, mechanisms of pollen abortion and fertility restoration remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of CMS-C pollen abortion and fertility restoration, particularly based on epigenetics, and to understand the relationship between male fertility performance and DNA methylation status. Methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique was conducted to analyze DNA methylation levels and patterns of tassels at pollen-mother cell, tetrad, mononuclear, and binuclear stages among four half-sib hybrids and their parents with different fertility. Results showed that DNA methylation levels in fertility restored hybrids were higher than those in sterility maintained hybrids. Nine CCGG sites, which displayed methylation polymorphism between male-fertile and male-sterile hybrids, were screened. To validate MSAP results, we performed methylation-sensitive PCR (MS-PCR) and found consistent observations in cloned methylation sites. Interestingly, a specific site named 16-1 was discovered in the region of Rf5 gene, which is one of the restorer genes of CMS-C. Thus, DNA methylation may participate in regulating the expression of fertility restorer genes of maize CMS-C.

SERK is involved in somatic embryogenesis and can be found in various important signal transduction pathways. Research on SERK found in pineapple (AcSERK1 and AcSERK2) has indicated that these genes could be used as potential marker genes for monitoring the acquisition of embryogenic competence. This experiment was designed to study somatic embryogenesis in pineapple in detail using AcSERK1 as a marker gene. The results showed that somatic embryogenesis in pineapple callus originated from the surface, the inside, and the superficial layer of the callus. Very few parenchyma cells could be converted into competent cells under 2,4-D induction. The competent cells passed through the pro-embryo-protuberance, the pro-embryo, and the early stage globular embryo. The passage of competent cells through these channels formed the globular embryo. AcSERK1 expression was upregulated by jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), injury, and low temperature treatment. The His6-AcSERK1 protein had autophosphorylation activity. These results confirmed that AcSERK1 can be used as a marker gene for the study of embryogenesis and for expression of totipotency in pineapple. The results indicated that AcSERK1 may also play a role in pineapple stress-response signaling. For future studies, the prokaryotically-expressed His6-AcSERK1 protein can be used to examine the receptor-like kinases function of SERK proteins.	[Ma, J.; Zhang, J.

The digital filter technique is employed to separate baseflow from streamflow, and then the recession curve displacement method is applied to estimate the annual average monthly groundwater recharge. The streamflow data of 15 gauging stations are applied to investigate the temporal and spatial features of annual monthly average groundwater recharge in Grand River watershed, Michigan, US. The results show that (1) the annual monthly average groundwater recharge in Grand River watershed gradually drops from 40.82 cm/a in March to 10.50 cm/a in August. In period of September and February of the next year, the annual monthly average groundwater recharge steadily rises to 40.82 cm. The temperatures are the main reason that caused the significantly change of annual monthly average groundwater recharge. (2) The temporal feature of annual seasonal average groundwater recharge obey that "the annual seasonal average groundwater recharge in spring is the highest and that in summer is the lowest; the annual seasonal average groundwater recharge in winter and autumn are between that in spring and summer". (3) In spring, summer, and autumn, the annual seasonal average groundwater recharge in upper reaches is less than that in lower reaches. While the annual seasonal average groundwater recharge in north Grand River watershed is higher than that in south, in winter. The characteristics of space distribution of annual seasonal average groundwater recharge are determined by atmospheric wet deposition, temperature, soil types, and vegetation coverage, and so on.

Per cent weight gain (PWG) and feed intake were improved with Fe levels up to 52.8mgkg(-1) diet. Serum Fe, erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit and mean cell haemoglobin increased with optimal Fe levels (38.4-79.3mgkg(-1) diet) (P<0.05). The muscle protein and lipid contents were increased by dietary Fe, whereas moisture, liquid loss, shear force and hydroxyproline contents followed opposite trends. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in muscle were the lowest in fish fed the 52.8 or 79.3mgFekg(-1) diet, respectively, while superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities, and glutathione content were increased by Fe levels up to 52.8-79.3mgkg(-1) diet.

It is a nitrogen scavenger and a source of glutamate and glutamine that stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation in muscles. AKG as a precursor of glutamate and glutamine is a central metabolic fuel for cells of the gastrointestinal tract as well. AKG can decrease protein catabolism and increase protein synthesis to enhance bone tissue formation in the skeletal muscles and can be used in clinical applications. In addition to these health benefits, a recent study has shown that AKG can extend the lifespan of adult Caenorhabditis elegans by inhibiting ATP synthase and TOR. AKG not only extends lifespan, but also delays age-related disease. In this review, we will summarize the advances in AKG research field, in the content of its physiological functions and applications.

The ent-CPP synthase (ent-CPS) gene was cloned from A. paniculata and its encoded ApCPS was demonstrated to react with (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form ent-CPP through recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Asp to Ala in the conserved DXDD motif of ApCPS resulted in loss of function. One Arg is located in the conserved position close to DXDD motif indicating the involvement of ApCPS in specialized metabolism. In addition, RT-PCR analysis revealed that ApCPS was expressed in all tissues of A. paniculata at all growth stages, which is consistent with andrographolides accumulating in these organs. Methyl jasmonate induced ApCPS gene expression, matching inducible accumulation of andrographolides in vivo. ApCPS is the first ent-CPS characterized in A. paniculata and is suggested to be involved in biosynthesis of andrographolides that have high pharmaceutical values.

Cells were gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, and rod shaped. Strain CF21(T) grew at 10-40 A degrees C (optimum 28-30 A degrees C) and pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0-8.0) and in the presence of NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.0 % (w/v) to 2.0 % (optimum 0.0-1.0 %). 16SrRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain CF21(T) belonged to genus Lysobacter within class Gammaproteobacteria and was most closely related to Luteimonas dalianensi OB44-3(T) (95.8 % similarity), Lysobacter ruishenii CTN-1(T) (95.1 %), Lysobacter spongiicola KMM329(T) (94.8 %), and Lysobacter daejeonensis GH1-9(T) (94.6 %). The genomic G+C DNA content was 68.72 mol%. Major cellular fatty acids of CF21(T) were iso-C-16:0 (30.22 %), iso-C-15:0 (25.70 %), and the sum of 10-methyl C-16:0 and/or iso-C-17:1 omega 9c (21.94 %). The prominent isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone 8 (Q-8). Primary polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and an unknown phospholipid. DNA sequence relatedness between strain CF21(T) and L. ruishenii CTN-1(T) was 56 %, which was clearly below the 70 % threshold for prokaryotic species delineation. These analyses indicated that CF21(T) is a novel member of genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter chengduensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CF21(T) (=CGMCC1.15145(T) = DSM 100306(T)).

Turfgrasses, due to their high biomass yields, are considered to be suitable for use in phytoextraction of soil contaminated with heavy metal. It has been demonstrated that centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack., Poaceae) is a good turfgrass for restore of soil contaminated by Pb. However, the enhanced tolerant mechanisms in metallicolous (M) centipedegrass accessions remain unknown. In this study, we made a comparative study of growth performance, Pb accumulation, antioxidant levels, and phytochelatin concentrations in roots and shoots from M and nonmetallicolous (NM) centipedegrass accessions. Results showed that turf quality and growth rate were less repressed in M accessions than in NM accession. Pb stress caused generation of reactive oxygen species in centipedegrass with relatively lower levels in M accessions. Antioxidant activity analysis indicated that superoxide dismutase and catalase played important roles in Pb tolerance in M accessions. M accessions accumulated more Pb in roots and shoots. Greatly increased phytochelatins and less repressed sulfur contents in roots and shoots of M accessions indicated that they correlated with Pb accumulation and tolerance in centipedegrass.

In Arabidopsis, flowering time is precisely controlled by extensive environmental and internal cues. Gibberellins (GAs) promote flowering, while abscisic acid (ABA) is considered as a flowering suppressor. However, the detailed mechanism through which ABA inhibits the floral transition is poorly understood. Here, we report that ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4), a key component in the ABA signalling pathway, negatively regulates floral transition by directly promoting FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) transcription. The abi4 mutant showed the early flowering phenotype whereas ABI4-overexpressing (OE-ABI4) plants had delayed floral transition. Consistently, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that the FLC transcription level was down-regulated in abi4, but up-regulated in OE-ABI4. The change in FT level was consistent with the pattern of FLC expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitationq-PCR (ChIP-qPCR), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and tobacco transient expression analysis showed that ABI4 promotes FLC expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic analysis demonstrated that OE-ABI4::flc-3 could not alter the flc-3 phenotype. OE-FLC::abi4 showed a markedly delayed flowering phenotype, which mimicked OE-FLC::WT, and suggested that ABI4 acts upstream of FLC in the same genetic pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that ABA inhibits the floral transition by activating FLC transcription through ABI4.

The amounts of saturated fatty acids (FAs) and short-chain FAs were increased. The amount of unsaturated FAs was decreased as the processing time increased. An increase in the amount of tetradecanoic acid and 9-cis-hexadecanoic acid was observed during the CBM frying only. The FTIR spectrum of frying oil was analyzed by extracting the entire information as the area ratios based on vibration absorptions of the specific functional groups. Changes in content of functional groups, namely cis C=C, trans C=C, C=O, C-O, O-H, and C-H, were studied by the FTIR-based method. Based on the changes in the content of FAs and functional groups, soybean oil fried with CBM degraded more quickly than that fried with WD. Moreover, good linear correlations between the change in contents of functional groups and the mass percentages of FAs were also observed. The FTIR-based method could be used in real time to monitor the quality of frying oil during the deep-fat frying.	[Zhang, Qing; Saleh, Ahmed S.

Susceptibility testing results showed that 85.5% isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic drug. The E. coli isolates showed the highest resistance to sulfamethoxazole (61.6%), followed by tetracycline (61.2%), ampicillin (48.2%), cefalotin (29.8%), and kanamycin (22.4%). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the disinfectants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, N,N-didecyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and cetylpyridinium chloride for E. coli were 16-1,024, 4-1,024, 16-512, and 8-512mg/L, respectively. The emrE, ydgE/ydgF, mdfA, and sugE(c) genes were commonly present (53.7-83.1%), but the qac and sugE(p) genes were less prevalent (0.0-14.9%). The qac genes were highly associated with antimicrobial resistance. Conjugative transfer experiment indicated that the disinfectant resistance genes, qacF, sugE(p), and qacE1, were located on conjugative plasmids. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the antimicrobial-resistant isolates were associated with the sampling supermarkets or groceries. This study indicated that using quaternary ammonium compounds to decontaminate food processing environments may be ineffective and even provide a selective pressure for strains with acquired resistance to other antimicrobials.

Comparison of methods for extracting thylakoid membranes of Arabidopsis plants	PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM			English	Article							BUNDLE-SHEATH CHLOROPLASTS; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; PROTEIN COMPLEXES; THALIANA; ORGANIZATION; IMPORT; LIGHT; PHOSPHORYLATION; SEPARATION; MESOPHYLL	Robust and reproducible methods for extracting thylakoid membranes are required for the analysis of photosynthetic processes in higher plants such as Arabidopsis. Here, we compare three methods for thylakoid extraction using two different buffers. Method I involves homogenizing the plant material with a metal/glass blender; method II involves manually grinding the plant material in ice-cold grinding buffer with a mortar and method III entails snap-freezing followed by manual grinding with a mortar, after which the frozen powder is thawed in isolation buffer. Thylakoid membrane samples extracted using each method were analyzed with respect to protein and chlorophyll content, yields relative to starting material, oxygen-evolving activity, protein complex content and phosphorylation. We also examined how the use of fresh and frozen thylakoid material affected the extracts' contents of protein complexes. The use of different extraction buffers did not significantly alter the protein content of the extracts in any case. Method I yielded thylakoid membranes with the highest purity and oxygen-evolving activity. Method III used low amounts of starting material and was capable of capturing rapid phosphorylation changes in the sample at the cost of higher levels of contamination. Method II yielded thylakoid membrane extracts with properties intermediate between those obtained with the other two methods. Finally, frozen and freshly isolated thylakoid membranes performed identically in blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments conducted in order to separate multimeric protein supracomplexes.

As one of the largest agricultural countries in the world, the sustainability of China's crop production system is being concerned widely with its economic development and increasing population. This study adopted emergy analysis to explore the comprehensive performance of this system. A set of emergy based indicator system was used to investigate its economic benefit, environmental pressure and sustainability from 2000 to 2010. The study results show that the purchased nonrenewable input makes the largest contribution to the total input (average value 60.73% of the total input), which mainly derived from agricultural mechanic equipments and chemical fertilizer; on the average, beans has the largest share (20.20%) to the total emergy output, next from rape seed (18.36%), then from peanuts (15.85%), fruits (15.74%), wheat (8.26%), rice (8.07%), corn (7.66%) and cotton (4.60%) accordingly, and the other four categories crops just have a contribution of 1.28%; the production efficiency of China's crop production system has been raised by 11.54% with decrease of the indicator unit emergy value of product (UEVP) from 1.82E09 sej/g to 1.61E09 sej/g, the dependence of this system on economic market has increased by 24.92% with growth of the indicator EIR from 6.22 to 7.77, its economic benefit has been reduced by 0.59% with decline of the indicator EYR from 1.69 to 1.68, and its environmental loading has raised by 57.89% with growth of the indicator ELR from 1.33 to 2.10; the sustainability of China's crop production system is reduced by 37.01% with decrease of the index ESI from 1.27 to 0.80, during this study period. Based on these study results, the following measures should be emphasized in future, including raising the efficiency of purchased non-renewable resources (especially agricultural mechanical equipments and chemical fertilizer), using other methods of cultivation inherently more sustainable (e.g. replacing chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer, recycling organic wastes, biological control of agricultural pests, use of local renewable energy, and more), strengthening supervision of the related industrial processes and further promoting agricultural environmental protection.

J	Deng, FL; Chen, SY				Deng, Feilong; Chen, Shi-Yi			dbHT-Trans: An Efficient Tool for Filtering the Protein-Encoding Transcripts Assembled by RNA-Seq According to Search for Homologous Proteins	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						quality filtering; RNA-Seq; transcript	DE-NOVO; DIFFERENTIAL GENE; REFERENCE GENOME; QUANTIFICATION; STRATEGIES; SEQUENCES	In RNA-Seq studies, there are still many challenges for reliably assembling transcripts. Both genome-guided and de novo methods always produce too many false transcripts because of known and unknown factors. Therefore, the postassembly quality filtering is necessary before performing downstream analyses. Here, we present an automatic and efficient tool of dbHT-Trans for filtering the protein-encoding transcripts assembled by RNA-Seq. For each candidate transcript, we first deduced all potential open reading frames and translated them into amino acid sequences. By searching against the reference protein database, a transcript would be predicted a false one when it has no homologous sequence. Using this method, it is expected to filter out the falsely assembled transcripts of protein-encoding genes. Application of dbHT-Trans to the annotated transcriptome of mouse revealed that the sensitivity was almost 90% for recalling protein-encoding transcripts. After this quality filtering, the numbers of assembled genes became more consistent between Cufflinks and Trinity tools. To significantly decrease the data storage, we transformed all intermediate data into descriptive metadata and stored by the MySQL database, which will be utilized by downstream analyses in a real-time style. The source codes, example data, and manual of dbHT-Trans are freely available on the GitHub repository.

The RS lines were developed through interspecific hybridizations between a vegetable cabbage (B. oleracea L. ssp. alboglabra Bailey) and a number of landraces in B. rapa L. ssp. chinensis and campestris from Southwestern regions of China. The CM lines include 10 elite lines bred in our own Sichuan Agricultural University, 9 elite lines from domestic research institutes in China and 6 exotic spring rapeseed lines from Germany and Canada. The investigated main agronomic traits include plant height, first branch height, main inflorescence length, number of primary branches, siliqua length, seeds per siliqua, siliqua density on the main inflorescence and 1000-seed weight. The observed agronomic traits exhibited a remarkable difference between the RS lines and theCMlines. Large variations were observed in main agronomic traits in the RS and CM lines. A number of salient RS lines were identified, showing variable unique agronomic traits, such as extremely long siliqua length, large 1000-seed weight, high number of seeds per siliqua and high siliqua density, etc. Clustering analyses were made based on both agronomic traits and SSR markers. The UPGMA dendrogram based on the main agronomic traits revealed a major differentiation between the RS lines and the CM lines. The UPGMA dendrogram based on SSR markers clearly distinguished the two main groups of RS lines and CM lines. Large variations and diversities were observed among the RS lines and the CM lines. Big variations were also observed within most of the RS and CM subgroups. We conclude that the RS lines are markedly different from the common (CM) B. napus lines in the study. Large diversity exists among the RS lines and the CM lines. These RS lines could be a valuable source of new germplasm for rapeseed breeding and genetic studies. It is also suggested that the resynthesis of novel B. napus types through interspecific hybridizations with the diverse indigenous B. oleracea and B. rapa sources could be an efficient way to broaden the genetic basis of B. napus L.

Recombinant plasmid pVAX-N was transformed into competent cells of attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 via electroporation. After it was identified via RT-PCR and double digestion, the screened recombinant bacteria presenting pVAX-N were named SL7207 (pVAX-N). To evaluate the safety and stability of the developed vaccine, different dosages (5 x 10(8), 1 x 10(9), and 2 x 10(9) CFU/mice) of SL7207 (pVAX-N) were inoculated to 6-week-old mice. Piglets below 20 days of age were dosed with 1 x 10(12) CFU. Humoral (neutralization titer and specific IgG), cellular (interleukin-4, gamma-interferon, and peripheral lymphocyte proliferation), and mucosal (sIgA) immune responses were detected and evaluated. The three immunizing dosages were determined to be safe for mice and were completely eliminated 8 weeks after the first inoculation. Results of antibody and cytokine detection indicated that SL7207 (pVA)(-N) could significantly induce antibody-IgG, antibody-IgA, interleukin-4, and gamma-interferon, whose value was maximized on the 6th week. Results confirmed that the recombinant vaccine increased the proliferation of peripheral T lymphocyte. In conclusion, the oral vaccine was developed successfully, and the vaccine could significantly induce humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses in piglets. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the biosynthesis of these sesquiter-penoids has remained unclear. In particular, it is unclear how the olefinic precursor, (S)-beta-macrocarpene produced by the characterized maize sesquiterpene synthases TPS6/11, is further elaborated to form the bioactive zealexins. The first step is likely to be conversion of carbon-15 (C15) from a methyl group to a carboxylic acid by a cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase (CYP). In this study, CYP71Z18, whose transcription is strongly induced by fungal infection, was found to catalyze oxidation of C15 in (S)-beta-macrocarpene, forming zealexin A1. The inducible transcription of CYP71Z18 matches that observed for TPS6/11 and the accumulation of zealexins, which is consistent with a role for CYP71Z18 in sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin production. This completes identification of zealexin A1 biosynthesis, and represents the initial CYP identified for the production of maize terpenoid phytoalexins. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To explore the sensitivity of LOCF and their enzymatic conversion under straw mulch for scientific management of crop straw use on the Chengdu plain, a straw mulch field experiment was conducted to observe the LOCF changes and explore their relationships with C-cycle enzymes during wheat growth. The treatments included no fertilizer or straw (Control), only mineral fertilizer (MF), 10% rice straw nitrogen (N) plus 90% fertilizer N (RS1), 20% rice straw N plus 80% fertilizer N (RS2), 30% rice straw N plus 70% fertilizer N (RS3), 100% rice straw (RS). The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under straw treatments in the 0-20 cm soil layer were significantly higher than those of Control and MF treatments from the seedling stage, and showed significant differences among straw treatments from the tillering stage. Correspondingly, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and permanganate oxidized carbon (POXC) showed no obvious differences among straw treatments in most growth stages. Therefore, WSOC and MBC were the most sensitive indicators for assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) change under straw mulch. Moreover, stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that cellulase and beta-glucosidase were significantly positive impact factors for LOCF in the two soil layers, while polyphenol oxidase had both positive and negative impacts on WSOC at different soil layers, and peroxidase was a negative factor for LOCF.

Overall, hemicellulose removal was intensified by PHP comparing to the concentrated H3PO4. Moreover, efficient delignification specially happened in PHP pretreatment. Hemicellulose removal and delignification by PHP positively responded to temperature and time. Increasing H3PO4 proportion in PHP can promote hemicellulose removal, however, decrease the delignification. Maximum hemicellulose removal and delignification were achieved at 100% and 83.7% by PHP. Enzymatic digestibility of PHP-pretreated wheat straw was greatly improved by increasing temperature, time and H3PO4 proportion, and complete hydrolysis can be achieved consequently. As temperature of 30-40 degrees C, time of 2.0 h and H3PO4 proportion of 60% were employed, more than 92% cellulose was retained in the pretreated wheat straw, and 29.1-32.6 g glucose can be harvested from 100 g wheat straw.

In our experiments, they were added as a drug for treatment of animal anemia. Iron-cobalt composite microcapsules were prepared by emulsion solvent diffusion method (ESDM) can meet the requirements of the body to trace elements, thus promoting the body's normal hematopoietic function. The optimum condition was investigated by response surface methodology (RSM) in order to improve the bioavailability of oral iron-cobalt preparations. By using the analysis of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry and scanning electronic microscope (SEM), the characteristics of the microcapsules were investigated respectively. The results showed that the optimum preparation conditions for iron-cobalt composite microcapsules were: 0.48 g of ferric citrate, 0.25 g cobalt chloride, 0.2 ml of twain-80 and 1.8 ml of span-80. The microcapsules were successfully prepared with 90.61% of encapsulation efficiency (EE) and 45.32% of drug loading (DL). The particles of the microcapsule conformed to a normal distribution with the average diameter of 180 +/- 9.54 mu m. The average accumulated dissolution is lower than 10.00% in dissolution medium of pH 1.0 within 120 min but that is more than 75.00% in dissolution medium of pH 6.8 within 120 min.

Tracheary elements (TEs) are tissues responsible for the transport of water and minerals and characterized by patterned secondary cell wall (SCW) thickening. Exocysts are involved in the regulation of SCW deposition by mediating the targeted transport of materials and enzymes to specific membrane areas. EXO70s are highly duplicated in plants and provide exocysts with functional specificity. In this study, we report the isolation of a rice mutant rapid leaf senescence2 (rls2) that exhibits dwarfism, ferruginous spotted necrotic leaves, decreased hydraulic transport, and disordered primary nutrient assimilation. Histological analysis of rls2-1 mutants has indicated impaired cell expansion, collapsed vascular tissues, and irregular SCW deposition. Map-based cloning has revealed that RLS2 encodes OsEXO70A1, which is one of the 47 members of EXO70s in rice. RLS2 was widely expressed and spatially restricted in vascular bundles. Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that RLS2 was present on both membrane and nuclear regions. Expression analysis revealed that mutations in rls2 triggers transcriptional fluctuation of orthologous EXO70 genes and affects genes involved in primary nutrient absorption and transport. In brief, our study revealed that RLS2 is required for normal vascular bundle differentiation and primary nutrient assimilation.

Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus. Results: In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73 xMo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. Eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a 2.21-4.96 Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community. Conclusions: Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. An updated IBM Syn10 population and a reliable, verified high-quality SNP set between Mo17 and B73 will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.

A qualitative analysis of the components of the essential oil and solvent fractions were then performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As a result, essential oil showed better antioxidant activity than ethanol extract and its solvent fractions. Among the solvent fractions, the EAF showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging ability (0.185 +/- 0.008 mg/mL) and reducing power while the CF showed the highest hydroxyl radical scavenging ability (0.307 +/- 0.011 mg/mL). And both of them had high phenolic content (p < 0.05) compared to other fractions. GC-MS analyses of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 30 compounds, representing 94.56% of the total oil. The major components were falcarinol (57.02%), 1,7-dimethy1-4-(1-methylethyl)-Spiro[4.5]dec-6-en-8-one (9.08%) and geranyl tiglate (7.54%). In addition, 53 constituents were identified in the fractions including the biological activity-containing compounds such as bergapten, ficusin, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-Pyran-4-one, and falcarinol. Consequently, the antioxidant activities of the essential oil and solvent fractions of ethanol extract are not only contributed by phenolics but also related to other constituents. Based on these results, the essential oil and fractions of ethanol extract from C. violaceum are promising sources of natural antioxidants. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (1) over bar, and consists of a dodecanuclear mixed-valent [(Mn4Mn8II)-Mn-III] cluster. When Cd(NO3)(2)center dot 4H(2)O was introduced into the reaction, compound 2 was resulted in, which displays the similar structural feature as compound 1, fabricating a dodecanuclear heterometallic [(Mn4Mn6Cd2II)-Mn-III-Cd-II] cluster, but crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c. Interestingly, there are two mu(5)-O bridges present in this structure, and it is rare. Magnetic susceptibilities of compounds 1 and 2 were measured, and antiferromagnetic interactions between metal centers were observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We conducted a field experiment in a natural forest and a plantation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau to estimate the warming effects of open-top chambers (OTC) on ECM and N nutrition of Picea asperata seedlings. Four-year warming significantly decreased ECM colonization, ECM fungal biomass, fine root vigor, and the N concentration of leaf, stem and coarse root, but significantly increased fine root N concentration and N content of leaf, stem, fine root and whole plant in natural forest. Contrarily, warming induced no obvious change in most of these parameters in plantation. Moreover, warming decreased rhizospheric soil inorganic N content in both forests. Our results showed that four-year warming was not beneficial for ECM colonization of P. asperata seedlings in the two forests, and the seedlings in natural forest were more sensitive and flexible to experimental warming than in plantation. The changes of ECM colonization and fine root biomass for effective N uptake would be good for plant growth and remit N leaching under future warming in natural forest.

Growth and P accumulation in Polygonum hydropiper were both dependent on an increasing level of IHP (1-8 mM P) and on a prolonged growth period (3-9 weeks), and those of the mining ecotype (ME) were higher than the non-mining ecotype (NME). Biomass increments in root, stem, and leaf of both ecotypes were significantly greater in IHP relative to other organic P (Po) sources (G1P, AMP, ATP), but lower than those in inorganic P (Pi) treatment (KH2PO4). P accumulation in the ME exceeded the NME from different P regimes. The ME demonstrated higher root activity compared to the NME grown in various P sources. Acid phosphatase (Apase) and phytase activities in root extracts of both ecotypes grown in IHP were comparable to that in Pi, or even higher in IHP. Higher secreted Apase and phytase activities were detected in the ME treated with different P sources relative to the NME. Therefore, the ME demonstrates higher P-uptake efficiency and it is a potential material for phytoextraction from P contaminated areas, irrespective of Pi or Po contamination.

Differences in the location-specific and breed-specific genes and pathways involved have important implications for meat productions and meat quality. Here, RNA-Seq was performed to identify differences in the muscle deposition between two muscle locations and two duck breeds for functional genomics studies. To achieve those goals, skeletal muscle samples were collected from the leg muscle (LM) and the pectoral muscle (PM) of two genetically different duck breeds, Heiwu duck (H) and Peking duck (P), at embryonic 15 days. Functional genomics studies were performed in two experiments: Experiment 1 directly compared the location-specific genes between PM and LM, and Experiment 2 compared the two breeds (H and P) at the same developmental stage (embryonic 15 days). Almost 13 million clean reads were generated using Illumina technology (Novogene, Beijing, China) on each library, and more than 70% of the reads mapped to the Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genome. A total of 168 genes were differentially expressed between the two locations analyzed in Experiment 1, whereas only 8 genes were differentially expressed when comparing the same location between two breeds in Experiment 2. Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG) were used to functionally annotate DEGs (differentially expression genes). The DEGs identified in Experiment 1 were mainly involved in focal adhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathways (corrected P-value<0.05). In Experiment 2, the DEGs were associated with only the ribosome signaling pathway (corrected P-value<0.05). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm 15 of the differentially expressed genes originally detected by RNA-Seq. A comparative transcript analysis of the leg and pectoral muscles of two duck breeds not only improves our understanding of the location-specific and breed-specific genes and pathways but also provides some candidate molecular targets for increasing muscle products and meat quality by genetic control.

However, the hydrolysis rate of PPF treated by centrifugal milling was limited with less than 30% while Crl was low to 0.48. In order to improve the efficiency of hydrolysis, the PPF sample was following pretreated by alkaline. The pretreated PPF, together with the spent PPF from the first hydrolysis and the doubly treated PPF were analyzed by X-ray diffract gram technique. It was dedicated that Crl of the spent PPF substrate did not change much after a double-treatment. However, it showed a potential to be hydrolyzed completely. The overall increase in digestibility was a result of the changed proportion of the three components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) and a reduction in particle size. This change has greater impact than reduction of Crl on enhanced hydrolysis of natural lignocellulosic biomass PPF.

At present, there are few published studies available on environmentally friendly management of this pest, compared with those on the use of chemical pesticides. The few studies that are available have suggested that the phototactic response of this beetle could be exploited in its management. We studied the phototactic behavior of H. vigintioctomaculata in response to 17 wavelengths of monochromatic lights and 10 illumination intensities of three of these wavelengths. The beetles showed a positively phototactic response to most wavelengths from 340 to 689 nm, except for the blue wavelength (492 nm). In addition, the beetles exhibited varying levels of sensitivity to illumination intensities from 10 to 190 lux under ultraviolet (UV) (340 nm), red (649 nm), green (510 nm), and white light. The general overall pattern of phototactic response rate, from short to long wavelengths, was a U-shaped curve. Thus, the beetles were most sensitive to UV light and red light. The response of the beetles to illumination intensity was correlated with light wavelength; therefore, the phototactic response rate (PRR) to UV light was always higher compared with the PRRs to other light. Our results highlight the positive phototactic behavior of H. vigintioctomaculata to different light wavelengths and illumination intensities. Such behavior could be exploited for noninvasive management using colored lights to control this important agricultural pest.

J	Liu, D; Tsegai, D; Litaker, D; von Braun, J				Liu, Dan; Tsegai, Daniel; Litaker, David; von Braun, Joachim			Under regional characteristics of rural China: a clearer view on the performance of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Regional characteristics of rural China; Health care access; Health care expenditure; Propensity score matching; Bounding approach	ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION ESTIMATOR; PROPENSITY-SCORE; TRAINING-PROGRAM; HEALTH-INSURANCE; CARE; VIETNAM	The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was implemented in 2003 in response to the poor state of health care in rural China. Considering the substantial differences in regional socioeconomics, preferences for health care needs, and concurrent implementation of other health-related policies, the extent to which the impact of the NCMS differs in rural communities across China is unclear. The objective of this paper, therefore, was to explore the variation in the determinants of household enrolment and the impact of enrolment on health care utilization and medical expenditures in three large geographic regions in China. A quasi-experiment study was designed based on the panel data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The bounding approach was used to conduct a robust check of impact estimation under the assumption of unobserved bias. A major finding is that household income plays no significant role for enrolment, which indicates the equity of program coverage in income terms. However, regional circumstances matter. In the generally poorer western regions, households with a high ratio of migrant workers are less attracted to the NCMS program, and adoption of the program is related to the regional infrastructure environment variables in the eastern and western regions. The NCMS has improved medical care utilization for poor income groups and regions (western regions). The NCMS's impact on reducing the incidence of catastrophic expenditures is not shown for all regions.

Methods: According to the reference sequences of RVFV published in GenBank, nine overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and four specific reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) primers were designed using DNAStar and LAMP primer design software, respectively. Based on the synthesis of a conserved part of the RVFV S segment gene sequence using overlapping PCR, RT-LAMP assay was first established and evaluated after a series of tests, including, optimization of reaction conditions, and sensitivity and specificity tests. Result: A target RVFV S segment gene fragment of 288 bp was synthesised. The optimal reaction conditions for RT-LAMP assay were 63 degrees C for 45 min: the assay has a specific ladder-like pattern of amplification bands from about 120 bp. The lowest target gene copy number of RT-LAMP for RVFV detection was 70 copies. The assay showed good specificity as only the synthesised target RVFV gene was amplified with no amplification for the detection of Peste des petits ruminants virus, Epidemic encephalitis B virus, E. coli, Pasteurella multocida, or Salmonella. Conclusion: This study provides a rapid, sensitive, specific RT-LAMP method for RVFV detection.

BASED ON RAPD AND SRAP MARKERS	BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Conyza blinii; RAPD; SRAP; Genetic diversity; HPLC	POPULATIONS; ISSR	The genetic diversity and genetic relationships among 16 populations of Conyza blinii in the Panxi area of China were assessed by RAPD and SRAP markers. Relative to independent molecular markers, the combined RAPD-SRAP data showed a more reasonable cluster (r = 0.80718), and the clustering results divided the 16 populations into three groups. One major group was formed by populations from Pzhihua city (nos. 1 to 7) and another two populations from Liangshan prefecture (nos. 8 and 9); two populations (nos. 10 and 11) collected from Liangshan clustered into the second category, and the remaining populations made up cluster III. The samples clustered into two groups based on the content of blinin (the characteristic compound of this plant), except samples 4, 5 and 16, other samples were clustered similar like molecular markers, they all gathered together based on their similar distance. The Jaccard's similarity coefficients ranged from 0.5073 to 0.8422, the results suggested that the genetic variation of wild populations was not abundant. However, based on blinin content (detected by HPLC), there was a large difference among populations although populations had a close genetic relationship which revealed that samples were not fully related to their geographical location. The result has important implications for C. blinii characterization, improvement, and conservation.

Twelve survey sites with active burrow of plateau pika were classified into four degrees of density: approximately zero-density, low-density, medium-density and high-density, to evaluate the impact of different pika densities on vegetation, plant biomass, soil organic carbon and nutrients in a whole growing season. We show that pika as a main supplement to livestock activities contributed to a decrease in the number of plant species, vegetation cover, plant height and seasonal mean biomass, while values at medium-density site except above-ground biomass were the lowest. With the exception of available potassium, soil organic carbon, nitrogen, total phosphorus and soil water content, zero-density areas were significantly higher than those of pika occupied areas. However, there were slight or no differences in vegetation characteristics and soil properties between medium-and high-density sites. Our study suggests pika activities with high-density made palatable forage less and soil carbon and nitrogen more than low-density, moreover, plateau pika had greater impacts on above-ground vegetation than on root system.

Hybrids of tetraploid wheat species and Ae. sharonensis have been successfully created by wild crosses. In our study, we conducted backcrosses and introduced the novel HMW-GSs of Ae. sharonensis into hexaploid wheat species. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cytogenetics indicated that lines carrying the HMW-GSs encoded by Glu-1S(sh) had varied chromosome numbers ranging from 35 to 50. Among these, three lines with 42 chromosomes (25-8, 33-1, and 42-2) were identified by visual examination. Except for possessing the alien HMW-GSs of Ae. sharonensis, the agricultural traits of the three lines were similar to those of common wheat, indicating their potential for wheat breeding. Additionally, we developed two molecular markers specific to the x-and y-type HMW-GSs genes of Ae. sharonensis. These two molecular markers were validated in backcross progenies and were proven to accurately trace and distinguish Ae. sharonensis Glu-1S(sh) from Glu-1A, Glu-1B, and Glu-1D of wheat. Therefore, the Glu-1S(sh) HMW-GSs lines with 42 chromosomes, together with gene-specific markers, will be valuable for molecular-assisted selection in alien genes utilization and wheat breeding.

Adaptive evolution of the MHC class III-encoded receptor RAGE in primates and murine rodents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOGENETICS			English	Article							GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS; CELL-SURFACE RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACID SITES; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CYTOPLASMIC DOMAIN; STRUCTURAL BASIS; S100 PROTEINS	The receptor for advanced glycation end products is associated with a series of physiological and pathological processes. Here, we studied the evolution of this multiligand receptor in primates and murine rodents. The evolutionary analyses reveal that adaptive selection had contributed to the variation at a number of amino acid sites in both taxa. Further, the major adaptively selected sites of both taxa are located on the extracellular ligand- and intracellular adaptor-binding regions and receptor oligomerization-related surfaces. The co-occurrence of adaptive evolution on the homologue domains suggests that they could play similar roles in these taxa. In terms of advantage fitness, the adaptive changes at these sites could contribute to host defence against the potential challenges towards these interactions and relevant signalling pathways, or the specificity of these essential points.

C5a peptidase is an important virulent factor of S. iniae. In this study, the subunit vaccine containing the truncated part of C5a peptidase (pSCPI) was mixed with aluminum hydroxide gel (AH), propolis adjuvant (PA), and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA). The immunogenicity of the pSCPI was detected by Western-blot in vitro. The relative percent survival (RPS), lysozyme activity, antibody titers, and the expression of the related immune genes were monitored in vivo to evaluate the immune effects of the three different adjuvants. The results showed that pSCPI exerted moderate immune protection (RPS = 46.43%), whereas each of the three adjuvants improved the immune protection of pSCPI. The immunoprotection of pSCPI + AH, pSCPI + PA, and pSCPI + FIA was characterized by RPS values of 67.86%, 75.00% and, 85.71%, respectively. Further, each of the three different adjuvanted pSCPIs stimulated higher levels of lysozyme activity and antibody titers than the unadjuvanted pSCPI and/or PBS buffer. In addition, pSCPI + FIA and pSCPI + PA induced expression of the related immune genes under investigation, which was substantially higher than the levels stimulated by PBS. pSCPI + AH significantly stimulated the induction of MHC II beta, CD4-L2, and IFN-gamma, while it induced slightly higher production of TNF-alpha and even led to a decrease in the levels of IL-1 beta, MHC I alpha , and CD8 alpha . Therefore, we conclude that compared with the other two adjuvants, FIA combined with pSCPI is a more promising candidate adjuvant against S. iniae in channel catfish.

Source Areas for the Early Immigration of Sogatella furcifera (Homoptera: Delphacidae) at Xiushan in the Middle Reach of Yangtze River of China	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						white-backed planthopper; Sogatella furcifera (HorvInot signth); trajectory analysis; HYSPLIT	NILAPARVATA-LUGENS STAL; MIGRATION; PLANTHOPPERS; HORVATH; SYSTEM; AUTUMN; FLIGHT	The spatiotemporal distribution of source areas for the early immigration of the white-backed planthopper, Sogatella furcifera (HorvInot signth), at Xiushan in the middle reach of Yangtze River of China, was analyzed with HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) and ArcGIS 10.0. The analysis was based on light trap data collected during April-July in 2000-2012. The synoptic meteorology backgrounds during the immigration periods were analyzed by GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display System). The light trap catches of S. furcifera varied monthly and annually. S. furcifera started immigration in Xiushan in early April to early May, whereas the main immigration period was in July. The distribution of the source areas varied monthly, and the core was moved from the south to the north gradually. The main source areas of S. furcifera in May were in southwestern Guangxi and northern Vietnam. The source areas of S. furcifera in June were located in southwestern Guangxi and western Hunan. Additionally, some of the pests were from southeastern Yunnan. The source areas in July were in northwestern Guangxi, southwestern Guizhou, eastern Yunnan, and the transitional parts of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. The sum frequencies of southwest and south winds on the 850 hPa isobaric surface of Xiushan of May-July in heavy occurrence years were more than the light occurrence years. The key meteorological factors were suggested to be vertical perturbation, precipitation, and wind shear during S. furcifera immigration periods.	[Jiang, C. X.; Chen, X. L.; Bi, J. C.; Li, J.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5B is a central component of the replicase complex (RC) in some single-stranded RNA viruses, including CSFV. On the basis of genetic variation, the CSFV RdRps could be clearly divided into 2 major groups and a minor group, which is consistent with the phylogenetic relationships and virulence diversification of the CSFV isolates. However, the adaptive signature underlying such an evolutionary profile of the polymerase and the virus is still an interesting open question. We analyzed the evolutionary trajectory of the CSFV RdRps over different timescales to evaluate the potential adaptation. We found that adaptive selection has driven the diversification of the RdRps between, but not within, CSFV major groups. Further, the major adaptive divergence-related sites are located in the surfaces relevant to the interaction with other component(s) of RC and the entrance and exit of the template-binding channel. These results might shed some light on the nature of the RdRp in virulence diversification of CSFV groups.

In rice, many lmms exhibit enhanced resistance to pathogens, which provides a unique opportunity to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying lmms. We isolated a rice light-dependent leaf lesion mimic mutant 1 (llm1). Lesion spots appeared in the leaves of the llm1 mutant at the tillering stage. Furthermore, the mutant llm1 had similar agronomic traits to wild type rice. Trypan blue and diamiobenzidine staining analyses revealed that the lesion spot formation on the llm1 mutant was due to programmed cell death and reactive oxygen species. The chloroplasts were severely damaged in the llm1 mutant, suggesting that chloroplast damage was associated with the formation of lesion spots in llm1. More importantly, llm1 exhibited enhanced resistance to bacterial blight pathogens within increased expression of pathogenesis related genes (PRs). Using a map-based cloning approach, we delimited the LLM1 locus to a 121-kb interval between two simple sequence repeat markers, RM17470 and RM17473, on chromosome 4. We sequenced the candidate genes on the interval and found that a base mutation had substituted adenine phosphate for thymine in the last exon of LOC_Os04g52130, which led to an amino acid change (Asp(388) to Val) in the llm1 mutant. Our investigation showed that the putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPOX) encoded by LOC_Os04g52130 was produced by LLM1 and that amino acid Asp388 was essential for CPOX function. Our study provides the basis for further investigations into the mechanism underlying lesion mimic initiation associated with LLM1. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

However, the inflammatory roles of different porcine GSK3 isoforms in response to LPS remain unknown. In this study, the activity of porcine GSK3 was inhibited in response to LPS stimulation through increased serine 9 phosphorylation of GSK3, which increased the production of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 in PK-15 cells. However, treatment with an inhibitor of GSK3, lithium chloride, significantly increased the production of IL-10 and IL-12 compared with the untreated control and significantly decreased the production of IL-10 and IL-12 compared with LPS stimulation. Moreover, all four glycogen synthase kinase-3 transcripts had positive roles in the production of IL-10 and IL-12 to varying degrees, suggesting their importance in the LPS-induced inflammatory response in pigs.

Although gene expression changes induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) have been profiled in several plant species, no information is available on the MeJA-triggered transcriptome response of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb., a species with highly valuable medicinal properties. In this study, we used transcriptome profiling to investigate transcriptome changes in roots of P. multiflorum seedlings subjected to a 0.25 mmol/L-MeJA root-irrigation treatment. A total of 18 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were induced by MeJA treatment, of which 4535 were up-regulated and 14 142 were down-regulated compared with controls. These DEGs were associated with 125 metabolic pathways. In addition to various common primary and secondary metabolic pathways, several secondary metabolic pathways related to components with significant pharmacological effects were enriched by MeJA, including arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and stilbenoid biosynthesis. The MeJA-induced transcriptome changes uncovered in this study provide a solid foundation for future study of functional genes controlling effective components in secondary metabolic pathways of P. multiflorum.

In the present study, we characterized a green-revertible albino mutant gra(k), which was obtained from the tissue-cultured rice Kitaake. The mutant gra(k) exhibited albino on its first three leaves. The leaf color started to turn green at the four-leaf stage. The chlorophyll contents were deeply reduced at the seedling stage, and the chloroplast development was delayed in gra(k). The green-revertible albino (gra) phenotype of the mutant gra(k) was temperature dependent. The main agronomic traits, including plant height, tilling number per plant, seed setting rate, and thousand-grain weight, slightly decreased in gra(k) comparing to those in the wild-type Kitaake. Genetic analysis showed that the gra phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nucleic gene. By using 5,168 recessive F (2) individuals derived from the cross of gra(k) x Jodan, the locus of the gene Gra(k) was delimited in a DNA region of 200 kb between the makers B-31 and P11 on chromosome 5. Sequencing analysis indicated that the three functionally annotated genes, LOC_Os05g23700, LOC_Os05g23720, and LOC_Os05g23740, were all deleted in the 200 kb region in the mutant gra(k). Transgenic test revealed that the gra(k) plants over-expressing LOC_Os05g23740CDS were restored to normal green as the wild-type Kitaake. Our results proved that the deletion of the DnaK protein gene LOC_Os05g23740 (encoding the chaperon protein OsHsp70CP1) led to the gra phenotype in the mutant gra(k).

However, the involvement of CART in the feeding behavior of teleosts has not been well understood. In this study, three distinct CARTs were cloned from the Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti). Real-time quantitative PCR were applied to characterize the tissue distribution and appetite regulatory effects of CARTs in S. prenanti. The S. prenanti CART-1, CART-2 and CART-3. full-length cDNA sequences were 597 bp, 694 bp and 749 bp in length, encoding the peptides of 125, 120 and 104 amino acid residues, respectively. All the S. prenanti CARTs consisted of three exons and two introns. Tissue distribution analysis showed that the high mRNA levels of S. prenanti CART-1 were observed in the telencephalon and eye, followed by the hypothalamus, myelencephalon, and mesencephalon. The S. prenanti CART-2 mRNA was mainly found in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, telencephalon and myelencephalon. The S. prenanti CART-3 mRNA was widely distributed among the tissues, with the high levels in the hypothalamus and foregut. In the periprandial experiment, all three CARTs mRNA expressions in the hypothalamus were highly elevated after a meal, suggesting that CARTs are postprandial satiety signals. In the fasting experiment, all three CARTs mRNA expressions decreased after fasting and increased after refeeding, suggesting that CARTs might be involved in regulation of appetite in the S. prenanti.

In this study, we measure mRNA and protein abundance of estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) in order to investigate the effect of monochromatic light on egg production traits and gonadal hormone function in chicken ovarian follicles. Five hundred and fifty-two 19-wk-old laying hens were exposed to three monochromatic lights: red (RL; 660 nm), green (GL; 560 nm), blue (BL; 480 nm) and control cool white (400-760 nm) light with an LED (light-emitting diode). There were 4 identical light-controlled rooms (n = 138) each containing 3 replicate pens (46 birds per pen). Water was supplied ad libitum and daily rations were determined according to the nutrient suggestions for poultry. Results showed that under BL conditions there was an increase in the total number of eggs at 300 days of age and egg-laying rate during the peak laying period. The BL and GL extended the duration of the peak laying period. Plasma melatonin was lowest in birds reared under BL. Plasma estradiol was elevated in the GL-exposed laying hens, and GL and BL increased progesterone at 28 wk of age. In the granulosa layers of the fifth largest preovulatory follicle (F5), the third largest preovulatory follicle (F3) and the largest preovulatory follicle (F1), ER alpha mRNA was increased by BL and GL. Treatment with BL increased ER beta mRNA in granulosa layers of F5, F3 and F1, while GL increased ER beta mRNA in F5 and F3. There was a corresponding increase in abundance of the proteins in the granulosa layers of F5, with an increase in PR-B, generated via an alternative splice site, relative to PR-A. Treatment with BL also increased expression of PR mRNA in all of the granulosa layers of follicles, while treatment with GL increased expression of PR mRNA in granulosa layers of SYF(small yellow follicle), F5 and F1. These results indicate that blue and green monochromatic lights promote egg production traits via stimulating gonadal hormone secretion and up-regulating expression of ERs and PRs. Changes in PR-B protein suggest that this form of the progesterone receptor is predominant for progesterone action in the granulosa layers of preovulatory follicles in chickens during light stimulation.

This study aimed to compare the bacterial community in the ileal and cecal digesta of growing pigs fed diets with low (0.14, LR pigs) and high (0.43, HR pigs) amylose/amylopectin ratio. Pyrosequencing based on MiSeq 2000 platform showed that in ileum digesta, Bacteroidetes of LR pigs was markedly higher than that in HR pigs (P < 0.05). Megasphaera and Prevotella were the two most predominant genera in LR pigs, and Prevotella was significantly higher in LR pigs than in HR pigs (P < 0.05). Prevotella was predominant in cecal samples from both LR and HR pigs, although no significant differences were found between the two groups. In the ileum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Mitsuokella multacida were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in LR pigs along with an increase of acetate and butyrate concentrations. Halomonas pacifica, Escherichia fergusonii, and Actinobacillus minor which belong to class Gammaproteobacteria were significantly lower (P < 0.01) in HR pigs with a significant increase (P < 0.01) of Lactobacillus acetotolerans-like bacteria. Therefore, the changed bacterial community may lead to a transformation of microbial function, such as the alteration of fermentation mode which is showed on the change of microbial metabolites like the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), to a response to the switch of dietary composition, and in turn, to help host absorb and utilize nutrients efficiently. The increase of dietary amylose induced the reduction of conditioned pathogens which may probably be due to the increase of some probiotics such as Lactobacillus, thus reducing the risk of intestinal disease.

Molecular markers to such genes facilitate their deployment. The variety Milan has resistance that is effective against the predominant stripe rust races in the Sichuan region. Two resistant and two susceptible F-8 lines from a cross between Milan and the susceptible variety Chuannong 16 were used to investigate inheritance of the Milan resistance. Three F-2 populations were developed from crosses between the resistant lines and their susceptible sibling lines (LM168a x LM168c, LM168c x LM168a, LM168b x LM168d) and used for genetic analysis and molecular mapping of the genes for resistance. The stripe rust resistance in LM168a and LM168b was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrLM168a. Forty-five extreme susceptible plants from the F-2 families of LM168d x LM168b were genotyped with 836 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to map YrLM168a. YrLM168a was mapped in chromosome 6BL. The nearest flanking markers Xwmc756 and Xbarc146 were 4.6 and 4.6 cM away from the gene at both sides, respectively. The amplification results of twenty extreme resistant (IT 0) and susceptible (IT 4) F-2 plants of LM168c x LM168a and LM168a x LM168c with marker Xwmc756 further validated the mapping results. The study suggested that extreme individuals and recessive phenotype class can be successfully used for mapping genes, which should be efficient and reliable. In addition, the flanking markers near YrLM168a should be helpful in marker-assisted breeding.

There is no reliable method to identify coenurus infected goats in the early period of infection. Methods: We identified a full-length cDNA that encodes acidic ribosomal protein P2 from the transcriptome of T. multiceps (TmP2). Following cloning, sequencing and structural analyses were performed using bioinformatics tools. Recombinant TmP2 (rTmP2) was prokaryotically expressed and then used to test immunoreactivity and immunogenicity in immunoblotting assays. The native proteins in adult stage and coenurus were located via immunofluorescence assays, while the potential of rTmP2 for indirect ELISA-based serodiagnostics was assessed using native goat sera. In addition, 20 goats were randomly divided into a drug treatment group and a control group. Each goat was orally given mature, viable T. multiceps eggs. The drug treatment group was given 10 % praziquantel by intramuscular injection 45 days post-infection (p.i), and all goats were screened for anti-TmP2 antibodies with the indirect ELISA method established here, once a week for 17 weeks p.i. Results: The open reading frame (366 bp) of the target gene encodes a 12.62 kDa protein, which showed high homology to that from Taenia solium (93 % identity) and lacked a signal peptide. Immunofluorescence staining showed that TmP2 was highly localized to the parenchymatous zone of both the adult parasite and the coenurus; besides, it was widely distributed in cystic wall of coenurus. Building on good immunogenic properties, rTmP2-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 95.0 % (19/20) and a specificity of 96.3 % (26/27) in detecting anti-P2 antibodies in the sera of naturally infected goats and sheep. In goats experimentally infected with T. multiceps, anti-TmP2 antibody was detectable in the control group from 3 to 10 weeks and 15 to 17 weeks p.i. In the drug-treated group, the anti-TmP2 antibody dropped below the cut-off value about 2 weeks after treatment with praziquantel and remained below this critical value until the end of the experiment. Conclusion: The indirect ELISA method developed in this study has the potential for detection of T. multiceps infections in hosts.

In order to explore these applications, a pot experiment was carried out to research the effect of biochar on the heavy metal speciation in paddy soil and the heavy metal accumulation of paddy rice from Chengdu plain, Sichuan Province. The experimental results show that wine lees-derived biochar can efficiently increase soil pH, decrease the contents of soil exchangeable heavy metals, and promote heavy metal transformation to residual fraction. Moreover, application of biochar can reduce the accumulation of heavy metals in paddy plant, decrease the migration ability of heavy metals to the aboveground part of the plant, and consequently cut down contents of heavy metals in rice. When biochar dosage was 0.5 % in weight, the contents of soil exchangeable Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd decreased 18.8, 29.6, 26.3, 23.0, 23.01, and 48.14 %, respectively, which all significantly differed from CK (P<0.05), and the contents of heavy metals in plant roots, stems, leaves, rice husk, and rice all decreased accordingly, among which Zn, Cd, and Pb decreased 10.96, 8.89, and 8.33 % respectively. When biochar dosage increased to 1 %, heavy metal contents in roots, stems, leaves, rice husk, and rice decreased further. Therefore, wine lees-derived biochar shows a great potential in remediation of heavy-metal-polluted soil, and this work provides theoretical basis for restoring heavy-metal-polluted soil using biochar.

Assessing the contribution of these two processes to release budgets is important to predicting plant/mineral interactions and soil sustainability. Three NEK extraction methods, 1 M boiling nitric acid (HNO3), 2 M hot hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 0.2 M sodium tetraphenylboron (NaTPB), were applied to investigate the mechanisms of NEK release from trioctahedral biotite and dioctahedral muscovite. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to investigate the surface morphology and transformation of mica, respectively. NEK released from biotite and muscovite through cation-exchange reaction accounted for 87.88%, 85.93% and 8323%, 78.31% of the total extracted K when extracted by boiling HNO3 and hot HCl, respectively, with channel and elliptical dissolution pits on mica surface. NEK extracted by NaTPB was an almost complete cation-exchange reaction, and the extracted micas showed an obvious vermiculitic character and no dissolution features. Results showed the release of NEK from micas is essentially a cation-exchange reactions in both acid and salt solutions, indicating that NEK released through cation-exchange reaction but not via dissolution may make up the main soil K pool available to plant.

Sodium acetate-antibiotic treatment was used to isolate the strains, and scanning electron microscopy was used to identify crystal morphology. Diversity was observed in the protein and cry gene profiles, and most of the isolated Bt strains produced 130, 90, 80, 70, 66, and 45 kDa protein bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of these isolates identified 14 cry genotypes and 30 different genotype combinations. Several novel cry fragments were discovered using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and five novel full-length cry genes-cry1Hc1, cry1Ie5, cry30Ea4, cry54Ba2, and cry56Aa4-were cloned. The analysis of insecticidal activity indicated that the majority of the isolates had high activity against Ostrinia furnacalis larvae; the cloned novel genes cry1Hc1 and cry1Ie5 conferred high activity against Ostrinia furnacalis larvae. Forty isolates did not yield PCR products, and eight of these had activity against Ostrinia furnacalis larvae. The results suggest that the genetic resources are rich in these isolates, which have the potential for future use as insecticides.

ELEGANS; CALORIC RESTRICTION; HISTONE H3; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEDIATES LONGEVITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SIGNALING PATHWAY	Aging is a long-standing problem that people are always interested in. Thus, it is critical to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in aging and explore the most efficient method to extend life expectancy. To achieve this goal, a wide range of systems including cells, rodent models, budding yeast, worms and flies have been employed for decades. In recent years, the effect of dietary restriction (DR) on lifespan is in the prime focus. Although we have confirmed that reduced insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling can increase Drosophila lifespan; the precise molecular mechanisms and nutritional response landscape of diet-mediated aging is ambiguous. Epigenetic events have been considered as the major contributors to lifespan extension with response to DR. The role of DNA methylation in aging is well acknowledged in mammals and rodents where it has been shown to impact aging by regulating the transcription, though the mechanism of regulation is not limited to only transcription. In Drosophila, the contribution of methylation during DR in aging is definitely less explored. In this review, we will update the advances in mechanisms of DR, with a particular focus on methylation as an upcoming target for aging studies and discuss Drosophila as a powerful model to understand mechanisms of aging with response to diet.

The results showed that relative amounts (RAs) of the most detected VAs were firstly increased to maximum values in oil samples collected at the second hour of the seventh day and the values were then decreased with the increase in the time of oil heating process (control). However, for food frying processes, the time needed for reaching maximum RAs of VAs was shorter and the values were decreased with the increase in frying time. Significant change in contents of the VAs was observed for oil samples fried with CBM due to the high contents of water, protein, and lipid content compared to oil samples fried with WD. Based on the obtained results, free radical reaction, particularly positional isomerization and cis-trans isomerization, was deduced to occur when WD or CBM was fried in SBO. The relatively high RAs of VAs formed during the deep-fat frying process presented certain invaluable measures for evaluating of frying oil and fried food quality and safety.

However, the changes in the FHC mRNA and protein levels in the HPG axis of geese remain to be determined. In the current study, FHC mRNA expression level was quantitatively monitored in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary and ovary stroma in prelaying and laying geese. In addition, the levels of FHC mRNA and protein were determined in follicles and ovarian stroma of laying geese. In comparison to prelaying geese, the FHC mRNA expression were 2.4, 1.8, and 13 times higher in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary and ovarian stroma of laying geese, respectively (p < 0.05). FHC mRNA and protein were detected in all examined follicles and ovarian stroma. FHC mRNA expression was higher in postovulatory follicles (POFs) and atretic follicles than in developing follicles and ovarian stroma. Furthermore, the FHC protein concentration in POF3 and atretic follicles were, respectively, 1.45 and 1.7 times higher compared with that of F1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the presented results provided evidence of a link between FHC and goose reproduction, and supplied a theoretical foundation and a new approach for studying reproduction, in particular ovarian follicular development in birds.

Chromatographic techniques were used to purify antimicrobial substances. Components with antimicrobial activity were analyzed by NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. Immunosuppressed mice were given crude protein extract or purified antimicrobial protein by gavage for 4 weeks, and serum cytokine levels were measured. Splenic lymphocyte proliferation assays were also performed. We obtained histone cluster 1, H2bc-like, which had antimicrobial activity. We termed this protein rabbit sacculus rotundus antimicrobial histone, according to its primary source. Sequence analysis and alignment suggested that EKTPVKKKARKSAGAAKRKA was a core segment of the protein mediating its antimicrobial activity. Treatment with high doses of the crude protein extract for 14, 21, and 28 days significantly increased interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels compared to the control. Interleukin (IL)-4 levels were also increased significantly on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 in the experimental group. Moreover, treatment with the crude protein extract stimulated a significant increase in lymphocyte proliferation on days 14 and 28. Administration of antimicrobial protein isolated from the rabbit sacculus rotundus to immunosuppressed mice increased serum IFN-gamma and IL-4 levels and induced lymphocyte proliferation, thereby promoting cellular immune function in immunosuppressed mice.

The optimal antigen, serum and enzyme-labeled antibody dilutions were 1:160 (0.94 mu g), 1:160 and 1:2000, respectively. The optimal blocking buffer was 1% gelatin. The cutoff value was determined to be 0.332, and the analytical sensitivity was 1:1280 (OD450-630 = 0.37). The results of the specificity evaluation showed that no crossreactivity existed between DHAV-1 antiserum and other common duck-sensitive pathogens, except for duck hepatitis A virus type 3 (DHAV-3), suggesting that this could be a common approach for the simultaneous detection of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 antibodies. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for all of the tested samples were lower than 10%. The concordance between the I-ELISA based on the VP3 subunit of DHAV-1 and that based on the whole DHAV-1 particle was 96%. These results indicate that the VP3-based I-ELISA method has high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability and is as effective as the DHAV-1-based I-ELISA method for sero-surveillance. Thus, it may be a convenient and novel method for DHAV antibody detection and epidemiological surveillance of DHAV prevalence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Young grass carp were fed diets containing 3.4 (basal diet), 6.1, 9.1, 11.5, 14.0 and 16.8 g phenylalanine kg(-1) diet with a fixed of 10.7 g tyrosine kg(-1) diet for 8 weeks. Percent weight gain (PWG), feed efficiency and feed intake of fish were the lowest in fish fed the basal diet (P < 0.05). Trypsin, lipase and amylase activities in the hepatopancreas, and antioxidants including glutathione contents and glutathione reducase activities in the hepatopancreas and intestine were all the highest in fish fed 11.5 g phenylalaninekg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase activities in whole intestine, and creatine kinase, Na+, K+-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase activities in the proximal intestine, and superoxide dismutase activities in the hepatopancreas and intestine were all the highest when phenylalanine at level of 9.1 g kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). In conclusion, phenylalanine improved growth, digestive and absorptive ability, and antioxidant capacity of young grass carp. The phenylalanine requirement of young grass carp (256-629 g) based on PWG was 10.4 g kg(-1) diet or 3.44 g 100 g(-1) protein.

Effects of dietary glutamate supplementation on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities and antioxidant capacity in intestine of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION			English	Article						antioxidant ability; glutamate; grass carp; growth; intestinal enzyme activity	SALMO-SALAR L.; JUVENILE JIAN; VAR. JIAN; GENE-EXPRESSION; HEPATOPANCREAS; PROTEIN; FISH; METABOLISM; TRYPSIN	A 56-day feeding trial was carried out to investigate the effect of dietary glutamate (Glu) supplementation on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities and intestinal antioxidant capacity of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 540 grass carp with average initial weight of 370 +/- 3.8 g were fed three diets supplemented with 0, 8 and 16 g kg(-1) Glu. The per cent weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, and protein and lipid productive value were significantly improved by dietary Glu supplementation. Feed intake, condition factor, visceral somatic index and perivisceral fat ratio were not significantly different between dietary groups. Hepatosomatic index, intestinal somatic index, intestine length index, intestine protein content, trypsin activity in hepatopancreas and intestine, lipase activity in proximal and mid-intestine (MI) and hepatopancreas, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities in intestine, creatine kinase activities in the mid- and distal intestine, intestinal folds height in the proximal and MI were significantly increased with increased Glu. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in the intestine decreased with increased Glu. Superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, glutathione reducase, catalase and total superoxide dismutase activities, and glutathione content in the intestine were increased with increased Glu. These results suggested that dietary Glu supplementation increased intestinal antioxidant capacity, digestive and absorptive ability and improved fish growth.

Four N treatment levels-control (no N added), low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), and high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) a(-1))-were applied monthly in the P. amarus plantation starting in November 2007. In June 2012, we collected intact soil cores in the bamboo plantation and conducted a 30-day laboratory incubation experiment. The results showed that the soil N net mineralization rate was 0.96 +/- A 0.10 mg N kg(-1) day(-1), under control treatment. N additions stimulated the soil N net mineralization, and the high-N treatment significantly increased the soil N net mineralization rate compared with the control. Moreover, the soil N net mineralization rate was significantly and positively correlated with the fine root biomass, the soil microbial biomass nitrogen content and the soil initial inorganic N content, respectively, whereas it was negatively correlated with the soil pH value. There were no significant relationships between the soil N net mineralization rate and the soil total nitrogen (TN) content and the soil total organic carbon content and the soil C/N ratio and the soil microbial biomass carbon content, respectively. These results suggest that N additions would improve the mineral N availability in the topsoil of the P. amarus plantation through the effects of N additions on soil chemical and physical characteristics and fine-root biomass.

B. Ellis. We used shaking culture in a modified Fries culture medium and methanol extraction to isolate the toxin. The optimal developing solvent mixture (methanol: ethyl acetate: H2O at 7:1.5:3) was selected using thin layer chromatography and used as the eluent for toxin purification by silica gel column chromatography. Two toxic fractions were identified in the bioassay. A flaxen oil substance, AP-I, showed higher toxicity than a toxic white powder, AP-II. The more toxic AP-I was determined to be dibutyl phthalate (C16H22O4, molecular weight of 278) by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectrophotometry. Dibutyl phthalate might contribute to the pathogenesis of bamboo blight.

We studied the mechanical properties of the BFRCs manufactured from the mats with and without bamboo nodes. The presence of nodes in BFM greatly reduced tensile strength, compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and modulus of rupture of the BFRCs, while the BFRCs fabricated from BFMs with nodes possessed higher horizontal shear strength. Therefore, the nodes in bamboo culms were an important factor in the uniform distribution of mechanical properties, and BFMs should be homogeneously arranged to reduce the impact of nodes on the mechanical strengths of BFRCs.

Higher plants contain many tetrapyrroles, including chlorophyll (Chl), heme, siroheme, phytochromobilin and some of their precursors, all of which have important biological functions. Genetic and physiological studies indicated that tetrapyrrole (mainly Mg-protoporphyrin IX) retrograde signals control photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene (PhANG) expression. Recent studies have shown that tetrapyrrole-derived signals may correlate with plant resistance to environmental stresses such as drought, high-light stress, water stress, osmotic stress, salinity and heavy metals. Signaling and physiological roles of Mg-protoIX-binding proteins (such as PAPP5, CRD and HSP90) and heme-binding proteins (such as HO and TSPO) and tetrapyrrole-signaling components (such as GUN1, ABI4 and CBFA) are summarized. Some of them positively regulate plant development and response to environmental stresses. The intermediate signaling components (such as PTM, HSP70-HSP90-HAP1 complex and PAPP5) between the nucleus and the plastid also positively regulate plant resistance to environmental stresses. This review provides new insights that genetically modified plants with enhanced tetrapyrrole levels have improved resistance to environmental stresses.

Phospholipase D alpha (PLD alpha) hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid, and plays crucial role in plant tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, a phospholipase D alpha gene (AnPLD alpha) was cloned from xerophyte Ammopiptanthus nanus by the methods of homologous cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and evaluated for its function in stress tolerance. The full-length cDNA was 2832 bp long, containing an open reading frame of 2427 bp that encodes 808 amino acids. The putative protein was predicted to be localized to the cytoplasm and this was confirmed by transient expression of a fluorescent fusion protein. The endogenous expression of the AnPLD alpha gene was induced by high salt, dehydration, cold and abscisic acid. The heterologous expression of the AnPLD alpha gene improved salt tolerance of an Arabidopsis pld alpha 1 knocked out mutant, and positively regulated the expression of the AtABI, AtNCED, AtRD29A, AtRD29B and AtADH genes. Therefore, the AnPLD alpha gene was concluded to be involved in response to abiotic stress. The AnPLD alpha gene is a hopeful candidate for transgenic application to improve stress tolerance of commercial crops.

Their chemical compositions were investigated. The PM2.5 concentrations in the cooking samples were 2.5-9.6 times higher than those in the corresponding backgrounds. Meat roasting produced the highest amount of PM2.5. In general, charbroilings emitted more PM2.5 than the other cooking activities because of the characteristics of cooking method and fuel type. High organic carbon (OC) contents (>53% of PM2.5) and OC/EC ratios (>54) in meat roasting and cafeteria frying samples suggest that oils and high-fat raw materials significantly affect the PM2.5 and OC emissions. However, the cooking activity was proved to be a minor source for elemental carbon (EC) with its low contents in all of the samples. High ion compositions in PM2.5 and WSOC/OC ratios in the snack-street boiling and cafeteria boiling samples represent that water-based cooking emitted more water-soluble species. Considering that high OC/EC ratios were measured in the oil-based cooking samples and most secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) are water soluble, it is more reasonable to estimate SOA with WSOC/OC ratio in populated urban areas. We found that the formation of SOA is significant when the WSOC/OC ratio is larger than 0.40. Principal component analysis (PCA) with the quantified metals identified four contributors to the samples, including coal combustion and non-licensed business activities, soil dust, charcoal burning, and stainless steel utensils, and explained 73% of the total variance. The high emissions of PM2.5 and toxic components from the cooking activities suggest that food safety control and environmental standard establishment should be strengthened in small and medium-sized cities in China.

Jian) in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro. In primary enterocytes, exposure to 10 mg lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/l increased lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture medium (P < 0.05) and resulted in a significant loss of cell viability (P < 0.05). LPS exposure increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8), which was decreased by pre-treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D3) in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Further results showed that pre-treatment with 1,25D3 downregulated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) and NF-kappa B p65 mRNA expression (P < 0.05), suggesting potential mechanisms against LPS-induced inflammatory response. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of LPS significantly increased TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in the intestine of carp (P < 0.05). Pre-treatment of fish with vitamin D3 protected the fish intestine from the LPS-induced increase of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 mainly by downregulating TLR4, Myd88 and NF-kappa B p65 mRNA expression (P< 0.05). These observations suggest that vitamin D could inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response in juvenile Jian carp in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro. The anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D is mediated at least in part by TLR4-Myd88 signalling pathways in the intestine and enterocytes of juvenile Jian carp.

The results showed that an 80 g/kg diet of glycinin exposure for 42 d caused poor growth performance and depressed intestinal growth and function of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). Meanwhile, dietary glycinin exposure induced increases in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation; it caused reductions in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities; and it increased MnSOD, CuZnSOD, GPx1b and GPx4a mRNA levels, suggesting an adaptive mechanism against stress in the intestines of fish. However, dietary glycinin exposure decreased both the activity and mRNA levels of nine isoforms of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (alpha, mu, pi, rho, theta, kappa, mGST1, mGST2 and mGST3), indicating toxicity to this enzyme activity and corresponding isoform gene expressions. In addition, glycinin exposure caused partial disruption of intestinal cell-cell tight junction components, disturbances of cytokines and induced apoptosis signalling in the distal intestines > mid intestines > proximal intestines of fish. Glycinin exposure also disturbed the mRNA levels of intestinal-related signalling factors Nrf2, Keap1a, Keap1b, eleven isoforms of protein kinase C and target of rapamycin/4E-BP. Interestingly, glutamine was observed to partially block those negative influences. In conclusion, this study indicates that dietary glycinin exposure causes intestinal oxidative damage and disruption of intestinal physical barriers and functions and reduces fish growth, but glutamine can reverse those negative effects in fish. This study provides some information on the mechanism of glycinin-induced negative effects.

Questions such as: why do AIVs infect humans?, how quickly can an AIV become pandemic?, and which virus is the most dangerous? cannot be sufficiently answered using current bioinformatic studies. Method: Secondary structures and energies of representative 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the HA gene were calculated. Then their secondary structures and energies were re-calculated after one or two nucleotide substitutions were introduced into the HA 5'-UTR. Phylogenetic trees on the basis of hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) amino acid sequences and HA 5'-UTR nucleotide sequences were constructed. The connection between the energy and translation efficiency of 5'-UTR was confirmed by in vitro coupled transcription/translation assay. Results: The simplicity of the secondary structure of the 5'-UTR of the HA gene determines the overall virus replication rate and transmission potential. Point mutation assays show that the 5'-UTR sequences of the HA gene in the influenza subtypes H2N2, H3N2, and H7N9 have greater variation potentials than other virus subtypes. Conclusion: Some high-virulent strains of avian influenza might emerge in the next two to three years. The H2N2 subtype, once disappeared in humans, may stage a comeback. The current outbreak of H7N9 may become pandemic and cause even more deaths, if one or two bases are substituted in the 5'-UTR sequence of the HA gene.

Nonetheless, there is little information on the UL54 protein of DEV. Methods: The UL54 gene was cloned into the pPAL7 vector, and the recombinant protein, expressed in the E. coli Rosetta, was used to produce a specific antibody. Using this antibody, Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) were used to analyze the expression level and intracellular localization, respectively, of UL54 in DEV-infected cells at different times. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the pharmacological inhibition test were utilized to ascertain the kinetic class of the UL54 gene. Results: UL54 was expressed as a fusion protein of approximately 66.0 kDa using the prokaryotic expression system, and this protein was used to generate the specific anti-UL54 antibody. The UL54 protein was initially diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasmic region; then, after 2 h, it gradually distributed into the nucleus, peaking at 24 h, and complete localization to the nucleus was observed thereafter. The UL54 transcript was detected as early as 0.5 h, and peak expression was observed at 24 h. The UL54 gene was insensitive to the DNA polymerase inhibitor Ganciclovir (GCV) and the protein synthesis inhibitor Cycloheximide (CHX), both of which confirmed that UL54 was an immediate early gene. Conclusions: The DEV UL54 gene was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and characterized for expression level, intracellular localization and gene kinetic class. We propose that these results will provide the foundation for further functional analyses of this gene.

Fish growth, and muscle nutrient (protein, fat and amino acid) content of young grass carp were significantly improved by appropriate dietary choline. Furthermore, muscle hydroxyproline concentration, lactate content and shear force were improved by optimum dietary choline supplementation. However, the muscle pH value, cooking loss and cathepsins activities showed an opposite trend. Additionally, optimum dietary choline supplementation attenuated muscle oxidative damage in grass carp. The muscle antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione reductase did not change) activities and glutathione content were enhanced by optimum dietary choline supplementation. Muscle cooking loss was negatively correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione content. At the gene level, these antioxidant enzymes, as well as the targets of rapamycin, casein kinase 2 and NF-E2-related factor 2 transcripts in fish muscle were always up-regulated by suitable choline. However, suitable choline significantly decreased Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 a (Keap1a) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 b (Keap1b) mRNA levels in muscle. In conclusion, suitable dietary choline enhanced fish flesh quality, and the decreased cooking loss was due to the elevated antioxidant status that may be regulated by Nrf2 signaling.

Its synthesis is orchestrated by several key enzymes, and the amount and structure of starch, affecting crop yield and quality, are determined mainly by starch synthase (SS) activity. To date, five SS isoforms, including SSI-IV and Granule Bound Starch Synthase (GBSS) have been identified and their physiological functions have been well characterized. Here, we report the identification of a new SS isoform in maize, designated SSV. By searching sequenced genomes, SSV has been found in all green plants with conserved sequences and gene structures. Our phylogenetic analysis based on 780 base pairs has suggested that SS/V and SSV resulted from a gene duplication event, which may have occurred before the algae formation. An expression profile analysis of SSV in maize has indicated that ZrnSSV is mainly transcribed in the kernel and ear leaf during the grain filling stage, which is partly similar to other SS isoforms. Therefore, it is likely that SSV may play an important role in starch biosynthesis. Subsequent analysis of SSV function may facilitate understanding the mechanism of starch granules formation, number and structure.

The pituitary plays a vital role in this process by the secretion of reproductive hormones. To investigate the effects of nutrient restriction on reproductive function and the underlying mechanisms involved, deep RNA sequencing of pituitary gland tissue was carried out to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between gilts in normal estrus, and gilts in which anestrus was induced by nutrient restriction. Gilts which had gone through two estrus cycles were fed a normal (CON, 2.86kg/d, n = 10) or nutrient restricted (NR, 1kg/d, n = 10) diet. The NR gilts experienced another three estrus cycles, but did not express estrus symptoms at the anticipated 6th and 7th cycles. Body weight gain in NR gilts was significantly decreased by nutrient restriction. Gilts were considered as anestrus when blood progesterone concentrations lower than 1.0 ng/mL from three consecutive blood samples were recorded. Circulating concentrations of progesterone (< 1.0 ng/mL vs. 2.1 ng/mL) and estradiol (208.6 ng/mL vs. 371.8 ng/mL) were significantly lower in the NR gilts than in the CON gilts. Between 5,360,000 and 5,370,000 sequence reads per sample from the CON and NR gilts' pituitaries were obtained and mapped to the porcine genome. Analysis of read counts revealed 185 DEGs. Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RTPCR. Bioinformatic analysis identified that the genes identified were enriched in the GO terms "neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction", "GnRH signaling pathway" and "immune response system". Our findings provide a new perspective for understanding the nutrient restriction-induced reproductive impairment at the pituitary transcriptional level, and how this is linked to hormone secretion. Moreover, the transcriptomic changes in anestrus gilts associated with nutrient restriction could be a resource for targeted studies of genes and pathways potentially involved in the regulation of reproductive function and animal health.

Using our previously established approach, the interplay of flow rate and particle size on the NOM effect was quantified, using flow rates of 1 and 2 mL/min and particle sizes of 50 and 200 nm to represent small nanoparticles (1-100 nm) and large non-nano-microspheres (100-1000 nm) in the low-flow groundwater environment. Latex particles, Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA), and iron oxide-coated sand were used as model particles, NOM, and the aquifer medium, respectively. The quantitative results show NOM blocked more sites for large particles at a high flow rate: 1 mu g of SRHA blocked 5.95 X 10(9) microsphere deposition sites at 2 mL/min but only 7.38 X 10(8) nanoparticle deposition sites at 1 mL/min. The particle size effect dominated over the flow rate, and the overall effect of the two is antagonistic. Granule-scale visualization of the particle packing on the NOM-presented sand surface corroborates the quantification results, revealing a more dispersed status of large particles at a high flow rate. We interpret this phenomenon as a polydispersivity effect resulting from the differential size of the particles and NOM: high flow and a high particle size enlarge the ratio of particle-blocked to NOM-blocked areas and thus the NOM blockage.

In this study, we generate 11 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against S1 subunit of IBV Sczy3 strain, and two mAbs 105 and 6A12 were positive in indirect ELISA against both His-S1 protein and the purified whole viral antigen. MAb 6A12 and 1D5 could recognized by other 10 IBV strains (IBVs) from five different genotypes, except that 1D5 had a relatively low reaction with two of the 10 tested IBVs. End-point neutralizing assay performed in chicken embro kidney (CEK) cells revealed that the neutralization titer of 6A12 and 1D5 against Sczy3 reached 1:44.7 and 1:40.6, respectively. After screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning, we identified two linear B-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mAbs 1D5 and 6A12, which corresponded to the amino acid sequences (87)PPQGMAW(93) and (412)IQTRTEP(418), respectively, in the IBV S1 subunit. Sequences comparison revealed that epitope (412)IQTRTEP(418) was conserved among IBVs, while the epitope (87)PPQGMAW(93) was relatively variable among IBVs. The novel mAbs and the epitopes identified will be useful for developing diagnostic assays for IBV infections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Glu-1 Ay allele is silent in common wheat. In this study, an active y-type HMW-GS allele termed lAy8.2 (GenBank No. KP137569) was identified from Triticum monococcum L ssp. monococcum (A(m)A(m) 2n = 2x = 14), a species with a genome related to the A-genome of common wheat. Compared with previously reported active 1Ay subunits, this novel subunit contained an extra cysteine residue at position 103 of the amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region, in addition to the six cysteines in the N- and C-terminal regions found in most active lAy subunits and the one in the repetitive region that appears in only a few lAy alleles. This subunit was expressed in an amphiploid (AAA(m)A(m)BB, 2n = 6x = 42) between Triticum turgidum L ssp. dicoccon and T. monococcum ssp. monococcum. This amphiploid could be used as a bridge to transfer lAy8.2 into common wheat cultivars. Replacing the silenced lAy in common wheat with the active 1Ay82 allele harboring an extra cysteine residue is expected to improve the quality by increasing the number of HMW-GSs and promoting the formation of covalent interactions through disulfide bonds with the extra cysteine residue.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood, particularly in goat. Here, we identified goat miR-101a as a novel myogenic microRNA mediating myogenic differentiation. The expression of miR-101a was enriched in goat skeletal muscles and up-regulated during satellite cell differentiation. After transfection with a miR-101a mimic and culturing in differentiation medium, satellite cell differentiation was promoted, accompanied by a significant increase in mRNA expression of the myogenic marker, MyoG, and decreased expression of MyoD. In contrast, blocking the function of miR-101a with a 2'-O-methylated antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor repressed satellite cell differentiation. However, both gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that miR-101a had no significant influence on satellite cell proliferation. Therefore, our results provide a new insight on miR-101a in the regulation of goat skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little known is how to manage phosphorus (P) to enhance P use efficiency of the W/M/S system and to mitigate P leaching that is a major source of pollution. Field experiments were carried out in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to test the impact of five P application rates on yield and P use efficiency of the W/M/S system. The study measured grain yield, shoot P uptake, apparent P recovery efficiency (PRE) and soil P content. A linear-plateau model was used to determine the critical P rate that maximizes gains in the indexes of system productivity. The results show that increase in P application rates aggrandized shoot P uptake and crops yields at threshold rates of 70 and 71.5 kg P ha(-1) respectively. With P application rates increasing, the W/M/S system decreased the PRE from 35.9% to 12.3% averaged over the three years. A rational P application rate, 72 kg P ha(-1), or an appropriate soil Olsen-P level, 19.1 mg kg(-1), drives the W/M/S system to maximize total grain yield while minimizing P surplus, as a result of the PRE up to 28.0%. We conclude that rational P application is an important approach for relay intercropping to produce high yield while mitigating P pollution and the rational P application-based integrated P fertilizer management is vital for sustainable intensification of agriculture in the Southwest of China.

Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, exerts prolongevity effects in evolutionarily diverse species. However, its impact on the intestinal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin can slow down the proliferation rate of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the aging guts and induce autophagy in the intestinal epithelium in Drosophila. Rapamycin can also significantly affect the FOXO associated genes in intestine and up-regulate the negative regulators of IMD/Rel pathway, consequently delaying the microbial expansion in the aging guts. Collectively, these findings reveal that rapamycin can delay the intestinal aging by inhibiting mTOR and thus keeping stem cell proliferation in check. These results will further explain the mechanism of healthspan and lifespan extension by rapamycin in Drosophila.

In this study, cold storage contributes to reducing endogenous ABA content, resulting in dormancy breaking of Gladiolus. The ABA inhibitor fluridone also promotes germination, suggesting that ABA is an important hormone that regulates corm dormancy. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the Gladiolus ABI5 homolog (GhABI5), which is a basic leucine zipper motif transcriptional factor (TF). GhABI5 is expressed in dormant vegetative organs (corm, cormel, and stolon) as well as in reproductive organs (stamen), and it is up-regulated by ABA or drought. Complementation analysis reveals that GhABI5 rescues the ABA insensitivity of abi5-3 during seed germination and induces the expression of downstream ABA response genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (EM1, EM6, and RD29B). Down-regulation of GhABI5 in dormant cormels via virus induced gene silence promotes sprouting and reduces the expression of downstream genes (G17LEA and GhR0298). The results of this study reveal that GhABI5 regulates bud dormancy (vegetative organ) in Gladiolus in addition to its well-studied function in Arabidopsis seeds (reproductive organ).

Adenophorum in relation to the cell cycle and apoptosis of splenocytes in Saanen goats remains unclear. In the present study, 16 Saanen goats were randomly divided into four groups, which were fed on 0%, 40%, 60% and 80% E. adenophorum diets. The results of TUNEL, DAPI and AO/EB staining, flow cytometry analysis and DNA fragmentation assays showed that E. adenophorum induced typical apoptotic features in splenocytes, suppressed splenocyte viability, and caused cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. However, westernblot, ELISA, qRT-PCR and caspase activity analyses showed that E. adenophoruminhibited Bcl-2 expression, promoted Bax translocation to the mitochondria, triggered the release of Cytc from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and activated caspase-9 and -3 and the subsequent cleavage of PARP. Moreover, in E. adenophorum-induced apoptosis, the protein levels of Fas, Bid, FasL and caspase- 8 showed no significant changes. E. adenophorum treatment induced the collapse of Delta Psi m. Moreover, these data suggested that E. adenophorum induces splenocyte apoptosis via the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in splenocytes. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of E. adenophorum cytotoxicity on splenocytes.

The experimental results showed that the sludge reduction efficiency was 32.9% and the observed growth yield (Y-obs) of SBR was 0.11 kg VSS (volatile suspended solids) /kg COD (chemical oxygen demand) for 80 days' operation at the optimum ClO2 dosage of 2.0 mg/g TSS (total suspended solids). It was speculated that cell lysis and cryptic growth, uncoupled metabolism and endogenous metabolism were jointly responsible for the sludge reduction in this study. COD, NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the effluent increased on average 29.47, 4.44, 1.97 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively. However, the effluent quality still satisfied the first-class B discharge standards for municipal wastewater treatment plants in China. In that case, the sludge maintained fine viability with the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) being 14.47 mg O2(/)(g VSS.h) and demonstrated good settleability with the sludge volume index (SVI) being 116 mL/g. The extra cost of sludge reduction at the optimum ClO2 dosage was estimated to be 2.24 CNY (or 0.36 dollar)/kg dry sludge.

The present study investigated the anti-aging and thermal stress resistance effects of polysaccharides from P. notoginseng on Caenorhabditis elegans. Results showed polysaccharides had little scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro, but significantly extended lifespan of C. elegans, especially the main root polysaccharide (MRP) which prolongs the mean lifespan of wild type worms by 21%. Further study demonstrated that the heat stress resistance effect of polysaccharides on C. elegans might be attributed to the elevation of antioxidant enzyme activities (both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)) and the reduction lipid peroxidation of malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Taken together, the results provided a scientific basis for the further exploitation of the mechanism of longer lifespan controlled by P. notoginseng polysaccharides on C. elegans. The P. notoginseng polysaccharides might be considered as a potential source to delay aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A novel TMUV isolate (named CQW1) was separated from the liver tissue of a young duck in Southwest China. The CQW1 isolate proliferated in embryonated duck eggs and led to death within 3-4 days post-inoculation. Furthermore, CQW1 replicated in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells and caused a cytopathic effect (CPE). The disease emerged on a duck farm in Southwest China and was reproduced by animal experiment. We found that CQW1 was detectable by RT-PCR in brain and liver tissues of dead ducklings within 5 days after inoculation. Most importantly, concentrated nuclei, neuronophagia and microglial nodules were observed in the brain tissue of the inoculated ducklings, and additionally, the liver tissue was affected, mainly by disordered lobular architecture, degeneration, necrosis and regenerated hepatocytes. Analysis of the complete genome sequence showed that CQW1 was 10,992 nt in length with two nucleotide insertions and shared 96.8 % to 99.1 % and 98.4 % to 99.6 % identity at nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively, with Chinese isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences demonstrated that the CQW1 isolate was closely related to other members of the genus Flavivirus and formed a new clade together with the GX2013H isolate. Also, the CQW1 isolate demonstrated the highest average pairwise distance value among the Chinese isolates. In the present study, we obtained evidence that TMUV is present in Southwest China. Extensive pathological and epidemiological studies are urgently needed.

A total of 360 female mice were divided into nine groups. Each group received intraperitoneal injection of solvent (control), DON, ZEA, or DON + ZEA four times for 12 d. Results showed that ZEA and/or DON increased the apoptosis rate in the kidney, as well as the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. DON and/or ZEA also induced renal oxidative stress as indicated by increased malondialdehyde concentration and nitric oxide level and reduced superoxide dismutase enzyme activity and hydroxyl radical inhibiting capacity. The observed changes were dose and time dependent. This study reports that DON and/or ZEA induced apoptosis, dysfunction, and oxidative stress in mouse kidney. Furthermore, the combination of DON + ZEA exhibited a sub-additive nephrotoxic effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In some individual burley tobacco plants, a large proportion of the nicotine can be converted to nornicotine, and this process of nicotine conversion is mediated primarily by enzymatic N-demethylation of nicotine which is controlled mainly by CYP82E4. Here we report a novel strategy based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method, which analyzed the ratio of nicotine conversion through examining the transcript level of CYP82E4 in burley leaves and do not need ethylene induction before detected. The assay was linear in a range from 1 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(5) copies/mL of serially diluted standards, and also showed high specificity and reproducibility (93%-99%). To assess its applicability, 55 plants of burley cultivar Ky8959 at leaf maturing stage were analyzed, and the results were in accordance with those from gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Moreover, a linear correlation existed between conversion level and CYP82E4 transcript abundance. Taken together, the quantitative real-time PCR assay is standardized, rapid and reproducible for estimation of nicotine conversion level in vivo, which is expected to shed new light on monitoring of burley tobacco converter.

To fully elucidate different evolutions and functions of ROS-scavenging enzymatic genes, we isolated iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) from white clover for the first time and subsequently tested dynamic expression profiles of these genes together with previously identified other antioxidant enzyme genes including copper zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in response to cold, drought, salinity, cadmium stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) or spermidine (Spd) treatment. The cloned fragments of FeSOD, DHAR and MDHAR genes were 630, 471 and 669 bp nucleotide sequences encoding 210, 157 and 223 amino acids, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both amino acid and nucleotide sequences of these three genes are highly conservative. In addition, the analysis of genes expression showed the transcription of GR, POD, MDHAR, DHAR and Cu/ZnSOD were rapidly activated with relatively high abundance during cold stress. Differently, CAT, APX, FeSOD, Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD exhibited more abundant transcripts compared to others under drought stress. Under salt stress, CAT was induced preferentially (3-12 h) compared to GR which was induced later (12-72 h). Cadmium stress mainly up-regulated Cu/ZnSOD, DHAR and MDHAR. Interestingly, most of genes expression induced by ABA or Spd happened prior to various abiotic stresses. The particular expression patterns and different response time of these genes indicated that white clover differentially activates genes encoding antioxidant enzymes to mitigate the damage of ROS during various environmental stresses.

However, the lower cooling rate compared with vacuum-cooling has initiated numerous studies to improve this technique. Substantial efforts, such as combination of IVC with other cooling methods, using different initial water temperatures, or employment of agitation during IVC, have been made to optimize cooling parameters while also maintaining quality properties and complying with strict food safety requirements. This review presents and discusses the IVC evolution and recent developments directed at the ready-to-eat meat products industry. The principle of IVC and its applications are discussed first.

Two doses of prebiotic fiber with 0.2 or 2 % of the fibers are being mixed into fish feed pellets. Fish growth as well as selected non-specific immune parameters of grass carp were tested in a feeding trial, which lasted for 8 weeks. Fish was fed at 2.5 % body mass per day. INU02, INU2, and MOS2 significantly improved relative weight gain, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, and food conversion ratio of grass carp fed with food waste-based diet. In terms of non-specific immune response, grass carp showed significant improvement in all three tested parameters (total serum immunoglobin, bactericidal activity, and anti-protease activity). Adding 2 % of inulin (INU2) into food waste diets seemed to be more preferable than other supplemented experimental diets (INU02, MOS02, MOS2), as it could promote growth of grass carp as well as improving the non-specific immune systems of grass carp.

The methods used to investigate antimicrobial effects of disinfectant vary considerably among studies, making comparisons difficult. In this study, agar dilution and broth microdilution methods were used to compare the antimicrobial activities of four quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) against foodborne and zoonotic pathogens. The potential relationship between the presence of QACs resistance genes and phenotypic resistance to QACs was also investigated. Our results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by two methods might be different depended upon different QACs and bacteria applied. Regardless of the testing methods, Klebsiella pneumoniae was more tolerant among Gram-negative strains to four QACs, followed by Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The agreement between MICs obtained by the two methods was good, for benzalkonium chloride (78.15%), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) (82.35%), cetylpyridinium chloride (CTPC) (97.48%) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (99.16%), respectively. Among all Gram-negative bacteria, 94.55% (n=52) of qacE Delta 1-positive strains showed higher MICs (512 mgl(-1)) to CTAB. The qacE Delta 1 gene was highly associated (P<0.05) with the high MICs of QACs (>= 512 mgl(-1)). In addition, DDAC remained as the most effective disinfectant against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This is the first study that compared the agar dilution and broth microdilution methods to assess the antimicrobial activity of QACs. The study demonstrated the need to standardize method that would be used in evaluating QACs antimicrobial properties in the future.

Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is novel PCR method that can achieve high precision. Our study aimed to develop a sensitive assay utilizing ddPCR to detect PCV-2. Specificity of the assay was confirmed by the failure of amplification of DNA of other relevant viruses. The detection limit for ddPCR was 25 copies/L, a 4-fold greater sensitivity than TaqMan real-time PCR. Both methods showed a high degree of linearity (R-2 = similar to 1), although TaqMan real-time PCR showed less sensitivity than ddPCR for clinical detection. Our findings indicate that ddPCR might represent a promising platform for detecting PCV-2 viral loads.

Plant miRNAs have been involved in developmental processes and adaption to biotic and abiotic stresses in their environment. The banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) caused by Rhizoctonia solani is extremely harmful to maize. To investigate the functions of miRNAs under R. solani inoculation, miRNA expression in R. solani infected maize (Zea mays L.) was profiled using deep sequencing. In total, 41 significantly differentially expressed known miRNAs and 39 novel R. solani-responsive miRNAs were identified, of which 9 identified miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR, and 2 important miRNAs were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Target genes were also predicted for these R. solani-responsive miRNAs; most of these putative target genes encoded transcription factors and proteins associated with metabolic processes or stress responses. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of several target genes that negatively correlated with the levels of corresponding miRNAs under R. solani inoculation were validated by qRT-PCR. These findings hypothesized that these miRNAs play an important role in R. solani resistance in maize, highlighting novel molecular mechanisms of R. solani resistance in plants.

A total of 1080 juvenile grass carp with an average initial weight of 9.34 +/- 0.03 g were fed six semi-purified diets containing 0.40% (unsupplemented control group), 1.43%, 2.38%, 3.29%, 4.37% and 5.42% PL for 2 months. Results indicated that 3.29% PL increased lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities and complement component 3 (C3) content (P < 0.05), upregulated the mRNA relative expression levels of interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1 inhibitor protein kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha), target of rapamycin (TOR) and casein ldnase 2 (CK2) (P < 0.05), and down-regulated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), I kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta) and I kappa B kinase gamma (IKK gamma) mRNA relative expression levels (P < 0.05) in the intestine, suggesting that optimum PL could improve fish intestinal immunity. In addition, 3.29% PL increased the activities of anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxyl radical, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), the content of glutathione (P < 0.05), and the mRNA relative expression levels of occludin, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), claudin 3, claudin 12, claudin b, claudin c, SOD1, GPx, GR and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) and ROS content (P < 0.05), the mRNA relative expression levels of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keap1a), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in the intestine, indicating that the optimum PL could improve fish intestinal physical barrier. Finally, based on the PWG, C3 content in the DI, ACP activity in the DI, intestinal PC content and intestinal ASA activity, the optimal dietary PL levels for juvenile grass carp (9.34-87.50 g) were estimated to be 3.46%, 3.79%, 3.93%, 3.72%, and 4.12%, respectively.

Young grass carp (Ctenophatyngodon idella) were fed diets containing graded levels of folic acid at 0.10 (basal diet), 0.47, 1.03, 1.48, 1.88 and 3.12 mg kg(-1) diet for 8 weeks. The results showed that acid phosphatase and lysozyme activities and the complement component 3 content in fish gills decreased with folic acid deficiency (P < 0.05). Folic acid deficiency up-regulated liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 1, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, nuclear factor kappa B p65, I kappa B kinase alpha (IKK-alpha), IKK-beta and IKK-gamma gene expression. Folic acid deficiency down-regulated interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta, I kappa B and target of rapamycin gene expression in fish gills (P < 0.05). These results showed that limited folic acid decreased fish gill immune status. Furthermore, folic acid deficiency down-regulated claudin-b, claudin-c, claudin-3, occludin and zonula occludens 1 gene expression, whereas folic acid deficiency up-regulated claudin-12, claudin-15, myosin light chain kinase and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase gene expression in fish gills (P < 0.05). These results suggested that folic acid deficiency disrupted tight junction-mediated fish gill barrier function. Additionally, folic acid deficiency increased the content of reactive oxygen species, protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde (MDA); Mn superoxide dismutase activity and gene expression; and Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keap1a) and Keap1b gene expression (P < 0.05). Conversely, folic acid deficiency decreased Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione s-transferases and glutathione reductase activities and gene expression as well as NF-E2-related factor 2 gene expression in fish gills (P < 0.05). All of these results indicated that folic acid deficiency impaired fish gill health status via regulating gene expression of cytokines, tight junction proteins, antioxidant enzymes, NF-kappa B p65, MLCK and Nrf2. Based on percent weight gain, LZ activity and MDA content in the gills, the dietary folic acid requirements for young grass carp were 1.60, 2.07 and 2.08 mg kg(-1), respectively.

JIAN; GENE-EXPRESSION; BARRIER FUNCTION; EPINEPHELUS-COIOIDES; SIGNALING MOLECULES; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; OXIDATIVE STRESS	This study investigated the effects of riboflavin on intestinal immunity, tight junctions and antioxidant status of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were fed diets containing graded levels of riboflavin (0.63-10.04 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks. The study indicated that riboflavin deficiency decreased lysozyme, acid phosphatase, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and contents of complement component 3 and reduced glutathione in the intestine of fish (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, riboflavin deficiency increased reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents and catalase activity (P < 0.05) in the intestine of fish. Furthermore, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to investigate mRNA expression patterns and found that the mRNA levels of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor beta 1, Occludin, zonula occludens 1, Claudin-b and Claudin-c, inhibitor protein kappa B alpha, target of rapamycin, ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 and NF-E2-related factor 2, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were decreased (P < 0.05) in the intestine of fish fed riboflavin-deficient diet. Conversely, the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 8, nuclear factor kappa B p65, Ikappa B kinase beta, Ikappa B kinase gamma, Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1b, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase and Claudin-12 were increased (P < 0.05) in the intestine of fish fed riboflavindeficient diet. In conclusion, riboflavin deficiency decreased immunity and structural integrity of fish intestine. The optimum riboflavin level for intestinal acid phosphatase activity of young grass carp was estimated to be 6.65 mg/kg diet. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that compared with optimal PA supplementation, PA deficiency (1.31 mg/kg diet) decreased gill interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta 1, inhibitor of kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha), eIF4E-binding protein 2, Claudin b and ZO-1 mRNA levels; anti-superoxide anion activity, and activities and mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and NF-E2-related factor (P < 0.05). Additionally, PA deficiency and excess (75.08 mg/kg diet) decreased gill complement 3 and glutathione contents, lysozyme and acid phosphatase, anti-hydroxy radical, catalase and glutathione S-transferases activities, and liver-expression antimicrobial peptide 2, hepcidin, Claudin 3, Claudin c and Occludin mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, PA deficiency increased gill reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyl contents, and interferon gamma 2, interleukin 8, nuclear factor kappa B P65, Claudin 15a, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a and Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1b mRNA levels (P <0.05). Moreover, PA deficiency and excess increased gill malondialdehyde content, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, I kappa B kinase alpha, I kappa B kinase beta, I kappa B kinase gamma, target of rapamycin and ribosomal S6 protein kinase1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PA deficiency decreased immune and physical barrier function, and regulated relative mRNA levels of signaling molecules in fish gill. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of gill lysozyme activity, the optimal PA levels in grass carp (253.44-745.25 g) were estimated to be 36.97 mg/kg diet. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Seeds	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Antioxidant enzyme; Germination rate; Isoenzyme pattern; Malondialdehyde	STRESS	The effects of different storage temperatures and times on germination rate, MalonDiAldehyde (MDA), SuperOxide Dismutase (SOD), PerOxiDase (POD) and Catalase (CAT) activities in Jatropha curcas L. seed were investigated. The results showed that germination rates of seeds stored at room temperature and 4 degrees C for 1 month was significantly higher than those stored for 3 months at -20 and -80 degrees C. MDA contents increased significantly for 1 and 3 months storage with decreasing temperatures. SOD activity decreased gradually down to -80 degrees C for 1 and 3 months storage. POD activity fluctuated slightly for 1 month, but increased apparently for 3 months storage with decreasing temperatures. CAT activity declined rapidly as storage temperatures decreased, particularly for 3 months storage. A significant interaction of storage temperatures and times was found for the activity of SOD and POD, and there was no significant interaction on germination rate, MDA content, and CAT activity. Electrophoretic analysis showed that the observed changes of SOD, POD and CAT isoenzyme bands under different storage temperatures were consistent with the changes of enzyme activities assayed in extract solutions. These results suggested that SOD, POD, and CAT may be involved in regulating the level of reactive oxygen species under different storage temperatures and times.

In this study, we investigated the association between the TYK2, JAK1, and STAT3 genes and genetic susceptibility to nonspecific digestive disorder (NSDD) in rabbits. Five coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) in TYK2 were detected in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits with direct sequencing, and two of them, c.1477 (C > T) and c.2013 (C > T), from two different linkage disequilibrium blocks, were further genotyped. A case control association analysis revealed that allele C (c.1477) in TYK2 increases the risk of NSDD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.036-2.145; P=0.021), whereas allele C (c.2013) plays a potentially protective role against NSDD (OR: 0.41; 95% CI 0.2996-0.5705; P<0.001). A gene x gene interaction analysis with a multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method indicated that the combination of c.1477 from TYK2 and c.831 from STAT3 is associated with the susceptibility to NSDD (OR: 7.2567; 95% CI: 4.7306-11.1317; P < 0.0001). Together, our data demonstrate that the TYK2 gene is associated with NSDD in rabbits. The TYK2, JAK1, and STAT3 combination model may be used to assist breeders in selecting rabbits.

A total of 48 1-d-old piglets (sow reared) were allotted, based on the initial body weights (1.57 +/- 0.04 kg), into 4 treatments (12 piglets/group): (1) 0.52 g/kg body weight (BW) L-Alanine (control), (2) 0.31 g/kg BW L-Arginine. HCl (arginine), (3) 0.52 g/kg BW L-Alanine plus 50 mg/kg BW NCG, and (4) 0.52 g/kg BW L-Alanine plus 100 mg/kg BW NCG. The supplement were offered twice daily for 14 d. At d 7 and d 14, 6 piglets from each group were killed. Piglets supplemented with 50 mg/kg BW NCG had increased average daily gain during days 1-14 after birth and jejunal mucosal lactase activity on d 7 compared with piglets supplemented with control, arginine and 100 mg/kg BW NCG groups. Serum concentrations of arginine, glutamate, citrulline and ornithine in arginine, 50 and 100 mg/kg BW NCG groups were markedly increased at d 7 and 14, in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the number of cecal Lactobacillus spp. in both NCG groups was higher than the control and arginine groups at d 14 (P<0.05). Serum IgA (P=0.05) and ileal sIgA (P=0.08) concentrations in the 50 mg/kg BW NCG and arginine groups were higher than those in the control and 100 mg/kg BW NCG groups at d 14. In conclusion, oral administration of 50 mg/kg BW NCG to newborn piglets improved growth performance, increased the endogenous synthesis of arginine and arginine family of amino acids, jejunal lactase activity and cecal Lactobacillus spp. numbers, and stimulated secretion of ileal sIgA.

A total of 288 female Huoyan geese (42 weeks old) were randomly allotted to four experimental groups in this 56-day experiment and fed on diets containing flaxseed at 0% (control), 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively. There were nine replicate pens per treatment, with eight geese per replicate pen. The concentration of a-linolenic acid (linear, P<0.01), EPA (20: 5n-3; linear, P<0.01), DHA (22: 6n-3; quadratic, P = 0.03) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (linear, P<0.01) levels in the yolk lipids increased with increasing dietary flaxseed levels. Yolk palmitic acid (16: 0, linear, P = 0.05), saturated fatty acid (linear, P = 0.04) level and total n-6/n-3 ratio (P<0.01) decreased in a linear fashion as dietary flaxseed levels increased. Increasing dietary flaxseed levels linearly decreased (P = 0.01) the total cholesterol in egg yolks. After hatching, three 1-day-old gosling were selected randomly from each replicate to determine blood characteristics and liver antioxidant status. Aspartate aminotransferase activity (linear, P = 0.03), total triglycerides (linear, P = 0.02) and total cholesterol (linear, P = 0.05) contents in blood linearly decreased as the levels of flaxseed increased. A linear dose response to maternal dietary flaxseed was detected for the activities of the goslings' liver enzymes catalase (linear, P = 0.01), superoxide dismutase (linear, P<0.01) and glutathione peroxidase (linear, P<0.01). The malondialdehyde (quadratic, P = 0.03) and alkaline phosphatase content in the livers of goslings decreased as flaxseed supplementation levels increased. In conclusion, the dietary addition of flaxseed up to 15%, in the maternal diet resulted in increased n-3 PUFA levels in egg yolks and improved the antioxidant status of offspring in a dose-dependent manner.

In order to clarify the role of PRLR and PRL in the process of follicular development in the goose ovary, the level of PRLR mRNA expression in the ovary and follicles of the Sichuan white goose was determined, as well as the PRL concentration in ovarian follicles. Results: The level of PRLR mRNA in the hierarchical follicles (HFs) initially increased, and subsequently decreased, whereas PRLR expression was initially low and later increased in postovulatory follicles (POFs). The level of PRLR mRNA expression was the highest in the F4 follicles, and lowest in the F1 follicles in all of the examined follicles. Compared with the level of PRLR mRNA expression in the small white follicles (SWFs), the level of PRLR mRNA was 2.86- and 1.44-fold higher in the F4 and small yellow follicles (SYFs), respectively (P < 0.05). The level of PRLR mRNA expression in the F4 follicles was highest (P < 0.05) in HFs. The highest PRL concentration in all of the examined samples was observed in SYFs and F1, with concentration of 6162 mLU/g and 6197 mLU/g, respectively. The PRL concentration in SYFs was significantly higher compared with SWFs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The change of PRL concentration was similar to the PRLR mRNA expression level in preovulatory follicles. These results suggest that the PRL mediated by the PRLR plays a stimulatory role in the SWF to SYF transition. (C) 2015 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

The consistently higher plant height, total leaf area, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP), respiration efficiency (RE), and non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ) but lower root mass fraction (RMF) and specific leaf area (SLA) of the invader than of its native congener contributed to the higher RGR and total biomass of A. formosana across light regimes. The total biomass and RGR of the invader increased markedly with increased RMF, A(max), LSP, LCP, RE, stomatal conductance (G(s)) and total leaf area. Furthermore, compared with the native species, the higher plasticity index in plant height, RMF, leaf mass fraction (LMF), SMF, SLA, A(max) and dark respiration rate (R-d) within the range of total light contributed to the higher performance of the invader. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were higher in the invader compared to the native, contributing to its invasion success under high/low light via photoprotection. With a decrease in light level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased significantly, whereas total carotenoid (Car) and total chlorophyll (Chl) decreased; ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities remained unchanged. These responses may help the invader to spread and invade a wide range of habitats and form dense mono-cultures, displacing native plant species. The results suggest that both resource capture-related traits (morphological and photosynthetic) and adaptation-related traits (antioxidant protection) contribute to the competitive advantage of the invader.

Results showed that the IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha (LITAF) cytokine mRNA expression and protein levels were lower (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01) and the percentages of T-cell subsets were also lower in the 300, 600, and 900 mg kg-1 groups than in the control group. It was concluded that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg kg(-1) could reduce cytokine mRNA expression and protein levels in the intestinal mucosa and cecal tonsil, and the percentages of ileac and cecal tonsil T-cell subsets. Decreasing in cytokine mRNA expression and protein levels of intestinal mucosa and cecal tonsil induced by NiCl2 was closely related to the reduction of T-cell population. Thus, the abnormal expression of these cytokines impacts the intestinal mucosal immune function by the pathways of reducing of lymphocyte population and activation. Also, this study first proved that NiCl2 at higher levels has the toxicological effects on intestinal mucosal immunity. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Cai, Y; Yang, ML; Li, J				Cai, Ying; Yang, Meng-long; Li, Jun			Multiclass classification based on a deep convolutional network for head pose estimation	FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Head pose estimation; Deep convolutional neural network; Multiclass classification	RECOGNITION; POINT	Head pose estimation has been considered an important and challenging task in computer vision. In this paper we propose a novel method to estimate head pose based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for 2D face images. We design an effective and simple method to roughly crop the face from the input image, maintaining the individual-relative facial features ratio. The method can be used in various poses. Then two convolutional neural networks are set up to train the head pose classifier and then compared with each other. The simpler one has six layers. It performs well on seven yaw poses but is somewhat unsatisfactory when mixed in two pitch poses. The other has eight layers and more pixels in input layers. It has better performance on more poses and more training samples. Before training the network, two reasonable strategies including shift and zoom are executed to prepare training samples. Finally, feature extraction filters are optimized together with the weight of the classification component through training, to minimize the classification error. Our method has been evaluated on the CAS-PEAL-R1, CMU PIE, and CUBIC FacePix databases. It has better performance than state-of-the-art methods for head pose estimation.

It employed an in situ bank gully field flume experiment with upstream catchment areas with bare (BLG) or cultivated land (CLG) that drained down to bare gully headcuts. Water discharge treatments ranged from 30 to 120 L Min(-1). Concentrated flow discharge clearly affected bank gully soil erosion rates. Excluding minimal discharge in the CLG upstream catchment area (30 L min(-1)), a declining power function trend (p <= 0.1) was observed with time in soil erosion rates for both BLG and CLG upstream catchment areas and downstream gully beds. Non-steady state soil erosion rates were observed after an abrupt collapse along the headcut slope after prolonged scouring treatments. However, as the experiment progressed, Delta E and energy consumption of flow per unit soil loss (Delta Eu) exhibited a logarithmic growth trend (p < .1) at each BLG and CLG position. Although similar temporal trends in soil erosion and infiltration rates were observed, values clearly differed between BLG and CLG upstream catchment areas. Furthermore, Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) values in the CLG upstream catchment area were higher than the corresponding BLG area. In contrast to the BLG upstream catchment area, lower Delta Eu and higher soil erosion rates were observed in the CLG upstream catchment area as a result of soil disturbances. This indicated that intensive land use changes accelerate soil erosion rates in upstream catchment areas of bank gullies and increase soil sediment transport to downstream gullies. Accordingly, reducing tillage disturbances and increasing vegetation cover in upstream catchment areas of bank gullies are essential in the dry-hot valley region of Southwest China.

Exogenous NO depletes Cd-induced toxicity by eliminating oxidative damage, re-establishing ATPase activity, and maintaining stress-related hormone equilibrium in white clover plants	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						ATPase activity; Cd-induced toxicity; Oxidative damage; Nitric oxide; Stress-related hormones; Trifolium repens L.

A dose of 100 mu M Cd stress significantly restrained plant growth and decreased the concentrations of chlorophyll and NO in vivo, whereas it disrupted the balance of stress-related hormones and enhanced the accumulation of Cd, thereby inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. However, the inhibition of plant growth was relieved by 50 mu M SNP through its stimulation of ROS-scavenging compounds (ascorbic acid, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase, non-protein thiol, superoxide dismutase, and total glutathione), regulation of H+-ATPase activity of proton pumps, and increasing jasmonic acid and proline but decreasing ethylene in plant tissues. Even so, the alleviating effect of SNP on plant growth was counteracted by cPTIO and (L)-NAME and was not observed with SNP analogues, suggesting that the protective roles of SNP are related to the induction of NO. These results suggest that NO may improve the Cd tolerance of white clover plants by eliminating oxidative damage, re-establishing ATPase activity, and maintaining hormone equilibrium. Improving our understanding of the role of NO in white clover plants is key to expanding the plantations to various regions and the recovery of pasture species in the future.	[Liu, S. L.; Yang, R.

Aegilops tauschii, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) D-genome progenitor, possesses numerous genes for stress resistance, including genes for tolerance of phosphorus (P) deficiency. Investigation of the genetic architecture of A. tauschii will help in developing P-deficiency-tolerant varieties of wheat. We evaluated nine traits in a population of 380 A. tauschii specimens under conditions with and without P application, and we performed genome-wide association studies for these traits using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips containing 7185 markers. Using a general linear model, we identified 119 SNPs that were significantly associated with all nine traits, and a mixed linear model revealed 18 SNPs associated with all traits. Both models detected 13 significant markers distributed on six of the seven A. tauschii chromosomes (all but 5D). Searches of public databases revealed several candidate/flanking genes related to P-deficiency tolerance. These genes were grouped in five categories by the types of proteins they encoded: defense response proteins, enzymes, promoters and transcription factors, storage proteins, or proteins triggered by P deficiency. The identified SNPs and genes contain essential information for cloning genes related to P-deficiency tolerance in A. tauschii and wheat, and they provide a foundation for breeding P-deficiency tolerant wheat cultivars.

However, the genome constitution of E. tangutorum is controversial and its taxonomic status is not clear. Hybridizations of E. tangutorum were carried out with E. wawawaiensis J. R. Carlson & Barkworth (StH), Roegneria grandis Keng (StY), and E. dahuricus Turcz. ex Griseb. (StYH). Meiotic pairing in the hybrids E. tangutorumxE. wawawaiensis (StH), E. tangutorumxR. grandis (StY), and E. tangutorumxE. dahuricus (StYH) averaged 10.48, 11.12, and 20.92 bivalents per cell, respectively. The results suggested that E. tangutorum is an allohexaploid and contains the StYH genomes. Results of genomic in situ hybridization analysis strongly supported the chromosome pairing data. Therefore, E. tangutorum should be treated as Campeiostachys dahurica var. tangutorum (Nevski) B. R. Baum, J. L. Yang & C. Yen.

In this study, we examined the origination of the newly identified CD34(+) liver CSC (LCSC). We found that CD34(+) LCSC coexpressed liver stem cell and myelomonocytic cell markers, showing a mixed phenotype, a combination of hepatobiliary stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and myelomonocytic cells. Moreover, human xenografts produced by CD34(+) LCSCs and the parental cells, which CD34(+) LCSC was isolated from, coexpressed liver cancer and myelomonocytic markers, also demonstrating mixed phenotypes. The xenografts and the parental cells secreted albumin demonstrating their hepatocyte origin and also expressed cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-12A, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and CSF1] and chemokines (IL-8, CCL2, and CCL5). Expression of these cytokines and chemokines responded to the stimuli [interferon- (INF-), IL-4, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Furthermore, human xenografts and the parental cells phagocytized Escherichia coli. CD34(+) LCSC coexpressed CD45, demonstrating that its origin appears to be from a hematopoietic precursor. The percentage of cells positive for OV6, CD34, and CD31, presenting the markers of HSPC, hematopoietic, and myelomonocytic cells, increased under treatment of CD34(+) LCSC with a drug. Cytogenetic analysis showed that CD34(+) LCSC contained a greater number of chromosomes. HBV DNA integrations and mutations in CD34(+) LCSC and the parental cells were identical to those in the literature or the database. Thus, these results demonstrated that CD34(+) LCSCs were formed by fusion of HSPC with CD34(+) hematopoietic precursor-derived myeloid intermediates; it appears that this is the first report that human CSCs have been formed by the fusion. Therefore, it represents a significant step toward better understanding of the formation of human CSC and the diverse origins of liver cancers.

A total of 20 multiparous sows (LandracexYorkshire) were randomly allotted into two treatments: (i) ID (basal diet, piglets were injected with iron dextran); (ii) BR (basal diet+bacterial-iron; bacterial-iron was given to sows, piglets were not injected with iron dextran). There were five replicates per treatment with two sows per replicate. No differences were observed on sow and piglet growth performance, fecal microbial flora as well as sow blood profiles between ID and BR treatments. In piglets, blood iron, red blood cell and hemoglobin concentrations in ID treatment were higher (P<0.05) on days 12 and 24. Furthermore, concentration of white blood cells in BR treatment was lower (P<0.05) on day 12. However, the percentage of lymphocytes on day 12 was increased (P<0.05) in BR treatment. In conclusion, effect of iron dextran and bacterial-iron has no difference on growth performance in lactating sows and piglets, but iron dextran injection has higher blood iron, white blood cell, red blood cell and hemoglobin concentrations in piglets.

In this study, the content of three antioxidants (ascorbic acid, total flavonoids and ferulic acid) and antioxidant activities of wheat leaf extracts were evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays. The interaction activities among different antioxidants were analyzed by factorial and path analyses. Wheat leaves were extracted with solvents of different polarities. The ABTS test showed that the ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity. There were highly significant linear correlations between antioxidant capacities of the investigated wheat leaves and their ascorbic acid, ferulic acid and flavonoid contents. Total flavonoids and ascorbic acid were major contributors to total antioxidant capacity in wheat leaves.

Identifying differentially expressed genes under heat stress and developing molecular markers in orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) through transcriptome analysis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						differentially expressed genes; marker development; orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.); transcriptome sequencing	EST-SSR MARKERS; RNA-SEQ DATA; NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM MARKERS; SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEATS; DIVERSITY ANALYSIS; GENOME ANNOTATION; SNP DISCOVERY; LINKAGE MAP; TRANSFERABILITY; IDENTIFICATION	Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a long-lived, cool-season forage grass that is commonly used for hay production. Despite its economic importance, orchardgrass genome remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we used Illumina RNA sequencing to identify gene-associated molecular markers, including simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as heat stress-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two orchardgrass genotypes, Baoxing' (heat resistant) and 01998' (heat susceptible). Approximately 163million high-quality trimmed reads were generated from 207million raw reads using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 126846 unigenes were obtained after de novo assembly of the trimmed reads, and 40078 unigenes were identified as coding sequences (CDSs). Based on the assembled unigenes, 669300 high-quality SNPs, including 416099 transitions and 257736 transversions, were contained in 75875 unigenes. In addition, a total of 8475 microsatellites were detected in 7764 unigenes. When placed under heat stress, the total number of DEGs in Baoxing' (3527) was higher than in 01998' (2649), indicating that in comparison with heat-susceptible 01998', heat-resistant Baoxing' seems to have more unigenes that respond to heat stress. The high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of orchardgrass under heat stress provides useful information for gene identification and for the development of SNP and SSR molecular markers. The comparison of DEGs under different periods of heat stress allowed us to identify a wealth of candidate DEGs that can be further analysed in order to determine the genetic mechanisms underlying heat tolerance in orchardgrass.

Dormancy and germination: How does the crop seed decide?	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Review						Crop seed dormancy; germination; phytohormones; pre-harvest sprouting	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; ABSCISIC-ACID BIOSYNTHESIS; RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; PREHARVEST SPROUTING RESISTANCE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA SEEDS; WHITE WINTER-WHEAT; SOYBEAN GERMINATION; GRAIN DORMANCY; GIBBERELLIN METABOLISM; CONTRASTING DORMANCY	Whether seeds germinate or maintain dormancy is decided upon through very intricate physiological processes. Correct timing of these processes is most important for the plants life cycle. If moist conditions are encountered, a low dormancy level causes pre-harvest sprouting in various crop species, such as wheat, corn and rice, this decreases crop yield and negatively impacts downstream industrial processing. In contrast, a deep level of seed dormancy prevents normal germination even under favourable conditions, resulting in a low emergence rate during agricultural production. Therefore, an optimal seed dormancy level is valuable for modern mechanised agricultural systems. Over the past several years, numerous studies have demonstrated that diverse endogenous and environmental factors regulate the balance between dormancy and germination, such as light, temperature, water status and bacteria in soil, and phytohormones such as ABA (abscisic acid) and GA (gibberellic acid). In this updated review, we highlight recent advances regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of seed dormancy and germination processes, including the external environmental and internal hormonal cues, and primarily focusing on the staple crop species. Furthermore, future challenges and research directions for developing a full understanding of crop seed dormancy and germination are also discussed.

NOV; TAXONOMIC EVALUATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ANALYSIS MLSA; IDENTIFICATION; SOIL; NIMIPRESSURALIS	A Gram-stain negative, motile, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain YIM Hb-3(T), was isolated from the stem of a tobacco plant. The strain was observed to form convex, circular and yellow-colored colonies. The predominant respiratory quinone was identified as Q-8. The major fatty acids (> 5 %) detected were C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c (summed feature 3), C-16:0, C(17:0)cyclo, C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c (summed feature 8), C(14:0)3-OH and/or iso-C16:1I (summed feature 2), C-14:0 and C-12:0. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 54.8 mol%. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and multilocus sequence analysis showed that strain YIM Hb-3(T) had the closest phylogenetic relationship with Enterobacter mori LMG 25706(T). DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain YIM Hb-3(T) and E. mori LMG 25706(T) was 46.9 +/- 3.8 %. On the basis of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data, phylogenetic analysis, and DNA-DNA relatedness value, strain YIM Hb-3(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Enterobacter, for which the name Enterobacter tabaci sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM Hb-3(T) (=KACC 17832(T) =KCTC 42694(T)).

Two hundred forty 1-day-old healthy male avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed basal diet (control group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) diet (AFB(1) group), 0.4 mg/kg Se diet (+Se group), and 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg Se diet (AFB(1) + Se group), respectively. Compared to the control group, the number of apoptotic renal cells and expressions of Bax and caspase-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) were significantly increased, while the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased in the AFB(1) and the +Se groups (p < 0.01). A significantly decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and arrested G(0)/G(1) phases of the cell cycle were also seen in the AFB(1) and the +Se groups when compared with those of the control group. Moreover, these parameters were restored to the control group levels in the AFB(1) + Se group. These results suggested that sodium selenite supplied in the diet could effectively inhibit AFB(1)-induced apoptosis and cell cycle blockage in renal cells of broiler.

In this report, 325 recombinant inbred lines (RILs, F-6:7) derived from a cross between B73 with 16 rows and SICAU1212 with four rows (two-ranked with two rows per rank) were utilized to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with ERN and two-ranked versus many-ranked ears (TR). Compared to modern maize that formed approximately 8-20 rows, SICAU1212 with four rows was the extreme case. A total of 12 and 8 QTLs were associated with ERN and TR across four environments through single-environment mapping, respectively. Each QTL responsible for ERN explained 2.33-21.28 % of the phenotypic variation. And the TR variation contributed by individual TR QTL ranged from 2.09 to 12.99 %. Notably, only three QTLs, qERN2-1 (bin 2.02), qERN8-1 (bin 8.02) and qERN8-2 (bin 8.04), were consistently detected in each environment and by joint analysis among all environments, which simultaneously influenced ERN and TR. One of the three QTLs, qERN8-1 was also identified as interacting with environment. In addition, nine pairs of significant epistatic interactions (two for ERN and seven for TR) were detected among all QTLs. The epistasis between qTR2-1 and qTR8-1 was consistent in most environments. This present study may provide the understanding of the genetic basis of ERN and TR and a foundation for further fine-mapping of these common QTLs.

Hence, understanding genetic architectures and functional genes involved in the response to N deficiency can greatly facilitate the development of low-N-tolerant cultivars. In this study, we collected 212 quantitative trait loci (QTL) of agronomically important traits under low-N stress conditions in maize. We then identified 21 consensus QTL (cQTL) strongly induced for low-N tolerance after excluding overlapping cQTL containing QTL simultaneously identified in meta-analyses of studies performed under other environmental conditions. Among the 21 cQTL, 30 candidate maize genes were identified from maize large-scale differential expression data derived from analyses of low-N stress, and the 12 most important maize orthologs were identified using homologous BLAST analyses of genes with known functions in N use efficiency in model plants. Furthermore, maize orthologs associated with low-N tolerance and metabolism were also predicted using large-scale expression data from other model plants. The present genetic loci and candidate genes indicate the molecular mechanisms of low-N tolerance in maize and may provide information for QTL fine mapping and molecular marker-assisted selection.

The morphology of the fracture surfaces of the composites was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. When FG was added to the BF/HDPE composites, the composites were readily deformed or damaged under the external load because of stress concentration and slippage of the interfacial layer in the BF/HDPE composites. The electrical resistivity of the BF/HDPE composites reached an anti-triboelectrification threshold because of the formation of conductive paths. However, when the FG mass fraction was less than the anti-triboelectrification threshold, the triboelectrification electrostatic potential of the BF/HDPE composites reduced in the order oxygen > nitrogen > air > argon > vacuum because the ionization or activation of the gas molecules contributed to the improvement of the triboelectrification electrostatic potential of the BF/HDPE composites.

The objective of the present work was to identify genetic variants of the caprine LEP gene in 411 individuals from five Chinese goat breeds. Six novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (g.117T > C, g.1642G > A, g.2883G > A, g3053T > C, g.3190G > A, and g3314T > C) were detected using DNA sequencing. A chi-squared (chi(2)) test showed that all of the LEP SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the studied population (P > 0.05). Six common haplotypes were identified in the five goat populations, with frequencies ranging from 0.083 to 0.244. The r(2) linkage disequilibrium plot of the LEP SNPs indicated linkage disequilibrium only in the cultured breeds (NJ and JY). Statistical analysis revealed that all of the six SNPs of the LEP gene were associated with growth traits. The individuals with the GG genotype at g.1642G > A and g3190G > A loci showed higher birth weight (2.38 +/- 0.03, 2.43 +/- 0.05) and weight at 2 months of age (10.59 +/- 0.16, 10.71 +/- 0.26) than the A-bearing genotypes (AA or GA, P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that polymorphisms of the caprine LEP gene might be important genetic factors influencing growth traits, and these genetic markers may be useful for future marker-assisted selection programs in goat breeding and production.

To investigate the post-hatch development of adipose tissue, the abdominal, clavicular, and subcutaneous adipose tissue depots were collected from broiler chicks at 4 and 14 days post-hatch. As a percent of body weight, abdominal fat increased (P < 0.001) with age. At day 4, clavicular and subcutaneous fat depots were heavier (P < 0.003) than abdominal fat whereas at day 14, abdominal and clavicular weighed more (P < 0.003) than subcutaneous fat. Adipocyte area and diameter were greater in clavicular and subcutaneous than abdominal fat at 4 and 14 days post-hatch (P < 0.001). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity increased (P < 0.001) in all depots from day 4 to 14, and at both ages was greatest in subcutaneous, intermediate in clavicular, and lowest in abdominal fat (P < 0.05). In clavicular fat, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (CEBP)alpha, CEBP beta, fatty acid synthase (FASN), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and NPY receptors (NPYR5) mRNA increased and NPYR2 mRNA decreased from day 4 to 14 (P < 0.001). Thus, there are site-specific differences in broiler chick adipose development, with larger adipocytes and greater G3PDH activity in subcutaneous fat at day 4, more rapid growth of abdominal fat, and clavicular fat intermediate for most traits. Adipose tissue expansion was accompanied by changes in gene expression of adipose-associated factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous reports indicated that proglucagon-derived peptides are important in regulating feeding and energy homeostasis in both mammals and fish. In the present study, a 504 bp cDNA fragment encoding a highly conserved proglucagon in a cyprinid fish (Schizothorax prenanti) was amplified by homologous cloning. Tissue expression profiles of proglucagon showed that S. prenanti proglucagon had a broad tissue distribution, but was expressed primarily in the intestine and brain. Proglucagon mRNA levels significantly increased after feeding in the hypothalamus and intestine, while levels were dramatically reduced during a week of food deprivation and increased upon refeeding. Proglucagon mRNA expression changes in the hypothalamus and intestine responded to the altered feeding status and suggest that proglucagon is involved in the regulation of feeding and energy in S. prenanti. Statement of relevance In the present study, we deal with the molecular, distribution expressions and mRNA quantification during periprandial, fasting and refeeding in lower vertebrate Ya-fish (S. prenanti). S. prenanti is an endemic cold temperate fish in the southwest of China valuable in both aquaculture and research. However, slow growth rate has been recognized as a major problem in S. prenanti farming, increasing the final production cost. Studies concerning the expression of genes related to feeding and growth regulation have been conducted for this species in our laboratory. Recently, a growing number of homologues of mammalian appetite-regulating peptides and their receptors have been characterized in fish. Proglucagon is the precursor for several peptides: glucagon, glicentin, oxyntomodulin and at least one glucagon-like peptide. These peptides are derived in a tissue-specific manner via post-translational proteolytic processing. Previous reports in mammals indicated that proglucagon-derived peptides are important in regulating feeding and energy homeostasis. However, there is scarce information about their physiological roles in fish. Here, we cloned a 504 bp cDNA fragment of a single proglucagon gene, that is mainly expressed in the intestine and brain and responded to changes of feeding status. These suggest that proglucagon acts as a satiety factor involved in the regulation of food intake in S. prenanti. Our findings of this study provide a basis for future research to better understand the functions and mechanisms of actions of proglucagon and will be helpful in dealing with feeding and growth issues in fishes. We believe that something in this manuscript would be of interest to the journal's readers and hope that this paper is suitable for publication in Aquaculture (Physiology and Endocrinology: Fish).

Our study produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for E2 screening and established a lateral flow colloidal gold immunoassay strip for determining E2 in milk samples with the E2 mAb. The sensitivity of the test strip was found to be 180.42 +/- 3.17 pg/mL and the lower detection limit (LDL) value was 37.14 pg/mL. For negative milk samples spiked with 400, 800, and 1200 pg/mL, the recovery range was 86.7-93.5% and the coefficient of variation scope [CV (%)] was 4.8 -6.2%. The results of comparative studies between test strips and HPLC were relatively identical while the strip test only required less than 8 min. In the study, the test strip was a practical screening technology for quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative detection of E2 residues. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This multilocus genetic characterization determined that the isolate was Cryptosporidium hominis, but carried 2, 10, and 6 nucleotide differences in the SSU rRNA, HSP70, and actin loci, respectively, which is comparable to the variations at these loci between C. hominis and the previously reported monkey genotype (2, 3, and 3 nucleotide differences). Phylogenetic studies, based on neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods, showed that the isolate identified in the current study had a distinctly discordant taxonomic status, distinct from known C. hominis and also from the monkey genotype, with respect to the three loci. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the SSU rRNA gene obtained from this study were similar to those of known C. hominis but clearly differentiated from the monkey genotype. Further subtyping was performed by sequence analysis of the gene encoding the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60). Maximum homology of only 88.3% to C. hominis subtype IdA10G4 was observed for the current isolate, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this particular isolate belonged to a novel C. hominis subtype family, IkA7G4. This study is the first to report C. hominis infection in the squirrel monkey and, based on the observed genetic characteristics, confirms a new C. hominis genotype, monkey genotype II. Thus, these results provide novel insights into genotypic variation in C. hominis.

It is considered to be an important source of genetic variation for wheat breeding, and its genome is an invaluable reference for wheat genomics. We conducted a genome-wide association study using 7,185 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across 322 diverse accessions of Ae. tauschii that were systematically phenotyped for 29 morphological traits in order to identify marker-trait associations and candidate genes, assess genetic diversity, and classify the accessions based on phenotypic data and genotypic comparison. Using the general linear model and mixed linear model, we identified a total of 18 SNPs significantly associated with 10 morphological traits. Systematic search of the flanking sequences of trait-associated SNPs in public databases identified several genes that may be linked to variations in phenotypes. Cluster analysis using phenotypic data grouped accessions into four clusters, while accessions in the same cluster were not from the same Ae. tauschii subspecies or from the same area of origin. This work establishes a fundamental research platform for association studies in Ae. tauschii and also provides useful information for understanding the genetic mechanism of agronomic traits in wheat.

Of the various QTL reported, the one on chromosome arm 3BL (Qcrs.cpi-3B) has the largest effect that can be consistently detected in different genetic backgrounds. Nine sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) for this locus were made available in a previous study. To identify markers that could be reliably used in tagging the Qcrs.cpi-3B locus, a NIL-derived population consisting of 774 F-10 lines were generated and exploited to assess markers selected from the existing linkage map and generated from sequences of the 3B pseudomolecule. Results: This is the first report on fine mapping a QTL conferring FCR resistance in wheat. By three rounds of linkage mapping using the NILs and the NIL-derived population, the Qcrs.cpi-3B locus was mapped to an interval of 0.7 cM covering a physical distance of about 1.5 Mb. Seven markers co-segregating with the locus were developed. This interval contains a total of 63 gene-coding sequences based on the 3B pseudomolecule, and six of them were known to encode disease resistance proteins. Several of the genes in this interval were among those responsive to FCR infection detected in an earlier study. Conclusions: The accurate localization of the Qcrs.cpi-3B locus and the development of the markers co-segregating with it should facilitate the incorporation of this large-effect QTL conferring FCR resistance into breeding programs as well as the cloning of the gene(s) underlying the QTL.

In this study, two association panels consisting of 94 inbred lines each, from China and the U.S., were characterized for resistance to two isolates: SCMV-Seehausen and SCMV-BJ. The population structure of both association panels was analyzed using 3072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The Chinese and the U. S. panel were both subdivided into two sub-populations, the latter comprised of Stiff Stalk Synthetic (SS) lines and Non Stiff Stalk Synthetic (NSS). The relative kinships were calculated using informative 2947 SNPs with minor allele frequency >= 5% and missing data <= 20% for the Chinese panel and 2841 SNPs with the same characteristics were used for the U. S. panel. The Scmv1 region was genotyped using 7 single sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, and 12 SSR markers were used for the Scmv2 region in the U. S. panel, while 5 of them were used for the Chinese panel. For all traits, a MLM (Mix Linear Model) controlling both population structure and relative kinship (Q + K) was used for association analysis. Three markers Trx-1, STS-11, and STS-12 located in the Scmv1 region were strongly associated (P = 0.001) with SCMV resistance, and explained more than 16.0%, 10.6%, and 19.7% of phenotypic variation, respectively. 207FG003 located in the Scmv2 region was significantly associated (P = 0.001) with SCMV resistance, and explained around 18.5% of phenotypic variation.

The physicochemical properties of the recovered lignin were analyzed prior to its application in the fabrication of polylactic acid (PLA)-lignin composites. The results showed that the samples had a high Klason lignin content (>75%) and retained their natural structure. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the recovered lignin exhibited a different thermal decomposition pattern from that of commercial lignins. All the recovered lignins had good solubility in common organic solvents (acetone, 1,4-dioxane, THF, DMSO, and ethanol/water) and 1 mol/L NaOH solution. The addition of lignin into the PLA matrix resulted in the improvement in tensile properties of PLA-lignin composites. PLA films with low lignin content had good UV light-resistant properties, indicating that the recovered lignin has potential in packaging of light-sensitive products. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At the beginning of a single selling season, the newsvendor who faces additive stochastic demand can obtain goods through two ways: ordering from a firm or purchasing and exercising call options. Single ordering (ordering from a firm only or purchasing and exercising call options only) and mixed ordering (ordering from a firm and purchasing and exercising call options simultaneously) cases are investigated. We find that the newsvendor's optimal pricing and ordering strategies exist and are unique for both cases, respectively. In addition, when both cases are available, mixed ordering is the newsvendor's optimal ordering policy. If only single ordering is available, the newsvendor prefers ordering from a firm when demand risk is low, while enjoys purchasing and exercising call options when demand risk is high. We also find that with option contracts, the newsvendor's optimal order quantity and maximum expected profit are all decreasing in the option price and exercise price of product, while the optimal retail price in terms of option price and exercise price of product are intricate. Moreover, we show that, mixed ordering is more capable to deal with supply price volatility risk.

In the present study, we sequenced the whole genome DNA methylation in these breeds to detect whether DNA methylation plays a role in determining the body mass of sheep by Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation - sequencing method. A high quality methylation map of Chinese Mongolian sheep was obtained in this study. We identified 399 different methylated regions located in 93 human orthologs, which were previously reported as body size related genes in human genome-wide association studies. We tested three regions in LTBP1, and DNA methylation of two CpG sites showed significant correlation with its RNA expression. Additionally, a particular set of differentially methylated windows enriched in the "development process" (GO: 0032502) was identified as potential candidates for association with body mass variation. Next, we validated small part of these windows in 5 genes; DNA methylation of SMAD1, TSC1 and AKT1 showed significant difference across breeds, and six CpG were significantly correlated with RNA expression. Interestingly, two CpG sites showed significant correlation with TSC1 protein expression. This study provides a thorough understanding of body size variation in sheep from an epigenetic perspective.

Moss is sensitive to heavy metals and is therefore considered a pollution indicator. However, it is unknown what kind physiological parameters can indicate metal contaminations quickly and non-invasively. Here, we systematically examined the effects of six heavy metals on physiological parameters and photosynthetic activities of two moss species grown in aquatic media or moist soil surface. We suggest that a phenotype with anthocyanin accumulation pattern and chlorosis pattern and two chlorophyll fluorescence parameters with their images can roughly reflect metal species groups, concentrations and differences between the two moss species. In other words, metal contaminations could be roughly estimated visually using the naked eye. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidative abilities and photosynthetic protein contents of Eurhynchium eustegium were higher than those of Taxiphyllum taxirameum, indicating their differential metal tolerance. Neither anti-oxidative abilities nor photosynthetic proteins were found to be ideal indicators. This study provides new ideas to monitor heavy metals rapidly and non-invasively in water or on wetland and moist soil surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With this in mind we developed several genetically defined mutants in a virulent duck Salmonella typhimurium isolate TT-1. From initial tests for virulence in day-old ducks, Delta rpoS, Delta hilA, and Delta slyA mutants retained some virulence so were not studied further. Amongst the mutants showing greater attenuation, Delta ssrB, Delta phoPQ, Delta ompR, and Delta clpP also showed high levels of protection when 1-day-old ducks, which were vaccinated orally, were challenged 1 week later demonstrating the capacity to protect ducks in the first few weeks of life when they are most susceptible and when the risk of infection is greatest. Immunized ducks triggered Omp-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA responses and raised IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels in the serum coupled with IL-4 suppression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water stress caused increases in endogenous PA content in leaves, including putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm). Exogenous application of Spd could induce the instantaneous H2O2 burst and accumulation of cytosolic free Ca2+, and activate NADPH oxidase and CDPK gene expression in cells. To a great extent, PA biosynthetic inhibitor reduced the water stress-induced H2O2 accumulation, free cytosolic Ca2+ release, antioxidant enzyme activities and genes expression leading to aggravate water stress induced oxidative damage, while these suppressing effects were alleviated by the addition of exogenous Spd, indicating PA was involved in water stress-induced H2O2 and cytosolic free Ca2+ production as well as stress tolerance. Dehydrin genes (Y2SK, Y2K, and SK2) were showed to be highly responsive to exogenous Spd. PA induced antioxidant defense and dehydrin genes expression could be blocked by the scavenger of H2O2 and the inhibitors of H2O2 generation or Ca2+ channels blockers, a calmodulin antagonist, as well as the inhibitor of CDPK. These findings suggested that PA regulated tolerance to water stress in white clover associated with antioxidant defenses and dehydrins via involvement in the calcium messenger system and H2O2 signaling pathways. PA-induced H2O2 production required Ca2+ release, while PA-induced Ca2+ release was also essential for H2O2 production, suggesting an interaction between PA induced H2O2 and Ca2+ signaling.

Gene expression studies provide a theoretical molecular biology foundation for improving new traits and developing new cultivars. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a crucial approach for gene expression analysis. In addition, appropriate reference genes (RGs) are essential for accurate and rapid relative quantification analysis of gene expression. In this study, fifteen candidate RGs involved in multiple metabolic pathways of plants were finally selected and validated under different experimental treatments, at different seed development stages and in different cultivars and tissues for real-time PCR experiments. These genes were ABCS, 60SRPL10, RANBP1, UBCL, MFC, UBCE2, EIF5A, COA, EF1-beta, EF1, GAPDH, ATPS, MBF1, GTPB and GST. The suitability evaluation was executed by the geNorm and NormFinder programs. Overall, EF1, UBCE2, EIF5A, ATPS and 60SRPL10 were the most stable genes, and MBF1, as well as MFC, were the most unstable genes by geNorm and NormFinder software in all experimental samples. To verify the validation of RGs selected by the two programs, the expression analysis of 7 CtFAD2 genes in safflower seeds at different developmental stages under cold stress was executed using different RGs in RT-qPCR experiments for normalization. The results showed similar expression patterns when the most stable RGs selected by geNorm or NormFinder software were used. However, the differences were detected using the most unstable reference genes. The most stable combination of genes selected in this study will help to achieve more accurate and reliable results in a wide variety of samples in safflower.

However, their biological functions remain to be elucidated, especially in rice (Ora sativa L.). Previously, we have reported that OsDo112 can promote rice flowering under long-day conditions. Here, we further investigated the other important agronomical traits of the transgenic plants oyerexpressing OsDof12 and found that oyerexpressing OsDof12 could lead to reduced plant height, erected leaf, shortened leaf blade, and smaller panicle resulted from decreased primary and secondary branches number. These results implied that OsDof12 is involved in rice plant architecture formation. Furthermore, we performed a series of Brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive tests and found that oyerexpression of OsDof12 could also result in BR hyposensitiyity. Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDo112 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDo112 oyerexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBR11 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDo112 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice. Taken together, our results suggested that overexpression of OsDof12 could lead to altered plant architecture by suppressing BR signaling. Thus, OsDof12 might be used as a new potential genetic regulator for future rice molecular breeding.

The objective of present study was to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a new vaccine candidate protein (EhaF) on methanogenesis and microbial population in the rumen of goats. We amplified the gene mru 1407 encoding protein EhaF using fresh rumen fluid samples of mature goats and successfully expressed recombinant protein (EhaF) in Escherichia coli Rosetta. This product was evaluated using 12 mature goats with half for control and other half injected with 400ug/goat the purified recombinant protein in day 1 and two subsequent booster immunizations in day 35 and 49. All measurements were undertaken from 63 to 68 days after the initial vaccination, with CH4 emissions determined using respiration calorimeter chambers. The results showed that the vaccination caused intensive immune responses in serum and saliva, although it had no significant effect on total enteric CH4 emissions and methanogen population in the rumen, when compared with the control goats. However, the vaccination altered the composition of rumen bacteria, especially the abundance of main phylum Firmicutes and genus Prevotella. The results indicate that protein EhaF might not be an effective vaccine to reduce enteric CH4 emissions but our vaccine have potential to influence the rumen ecosystem of goats.

Kidney is the major organ for Ni accumulation and excretion. There are no investigations on the Ni- or Ni compounds-induced renal inflammatory responses in human beings and animals at present. Therefore, we determined NiCl2-caused alteration of inflammatory mediators, and functional damage in the broiler's kidney by the methods of biochemistry, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused the renal inflammatory responses that characterized by increasing mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) via the activation of nucleic factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), and decreasing mRNA expression levels of the anti-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). Concurrently, NiCl2 caused degeneration, necrosis and apoptosis of the tubular cells, which was consistent with the alteration of renal function parameters including elevated alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, and reduced activities of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase), calcium adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2+-ATPase), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in the kidney. The above-mentioned results present that the activation of NF-kappa B pathway and reduction of anti-inflammatory mediator expression are main mechanisms of NiCl2-caused renal inflammatory responses and that the renal function is decreased or impaired after NiCl2-treated.

We examined the changes of relative weight, cell cycle phase, apoptotic cells, and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 in the thymus by the methods of flow cytometry, TUNEL (terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling) and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that dietary high vanadium (30mg/kg, 45mg/kg and 60mg/kg) caused the toxic effects on thymic development, which was characterized by decreasing relative weight, increasing G(0)/G(1) phase (a prolonged nondividing state), reducing S phase (DNA replication) and proliferating index (PI), and increasing percentages of apoptotic thymocytes. Concurrently, the protein expression levels of Bax and caspase-3 were increased, and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 were decreased. The thymic development suppression caused by dietary high vanadium further leads to inhibitive effects on T lymphocyte maturity and activity, and cellular immune function. The above-mentioned results provide new evidences for further understanding the vanadium immunotoxicity. In contrast, dietary 5 mg/kg vanadium promoted the thymic development by increasing relative weight, decreasing G(0)/G(1) phase, increasing S phase and PI, and reducing percentages of apoptotic thymocytes when compared to the control group and high vanadium groups.

Methods: We used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to examine the mechanisms of resistance in the resistant wheat line L693 (Reg. No. GP-972, PI 672538), which was derived from a lineage that includes a wide cross between common and Thinopyrum intermedium. Sequencing of an SSH cDNA library identified 112 expressed sequence tags. Results: In silico mapping placed one of these tags [GenBank: JK972238] on chromosome 1A. Primers based on [GenBank: JK972238] amplified a polymorphic band, which co-segregated with YrL693. We cloned a candidate gene encoding wheat copper-binding protein (WCBP1) by amplifying the polymorphic region, and we mapped WCBP1 to a 0.64 cM genetic interval. Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum have genes and genomic regions syntenic to this region. Discussion: Sequence analysis suggested that the resistant WCBP1 allele might have resulted from a deletion of 36-bp sequence of the wheat genomic sequence, rather than direct transfer from Th. intermedium. qRT-PCR confirmed that WCBP1 expression changes in response to pathogen infection. Conclusions: The unique chromosomal location and expression mode of WCBP1 suggested that WCBP1 is the putative candidate gene of YrL693, which was involved in leaf senescence and photosynthesis related to plant responses to stripe rust infection during the grain-filling stage.

In the present study, Robertson navel oranges (Citrus sinesis Osb.) were collected from six representative habitats in three eco-regions of Sichuan, China. The changes in the sugar-acid ratio and the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SS), cytosolic cio-aconitase (ACO), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were examined in navel oranges during fruit development. The results indicated that the sugar-acid ratio of fruits in different eco-regions changed significantly from 150 days after full bloom. The SPS and cytosolic ACO fruit activities had minor changes among different eco-regions throughout the experimental periods, whereas the activities of SS and IDH changed significantly in fruits among three eco-regions. Furthermore, the sugar-acid ratio and the activities of SS in the synthetic direction and IDH were the highest in south subtropics and the lowest in north mid-subtropics, probably due to the effects of climate conditions and/or other relevant eco-factors. It demonstrated that SS in the synthetic direction and IDH were of greater importance in regulating the sugar-acid ratio of navel oranges in different eco-regions, which provided new insights into the factors that determine the flavor quality of navel oranges and valuable data for guiding relevant agricultural practices.

In order to understand the regulation of RPW8.1-mediated signaling, an approach based on ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis was adopted to identify mutants that enhance or impair RPW8.1-mediated cell death. Here we describe the identification of mutants b10-6 and b9-1, point mutations that were induced in the At2g37630 locus resulting in an amino acid substitution or a premature stop codon in ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1), respectively. Loss-of-function in AS1 altered the transcription of RPW8.1, RPW8.1-dependent necrotic lesions in leaves and resistance to powdery mildew. In the mutant b10-6, RPW8.1-mediated cell death and disease resistance was compromised, however. in b9-1 RPW8.1-mediated cell death and resistance to powdery mildew was slightly enhanced. Expression of AS1-eYFP within b10-6 background suppressed RPW8.1-mediated cell death and disease resistance in the short-day condition, but largely restored the phenotypes of b10-6 to that of R1Y4 in the long-day condition. These data imply that proper expression of AS1 is required for full function of RPW8.1 in triggering cell death and resistance to powdery mildew. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the changes in molecular processes impacted by incubation temperature in avians. In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 degrees C from day 11-20 on the embryonic and posthatch skeletal muscle development of the Peking duck, and identified the differentially expressed genes using RNA-seq of leg muscle tissues. The results showed that altering the incubation temperature had immediate and long-lasting effects on phenotypic changes in the embryonic and post-hatching muscle development. It was shown that expression levels of total 1370 genes were altered in muscle tissues by the thermal treatments. The gene ontology (GO) analyses indicated that cellular processes including metabolism, cell cycle, catalytic activity, and enzyme regulatory activity may have involved in the muscle mass impacted by thermal manipulation. TGF-beta and insulin pathways as two classical muscle development related pathways may also involve in regulating muscle mass. These data may be helpful for understanding the physiological and biochemical processes of muscle development under environmental treatments in embryonic avians. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The inhibitory effects of 2, 4-di-tert-butyl phenol was strongest on the target plants. The three volatile compounds at high concentrations [n-octane, 1%; 2,4-di-tert-butyl phenol, 10 mmol/E; 2,2 '-methylene bis (6-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol)], 10 mmol/E) inhibited the seed germination, root length, seedling height and the seedling / root fresh weight ratio of Vigna radiata, Raphanus sativus and Lactuca sativa, but low concentrations were less inhibitory or stimulatory. All three volatile compounds at low concentrations were slightly stimulatory to seedling's MDA content and were less inhibitory to seedlings roots' vitality TTC. At low concentrations, the n-octane and 2, 2'-methylene bis (6-tert-butyl -4- methyl phenol) were less stimulatory to the seedlings root's vitality.

The sequence analysis of three housekeeping genes (atpD, glnll and recA) and 16S rDNA indicated that the strains represented two R. leguminosarum, two Rhizobium spp., R. mesosinicum, Agrobacterium sp. and A. tumefaciens. The strains representing four Rhizobium species were divided into two distinct nodC and Will genotypes. However, the phylogeny of housekeeping genes and symbiotic genes was not congruent, implying that the strains had been shaped by vertical evolution of the housekeeping genes and lateral evolution of the symbiotic genes.

Molecular genetics with model plants continues to make advances; highlighted here are quantitative-occupancy results from the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) Phytochrome-Interacting bHLH transcription Factors (PIF) quartet. Compared to this complex snapshot, results from chromatin occupancy and other Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)-like approaches increase our transcription factor-motif cognate library, but regulation cannot by itself be inferred from binding. Complementary published Arabidopsis conserved noncoding sequence lists are compared, evaluated, merged, and released. Comparative genomic approaches have identified a cis modifier of a gene's expression - hypothetically, a transposon-based 'rheostat' - that works in all cells, times and places.

We investigated the biomass stock and carbon sequestration across a chronosequence ( 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-, 12-, 15-, 19-, 29-, 35- and 42- year) of stands with the main objectives: ( 1) to determine the biomass and carbon stock of the forest ecosystem; and ( 2) to identify factors influencing their distribution across the age series. Simple random sampling was used for collecting field data in the ten ( 10) stand ages. Three 20 x 20 m standard plots were laid out in February 2015 across the chronosequence. The diameter at breast height ( DBH) and tree height ( H) of each tree within each plot were measured using calipers and height indicator. Sub- plots of 2 x 2 m were established in each main plot for collecting soil samples at a 0- 30- and 30- 60- cm depth. Plantation biomass increased with increasing stand ages, ranging from 0.84 tonnes per hectare ( t . ha- 1) in the three- year stand to 252.35 t . ha- 1 in the 42- year stand. The aboveground biomass ( AGB) contributed 86.51%; the maximum value is 300- times the minimum value. Carbon concentrations and storage in mineral soil decreased with increasing soil depth, but were controlled by the management history of the ecosystem. The total ecosystem carbon storage varies with stand ages, ranging from 169.90 t . ha- 1 in the five-year plantation to 326.46 t . ha- 1 in the 42- year plantation, of which 80.29% comes from the mineral soil carbon and 19.71% from the vegetation. The ratio of the total carbon sequestration by the 42- year to the three-year stand was 1.70, implying substantial amounts of carbon accumulation during the transition period from young to mature- aged trees. The forest ecosystem had the capacity of storing up to 263.16 t . ha- 1 carbon, assisting in mitigating climate change by sequestrating 965.83 t . ha- 1 of CO2 equivalents, indicating that the forest is an important carbon sink.

J	Pan, J; Liu, D; Ali, S				Pan, Jay; Liu, Dan; Ali, Shehzad			Patient dissatisfaction in China: What matters	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Patient satisfaction; Determinant; Outpatient; Inpatient; China	HEALTH-CARE; RURAL CHINA; SATISFACTION; HOSPITALS; PRIVATE; DECOMPOSITION; DETERMINANTS; PREDICTORS; DELIVERY; SERVICES	Patient satisfaction is a focal concern of health-care delivery and an expected outcome of medical care. Recently, the violent conflict between doctors and patients in China has intensified. Patient dissatisfaction has been recognized as an important concern and an urgent issue in the reform of China's health care. The objectives of this study are to investigate the determinants of patient dissatisfaction attributed to patient, hospital, and health-care market characteristics, as well as to explore the major determinants in the context of China. Data from 2007 to 2010 Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Survey (URBMIS) are used in this study. A total of 13,336 patients are selected conditional on health-care utilization. Analysis of satisfaction is based on outpatient utilization (last 2 weeks' reference, 6393 individuals) and inpatient utilization (last 1-year reference, 6943 individuals). Satisfaction was measured as ordinal variables (scales 1-5). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and an ordered probit model are applied to investigate the determinants. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition is further employed to detect the proportion each predictor's contribution. The results indicate that patients' gender, education, and insurance status are significantly related to patient satisfaction. Higher-level hospitals are found to negatively correlate with patient satisfaction. Lower competition in providers' market and a higher market share of private hospitals are found to positively correlate with patient dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, the survey indicates that "medical charges too expensive" is chiefly responsible for patient dissatisfaction. Our study provides empirical evidence on the determinants of patient dissatisfaction in China. In particular, the results indicate that establishing a high competition among various providers in the health-care market will act as a "double-edged sword," with great policy implications.

Twenty-four boars were randomly divided into 4 groups (HP, LP1, LP2, and LP3). HP boars received 17% crude protein diet with a lysine:threonine:tryptophan:arginine (Lys:Thr:Trp:Arg) ratio of 100:50:20:104. Other boars received 13% CP and similar Lys levels (0.84%) with Lys:Thr:Trp:Arg ratios of 100:50:20:71, 100:76:38:71, and 100:76:38:120 for LP1, LP2, and LP3, respectively. These results showed sperm motility in the LP3 group was higher than in HP group during the 13-22 week period. The total sperm number, acrosome integrity ratio, and the effective total sperm number in LP3 and LP2 was higher than in other groups, and the abnormality ratio was lower than in other groups during the 13-18 week period. During 19-22 week period, in LP1 and LP3 groups, total sperm number and effective total sperm number were higher than in other groups, abnormality ratio was lower, and acrosome integrity ratio was higher than in the HP group. Nitric oxide synthase activity of seminal plasma and nitric oxide concentration of spermatozoa were significantly higher in the LP3 group than in other groups. Furthermore, mRNA expression of androgen receptor in testes was up-regulated in LP3. In conclusion, we suggest that the optimum ratio of Lys:Thr:Trp:Arg in a 13% CP diet for boars is 100:76:38:120, which results in similar or better reproductive performances than a 17% CP diet.

Fish were fed with six different experimental diets containing graded levels of Trp at 0.7 (control), 1.7, 3.1, 4.0, 5.2 and 6.1 g kg(-1) diet for 8 weeks. The results firstly demonstrated that Trp deficiency or excess caused increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and severe oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation) in the gill of fish, and those negative effects could be reversed by optimal Trp levels. Secondly, compared with the optimal Trp levels, Trp deficiency could cause decreases in the mRNA levels of the barrier functional proteins (occludin, zonula occludens-1, claudin-c, and -3) and increases in the mRNA levels of the pore-formation proteins (claudin-12 and -15) mRNA levels in the gill of fish, and those were reversed by the optimal levels of Trp. The negative effects of Trp deficiency on those tight junction protein gene expression might be partly related to the increases in the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and related signalling factors (tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 8, interleukin 10 and transcription factor-kappa B) and decreases in the mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and related signalling factors [interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta 1, nuclear inhibitor factor kappa B alpha (i kappa B alpha), target of rapamyc and ribosome protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)] in the gill of fish. In addition, optimal dietary Trp protected the gill of fish against its deficiency-caused increases in the mRNA levels of the apoptosis signalling (caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9) and decreases in anti-superoxide radicals capacity, anti-hydroxyl radical capacity, glutathione contents and the activities of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the gill of fish. Additionally, compared with the Trp deficiency, optimal Trp up-regulated the mRNA levels of SOD, CAT, GPx, GR and GST, which might be partly ascribed to the up-regulation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels and the down-regulation of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) mRNA levels in the gill of fish. Interestingly, excessive Trp caused similar results with its deficiency. Collectively, Trp deficiency or excess could cause antioxidant system disruption and change tight junction protein transcription abundances, which were partly related to the signalling factors, NF-kappa B p65, TOR, caspase-(3,8,9) and Nrf2, in fish gill, those could be blocked by the optimal Trp levels.

Fish were fed the diets containing graded levels of Mn [3.65-27.86 mg Mn kg(-1) diet] for 8 weeks. The results demonstrated that Mn deficiency significantly decreased the lysozyme and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, up-regulated tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 8 and the signalling factor nuclear factor-kappa B p65, and down-regulated interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor beta 1, inhibitor of signalling factors kappa B-alpha and target of rapamycin mRNA levels in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI). However, Mn deficiency did not change the C3 content in the PI, whereas it decreased the C3 contents in the MI and DI. Additionally, Mn depletion also resulted in significantly low mRNA levels for tight junction proteins (claudin-b, claudin-c, claudin-15, occludin and zonula occludens-1), antioxidant enzymes (MnSOD, GPx and CAT) and NF-E2-related factor-2 in the intestines of fish. Excessive Mn exhibited toxic effects similar to Mn deficiency, where optimal Mn contents reversed those indicators. In conclusion, Mn deficiency or excess causes the depression of intestinal immunity, induction of inflammation and dysfunction of the intestinal physical barrier relating to NF-kappa B, TOR and Nrf2 signalling in grass carp. Furthermore, quadratic regression analysis at 95% maximum response of lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities in the distal intestine of young grass carp revealed the optimum dietary Mn levels to be 8.90 and 8.99 mg kg(-1) diet, respectively.

Fish were fed diets containing six graded levels of thiamin at 0.12-2.04 mg/kg diet for 8 weeks. The percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency were lower in fish fed the 0.12 mg/kg diet. Thiamin deficiency decreased complement 3 content, lysozyme (LA) and acid phosphatase activities, mRNA levels of hepcidin and interleukin (IL) 10, elevated mRNA levels of interferon gamma 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-10 and IL-8 in intestine, head kidney, spleen and liver. The mRNA levels of inhibitor protein-kappa B alpha, target of rapamycin (TOR) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the activities and mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase were down-regulated, mRNA levels of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), I kappa B kinases (IKK beta and IKK gamma), nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF-kappa B P65) and Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein la (Keap1a) were up-regulated in the intestine of fish fed the thiamin-deficient diet. Additionally, thiamin deficiency decreased claudin b, c and 3, ZO-1 and occludin mRNA levels in each intestinal segment, increased claudin 12 and claudin 15a mRNA levels in distal intestine. In conclusion, thiamin deficiency decreased fish growth and immunity of intestine, head kidney, spleen and liver. The dietary thiamin requirement of young grass carp (242-742 g) based on intestinal LA activity or PWG were determined to be 1.15 or 0.90 mg/kg diet, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Mapping of SrTm4, a Recessive Stem Rust Resistance Gene from Diploid Wheat Effective to Ug99	PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							F-SP TRITICI; PUCCINIA-GRAMINIS; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; BARBERRY ERADICATION; TETRAPLOID WHEATS; AEGILOPS-TAUSCHII; DURUM-WHEAT; RACE TTKSK; PH1 LOCUS; MONOCOCCUM	Race TTKSK (or Ug99) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stem rust, is a serious threat to wheat production worldwide. Diploid wheat, Triticum monococcum (genome A(m)), has been utilized previously for the introgression of stem rust resistance genes Sr21, Sr22, and Sr35. Multipathotype seedling tests of biparental populations demonstrated that T monococcum accession PI 306540 collected in Romania contains a recessive resistance gene effective to all P. graminis f. sp. tritici races screened, including race TTKSK. We will refer to this gene as SrTm4, which is the fourth stem rust resistance gene characterized from T. monococcum. Using two mapping populations derived from crosses of PI 272557 x PI 306540 and G3116 x P1306540, we mapped SrTm4 on chromosome arm 2A(m)L within a 2.1 cM interval flanked by sequence-tagged markers BQ461276 and DR732348, which corresponds to a 240-kb region in Brachypodium chromosome 5. The eight microsatellite and nine sequence-tagged markers linked to SrTm4 will facilitate the introgression and accelerate the deployment of SrTm4-mediated Ug99 resistance in wheat breeding programs.

Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and SYBR Green reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the methylation status and the mRNA expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), the tumor suppressor genes P73, P53, GADD45G, CHFR and THBS1, the transcription factor CEBPA, the proto-oncogenes KRAS, NRAS and C-myc and EGFR in 24 nasal tumor tissue samples and 20 normal nasal epithelia tissue samples. The associations between promoter methylation and DNMT, and promoter methylation and mRNA expression of the genes were analyzed.. The results indicated that the expression levels of DNMT1 increased by 56% compared with those in normal nasal epithelial tissues, while MGMT, DNMT3a and DNMT3b had similar expression levels in the two tissue types. The expression levels of P53 decreased by 36.8% and those of THBS1 by 43%, while C-myc increased by 2.9-fold and CEBPA by 2-fold compared with that in normal nasal epithelial tissues. GADD45G, P73, CHFR and NRAS were observed to have similar expression levels in the two tissue types. However, no expression was observed for EGFR and KRAS. CHFR, GADD45G and THBS1 were identified to be methylated in tumor suppressor genes. The methylation expression rate of the CHFR gene was similar to 60% in the two tissue types and for THBS1 it was 100% in the nasal tumor tissues as opposed to 20% in the normal nasal epithelial tissues. The exhaustive methylation expression rate of GADD45G was 62.5% and the partial methylation expression rate was 37.5% in nasal tumor tissue, while no methylation was observed in normal nasal epithelial tissues. C-myc was the only gene identified to be methylated amongst proto-oncogenes. The methylation expression rate of C-myc was 87.5% in nasal tumor tissues and 15% in normal nasal epithelial tissues. The methylation expression rate of CEBPA was 100% in nasal tumor tissues and 40% in normal nasal epithelial tissues. The methylation expression rate of the EGFR gene was similar to 80% in the two tissues. In summary, the present study identified abnormal methylation of the C-myc, CEBPA, GADD45G and THBS1 genes in nasal tumor tissues. The expression levels of DNMT1, C-myc and CEBPA were upregulated and the expression of P53 and THBSI were downregulated in nasal tumor tissues, with a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). Therefore, it is suggested that these six genes may be used as diagnostic marker candidates for ENT. The results may serve as a foundation for screening of tumor-specific markers for early diagnosis of ENT and further investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV)-induced nasal epithelium cell carcinoma.

Functional identification of plant genes is generally achieved by a combination of creating genetic modifications and observing the according phenotype, which begins with forward-genetic methods represented by random physical and chemical mutagenesis and move towards reverse-genetic tools as targeted genome editing. A major bottleneck is time need to produce modified homozygous genotypes that can actually be used for phenotypic validation. Herein, we comprehensively address and compare available experimental approaches for functional validation of plant genes, and propose haploid strategies to reduce the time needed and cost consumed for establishing gene function.

As reported, TMUV infection has resulted in significant poultry losses, and the virus may also pose a threat to public health. To characterize TMUV evolutionarily and to understand the factors accounting for codon usage properties, we performed, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias for the genomes of 60 TMUV strains. The most recently published TMUV strains were found to be widely distributed in coastal cities of southeastern China. Codon preference among TMUV genomes exhibits a low bias (effective number of codons (ENC) = 53.287) and is maintained at a stable level. ENC-GC3 plots and the high correlation between composition constraints and principal component factor analysis of codon usage demonstrated that mutation pressure dominates over natural selection pressure in shaping the TMUV coding sequence composition. The high correlation between the major components of the codon usage pattern and hydrophobicity (Gravy) or aromaticity (Aromo) was obvious, indicating that properties of viral proteins also account for the observed variation in TMUV codon usage. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that CQW1 isolated from Chongqing may have evolved from GX2013H or GX2013G isolated from Guangxi, thus indicating that TMUV likely disseminated from southeastern China to the mainland. Moreover, the preferred codons encoding eight amino acids were consistent with the optimal codons for human cells, indicating that TMUV may pose a threat to public health due to possible cross-species transmission (birds to birds or birds to humans). The results of this study not only have theoretical value for uncovering the characteristics of synonymous codon usage patterns in TMUV genomes but also have significant meaning with regard to the molecular evolutionary tendencies of TMUV.

Results indicated that the drying time is more significantly affected by drying temperature followed by sample thickness and air velocity. Drying rate curves illustrated that the whole drying process happened in the falling rate period. Additionally, from initial drying to the moisture content of about 0.5 kg/kg, the drying rate increased with the increase of drying temperature and air velocity or decreased with the increase of sample thickness. The moisture effective diffusivity (D-eff) was determined both neglecting shrinkage and considering shrinkage. The drying activation energy of American ginseng slices was 46.64 kJ/mol determined by Arrhenius relationship. The moisture effective diffusivity and drying activation energy of American ginseng slices were compared to other biomaterials and related issues were also discussed. The current work is useful for designing air impingement drying system, evaluating and saving energy consumption of American ginseng slices.

This paper mainly discusses the climate change effects on water use indices and maize yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions projected by three climate models in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia in 2020, 2050 and 2080 under A2 and B2 scenarios. The climate prediction results show that it is similar to the future precipitation and temperature projected by three climate models for the same time slices. For rainfed and irrigated maize, the crop yield, the potential and actual evapotranspiration will increase by 3-32, 3-12, 30-45 and 32-45, 3-15, 6-15% under both scenarios in the future during the maize growth period compared with the baseline respectively. Water use indices of maize under rainfed conditions will decrease and the variable increment will gradually be larger in the future, including evapotranspiration efficiency, crop water use efficiency and total water use efficiency. However, all the water use indices analysed under irrigated conditions will increase. The variation for evapotranspiration efficiency, ratio of evapotranspiration and irrigation is around 20%, but the variation for the other three indices is more than 30%. The projection results also indicate that the indices under the B2 scenario are smaller than those under A2 although the variable tendency and range are consistent. The conclusions suggest that it is significant to develop irrigated agriculture so as to mitigate climate change effects on crop production in the Murray Darling Basin.

The results showed that 13.52% of pure oleuropein was found with a high purity of 96.54% and purification efficiency of 78.49%. Oleuropein and total phenolic contents of different olive varieties were quite different, but both had similar trends over the year. Five methods, including DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABST (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt), ferric reducing antioxidant power, total reducing power and nitrite-scavenging ability, were used to evaluate the antioxidant activities of oleuropein, and the IC50 were 34.540.14g/mL, 18.79 +/- 0.82g/mL, 75.32 +/- 1.83g/mL, 13.80 +/- 0.68g/mL and 1.00 +/- 0.08mg/mL, respectively. Practical ApplicationsThis study provides information on the changes in contents including oleuropein and total phenolics in a year to help understand the relationship between content of oleuropein and various influencing factors. Currently, the metabolic pathways of oleuropein are not clear. These results provide information for the study of the metabolism of phenolic compounds in olive and promote research at the molecular level. Oleuropein occupies a large proportion of total polyphenols in olive and can be to be purified by silica gel column chromatography with high purification efficiency for industrial production and laboratory production. In addition, the comprehensive evaluation of activity in vitro shows that oleuropein is more useful than BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) for the application in food and human health.

The molecular markers have substantial potential to improve the efficiency of conventional cucumber breeding. In this study, a total of 101157 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified across the cucumber 9930 genome. Most (69526 of 76103 or 91.36%) SSRs with unique flanking sequences (unique SSRs) had polymorphisms among 103 cucumber genomes; the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 34 with an average of 4.70. Next, we selected 7486 unique SSR loci with polymorphism information content (PIC) 0.5 and major allele differences (the size difference between the alleles with the highest and the second highest frequency) 3bp to design primers. The SSR marker polymorphisms were experimentally validated; 50 highly polymorphic SSR markers had polymorphisms with an average PIC of 0.44. PCR analysis also indicated that these SSR markers could be effectively used as molecular markers. The SSR fingerprints and polymorphic SSR markers with large major allele differences could enhance the efficiency of genetic research and marker-assisted breeding in cucumbers.

These proteins contain the conserved MYB domain and the ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) repression domain. Additionally, MYB4, MYB7 and MYB32 possess a putative zinc-finger domain and a conserved GY/FDFLGL motif in their C-termini. The protein sensitive to ABA and drought 2' (SAD2) recognizes the nuclear pore complex, which then transports the SAD2-MYB4 complex into the nucleus. Here, we show that the conserved GY/FDFLGL motif contributes to the interaction between MYB factors and SAD2. The AspAsn mutation in the GY/FDFLGL motif abolishes the interaction between MYB transcription factors and SAD2, and therefore they cannot be transported into the nucleus and cannot repress their target genes. We found that MYB4(D261N) loses the capacity to repress expression of the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) gene and biosynthesis of sinapoyl malate. Our results indicate conservation among MYB transcription factors in terms of their interaction with SAD2. Therefore, the AspAsn mutation may be used to engineer transcription factors. Significance Statement Subgroup 4 R2R3-type MYB transcriptional repressors repress phenylpropanoid synthesis. These transcription factors are translocated to the nucleus by interacting with SAD2, an importin. Here we show that mutating the interaction domain with SAD2 can prevent their translocation to the nucleus and stop their ability to repress phenylpropanoid gene expression. We propose that similar mutations could be used to engineer transcription factors.

In present study, we analyzed 128 elite clonal tea cultivars in China with 30 well-chosen simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, aiming at (1) characterizing a set of DNA markers for unambiguously fingerprinting clonal tea cultivars and (2) confirming or identifying the parent-offspring (PO) relationships among them. The results showed that the markers are highly polymorphic among the tested cultivars with an average allele number of 10.4 per locus and an average polymorphic information content of 0.704. Robust fingerprinting power was demonstrated: It was possible to fully discriminate all 128 cultivars by a combination of four markers, and the overall possibility of finding two random individuals having the same genotypes across the 30 loci was estimated to be 4.8 x 10(-33). Eight SSR loci were further recommended as a core marker set for fingerprinting the tea plant. Meanwhile, parentage analysis based on the fingerprint data revealed 47 pairs of putative PO relationships, among which 33 were in agreement with the known pedigree information, whereas the other 14 were newly identified in this study. The SSR markers and pedigree relationships reported here are valuable for tea cultivar identification and new breeding programs.

Liver HepG2 and LO2 cells were cultured in 12-well plates under the same condition until cells grew to complete confluence, and then cells were harvested for total RNA and protein extraction. The qPCRs were performed to compare gene expression of 14 selenoprotein genes and 5 cancer signaling-related genes. Enzyme activities were also assayed. The results showed that human hepatoma HepG2 cells grew faster than normal hepatocytes LO2 cells. Among the genes investigated, 10 selenoprotein genes (Gpx1, Gpx3, Gpx4, Selx, Sepp, Sepw1, Sepn1, Selt, Seli, Selh) and 3 cancer signaling-related genes (Bcl-2A, caspase-3, and P38) were upregulated (P< 0.05), while Selo and Bcl-2B were downregulated (P< 0.05) in hepatoma HepG2 cells compared to LO2 cells. Significant correlations were found between selenoprotein genes and the cancer signaling-related genes Caspase3, P53, Bc1-2A, and Bc1-2B. Our results revealed that selenoprotein genes were aberrantly expressed in hepatoma HepG2 cells compared to normal liver LO2 cells, which indicated that those selenoprotein genes may play important roles in the occurrence and development of liver carcinogenesis.

Satellite remote sensing can frequently supply spatially continuous information on earth surface, which is impossible from ground-based investigations, but remote sensing description is not able to directly obtain process parameters. In fact, in terms of fundamental theorem of surfaces, a surface is uniquely defined by the first fundamental coefficients, about the details of the surface observed when we stay on the surface, and the second fundamental coefficients, the change of the surface observed from outside the surface. A method for high accuracy surface modeling (HASM) has been developed initiatively to find solutions for error problem and slow-speed problem of earth surface modeling since 1986. HASM takes global approximate information (e.g., remote sensing images or model simulation results) as its driving field and local accurate information (e.g., ground observation data and/or sampling data) as its optimum control constraints. Its output satisfies the iteration stopping criterion which is determined by application requirement for accuracy. This paper reviews problems to be solved in every development stage and applications of HASM.

Soybean seeds were germinated in the presence and absence of light. Chlorophylls and morphological characteristics of sprouts were evaluated daily. Antioxidant activities were determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing activity power methods. Morphological characteristics of light-grown sprouts were superior to dark-grown sprouts and the metabolism of phenolic compounds was regulated by light. Light treatment improved accumulation of phenolic compounds in soybean sprouts and increased antioxidant activities. The optimum harvest time of light-grown sprouts was on the seventh day when sprouts achieved the best nutraceutical value. Green sprouts can serve as a good vegetable source for the human diet.

Viral pathogens are recognized at the time of infection by pattern recognition receptors; thus, the inflammatory cytokines (IL1 beta, IL6, and IL18) and antiviral cytokines (IFN alpha, IFN gamma) are secreted by innate immune cells and induced to respond to the pathogens. The objective of this study was to develop an effective and sensitive RT-qPCR assay for the rapid and accurate quantification of goose cytokines: IFN alpha, IFN gamma, IL1 beta, IL6, and IL18. Subsequently, the established methods were employed to detect the immune response in agonist-stimulated goose spleen cells in vitro. These data indicated that the established RT-qPCR is a reliable method for determining relative gene expression. The results revealed that Imiquimod led to the significant upregulation of goose IFN alpha (P < 0.01), IFN gamma (P < 0.01), IL1 beta (P < 0.01), IL6 (P < 0.01), and IL18 (P < 0.05). The established methods are important for scientific research and clinical applications, which require rapid and accurate results in a short period of time. The technique can potentially be used in the further research of goose molecular immunology, which will help us understand the interactions between hosts and pathogens.

DNA methylation as an important environment-induced mechanism could serve as a potential link between embryos' phenotypic variability and temperature variation, which reprogrammed by DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases (DNMTS) and Methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBPS) 3&5 (MBD3&5). Five genes in DNMTS and MBPS gene families were selected as target genes, given their important role in epigenetic modification. In this study, we aimed to test whether raising incubation temperature from 37.8. degrees C to 38.8. degrees C between embryonic days (ED) 1-10, ED10-20 and ED20-27 have effect on DNA methylation and whether DNMTS, MBPS play roles in thermal epigenetic regulation of early development in duck. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that increased incubation temperature by 1 degrees C has remarkably dynamic effect on gene ex-pression levels of DNMTS and MBPS. Slight changes in incubation temperature significantly increased mRNA levels of target genes in breast muscle tissue during ED1-10, especially for DNMT1, DNMT3A and MBD5. In addition, higher temperature significantly increased enzyme activities of DNMT1 in leg muscle during ED10-20, liver tissue during ED1-10, ED20-27 and DNMT3A in leg muscle and breast muscle tissue during ED10-20. These results suggest that incubation temperature has an extended effect on gene expression levels and enzyme activities of DNMTS and MBPS, which provides evidence that incubation temperature may influence DNA methylation in duck during early developmental stages. Our data indicated that DNMTS and MBPS may involved in thermal epigenetice regulation of embryos during the early development in duck. The potential links between embryonic temperature and epigenetic modification need further investigation	[Yan, Xi-ping; Liu, He-he; Liu, Jun-ying; Zhang, Rong-ping; Wang, Guo-song; Li, Qing-qing; Wang, Ding-min-cheng; Li, Liang; Wang, Ji-wen] Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat Key, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Wang, JW (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat Key, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	wjw2886166@163.com		Li, Liang/0000-0001-9139-5025	Chinese Agriculture Research Service [CARS-43-6]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31301964]; Major Project of Sichuan Education Department [13ZA0252]	This work was supported by Chinese Agriculture Research Service (No. CARS-43-6), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31301964), the Major Project of Sichuan Education Department (13ZA0252).		57	1	1	3	24	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0032-5791	1525-3171		POULTRY SCI	Poult.

In Exp. 1, the diet with supplemental antibiotics (containing pure Colistin sulfate and Enramycin, respectively, at 0.02 g/kg diet) and ZnO (2.5 g/kg diet) was used as the control (CON) group, and another diet without supplemental ZnO was prepared by inclusion of the SF3 (containing calcium formate, calcium lactate, citric acid and MCFA at 340, 160, 70 and 130 g/kg, respectively) at 3 g/kg diet. A total of 120 crossbred piglets (21-day old, 6.36 +/- 0.80 kg) were fed the same commercial prestart diet for one week and then fed the CON or SF3 diet for four weeks (ZnO was no longer supplemented in the CON diet during the second two-weeks), with 6 replicate pens (10 piglets/pen) per diet. Compared with the CON-fed piglets, the SF3-fed piglets had higher (P< 0.001) feed intake during the first two experimental weeks, higher (P< 0.05) body weight at the end of each of the four experimental weeks, and lower (P< 0.01) ratio of feed to gain during the first experimental week. In Exp. 2, diets were the same as in Exp. 1, except that chromium oxide was included at 3 g/kg diet at the expense of corn to evaluate apparent heal digestibility (AID) of dietary amino acids (AA). Fourteen crossbred piglets (28-day old, 9.05 +/- 1.38 kg) were housed individually in metabolism cages, fed the CON diet for one week and then fed the CON or SF3 diet for two weeks with 7 pigs (4 female and 3 male) per diet. Compared with the CON-fed piglets, the SF3-fed piglets had higher (P <0.05) AID of a majority of AA, lower (P< 0.05) plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) but higher (P< 0.05) plasma immunoglobulin-G concentrations, more (P< 0.05) Heal and rectal Lactobacillus content, and upregulated (P< 0.05) jejunal AA transporters (EAAT3 and CAT2) and regulatory cytokine (transforming growth factor beta) expression but downregulated (P< 0.05) jejunal proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha) expression. Taken together, dietary supplementation with a mixture of organic acids and MCFA contributed more than ZnO to growth of weanling pigs under commercial conditions. The improved growth of pigs was associated with increased AA digestibility and immunity. The stimulated regulatory cytokine expression and downregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression might be associated with increased proliferation of Lactobacillus following organic acids consumption.

To assess the behavioral adaptation of this species to forest fragments and its response to seasonal variation in food availability and climate, we present activity patterns of a group inhabiting an isolated forest based on two year-long studies in southern Yunnan, China. Annually, the gibbons spent nearly half of their active time resting, followed by moving and feeding. In both study periods, the time allocated to activities varied significantly between months, and was affected by food availability and climate factors. The group delayed retirement when tree fruit was abundant, and they decreased time spent moving and playing during periods of low fruit availability. In the cold months, the gibbons decreased time spent moving, and they decreased active time and resting time when rainfall was high. The results suggest that the group may seek to maximize net energy intake like energy maximizers when high quality food is most available, and adopt an energy-conserving strategy during periods of lower food availability and temperature. The gibbons showed similar diurnal variation in activity patterns to a group inhabiting a continuous forest at Dazhaizi, Mt. Wuliang, central Yunnan. However, they had a longer active period, and devoted more time to resting but less time to feeding. The individuals also spent lower percentages of time engaged in social behavior than those at Dazhaizi. These differences may be due to their smaller home range and unusual group composition caused by habitat fragmentation.

Understanding changes in decomposition rates (Rs) of soil organic matter (SOM) and temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) in alpine wetlands, under the scenarios of a warming climate and decreasing soil moisture, is important for predicting their carbon (C) budget. Here, we established three sampling transects from wetland edge to meadow in the Zoige alpine wetlands in China, which represented the gradients of decreasing soil moisture. We conducted an incubation experiment (5-25 A degrees C) to explore changes in Q (10) with the degradation process from alpine wetland to alpine meadow. The results showed that temperature significantly influenced Rs in all locations. Rs first increased from site I to site IV and then decreased from site IV to site V. However, Q (10) and activation energy (E (a) ) showed no apparent trends with soil coming from sites along a moisture gradient. Overall, the Q (10) values in the wetland (sites 1.50) were significantly lower than that of the meadow (1.83); similar trends were observed for E (a) . In addition, E (a) exhibited a negative logarithmic relationship with C quality indices in all locations, which suggested that the C quality-temperature hypothesis is applicable to both alpine wetlands and meadows. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for predicting the potential influences of warming climate on soil C turnover and storage in alpine wetlands.

The strain could degrade 54.83 % of beta-cypermethrin (beta-CY; 50 mg L-1) in 7 days and 100 % of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA; 100 mg L-1) in 22 h. The half-lives of beta-CY and 3-PBA range from 3.573 to 11.748 days and from 5.635 to 12.160 h, respectively. The degradation of beta-CY and 3-PBA was further described using first-order kinetic models. The pathway and mechanism of beta-CY degraded by YAT were investigated by analyzing the degraded metabolites through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Relevant enzymatic activities and substrate utilization were also investigated. beta-CY degradation products were analyzed. Results indicated that YAT strain transformed beta-CY into 3-PBA. 3-PBA was then gradually transformed into permethric acid, protocatechuic acid, 3-hydroxy-5-phenoxy benzoic acid, gallic acid, and phenol gradually. The YAT strain can also effectively degrade these metabolites. The results indicated that YAT strain has potential applications in bioremediation of pyrethroid insecticide (PI)-contaminated environments and fermented food.

Jian). The enterocytes were incubated in media containing 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mM/L Glu for 96 h. The results showed that Glu could promote fish enterocytes proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, activities of alkaline phosphatase, Na+, K+-ATPase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and creatine kinase were significantly improved with the increase in Glu level up to 6 mM/L. Lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and malondialdehyde content in the medium and cellular protein carbonyls were depressed by Glu. Moreover, optimum Glu significantly enhanced glutathione content and the activities and gene expression of catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase in enterocytes. Finally, the expression level of Nrf2 in enterocytes was significantly elevated by appropriate Glu content in the medium. Furthermore, optimum Glu significantly decreased Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 mRNA level in enterocytes. In conclusion, Glu improved the proliferation, function, and antioxidant capacity and regulated antioxidant-related signaling molecule expression of fish enterocytes.

The present study explored the apoptosis in hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot)-induced young and mature erythrocytes of Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). Carp erythrocytes from the peripheral blood were separated into the young fraction, the intermediate fraction and the mature fraction using fixed-angle centrifugation. The erythrocytes in three age fractions were treated with the caspase inhibitors (zVAD-fmk) in physiological carp saline (PCS) or Ca2+-free PCS in the presence of 40 mu M FeSO4/20 mu M H2O2. The results showed that the (OH)-O-center dot-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and DNA fragmentation are caspase dependent in carp erythrocytes. Furthermore, the ROS generation, PS exposure and DNA fragmentation in the more young fraction are more dependent on the caspase activity. This suggested that the caspases are involved in the (OH)-O-center dot-induced apoptosis in the young erythrocytes of fish. Results also indicated that Ca2+ is involved in (OH)-O-center dot-induced calpain activation, PS exposure and DNA fragmentation in carp erythrocytes. Moreover, the calpain activation, DNA fragmentation and PS exposure in the more mature fraction are more dependent on the levels of Ca2+. This revealed that (OH)-O-center dot-induced apoptosis is Ca2+ dependent in the mature erythrocytes of fish. Taken together, there might be two apoptosis pathways in fish erythrocytes: one is the caspase-dependent apoptosis in the young erythrocytes and the other is the Ca2+-involved apoptosis in the mature erythrocytes.

Forty-eight healthy 3-year-old G.eckloni (26 males: 525.79 +/- 48.56g weight, 34.51 +/- 1.88cm total length; 22 females: 507.60 +/- 54.48g weight, 33.97 +/- 1.84cm total length) were used for this study. Both male and female gonadal maturity were at stage III (maturing). The fish were reared in 25-36m(2) outdoor tanks at dissolved oxygen 6.86 +/- 0.48mgL(-1), pH 7.22 +/- 0.58, temperature 12.40 +/- 0.94 degrees C and stocking density 50-80 fishm(-3) during November 2014. The fish were fed commercial carp floating foods containing 35% crude protein three times daily. Haematological values were performed manually on heparin anticoagulated blood specimens using standard methods. The morphological features of blood cells and differential cell counts were done on Wright-Giemsa stained blood smears with no anticoagulants. Erythrocytes, leucocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) and thrombocytes were distinguished and characterized under light microscope. The percentage of the different leukocytes revealed predominance of small lymphocytes (male: 62.31 +/- 2.06%; female: 63.00 +/- 2.25%) and nurophiles (male: 23.85 +/- 1.51%; female: 23.49 +/- 1.67%) followed by fewer monocytes (male: 4.81 +/- 0.68%; female: 4.80 +/- 0.77%) and few eosinophils (male: 3.73 +/- 0.82%; female: 3.52 +/- 0.67%). The nurophile percentages of each stage showed that metamyelocyte accounted for the most (male: 13.29 +/- 0.88%; female: 13.07 +/- 0.98%), followed by banded ones (male: 7.18 +/- 0.49%; female: 7.00 +/- 0.58%). The microstructure of G.eckloni blood cells was similar to that of other fish. Sex-dependent differences for the erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin, haematocrit and mean corpuscular haemoglobin were found (P<0.05 or P<0.01); while differences in other haematological parameters (P>0.05) and blood cell morphology between male and female fish were not significant. Hematologic parameters and knowledge of morphological characteristics of male and female G.eckloni blood cells could be utilized to evaluate the health status of this species in captivity.

These two polyelectrolytes are both consisted of isoindigo units and phenylenevinylene units. In the UV-vis absorption spectra, both (+)-PIDPV and (-)-PIDPV exhibit broad absorption bands that almost cover the whole visible region. Photophysical investigations reveal that the fluorescence of water-soluble PPV can be efficiently quenched by oppositely charged PIDPV at a very low concentration. Cationic PPV shows an efficient quenching effect with K-SV = 1.01 x 10(6) M-1 in the presence of (-)-PIDPV while the anionic PPV gives a lager quenching constant with K-SV = 1.71 X 10(6) M-1 in the presence of (+)-PIDPV. Furthermore, the blend films of water-soluble PPVs and oppositely charged PIDPV also exhibit excellent quenching effect. These properties suggest that (+)-PIDPV and (-)-PIDPV are promising materials in the application of ionic photoactive layer in the organic solar cells. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Per cent weight gain (PWG), special growth rate (SGR), feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), anti-hydroxy radical (AHR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reducase (GR) activities and glutathione (GSH) content were significantly increased with increasing levels of Zn up to a point, and thereafter declined (P < 0.05). Serum zinc, alkaline phosphatase (AKP), muscle antisuperoxide anion (ASA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities and collagen content were significantly enhanced with dietary zinc levels up to a point (P < 0.05), beyond which it plateaued. Cooking loss, shear force and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly reduced with increasing level of zinc up to a point, and thereafter increased (P < 0.05). The pH value significantly increased with the increasing zinc levels, whereas the trend of protein carbonyl content was opposite. Flesh quality was positively related to the antioxidant enzymes activities in muscle of young grass carp. These results indicated that optimum zinc could improve growth, and improve flesh quality partly through improving muscle antioxidant status of young grass carp.

Cell counting kit-8 assay was employed to establish the growth curve of duck primary preadipocytes. Meanwhile, after the cells reaching full confluency, they were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes by the addition of a cocktail containing dexamethasone, insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and oleic acid for 8 days. Successful differentiation was demonstrated by the development of lipid droplets and the expression of key marker genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (CEBP/alpha) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4). Our results showed that duck primary preadipocytes began to adhere 12 h after seeding as short spindle shapes or litter triangles, which grew quickly 3 days post attachment and maintained stable after day 7. After 8 days the preadipocytes were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes, which were stained red by oil red O. Additionally, it showed that during preadipocyte differentiation PPAR gamma mRNA was highly expressed at day 3, while CEBP/alpha and FABP4 mRNA peaked at day 5 and 8, respectively. These results indicate that we have successfully isolated and cultured Peking duck preadipocytes and successfully induced them to differentiate into mature adipocytes. This work could lay a foundation for further research into waterfowl adipogenesis.

However, the effects of different chronosequence phases on the quantity and quality of SOC in such plantations were poorly understood. In this study, we investigated SOC dynamics following farmland conversion to tea plantations of 16-, 23-, 31-, and >50 years old in Zhongfeng Township of Mingshan County, Sichuan, which is in southwest China. We specifically examined the effects of the age of various tea plantations on the concentrations of SOC and LOC, including readily oxidizable carbon (ROC), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and mineralizable organic carbon (MOC) within soil water-stable aggregates. We found that the contents of very coarse fraction (>5 mm) and very fine fraction (<0.25 mm) dominated in the soil of the different tea plantations. Importantly, contents of water-stable aggregates at the size of >5 mm and mean weight diameter (MWD) in 23 year old tea plantation were seen to be higher when compared with >50 years, indicating that maximum soil stability was within soil macro-aggregates. SOC, ROC, POC, MBC, and MOC contents were reduced with the decreasing of particle size except for WSOC. On the whole, the SOC concentrations in >50 yr. of tea plantations at two soil depths were significantly lower than those of 23 yr. In addition to WSOC, other LOC contents changed in trends parallel to SOC, demonstrating that tea plantation reaching up to about 23 years contributed more to the soil quality than >50 yr.

A total of forty-eight DLY pigs (initial body weight of 74.9 +/- 5.0 kg) were randomly allotted to two treatments, and fed either with LR (DAR: 12/88) or HR (DAR: 30/70) diet. Results showed that ingestion of a HR diet not only decreased the triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations in plasma (P < 0.05), but also reduced the lipid contents in liver (P < 0.05). Interestingly, ingestion of a HR diet tended to reduce the intramuscular fat content (P = 0.06), and significantly increased the firmness (P < 0.05) and loin-eye area (P < 0.01). Moreover, ingestion of a HR diet significantly decreased the levels of MyHC I (P < 0.05), and elevated the levels of MyHCIIb (P < 0.05) gene expression in longissimus dorsi. Ingestion of a HR diet has resulted in down-regulation of the FAS(3) gene in liver and longissimus dorsi (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that a HR diet is helpful to reduce the lipogenesis both in liver and muscle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exposure experiments monitoring the size evolution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated AgNPs in organic solutions confirm the capacity of SDBS, NAC and EDTA to partly displace PVP. Single Pulse Column Experiment (SPCE) results show both the PVP polymer and the silver core controlled AgNP deposition while the effect of the PVP was dominant. Results of Co-injected Pulse Column Experiments (CPCEs) where AgNP and SDBS or NAC were co-injected into the column following a very short mixing (<1 s) disprove our hypothesis that coating-alternation by particle associated organic would mobilize irreversibly deposited particles from the uncoated sand, while surface charge modification by adsorbed NAC was identified as a potential mobilizing mechanism for AgNP from the iron-oxide-coated sand. Triple Pulse Column Experiment (TPCE) results confirm that such a charging effect of the adsorbed organic molecules may enable SDBS and NAC to mobilize AgNPs from the iron-oxide-coated sands. TPCE results with five distinct levels of SDBS indicate that concentration-stimulated change in the SDBS format from an individual to a micelle significantly increased the mobilizing efficiency and site blockage of SDBS. Although being an electrolyte, EDTA did not mobilize AgNPs, as the case with SDBS or NAC, as it dissolved the iron oxides which in turn prevented EDTA adsorption on sand. The findings have implications for better understanding the behavior of polymer-coated nanoparticles in organic-presented groundwater systems, i.e., detachment-associated uncertainty in exposure prediction of the nanomaterials.

However, the characteristics of the Aux/IAA gene family in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have long been unknown. In this study, a comprehensive identification of the Aux/IAA gene family was performed using the latest draft genome sequence of the bread wheat "Chinese Spring." Thirty-four Aux/IAA genes were identified, 30 of which have duplicated genes on the A, B or D sub-genome, with a total of 84 Aux/IAA sequences. These predicted Aux/IAA genes were non randomly distributed in all the wheat chromosomes except for chromosome 2D. The information of wheat Aux/IAA proteins is also described. Based on an analysis of phylogeny, expression and adaptive evolution, we prove that the Aux/IAA family in wheat has been replicated twice in the two allopolyploidization events of bread wheat, when the tandem duplication also occurred. The duplicated genes have undergone an evolutionary process of purifying selection, resulting in the high conservation of copy genes among sub-genomes and functional redundancy among several members of the TalAA family. However, functional divergence probably existed in most TalAA members due to the diversity of the functional domain and expression pattern. Our research provides useful information for further research into the function of Aux/IAA genes in wheat.

F-SP TRITICI; SALICYLIC-ACID; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; QUANTUM YIELD; WINTER-WHEAT; OXYGEN; STRESS; GENE	Wheat stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst), is one of the most serious diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. To gain a better understanding of the protective mechanism against stripe rust at the adult plant stage, the differences in photosystem II and antioxidant enzymatic systems between susceptible and resistant wheat in response to stripe rust disease (P striiformis) were investigated. We found that chlorophyll fluorescence and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes were higher in resistant wheat than in susceptible wheat after stripe rust infection. Compared with the susceptible wheat, the resistant wheat accumulated a higher level of D1 protein and a lower level of reactive oxygen species after infection. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that D1 and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) phosphorylation are involved in the resistance to stripe rust in wheat. The CP29 protein was phosphorylated under stripe rust infection, like its phosphorylation in other monocots under environmental stresses. More extensive damages occur on the thylakoid membranes in the susceptible wheat compared with the resistant wheat. The findings provide evidence that thylakoid protein phosphorylation and antioxidant enzyme systems play important roles in plant responses and defense to biotic stress.

Many studies have documented the contributions of soil fauna to litter decomposition, but the effects of the soil fauna on labile substances (i.e., DOC and TDN) in litter during early decomposition are not completely clear. Therefore, a field litterbag experiment was carried out from 13th November 2013 to 23rd October 2014 in an alpine forest and an alpine meadow located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Litterbags with different mesh sizes were used to provide access to or prohibit the access of the soil fauna, and the concentrations of DOC and TDN in the foliar litter were measured during the winter (the onset of freezing, deep freezing and thawing stage) and the growing season (early and late). After one year of field incubation, the concentration of DOC in the litter significantly decreased, whereas the TDN concentration in the litter increased. Similar dynamic patterns were detected under the effects of the soil fauna on both DOC and TDN in the litter between the alpine forest and the alpine meadow. The soil fauna showed greater positive effects on decreasing DOC concentration in the litter in the winter than in the growing season. In contrast, the dynamics of TND in the litter were related to seasonal changes in environmental factors, rather than the soil fauna. In addition, the soil fauna promoted a decrease in litter DOC/TDN ratio in both the alpine forest and the alpine meadow throughout the first year of decomposition, except for in the late growing season. These results suggest that the soil fauna can promote decreases in DOC and TDN concentrations in litter, contributing to early litter decomposition in these cold biomes.

QDs aroused significant interest in the bio-imaging field through integrating the fluorescence properties of QDs and the delivery function of biomaterial. The natural tropism of Canine Parvovirus (CPV) to the transferrin receptor can target specific cells to increase the targeting ability of QDs in cell imaging. CPV virus-like particles (VLPs) from the expression of the CPV-VP2 capsid protein in a prokaryotic expression system were examined to encapsulate the QDs and deliver to cells with an expressed transferrin receptor. CPV-VLPs were used to encapsulate QDs that were modified using 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Gel electrophoresis, fluorescence spectrum, particle size, and transmission electron microscopy verified the conformation of a complex, in which QDs were encapsulated in CPV-VLPs (CPV-VLPs-QDs). When incubated with different cell lines, CPV-VLPs-QDs significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of QDs and selectively labeled the cells with high-level transferrin receptors. Cell-targeted labeling was achieved by utilizing the specific binding between the CPV capsid protein VP2 of VLPs and cellular receptors. CPV-VLPs-QDs, which can mimic the native CPV infection, can recognize and attach to the transferrin receptors on cellular membrane. Therefore, CPV-VLPs can be used as carriers to facilitate the targeted delivery of encapsulated nanomaterials into cells via receptor-mediated pathways. This study confirmed that CPV-VLPs can significantly promote the biocompatibility of nanomaterials and could expand the application of CPV-VLPs in biological medicine.

By using the conjugate system of the complex-valued neural networks and Brouwer's fixed point theorem, sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium are obtained. Some criteria on globally exponential stability of the equilibrium of the complex-valued neural networks are also established by using a delay differential inequality. These results are easy to apply to the study of the complex-valued neural networks whether their activation functions are explicitly expressed by separating their real and imaginary parts or not. Two examples with numerical simulations are given to highlight the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Results showed that E. adenophorum induced typical apoptotic features of renal cells. E. adenophorum significantly suppressed renal cells viability, caused cell cycle activity arrest and induced typical apoptotic features in a dose-dependent manner. However, the protein levels of Fas/FasL, Bid and caspase-8 did not appear significant changes in the process of E. adenophorum-induced apoptosis. Moreover, E. adenophorum administration slightly decreased Bcl-2 expression, promoted Bax translocation to mitochondria, triggered the release of Cyt c from mitochondria into cytosol and activated caspase-9, -3, and cleaved PARP. The mitochondrial p53 translocation was significantly activated, accompanied by a significant increase in the loss of Delta psi m, Cyt c release and caspase-9 activation. Above all, these data suggest that E. adenophorum induces renal cells apoptosis via the activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway in renal cells. These findings may provide new insights to understand the mechanisms involved in E. adenophorum-caused cytotoxicity of renal cells.

Fertility-promoting intrauterine infusion liquid (FPL), an effective alternative to hormone therapy, is associated with short retention time and low therapeutic efficacy. To address these problems, we developed a thermosensitive in situ gel based on poloxamer 407 for local uterine administration. To achieve the desired gelling temperature and enhance local retention property, we added poloxamer 188 and HPMC to the formulation containing poloxamer 407 and FPL. After screening was performed, the optimized formulation showed good temperature sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Gelation temperature was approximately 27 degrees C. In vitro release tests showed that icariin (the major active compound in FPL) was slow released from in situ forming gel. After the gel was locally administered, uterine and ovarian indexes were significantly increased in the gel group compared with the control group (P<0.05). The serum estradiol level of the gel group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.01). Histological evaluation did not show mucosa irritation in the gel group. Therefore, the proposed in situ forming gel system based on poloxamer 407 is a promising local drug delivery system to treat bovine uterine diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since there may be fewer cell cycles per year in the germlines of long-lived than short-lived angiosperms, the genomes of long-lived angiosperms may be diverging more slowly than those of short-lived angiosperms. Here we test this hypothesis. Results: We first constructed a genetic map for walnut, a woody perennial. All linkage groups were short, and recombination rates were greatly reduced in the centromeric regions. We then used the genetic map to construct a walnut bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone-based physical map, which contained 15,203 exonic BAC-end sequences, and quantified with it synteny between the walnut genome and genomes of three long-lived woody perennials, Vitis vinifera, Populus trichocarpa, and Malus domestica, and three short-lived herbs, Cucumis sativus, Medicago truncatula, and Fragaria vesca. Each measure of synteny we used showed that the genomes of woody perennials were less diverged from the walnut genome than those of herbs. We also estimated the nucleotide substitution rate at silent codon positions in the walnut lineage. It was one-fifth and one-sixth of published nucleotide substitution rates in the Medicago and Arabidopsis lineages, respectively. We uncovered a whole-genome duplication in the walnut lineage, dated it to the neighborhood of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, and allocated the 16 walnut chromosomes into eight homoeologous pairs. We pointed out that during polyploidy-dysploidy cycles, the dominant tendency is to reduce the chromosome number. Conclusion: Slow rates of nucleotide substitution are accompanied by slow rates of synteny erosion during genome divergence in woody perennials.

Here we develop a novel and rapid method for serodiagnosis of T. multiceps infections via an indirect ELISA (iELISA) that uses a heat shock protein, namely, TmHSP70. We extracted the total RNA of T. multiceps from the protoscoleces of cysts dissected from the brains of infected goats. Subsequently, we successfully amplified, cloned and expressed the TmHSP70 gene in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein (similar to 34 kDa molecular weight) was recognized by the coenurosis positive serum. Given these initial, robust immunogenic properties for recombinant TmHSP protein, we assessed the ELISA-based serodiagnostic potential of this gene. The indirect ELISA was then optimized to 2.70 mu g/well dilution for antigen and 1:80 dilution for serum,while the cut-off value is 0.446. We report that our novel TmHSP ELISA detected T. multiceps sera with a sensitivity of 1:10240 and a specificity of 83.3% (5/6). In a preliminary application, this assay correctly confirmed T. multiceps infection in 30 infected goats, consistent with the clinical examination. This study has revealed that our novel iELISA, which uses the rTmHSP protein, provides a rapid test for diagnosing coenurosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results: First, mouse metaphase II (MII) oocytes were vitrified in the open-pulled straws (OPS). After warming, they were cultured for 1 h in M-2 medium containing melatonin at different concentrations (0, 10(-9), 10(-7), 10(-5), 10(-3) mol/L). Then the oocytes were used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels (fluorescence microscopy), and the developmental potential after parthenogenetic activation. The experimental results showed that the ROS level and cleavage rate in 10(-3) mol/L melatonin group was significantly lower than that in melatonin-free group (control). The GSH levels and blastocyst rates in all melatonin-treated groups were similar to that in control. Based on the above results, we detected the expression of gene Hsp90aa1, Hsf1, Hspa1b, Nrf2 and Bcl-x1 with qRT-PCR in oocytes treated with 10(-7), or 10(-3) mol/L melatonin and untreated control. After warming and culture for 1 h, the oocytes showed higher Hsp90aa1 expression in 10(-7) mol/L melatonin-treated group than in the control (P < 0.05); the Hsf1, Hsp90aa1 and Bcl-x1 expression were significantly decreased in 10(-3) mol/L melatonin-treated group when compared to the control. Based on the above results and previous research, we detected the development of vitrified-warmed oocytes treated with either 10(-7) or 0 mol/L melatonin by in vitro fertilization. No difference was observed between them. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the supplementation of melatonin (10(-9) to 10(-3) mol/L) in culture medium and incubation for 1 h did not improve the subsequent developmental potential of vitrified-warmed mouse MII oocytes, even if there were alteration in gene expression.

Based on the spin-polarized density-functional theory, coalbed methane (CBM, the main components are CH4, CO2 and H2O) adsorption on X-Gr was investigated and the corresponding adsorption energy, adsorption equilibrium distance, Mulliken charge, charge density differences and density of states were well discussed. The result show that Al- and Si-Gr are sensitive to CBM, whereas CBM adsorptions on P- and S-Gr are found to be physical adsorption. In brief, the interactions between CBM and X-Gr are slightly depend on the orientations of CBM gas molecules and the metallicity of the dopants in Gr. The higher adsorption energy, the higher metallicity of the dopants becomes, namely Al-Gr>Si-Gr>P-Gr>S-Gr. Through systematical and theoretical analysis, we found that CO2 and H2O were easy to adsorb on surface models of coal than CH4. Hence, injection of CO2 or H2O in coal seams could enhance CH, recovery. In addition, we suggest that Al- and Si-Gr could be a good gas sensors for CBM because of the higher interactions between Al-/Si-Gr and CBM.

Many factors affect the release of nutrients from the waterborne polymer-coated CRF, but the effects of thermal post-treatments remain unclear. In this study, a waterborne polyacrylate-coated CRF was post-treated at different temperatures (30 degrees C, 60 degrees C, and 80 degrees C) and durations (2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h) after being developed in the Wurster fluidized bed. To characterize the polyacrylate membrane, and hence to analyze the mechanism of nutrient release, Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy were employed. The nutrient-release model of CRF post-treated at 30 degrees C was the inverse "L" curve, but an increased duration of the post-treatment had no effect. The nutrient-release model was "S" curve and nutrient-release period was enhanced at higher post-treatment temperatures, and increased post-treatment duration lengthened slowed nutrient release due to a more compact membrane and a smoother membrane surface as well as a promoted crosslinking action. CRF equipped with specified nutrient-release behaviors can be achieved by optimizing the thermal post-treatment parameters, which can contribute to the development and application of waterborne polymer-coated CRF and controlled-release technologies.

It belongs to the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group, which contains six species. Among these six species, B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis, and B. cereus have a low genetic diversity. B. thuringiensis strain HD521 shows maroon colony which is different from most of the B. thuringiensis strains. Strain HD521 also displays an ability to inhibit plant sheath blight disease pathogen (Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IB) growth and can form bipyramidal parasporal crystals consisting of three cry7 genes. These crystals have an insecticidal activity against Henosepilachna vigintioctomaculata larva (Coleoptera). Here we report the complete genome sequence of strain HD521, which has one chromosome and six circular plasmids.

However, research on how plant respond to various kinds of heavy metal stress is scarcely reported, especially for understanding of complex molecular regulatory mechanisms and elucidating the gene networks of plant respond to Cd stress. Here, transcriptomic changes during Mo17 and B73 seedlings development responsive to Cd pollution were investigated and comparative RNAseq-based approach in both genotypes were performed. 115 differential expression genes (DEGs) with significant alteration in expression were found co-modulated in both genotypes during the maize seedling development; of those, most of DGEs were found comprised of stress and defense responses proteins, transporters, as well as transcription factors, such as thaumatin-like protein, ZmOPR2 and ZmOPR5. More interestingly, genotype-specific transcriptional factors changes induced by Cd stress were found contributed to the regulatory mechanism of Cd sensitivity in both different genotypes. Moreover, 12 co-expression modules associated with specific biological processes or pathways (M1 to M12) were identified by consensus co-expression network. These results will expand our understanding of complex molecular mechanism of response and defense to Cd exposure in maize seedling roots. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Chemicals to induce plastid signals in Arabidopsis seedlings	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Plastid signals; tetrapyrroles; abscisic acid; gun mutant; carbon-nitrogen heterocyclic compounds	CHELATASE H-SUBUNIT; NUCLEAR GENE-EXPRESSION; ABSCISIC-ACID RECEPTOR; CHLOROPHYLL BIOSYNTHESIS; STRESS RESPONSES; THALIANA; LIGHT; SUGAR; ABA; IDENTIFICATION	Tetrapyrroles and abscisic acid (ABA) were considered as plastid signal molecules for plant cells. However, they attract hot controversies. High levels of sugars also trigger plastid signals to regulate nuclear gene expression. However, the effective concentrations of sugar are extremely high (100-10,000 times of tetrapyrroles). To resolve these controversies and inconsistencies, we investigated which chemicals at what concentrations may work as plastid signal molecules, and summarize their common chemical structures. We found that they can be classified into two categories: (1) tetrapyrroles or other carbon-nitrogen heterocyclic compounds with an adjacent three-membered ring (two of them may be incomplete), with a signaling impact order: Mg-protoporphyrin IX/ABA>Fe-protoporphyrin IX>Zn-protoporphyrin IX>protoporphyrin IX>tryptophan>histidine. The completeness of the rings with a chelated metal ion has a positive effect on the effectiveness of plastid signaling stimulation. (2) Sugar or other carbon-oxygen (sulfur) five- or six-membered ring compounds, such as cyclohexane and thiophene. The effective concentrations of the second category of signal molecules are very high (about 400mM for the monosaccharide). The two types of signal molecules are possibly perceived by different receptors in the plastid.

A total of 24 crossbred barrows weaned at 21 d of age were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 diets supplemented with 1.00% L-leucine or 0.68% L-alanine (isonitrogenous control) for 17 d. On day 11, all pigs were orally infused PRV or the sterile essential medium. During the first 10 d of trial, dietary leucine supplementation could improve the feed efficiency (P = 0.09). The ADG and feed efficiency were impaired by PRV infusion (P<0.05). PRV infusion also increased mean cumulative score of diarrhea, serum rotavirus antibody concentration and crypt depth of the jejunal mucosa (P<0.05), and decreased villus height: crypt depth (P = 0.07), goblet cell numbers (P<0.05), mucin 1 and 2 concentrations (P<0.05) and phosphorylated mTOR level (P<0.05) of the jejunal mucosa in weaned pigs. Dietary leucine supplementation could attenuate the effects of PRV infusion on feed efficiency (P = 0.09) and mean cumulative score of diarrhea (P = 0.09), and improve the effects of PRV infusion on villus height: crypt depth (P = 0.06), goblet cell numbers (P<0.05), mucin 1 (P = 0.08) and 2 (P = 0.07) concentrations and phosphorylated mTOR level (P = 0.08) of the jejunal mucosa in weaned pigs. These results suggest that dietary 1% leucine supplementation alleviated the decrease of mucin production and goblet cell numbers in the jejunal mucosa of weaned pigs challenged by PRV possibly via activation of the mTOR signaling.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of swainsonine about the immunotoxic effects on pregnant mice in vivo. Results: The peripheral Th1/Th2 was detected by Ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of phase pregnant mice. Relevant cytokines in serum was evaluated after exposed to different dose of swainsonine. Gene expression of IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-10 in PBMC was assessed by real-time PCR. Swainsonine caused vacuolization phenomenon of lutein cells and a dose-effect relationship. The IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were promoted, but IL-4 and IL-10 were suppressed in serum. Swainsonine significantly increased IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha nuclear translocation and decreased IL-4 and IL-10. Swainsonine resulted in a significant shift of peripheral Th1/Th2 paradigm to Th1. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the immunomodulatory of swainsonine disturbed the regular immunologic state of the pregnant mice. This may increase the risk of abortion and probably resulted in serious disorders in reproduction of livestock.

Ninety weaned piglets were randomly allotted to five groups for 28-day study. Blood samples were collected at 32, 39, 46, and 53 days of age. The results showed that AMP as dietary additive increased the levels of IgG, IgM, IgA, CSF-Ab, CH50 among the whole experimental period, and the effects of AMP supplementation were dose-dependent. The study showed that supplementing weaned piglets diets with AMP enhanced the humoral immune responses of weaned piglets by improving the levels of classical swine fever virus antibody, CH50, and immunoglobulins. We suggest the dosage of AMP was 500 mg/kg.	[Yuan, W.; Jin, H. T.; Ren, Z. H.; Deng, J. L.; Zuo, Z. C.; Wang, Y.; Deng, H. D.; Deng, Y.

The limit of detection was less than 100 ng/mL by visual assessment and was found to be 91.78 +/- 0.17 ng/mL for quantitative detection using a test strip reader. The recoveries of test samples were from 89.26% to 102.02% and the coefficient of variation (%) was less than 4.75%. Parallel analysis of cucumber samples with CTN showed comparable results from the strip test and high performance liquid chromatography. The strip test requires 5-8 min to complete and provides a very useful screening method for the quantitative and qualitative detection of CTN residues in cucumber.

This study utilized three non-linear growth models (Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and logistic) to fit the growth curve of Liangshan pigs from an unselected, random-bred pig population and estimate the pigs most suitable slaughter weight. The growth development data at 20 time points of 275 Liangshan pigs (from birth to 250 d) were collected. To analyze the relative gene expression related to development, seven slaughter weight phases (50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, and 98 kg) (20 pigs per phase) were examined. We found that the Liangshan pig growth curve fit the typical S-curve well and that their growth turning point was 193.4 days at a weight of 62.5 kg, according to the best fit Von Bertalanffy model based on the goodness of fit criteria. Furthermore, we estimated that the most suitable slaughter weight was 62.5 to 74.9 kg based on the growth curve and the relative expression levels of growth-related genes.
