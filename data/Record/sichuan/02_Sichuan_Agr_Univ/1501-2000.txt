Studies were carried out on Tianfu ducks on days 24 and 27 of embryogenesis (E24 and E27) along with days 20, 70, and 200 of postnatal development (P20, P70, and P200). Results showed that the percentage of G(0)/G(1) bursa cells significantly increased between E24 and P200 while the percentage of cells in the S phase or G(2) + M phase as well as the proliferating index obviously decreased during the same period. Proliferation cell nuclear antigen was detected in lymphocyte and interfollicular epithelium. The proliferative lymphocyte density tended to decrease from E24 to P200. Apoptotic bodies in macrophages, free apoptotic bodies, or nuclei with condensed chromatin in lymphocytes in follicles were identified by transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. Both flow cytometry and microscopic analysis reveal that the proportion of apoptotic cells and apoptotic lymphocyte density increased from E24 to P20, fell on P70, then rose again on P200. Our foundings demonstrate that cell proliferation decreases and apoptosis increases with age. These changes may account for duck bursa development and involution.

The results indicated that vascular bundle density, fiber proportion, specific gravity and compression strength parallel to grain (CSPG) increased from culm bottom to top. Bamboo culm height could significantly affect the mechanical properties of the BP. The shear strength (SS) of the BP decreased with increasing culm height, while the compressive strength (CS) increased. The maximum modulus of rupture (MOR) and tensile strength (TS) was observed at middle portion of culm. Significant correlation was found between vascular bundle density, specific gravity, culm wall thickness of original bamboo and the CS, SS of the BP.

The Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic reconstructions partitioned the species into two reciprocally monophyletic groups. Kengyilia melanthera was related to species of Agropyron, whereas the other species were related to species of Pseudoroegneria and Roegneria. These results indicate that there have been at least two phylogenetically divergent maternal donors within Kengyilia, i.e. Agropyron (P genome) and Pseudoroegneria (St genome). In addition, the St genome of Kengyilia had several origins and diverse species of Pseudoroegneria might have taken part in the formation of polyploid species of Kengyilia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Br.; Hemarthria altissima; Genetic diversity; EST-SSR; SCoT	MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; SOUTH CHINA; PLANTS; AFLP	There is a need for an appropriate evaluation of Hemarthria germplasm resources using genetic analysis. Understanding their genetic background will promote effective development and utilization of its germplasm resources in plant breeding. We examined the genetic diversity and relationships among 46 Hemarthria germplasm resources from four continents. Expressed Sequence Tags-Simple Sequence Repeat (EST-SSR) and Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers were used to investigate species Hemarthria altissima (36), Hemarthria compressa (8) and Hemarthria uncinata (2). We selected 19 EST-SSR primers and generated 550 polymorphic (94.7%). Twenty one SCoT primers were selected and amplified to produce 597 bands with 89.4% of polymorphic bands. The Mantel test between EST-SSR and SCoT matrices revealed significant correlations (r = 0.854) and the data from both markers were combined for cluster analysis. The 46 materials were clustered into two main groups by UPGMA clustering with a similarity coefficient ranging from 0.573 to 0.940 and the dendrogram was basically concordant with geographical origins and species. Among the three Hemarthria species, H. altissima was genetically closest to H. compressa while it was not close to H. uncinata. When the utility of the two markers were compared, we found EST-SSR to be more efficient than SCoT in determining the genetic diversity study of Hemarthria species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

L Liu, Fagopyrum pugense T. Yu, Fagopyrum qiangcai D. Q. Bai and Fagopyrum wenchuanense J. R. Shao, have been identified and described based on their morphological characters. This study investigates the phylogenetic relationship, nucleotide sequence polymorphisms of internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) and the maturase K (matK) gene within four wild species related to western Sichuan buckwheat. F. wenchuanense is closely related to Fagopyrum gracilipes while E qiangcai is closely related to Fagopyrum esculentum based on their morphological differences. However, E wenchuanense is more closely related to Fagopyrum cymosum and E qiangcai is closer to Fagopyrum lineare and Fagopyrum leptopodum from the viewpoint of the ITS, and matK analysis. In addition, E gracilipes is closer to E pugense and Fagopyrum crispatofolium than to E qiangcai. E wenchuanense belongs to the cymosum group, while E qiangcai, F. pugense and E crispatifolium are classified into the urophyllum group based on their morphological and molecular analysis. Conducting morphological and molecular studies provide a better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms and genetic relationships of cultivated and wild buckwheat in western Sichuan, China.

Field experiments with no N treatment, famer's fertilizer practice (FFP), three optimized nitrogen managements (ONMs), and three PASP-urea treatments (PASPTs) were conducted at Shehong and Wenjiang, Sichuan Province, in 2013. The results showed that the N fertilizer increased crop N uptake and total N output, but intensified the apparent N losses. Compared to FFP, ONMs and PASPTs (excluding ONM2 and PASPT1 at Shehong) increased N accumulation in plant organs before anthesis, which significantly (p < 0.05) increased crop N uptake and N recovery efficiency (NRE), but reduced N production efficiency and N physiological efficiency (NPE), as well as apparent N losses at both the sites. However, the effectiveness of N treatments on N utilization and soil N balance was associated with the initial soil N-min (amount of inorganic N accumulation). ONM3 (a 15% increase in the N rate over that used in the FFP) increased N accumulation, NRE, and N agronomy efficiency (NAE) of rice at Shehong, whereas ONM2 (a 15% reduction in the N rate over that used in the FFP) reduced N loss but significantly (p < 0.05) increased NPE, NAE, and N partial factor productivity at Wenjiang. PASP-urea, especially PASPT3 (PASP urea spilt-applied in four stages), significantly (p < 0.05) reduced apparent N surplus before anthesis and N deficit after anthesis, resulting in higher crop N uptake and N use efficiency. Therefore, split-application of N at an optimal rate and PASP-urea could improve the balance between plant N requirement and N input and thus enhance N use efficiency and/or reduce N losses.

The effects of STL dosage, concentration of initial solution, and pH were analyzed in the combined treatment. Results showed that the combined treatment was effective for dye wastewater degradation; when the dosage of STLs was 3.2 g/L, the degradation efficiency reached 90% after 15 min treatment, and STLs showed a good repeatability. The degradation rate decreased with increasing initial MB concentration but not related to the solution pH in the combined treatment. Fourier-transform infrared spectra and N-2 adsorption suggested that the number of acidic and basic groups in the STL surface increased after the treatment, but the surface area and pore volume remained unchanged.

In this study, we investigated the functions of its tomato homolog, namely SIREV. Overexpression of a microRNA166-resistant version of SIREV (35S::REVRis) not only resulted in vegetative abnormalities such as curly leaves and fasciated stems, but also caused dramatic reproductive alterations including continuous production of flowers at the pedicel abscission zone (AZ) and ectopic fruit formation on receptacles. Microscopic analysis showed that meristem-like structures continuously emerged from the exodermises of the pedicel AZs and that ectopic carpels formed between the first and second whorl of floral buds in 35S::REVRis plants. Transcriptional data suggest that SlREV may regulate genes related to meristem maintenance and cell differentiation in the development of the flower pedicel abscission zone, and modulate genes in homeodomain and MADS-box families and hormone pathways during fruit formation. Altogether, these results reveal novel roles of SIREV in tomato flower development and fruit formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rice flowering time (heading date) is an important agronomic trait for season adaption and grain yield, which is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. During the last decade, as the nature of florigen was identified, notable progress has been made on exploration how florigen gene expression is genetically controlled. In Arabidopsis expression of certain key flowering integrators such as FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are also epigenetically regulated by various chromatin modifications, however, very little is known in rice on this aspect until very recently. This review summarized the advances of both genetic networks and chromatin modifications in rice flowering time control, attempting to give a complete view of the genetic and epigenetic architecture in complex network of rice flowering pathways.

In this study, the P phytoremediation potential of a mining (ME) and nonmining ecotype (NME) of Pilea sinofasciata were analyzed by pot experiments employing different concentrations of P treatments (CK, P100, P200, P400, P800 and P1600) in tested soil. Growth, P accumulation and P-relevant enzyme activities of P. sinofasciata in ME and NME were assessed after 10 weeks' plantation. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the shoot biomass of the ME and NME. Higher P concentration and accumulation were observed in the ME than NME for all treatments. Stem P concentration of the ME were 117%, 189%, 152%, 153%, 140% and 139% higher than the NME, and leaf P concentration were 122%, 146%, 138%, 144%, 137% and 113%. Maximum P uptake and phytoextraction was observed at P400 for the ME of P. sinofasciata. Elevated activities of acid phosphatase and phytase in roots were examined in P-enriched soil, and the ME presented higher activities compared with the NME. The results in this paper provide a theoretical basis for the use of ME of P. sinofasciata for phosphorus accumulators and suggest that ME of P. sinofasciata is a promising species for the excess P phytoextraction of P-enriched soils.

Therefore, a set of stably expressed reference genes for data normalization is required. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a prime candidate crop for bioenergy production. The expression stability of reference genes in switchgrass, especially under different experimental conditions, is largely unknown. In order to identify the most suitable reference genes for abiotic stress studies in switchgrass, we evaluated 14 candidate genes for their expression stability under drought, high salinity, cold, heat, and waterlogging treatments using the Delta Ct, geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder approaches. Validation of reference genes indicated that the best reference genes should be selected based on the stress treatment. Actin 2 (ACT2), carotenoid-binding protein 20 (CBP20), and Tubulin (TUB) were found to have the highest expression stability to study drought stress. 18S ribosomal RNA1 (18S rRNA1), ACT2, and TUB were the most stably expressed genes under salt stress. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC), TUB, and cyclophilin2 (CYP2) were the most suitable reference genes across cold treatments. Likewise, 18S rRNA1, UBC, and TUB were good reference genes for studying heat stress, while ACT2, 18S rRNA1, and ubiquitin3 (UBQ3) were the top three reference genes under waterlogging treatment. Considering that reference gene expression may vary across switchgrass tissues, ACT2 and 18S ribosomal RNA2 (18S rRNA2) were shown to be the most stably expressed genes in switchgrass leaves and roots, respectively. The highly ranked reference genes that were identified in this study were shown to be capable of detecting subtle differences in the expression rates of other genes. These differences may have been missed if a less suitable reference gene was used.

Salt stress is one of the major limiting factors for switchgrass growth in many regions. The objective of this study was to examine relative salt tolerance and genetic diversity among 33 switchgrass populations. Seeds of each population were planted in cone-tainers and grown in a greenhouse. Two months after establishment, the switchgrass were grown in half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with either 0 mM NaCl (control) or half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with 250 mM NaCl (salt stress treatment) for 24 days. Salt stress tolerance was determined based on a variety of parameters including leaf electrolyte leakage (EL), chlorophyll content (Chl content), leaf photochemical efficiency (F (v)/F (m)), photosynthetic rate (P (n)), stomatal conductance (g (s)), and transpiration rate (T (r)). Significant differences in salt stress tolerance were found among the 33 populations. Based on the P (n) and salt tolerance trait index (STTI), lowland populations AM-314/MS-155, Kanlow, TEM-LoDorm, Alamo, and BN-13645-64, as well as upland populations T-2086, T-2101, BN-11357-63, and BN-12323-69 were classified as salt tolerant. In contrast, upland populations BN-18757-67, 70SG0021, Summer, 70SG0016, T16971, Dacotah, Turkey, 70SG003, and Pathfinder were classified as salt sensitive populations. Sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) marker analysis was employed to determine the genetic diversity among the 33 switchgrass populations. UPGMA cluster analysis showed that salt tolerant switchgrass populations TEM-LoDorm, Alamo, Kanlow, BN-12323-69, AM-314/MS-155, T2101, BN-11357-63, T-2086, and BN-13645-64 clustered into one group, indicating that these salt tolerant populations may have a similar genetic background.

There are no studies on the Ni or Ni compound-regulated antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression in animals and human beings at present. This study was conducted to investigate the pathway of nickel chloride (NiCl2)-caused renal oxidative damage by the methods of biochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two hundred and eighty one-day-old broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed on a control diet and three experimental diets supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. Dietary NiCl2 elevated the malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) contents, and reduced the ability to inhibit hydroxy radical in the NiCl2-treated groups. Also, the renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and mRNA expression levels were increased. The total antioxidant (T-AOC) and activities of antioxidant enzymes including copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) were decreased, and the glutathione (GSH) contents as well were decreased in the kidney. Concurrently, the renal CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, GST, and GR mRNA expression levels were decreased. The above-mentioned results showed that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused renal oxidative damage by reducing mRNA expression levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes, and then enhancing free radicals generation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA oxidation.

The results indicated that grass carp (hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) <0.03; dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) 1.42-334 ng/g ww) and bighead carp (HCHs < 0.03; DDTs 1.55-2.56 ng/g ww) fed with food waste feed pellets were relatively free of organochlorine pesticides (OCPS). The experimental ponds (water and sediment) were relatively free of OCPs, lowering the possibility of biomagnification of OCPs in the food chains within the ponds. The raw concentrations of OCPs extracted from the fish were not in the bioavailable form, which would ultimately reach bloodstream and exert adverse effects on human body. Health risk assessments based on digestible concentrations are commonly regarded as a more accurate method. The results of health risk assessments based on raw and digestible concentrations showed that the fish fed with food waste feed pellets were safe for consumption from the OCP perspective.

However, PBDEs received increasing health concerns due to their endocrine disrupt and neurodevelopment toxicity effects. The present study assessed the accumulation of PBDEs in 30 paired placenta, breast milk, fetal cord blood, and neonatal urine samples collected from five major cities of the South China. The age of mothers ranged from 21 to 39 (mean 27.6 +/- 4.56). The Sigma PBDE concentrations were 15.8 +/- 9.88 ng g(-1) lipid in placenta, 132 +/- 7.64 ng g(-1) lipid in breast milk, 16.5 +/- 19.5 ng g(-1) lipid in fetal cord blood, and 1.80 +/- 1.99 ng ml(-1) in neonatal urine. BDE-47 was the predominant congener in all types of human sample. Octa-BDEs such as BDE-196/-197 were detected highly in placenta and cord blood while moderately in breast milk and neonatal urine. Significant (p < 0.01) correlations were observed for both total and most individual PBDEs in cord blood-maternal placenta and breast milk-urine paired individual samples. The extent of placental transfer of higher brominated BDEs such as BDE-196/-197 was greater than that of BDE-47. The estimated daily intake (EDI) analysis for breast-fed infants revealed that newborns in these areas were exposed to relatively high levels of PBDEs via breast milk. Our study not only provided systematic fundamental data for PBDE distribution but also revealed the placenta transfer characteristics of PBDE congeners in South China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We report the sequencing at 146x coverage, de novo assembly and analyses of the genome of a male golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) and resequencing at 30x coverage of three related species (Rhinopithecus bieti, Rhinopithecus brelichi and Rhinopithecus strykeri). Comparative analyses showed that Asian colobines have an enhanced ability to derive energy from fatty acids and to degrade xenobiotics. We found evidence for functional evolution in the colobine RNASE1 gene, encoding a key secretory RNase that digests the high concentrations of bacterial RNA derived from symbiotic microflora. Demographic reconstructions indicated that the profile of ancient effective population sizes for R. roxellana more closely resembles that of giant panda rather than its congeners. These findings offer new insights into the dietary adaptations and evolutionary history of colobine primates.

Peking duck breast muscle and leg muscle were collected 3, 7, and 16 wk posthatching. The morphology of the myofibers was observed by paraffin sectioning the muscles. The expression of genes involved in protein metabolism [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RPS6-p70-protein kinase (S6K), forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), and atrogin-1 (MAFbx)] was detected using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays, and the results indicated that breast muscle had a stronger capacity for both protein synthesis and protein degradation compared with leg muscle. Satellite cell frequency declined during muscle development in both tissues, and the expression of Pax3/7, satellite cell marker genes, was not significantly different between breast muscle and leg muscle. No notable apoptosis was observed in either tissue. The results of this study suggest that protein metabolism signaling is the main reason promoting duck skeletal muscle mass gain.

Jian) (7.99 +/- 0.02 g) were fed diets containing graded levels of xylanase at 220 (unsupplemented control), 650, 1070, 1480, 1810 and 2470 U kg(-1) diet for 10 weeks to investigate the effects of xylanase levels on growth performance, intestinal enzyme activities and microflora. The per cent weight gain, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, protein production value, lipid production value, ash production value, calcium production value and phosphorus retention ratio were significantly improved with increasing levels of xylanase up to a point, and thereafter declined (P < 0.05). The activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase in the hepatopancreas and intestine, activities of alkaline phosphatase, Na+, K+-ATPase, creatine kinase and c-glutamyl transpeptidase in three intestinal segments were improved by dietary xylanase (P < 0.05). The amounts of Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas were significantly affected by dietary xylanase levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, xylanase supplementation improved growth performance, enhanced intestinal enzyme activities and influenced the balance of intestinal microflora of juvenile Jian carp. The optimal level of xylanase in juvenile Jian carp (7.99-99.16 g) based on PWG was 1259 U kg(-1) diet by the quadratic regression analysis.

JIAN; MITOCHONDRIAL GLUTAMINASE; DIETARY ARGININE; JUVENILE JIAN; METABOLISM; GROWTH; IDENTIFICATION	Glutaminase (GLS) is the key enzyme of glutamine (Gln) metabolism and utilization. In this study, a cDNA encoding GLS protein was identified from common carp Cyprinus carpio intestine. The open reading frame of GLS cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 595 amino acids, which shows a high similarity with its zebrafish Danio rerio counterpart. Bioinformatic analysis showed the protein belongs to kidney-type GLS. The putative protein has glutaminase domain and ankyrin repeats domain, which are highly conserved among vertebrate orthologues. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the abundance of GLS mRNA was the highest in the white muscle, followed by the brain, eyeball and pituitary. Glutaminase was ubiquitously expressed in all intestinal segments of common carp. The activity of GLS did not distribute uniformly along the entire length of the intestine. In primary culture enterocyte, and the expression of GLS mRNA is up-regulated quickly and effectively by Gln.

Radar observations of the seasonal migration of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal) in Southern China	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Nilaparvata lugens Stal; millimetric scanning entomological radar; flight behaviour; seasonal migration; Southern China	AUTUMN MIGRATION; NORTHERN CHINA; LEPIDOPTERA; MOTHS; DELPHACIDAE; NOCTUIDAE; INSECTS; FLIGHT; RICE; PYRALIDAE	The summer and autumn migrations of the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) were observed in Southern China with a millimetric scanning entomological radar and a searchlight trap supplemented with capture in field cages, field surveys, and dissections of females. Nilaparvata lugens took off at dusk and dawn in summer, but in autumn there was sometimes only a dusk take-off. The variation of the area density of the radar targets indicated that flight durations were about 9-10 h. In summer, planthopper-size targets generally flew below 1800 m above ground level (AGL), although some insects reached 2000 m AGL; in autumn, they flew lower, generally below 1100 m although some insects reached 1700 m AGL. Multiple layer concentrations were seen every night in both summer and autumn. The depths of these layers in autumn were less than in summer. Nilaparvata lugens flew in strong winds; wind shear may be the main factor causing them to accumulate and form dense layers at certain heights. Nilaparvata lugens emigrating in summer from the vicinity of the radar site in the Northeastern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and carried by the prevailing southwesterly wind, would have travelled north-eastwards and reached Northern Hunan Province. In autumn, with the prevailing northeasterly wind, emigrants would have reached overwintering areas (south of 21 degrees N).

In this study, we isolated and chromosomally mapped barley SEX4, characterized its gene and protein structure, predicted the cis-elements of its promoter, and analysed its expression based on real-time quantitative PCR and publically available microarray data. The full length of barely SEX4 (HvSEX4) was 4,598 bp and it was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4H (4HL). This gene contained 14 exons and 13 introns in all but two of the species analysed, Arabidopsis (13 exons and 12 introns) and Oryza brachyantha (12 exons and 11 introns). An exon-intron junction composed of intron 4 to intron 7 and exon 5 to exon 8 was highly conserved among the analysed species. SEX4 is characterized with conserved functional domains (dual specificity phosphatase domain and carbohydrate-binding module 48) and varied chloroplast transit peptide and C-terminal. Expression analyses indicated that: (1) SEX4 was mainly expressed in anthers of barley, young leaf and anthers of rice, and leaf of Arabidopsis; (2) it exhibited a diurnal pattern in barley, rice and Arabidopsis; (3) significant difference in the expression of SEX4 was not detected for either barley or rice under any of the investigated stresses; and (4) it was significantly down-regulated at middle stage and up-regulated at late stage under cold treatment, down-regulated at early stage under heat treatment, and up-regulated at late stage under salt treatment in Arabidopsis. The strong relationships detected in the current study between SEX4 and glucan, water dikinases (GWD) or phosphoglucan, water dikinases (PWD) were discussed. Collectively, our results provide insights into genetic manipulation of SEX4, especially in monocotyledon and uncovering the possible roles of SEX4 in plant development.

In August 2011, a severe infectious disease affecting rabbits, which caused 42% mortality, occurred in Mianyang, Sichuan Province, China. The main clinical signs included acute respiratory distress syndrome, fever, paddling and convulsions. A Gram-positive, chain-forming coccus was isolated from the primary organs and tissues of diseased rabbits and then identified as S. agalactiae by morphology, biochemical and physiological characteristics, 16S rDNA and gyrB gene sequences analysis. All isolates of S. agalactiae showed a similar antibiotic susceptibility, which were sensitive to florfenicol, ampicillin, gentamicin and norfloxacin, as well as being resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline. To our knowledge, this is the first report on S. agalactiae natural infection in domestic rabbits.	[Ren, S. Y.; Geng, Y.; Wang, K. Y.; Zhou, Z. Y.; Liu, X. X.; He, M.; Peng, X.; Wu, C. Y.; Lai, W.

The microRNAs were used for bioinformatics prediction of their target genes. The majority of the differentially expressed microRNA families showed different expression profiles at different time points of the stress process among the four inbred lines. Digital gene expression profiling revealed 54 genes targeted by 128 of the microRNAs differentially expressed under the same stress conditions. The differential expression of miR159 and miR168 was further validated by locked nucleic acid northern hybridization. These results indicated that miR159 and miR168, as well as numerous other microRNAs, play critical roles in signaling pathways of maize response to drought stress. However, the level of the post-transcriptional regulation mediated by microRNAs had different responses among genotypes, and the gene expression related to signaling pathways under drought stress is also regulated, possibly by multiple mechanisms.

The effect of hydrolysis time on antioxidant activity was also investigated. As the hydrolysis time was extended, the DPPH radical scavenging activity increased and finally reached a plateau, the copper chelating capacity decreased, and the superoxide radical scavenging and iron chelating activities increased initially, then subsequently slowed. The solubility, foaming properties, and emulsification properties of TSPH were affected by pH and DH. As the DH value increased, the DPPH radical scavenging activity and the reducing power increased and the copper chelating capacity decreased. TSPH at 20 and 30% DH values exhibited higher superoxide radical scavenging and stronger iron chelating activities respectively, than TSPH at other DH values. The DH value of TSPH affected the antioxidant activity and functional properties.

Rapid diagnosis is vital to preserve renal function and to slow down renal injury. Owing to the poor sensitivity and specificity of serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), new biomarkers for earlier and more accurate detection are needed. The aim of our study was to determine whether kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may be useful biomarkers in the assessment of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. In this study, the two biomarkers of renal toxicity were assessed via ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry in rats treated with gentamicin for up to 7 days. Repeated administration of gentamicin to male SD rats for 1, 3, or 7 days resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in the expression of KIM-1 and NGAL. Changes in gene and protein expressions were found to correlate with the progressive histopathological alterations and preceded effects on traditional clinical parameters indicative of impaired kidney function. Both of the biomarkers are supported to be used as sensitive indicators of acute kidney injury caused by gentamicin.

To understand the diversity of Bacillus group from the Giant Panda intestine and their functions in maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora of Giant Panda, this study isolated a significant number of strains of Bacillus spp. from the feces of Giant Panda, compared the inhibitory effects of these strains on three common enteric pathogens, investigated the distributions of six universal antimicrobial genes (ituA, hag, tasA, sfp, spaS and mrsA) found within the Bacillus group by PCR, and analyzed the characterization of antimicrobial gene distributions in these strains using statistical methods. The results suggest that 34 strains of Bacillus spp. were isolated which has not previously been detected at such a scale, these Bacillus strains could be classified into five categories as well as an external strain by 16S rRNA; Most of Bacillus strains are able to inhibit enteric pathogens, and the antimicrobial abilities may be correlated to their categories of 16S rRNA; The detection rates of six common antimicrobial genes are between 20.58 %(7/34) and 79.41 %(27/34), and genes distribute in three clusters in these strains. We found that the antimicrobial abilities of Bacillus strains can be one of the mechanisms by which Giant Panda maintains its intestinal microflora balance, and may be correlated to their phylogeny.

In the current study, two ecotypes (Mining ecotype and Farmland ecotype) of Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq. (cadmium accumulator), Solanum nigrum L. (cadmium hyperaccumulator), and Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. (cadmium and plumbum accumulator) were collected from plumbum-zinc mine and non-heavy metal contaminated farmland, respectively. They affected cadmium accumulation in cherry seedlings by intercropping. The cadmium accumulation in cherry seedlings was reduced by hyperaccumulators and accumulators. The contents of cadmium in cherry shoots were: monoculture > intercropping with D. sanguinalis (farmland) > intercropping with D. sanguinalis (mining) > intercropping with C. canadensis (farmland) > intercropping with C. canadensis (mining) > intercropping with S. nigrum (farmland) > intercropping with S. nigrum (mining). Moreover, intercropping with mining ecotype of hyperaccumulators or accumulators, the cadmium accumulation in cherry shoots was less than that intercropping with farmland ecotype. Therefore, all of hyperaccumulators and accumulators in this study could be used for remedying the cadmium contaminated cherry orchard, with mining ecotype of S. nigrum as the best material.

The study of the sub-fractions obtained after pectinase degradation showed that the complement fixation activities of these pectins are expressed mainly by their ramified regions. The structure studies of native and sub-fractions showed the 50WCP-II-I is a pectic polysaccharide, with long homogalacturonan regions (some of the galacturonic acid units were methyl esterified), interrupted by one short rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) region. The side chains of the RG-I region are arabinogalactan type I (AG-I) and type II (AG-II) attached on position 4 of rhamnose. The 100WCP-II-I has two main ramified regions, one is galacturonan region with AG-I side chain on position 2 of GalA, and the other one is RG-I region with AG-II side chain on position 4 of Rha.

The beta-mannosidase gene (MANB) was isolated from P. polymyxa A-8, using primers according to the complete genome. The MANB (2,550 bp) encoding 849 amino acid residues was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activities of beta-mannosidase produced by P. polymyxa A-8 and E. coli pET30a-MANB were 12 nkat/mg and 635 nkat/mg respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the molecular mass of the recombinant MANB was approximately 96 kDa. The recombinant MANB was active between pH 7.0-8.5 with the maximum activity at pH 7.0. It had good pH stability and adaptability. The MANB had the optimal temperature of 35 degrees C and was relatively stable at 35-40 degrees C. In addition, the MANB activity was enhanced by K+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ and inhibited by Zn2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+.

Despite being widely distributed around the world, no significantly different PCMV serotypes have been found. Moreover, the molecular immunosuppressive mechanisms of PCMV, along with the host antiviral mechanisms, are still not well characterized. To understand the potential impact of PCMV on the function of immune organs, we examined the transcriptome of PCMV-infected thymuses by microarray analysis. We identified 5,582 genes that were differentially expressed as a result of PCMV infection. Of these, 2,161 were upregulated and 3,421 were downregulated compared with the uninfected group. We confirmed the expression of 13 differentially expressed immune-related genes using quantitative real-time RTPCR, and further confirmed the expression of six of those cytokines by western blot. Gene ontology, gene interaction networks, and KEGG pathway analysis of our results indicated that PCMV regulates multiple functional pathways, including the immune system, cellular and metabolic processes, networks of cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the TGF-beta signaling pathway, the lymphocyte receptor signaling pathway, and the TNF-alpha signaling pathway. Our study is the first comprehensive attempt to explore the host transcriptional response to PCMV infection in the porcine immune system. It provides new insights into the immunosuppressive molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of PCMV. This previously unrecognized endogenous antiviral mechanism has implications for the development of host-directed strategies for the prevention and treatment of immunosuppressive viral diseases.

A large-effect locus conferring resistance to FCR disease was previously located to chromosome arm 3BL (designated as Qcrs-3B) and several independent sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) have been developed for this locus. In this study, five sets of the NILs were used to examine transcriptional changes associated with the Qcrs-3B locus and to identify genes linked to the resistance locus as a step towards the isolation of the causative gene(s). Of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected between the NILs, 12.7% was located on the single chromosome 3B. Of the expressed genes containing SNP (SNP-EGs) detected, 23.5% was mapped to this chromosome. Several of the DEGs and SNP-EGs are known to be involved in host-pathogen interactions, and a large number of the DEGs were among those detected for FHB in previous studies. Of the DEGs detected, 22 were mapped in the Qcrs-3B interval and they included eight which were detected in the resistant isolines only. The enrichment of DEG, and not necessarily those containing SNPs between the resistant and susceptible isolines, around the Qcrs-3B locus is suggestive of local regulation of this region by the resistance allele. Functions for 13 of these DEGs are known. Of the SNP-EGs, 28 were mapped in the Qcrs-3B interval and biological functions for 16 of them are known. These results provide insights into responses regulated by the 3BL locus and identify a tractable number of target genes for fine mapping and functional testing to identify the causative gene(s) at this QTL.

They can cause flock mortality up to 100%, resulting in a catastrophic economic loss. This is the first study to investigate the feasibility of genomic selection for antibody response to Newcastle disease virus (Ab-NDV) and antibody response to Avian Influenza virus (Ab-AIV) in chickens. The data were collected from a crossbred population. Breeding values for Ab-NDV and Ab-AIV were estimated using a pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction model (BLUP) and a genomic best linear unbiased prediction model (GBLUP). Single-trait and multiple-trait analyses were implemented. According to the analysis using the pedigree-based model, the heritability for Ab-NDV estimated from the single-trait and multiple-trait models was 0.478 and 0.487, respectively. The heritability for Ab-AIV estimated from the two models was 0.301 and 0.291, respectively. The estimated genetic correlation between the two traits was 0.438. A four-fold cross-validation was used to assess the accuracy of the estimated breeding values (EBV) in the two validation scenarios. In the family sample scenario each half-sib family is randomly allocated to one of four subsets and in the random sample scenario the individuals are randomly divided into four subsets. In the family sample scenario, compared with the pedigree-based model, the accuracy of the genomic prediction increased from 0.086 to 0.237 for Ab-NDV and from 0.080 to 0.347 for Ab-AIV. In the random sample scenario, the accuracy was improved from 0.389 to 0.427 for Ab-NDV and from 0.281 to 0.367 for Ab-AIV. The multiple-trait GBLUP model led to a slightly higher accuracy of genomic prediction for both traits.

Moreover, mitochondria are crucial in adipose energy homeostasis. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to chronic GC exposure-induced epididymal adiposity in the present study. A total of thirty-six 5-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (similar to 20 g) were administrated with 100 mu g/ml corticosterone (CORT) or vehicle through drinking water for 4 weeks. Chronic CORT exposure mildly decreased body weight without altering food and water intake in mice. The epididymal fat accumulation was increased, but adipocyte size was decreased by CORT. CORT also increased plasma CORT, insulin, leptin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 concentrations as measured by RIA or ELISA. Interestingly, CORT increased plasma levels of triacylglycerols and nonesterified fatty acids, and up-regulated the expression of both lipolytic and lipogenic genes as determined by real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, CORT impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function in epididymal WAT. The reactive oxygen species production was increased and the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were reduced by CORT treatment as well. Taken together, these findings reveal that chronic CORT administration-induced epididymal adiposity is, at least in part, associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse epididymal white adipose tissue.

The present study was mainly conducted to determine the effect of dietary tryptophan levels on oxidative stress in the liver of weaned pigs challenged by diquat. A total of 36 PIC piglets weaned at 21 days of age were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets containing dietary tryptophan levels of 0.18, 0.30, and 0.45% for 14 d. On day 8, the piglets were injected intraperitoneally with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution or diquat (10 mg/kg body weight). During the first 7 d of trial, increasing dietary tryptophan levels enhanced average daily gain (P = 0.09) and average daily feed intake (P = 0.08), and decreased the feed efficiency (P < 0.05) of piglets. The growth performance was decreased by diquat injection (P < 0.05). Diquat injection also decreased the activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the plasma and liver (P < 0.05), increased plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < 0.05) and urea nitrogen (P < 0.05) concentrations, and enhanced MDA concentration (P = 0.09) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activity (P = 0.07) in liver of piglets. Increasing dietary tryptophan levels could attenuate the effects of diquat injection on the MDA (P = 0.06) concentration and the activities of SOD (P = 0.09) and GPx (P = 0.05) of the liver, and plasma urea nitrogen (P = 0.06) concentration in the piglet. There was a synergistic role for increasing TDO activity in the liver between dietary tryptophan levels and diquat injection (P < 0.05). These results suggest that increasing dietary tryptophan levels could attenuate the oxidative stress of the liver in weaned piglets intraperitoneally injected with diquat via enhancing the antioxidant capacity.

Two isolates that were able to degrade ZEN belonged to the genus Pseudomonas according to biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence and were named as Pseudomonas alcaliphila TH-C1 and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida TH-L1, respectively. The results showed that the degradation rates of P. alcaliphila TH-C1 and P. plecoglossicida TH-L1 for ZEN (2 mu g/ml) were 68 +/- 0.85 % and 57 +/- 0.73 %, when incubated for 72 h at 30 degrees C in a rotary shaker (160 rpm) and detected by high-performance liquid chromatograms (HPLC). These results suggest that the two Pseudomonas strains are new bacterial resource for degrading ZEN and can provide a new approach for the detoxification of ZEN.

Genotype "Chinese Spring" Revealed from Chromosome Shotgun Sequence Data	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						chromosomal rearrangement; comparative genomics; pericentric inversion; pericentromeric regions; translocation; Chinese Spring	GENOME EVOLUTION; BIN MAP; HOMOEOLOGOUS GROUP-4; INVERTED REPEATS; POLYPLOID WHEAT; DRAFT GENOME; RECOMBINATION; REGIONS; COMMON; RICE	The bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotype "Chinese Spring" ("CS") is the reference base in wheat genetics and genomics. Pericentric rearrangements in this genotype were systematically assessed by analyzing homoeoloci for a set of nonredundant genes from Brachypodium distachyon, Triticum urartu, and Aegilops tauschii in the CS chromosome shotgun sequence obtained from individual chromosome arms flow-sorted from CS aneuploid lines. Based on patterns of their homoeologous arm locations, 551 genes indicated the presence of pericentric inversions in at least 10 of the 21 chromosomes. Available data from deletion bin-mapped expressed sequence tags and genetic mapping in wheat indicated that all inversions had breakpoints in the low-recombinant gene-poor pericentromeric regions. The large number of putative intrachromosomal rearrangements suggests the presence of extensive structural differences among the three subgenomes, at least some of which likely occurred during the production of the aneuploid lines of this hexaploid wheat genotype. These differences could have significant implications in wheat genome research where comparative approaches are used such as in ordering and orientating sequence contigs and in gene cloning.

In this review, the protein structure of avian interferon and the interferon receptor are discussed, indicating remarkable similarity between different species. However, the structures of the interferon receptors are more sophisticated than those of the interferons, suggesting that the interferon receptor is a more complicated signal lock system and has considerable diversity in subtypes or structures. Preliminary evolutionary analysis showed that the subunits of the interferon receptor formed a distinct clade, and the orthologs may be derived from the same ancestor. Furthermore, the development of interferons and interferon receptors in birds may be related to an animal's age and the maintenance of a balanced state. In addition, the equilibrium between interferon and its receptor during pathological and physiological states revealed that the virus and the host influence this equilibrium. Birds could represent an important model for studies on interferon's antiviral activities and may provide the basis for new antiviral strategies.

Use of seed priming with Spd improved seed germination percentage, germination vigor, germination index, root viability and length, and shortened mean germination time under different water stress conditions. Seedling fresh weight and dry weight also increased significantly in Spd-treated seeds compared with control (seeds primed with distilled water). Improved starch metabolism was considered a possible reason for this seed invigoration, since seeds primed with Spd had significantly increased alpha-amylase/beta-amylase activities, reducing sugar, fructose and glucose content and transcript level of beta-amylase gene but not transcript level of a-amylase gene. In addition, the physiological effects of exogenous Spd on improving seeds' tolerance to water deficit during germination were reflected by lower lipid peroxidation levels, better cell membrane stability and significant higher seed vigour index in seedlings. Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase), ascorbate-glutathione cycle (ASC-GSH cycle) and transcript level of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes induced by exogenous Spd may be one of the critical reasons behind acquired drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in water-stressed white clover seeds. The results indicate that Spd plays an important function as a stress-protective compound or physiological activator.

The current study was conducted to obtain the full-length coding sequence of Peking duck FAS and investigate its expression during adipocyte differentiation. Results: We have isolated a 7654 bp fragment from Peking duck adipocytes that corresponds to the FAS gene. The cloned fragment contains an open reading frame of 7545 bp, encodes a 2515 amino acid protein, and displays high nucleotide and amino acid homology to avian FAS orthologs. Twelve hour treatment of oleic acid significantly up-regulated the expression of FAS in duck preadipocytes (P < 0.05). However, 1000 mu M treatment of oleic acid exhibited lipotoxic effect on cell viability (P < 0.05). In addition, during the first 24 h of duck adipocyte differentiation FAS was induced; however, after 24 h its expression level declined (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We have successfully cloned and characterized Peking duck FAS. FAS was induced during adipocyte differentiation and by oleic acid treatment. These findings suggest that Peking duck FAS plays a similar role to mammalian FAS during adipocyte differentiation. (C) 2014 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

The modified Apelblat equation, the General Single Model and the Hybrid model were used to correlate the solubility data. The mole fraction solubility of azithromycin increased with increasing temperature and the mole fraction composition of 1,2-propanediol. Compared with the experimental data, the back-calculated values of the three models showed good correlation in all cases. The overall root mean square deviations (ORMSD) of the three models are 2.0788, 2.0451 and 5.9461, respectively. However, the modified Apelblat equation and the General Single model led to more reliable and accurate results than the Hybrid model. The fundamental solubility data and the three models in this work could be applied for related process design of azithromycin. Finally, the dissolution Gibbs energy and enthalpy for azithromycin in various binary mixtures were derived from the Van't Hoff and Krug analysis, which indicated that the process was endothermic and nonspontaneous, and the result well agreed with the analysis of their molecular and intermolecular forces.

While reclaimed water reuse seems to have become a promising practice, is it always feasible in any condition? To address this issue, this study carried out an extended emergy evaluation of a holistic wastewater treatment system. On one hand, this method was extended to include the emissions' impact. On the other hand, this study integrated a wastewater treatment plant, its excess sludge disposal system and treated water disposal system into an integrated wastewater treatment system (IWTS), so as to evaluate its performances more completely. And then several indicators, including cost per unit pollutant eliminated (CUPE), ratio of positive output (RPO), environmental load ratio (ELR), and sustainability index (SI), were proposed for evaluating the performances of an IWTS. Two scenarios (scenario A: wastewater treatment + sludge landfilling + treated water discharges; scenario B: wastewater treatment + sludge landfilling+ reclaimed water reuse) for a livestock wastewater treatment plant in Sichuan Agricultural University located in Ya'an City in Southwest China, as cases, were researched. The results show that scenario B has lower positive output efficiency and greater environmental load than scenario A. Meanwhile, the reclaimed water reuse raises cost per unit pollutant eliminated compared with the treated water being discharged directly; emissions' impact enhances the environmental load of the two scenarios to different degree; emissions' impact has decisive effect on the sustainability of the two scenarios. These results mean that the reclaimed water reuse should not be advocated in this case. This study provides some policy implications: (1) wastewater treatment process should be comprehensively evaluated from its resources consumption and impact of emissions; (2) reclaimed water reuse should be carefully evaluated from its pros and cons simultaneously; (3) the local conditions should be considered when implementing reclaimed water reuse, such as local water body conditions, market demands, the related laws and regulations, corporations' economic conditions, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The DMFit software (Institute of Food Reseach, Norwich, UK), based on the Baranyi model, was used to fit growth curves and obtain growth parameters. When temperature or water activity increased, the maximum growth rate increased and the lag time decreased. The developed secondary model was validated by published reports and 422 data from ComBase, which suggest that the model could be used to safely predict the growth of Salmonella in chicken. In this study, the correlation between growth parameters and growth conditions was also investigated using unified and separated models. These models were validated using a different Salmonella strain, isolated from chicken meat, and also with independent data from literatures and ComBase. The values of accuracy and bias factor are 0.99, 1.22 for unified model, and 0.98 and 1.08 for separated model, which suggested the predictions of the models were in a safe and acceptable range. The evaluation suggested robustness of the models and the statistical results of the models show goodness-of-fit. Practical ApplicationsThere is no significant difference between unified and separated models, so the data tested in laboratory media could be easily used in real food after the mathematical process using unified model. This is important in predictive microbiology, as it can be readily used to control the potential hazard in food and maintain food safety.

Rye (Secale cereale L., 2n = 2 x = 14, genome RR) offers a rich reservoir of powdery mildew resistant genes for wheat breeding program. However, extensive use of these resistant genes may render them susceptible to new pathogen races because of co-evolution of host and pathogen. Therefore, the continuous exploration of new powdery mildew resistant genes is important to wheat breeding program. In the present study, we identified several wheat-rye addition lines from the progeny of T. aestivum L. Mianyang11 x S. cereale L. Kustro, i.e., monosomic addition lines of the rye chromosomes 4R and 6R; a disomic addition line of 6R; and monotelosomic or ditelosomic addition lines of the long arms of rye chromosomes 4R (4RL) and 6R (6RL). All these lines displayed immunity to powdery mildew. Thus, we concluded that both the 4RL and 6RL arms of Kustro contain powdery mildew resistant genes. It is the first time to discover that 4RL arm carries powdery mildew resistant gene. Additionally, wheat lines containing new wheat-rye translocation chromosomes were also obtained: these lines retained a short arm of wheat chromosome 5D (5DS) on which rye chromosome 4R was fused through the short arm 4RS (designated 5DS-4RS.4RL; 4RL stands for the long arm of rye chromosome 4R); or they had an extra short arm of rye chromosome 4R (4RS) that was attached to the short arm of wheat chromosome 5D (5DS) (designated 4RS5DS.5DL;5DL stands for the long arm of wheat chromosome 5D). These two translocation chromosomes could be transmitted to next generation stably, and the wheat lines containing 5DS-4RS.4RL chromosome also displayed immunity to powdery mildew. The materials obtained in this study can be used for wheat powdery mildew resistant breeding program.

Its members differed from those of other genera in the tribe in lacking glumes. The type species is H. patula Moench, a North American taxon. When it became accepted that H. patula should be included in Elymus, Hystrix could not be used as a generic name. The problem became how to treat the other species that had been included in Hystrix. Hystrix patula, like many other species of Elymus, has the StH genomic composition but H. coreana (Honda) Ohwi, H. californica (Bol.) Kuntze, H. duthiei (Stapf) Bor ssp. duthiei, and H. duthiei ssp. longearistata have the NsXm genomic composition that is associated with Leymus. Using genomic in situ hybridization analysis, we showed that H. komarovii (Roshev.) Ohwi has an NsE(e) genomic composition, a combination not known from any other species. Hystrix sibirica (Trautv.) Kuntze and H. duthiei ssp. japonica are included in Leymus on morphological grounds. The status of H. kunlunensis K. S. Hao is not clear. In this paper, we summarize our results and those of others concerning what is now known and the problems that remain concerning the species that used to be included in Hystrix.

To investigate the phylogenetic relationships and maternal genome donor of polyploid Leymus, the chloroplast trnH-psbA region and mitochondrial coxII intron sequences of 33 Leymus taxa were analyzed with those of 36 diploid perennial species representing 19 basic genomes in Triticeae. The results showed that reticulate evolution occurred in Leymus species, with the cytoplasmic lineage of Leymus contributed by different progenitors. Interspecific relationships of Leymus were also elucidated on the basis of orthologous comparison. Our data suggested that: (i) due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or difference in the pattern of chloroplast and mitochondrial inheritance, the genealogical conflict between the two genealogical patterns suggest the contribution of Psathyrostachys Nevski, Agropyron J. Gaertn, Eremopyrum (Ledeb.) Jaub. & Spach, Pseudoroegneria (Nevski) A. Love, Thinopyrum A. Love, and Lophopyrum (Host) A.

The occurrence of multiple origin and introgression could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Leymus species.

Hordeum spontaneum C. Koch, the progenitor of cultivated barley that harbors rich genetic diversity, was collected from seven different environments. To investigate the influence of microclimatic ecological divergence on a-amylase, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in amy genes from these populations were determined. A total of 16 and 17 SNPs were detected in the coding sequences of amy1 and amy2, respectively, from the seven wild barley populations. Among these SNPs, three in amy1-2 and nine in amy2-2 were significantly associated with ecological factors. The genetic divergence of amy sequences was significantly different among the populations. Natural microclimatic selection was apparently the major evolutionary driving force causing interslope divergence and adaptive evolution of these genes. The genetic variation in amy1-2 and amy2-2 was at least partly ecologically determined in these populations, representing adaptive patterns generated by natural selection. The SNPs were apparently generated by natural selection in climatic environmental patterns at both the micro ("Evolution Canyon") and macro (across Israel, Galilee, and Negev) scales.

MicroRNA-27a promotes porcine myoblast proliferation by downregulating myostatin expression	ANIMAL			English	Article						miR-27a; porcine myostatin; 3 ' UTR; cloning; porcine myoblast proliferation	DOUBLE-MUSCLED PHENOTYPE; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; DIFFERENTIATION; MIR-27A; METABOLISM; MECHANISMS; CATTLE; CELLS	MicroRNAs are endogenous similar to 22nt RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level via binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs. The microRNA miR-27a was reported to depress the expression of myostatin, a critical inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis, by binding to its 3'UTR in mouse. In this study, we cloned the full-length 3'UTR of porcine myostatin by rapid amplification of 3'-cDNA ends (3'-RACE) and demonstrated that the 3'UTR of porcine myostatin is targeted by miR-27a. The phenomenon that the level of myostatin inversely correlated with miR-27a was observed in fat and heart of pigs and also in proliferating porcine myoblasts. Besides, overexpression of miR-27a in porcine myoblasts promoted cell proliferation by reducing the expression of myostatin. Our data suggest that miR-27a positive regulates porcine myoblast proliferation via targeting myostatin.	[Yang, T.; Chen, X. L.; Huang, Z. Q.; Wen, W. X.; Xu, M.; Chen, D. W.; Yu, B.; He, J.; Luo, J.

In experiment (Exp.) 1, eight barrows (body weight=30.56 +/- 0.78kg) were fitted with a T-cannula and allotted to a duplicated 4x4 Latin square design: WB10, 100g/kg WB; WB20, 200g/kg WB; DB10, 100g/kg DB; and DB20, 200g/kg DB. In Exp. 2, 80 barrows (body weight=70.56 +/- 1.29kg) were used in a 56-day experiment: (i) WB15, 150g/kg WB; (ii) WBD10, 100g/kg WB and 50g/kg DB; (iii) WBD5, 50g/kg WB and 100g/kg DB; and (iv) DB15, 150g/kg DB. In Exp. 1, the apparent ileal digestibilities of total essential amino acids were higher (P<0.05) in WB10 treatment than DB20. For Exp.2, the WB15 and WBD10 had higher pH and lower cooking loss (P<0.05) than other two treatments. The WB15 treatment decreased (P<0.05) the contents of palmitic acid (C16:0) in Longissimus dorsi muscle than WBD5 and DB15 treatments. In conclusion, it is suggested that water-soaked barley improved some amino acid digestibility and the cooking loss and moderate fatty acid profiles in Longissimus dorsi muscle.

Blood samples were collected from five broilers in each group at 14, 28, and 42 days of age. Changes of erythrocyte parameters showed that total erythrocyte count (TEC), hemoglobin (Hb) contents, and packed cell volume (PCV) were significantly lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) and erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF) was higher (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 600 and 900 mg/kg groups at 28 and 42 days of age than those in the control group, and the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) and calcium adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2+-ATPase) activities were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the NiCl2-treated groups. The results of erythrocyte immune adherence function indicated that erythrocyte C-3b receptor rosette rate (E-C3bRR) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 600 and 900 mg/kg groups and in the 300 mg/kg group at 42 days of age, whereas the erythrocyte immune complex rosette rate (E-ICRR) was markedly increased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg groups at 28 and 42 days of age. It was concluded that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused anemia and impaired the erythrocytic integrity, erythrocytic ability to transport oxygen, and erythrocyte immune adherence function in broilers. Impairment of the erythrocytes and erythrocyte immune adherence function was one of main effect mechanisms of NiCl2 on the blood function.

However, the general objective of an accelerated life test(ALT) is to assess the p-th quantile of the product life distribution under normal stress. For this objective, estimating all model parameters is not necessary, and this will increase the cost of test. Based on the theoretical conclusion that the stress level combinations of the optimum multiple stresses ALT plan locate on a straight line through the origin of coordinate, it is proposed that a design idea of planning the optimum multiple stresses ALT plan through transforming the problem of designing an optimum multiple stresses ALT plan to designing an optimum single stress ALT plan. Moreover, a method of planning the optimum multiple stresses ALT plan which can avoid estimating all model parameters is established. An example shows that, the proposed plan which only has two stress level combinations could achieve an accuracy no less than the traditional plan, and save the test time and cost on one stress level combination at least; when the actual product life is less than the design value, even the deviation of the model initial parameters value is up to 20%, the variance of the estimation of the p-th quantile of the proposed plan is still smaller than the traditional plans approximately 25%. A design method is provided for planning the optimum multiple stresses ALT which uses the statistical optimum degenerate test plan as the optimum multiple stresses accelerated life test plan.

Obesity is considered as a major risk factor of insulin resistance. STEAP4 is a novel anti-obesity gene that is significantly down-regulated in adipose tissue of obese patients. Over-expression of STEAP4 can improve glucose uptake and mitochondrial function, and increase insulin sensitivity. STEAP4 expression is regulated by a variety of inflammatory cytokines, hormones, or adipokines. In this review, we discuss function of STEAP4 in regulating insulin resistance in adipose tissue in vivo, as well as in adipocytes in vitro.

Intact soil cores were collected from long-term field experiments involving several N fertilization regimes, including single synthetic N fertilizer (N), organic manure (OM), synthetic N, P. K fertilizer (NPK), organic manure with synthetic fertilizer (OMNPK), crop straw residue with synthetic fertilizer (SRNPK) and no nitrogen fertilizer (NF). N2O was sampled from the head space of the cylinders to determine the daily N2O emission and denitrification rate. The results showed that the N2O emissions were greatly influenced by the specific fertilization regime even when the same nitrogen rate was applied. The mean N2O emissions and denitrification rates from the N, OM, NPK, OMNPK and SRNPK treatment were 2.22, 2.66, 1.94, 2.53, 1.67 and 4.63, 5.96, 4.15, 5.41, 3.65 mg per m(2) per day, respectively. The application of OM significantly increased the N2O emission and denitrification compared to the application of NPK because of the high soil organic carbon (SOC) content of OM. However, SRNPK increased the SOC content and decreased the N2O emissions significantly compared to the OM and OMNPK treatments because the addition of crop straw with a high C/N ratio to soil with a low inorganic N content induced N immobilization. The contents of soil nitrate and ammonium were the main limiting factors for N2O emissions in a positive regression as follows: Ln (N2O) = 2.511 + 1.258 x Ln ([NH4+] + [NO3-). Crop straw residue combined with synthetic fertilizer is recommended as an optimal strategy for mitigating N2O emissions and denitrification-induced N loss in rain-fed croplands.

Galinsoga parviflora was the most promising remedial plant among 5 Cd accumulators or hyperaccumulators. In Cd concentration gradient experiments, as soil Cd concentration increased, root and shoot biomass decreased, and their Cd contents increased. In additional concentration gradient experiments, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities increased with soil Cd concentrations up to 75mgkg(-1), while expression of their isoenzymes strengthened. Catalase (CAT) activity declined and CAT isoenzyme expression weakened at soil Cd concentrations less than 50mgkg(-1). The maxima of Cd contents in shoots and roots were 137.63mgkg(-1) and 105.70mgkg(-1), respectively, at 100mgkg(-1) Cd in soil. The root and shoot bioconcentration factors exceeded 1.0, as did the translocation factor. In a field experiment, total extraction of Cd by shoots was 1.35mgm(-2) to 1.43mgm(-2) at soil Cd levels of 2.04mgkg(-1) to 2.89mgkg(-1). Therefore, the artificially high soil Cd concentration method was effective for screening Cd hyperaccumulators. Galinsoga parviflora is a Cd hyperaccumulator that could be used to efficiently remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:2422-2428.

However, molecular characterisation of these pathogens from NHPs remains scarce. In this study, 2,660 specimens from 26 NHP species in China were examined and characterised by PCR amplification of 18S rRNA, 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) and 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene loci for Cryptosporidium; and 1,386 of the specimens by ssrRNA, triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene loci for Giardia. Cryptosporidium was detected in 0.7% (19/2660) specimens of four NHP species including rhesus macaques (0.7%), cynomolgus monkeys (1.0%), slow lorises (10.0%) and Francois' leaf monkeys (6.7%), belonging to Cryptosporidium hominis (14/19) and Cryptosporidium muris (5/19). Two C hominis gp60 subtypes, IbA12G3 and IiA17 were observed. Based on the tpi locus, G. duodenalis was identified in 2.2% (30/1,386) of specimens including 2.1% in rhesus macaques, 33.3% in Japanese macaques, 16.7% in Assam macaques, 0.7% in white-headed langurs, 1.6% in cynomolgus monkeys and 16.7% in olive baboons. Sequence analysis of the three targets indicated that all of the Giardia-positive specimens belonged to the zoonotic assemblage B. Highest sequence polymorphism was observed at the tpi locus, including 11 subtypes: three known and eight new ones. Phylogenetic analysis of the subtypes showed that most of them were close to the so-called subtype BIV. Intragenotypic variations at the gdh locus revealed six types of sequences (three known and three new), all of which belonged to so-called subtype BIV. Three specimens had co-infection with C hominis (IbA12G3) and G. duodenalis (BIV). The presence of zoonotic genotypes and subtypes of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis in NHPs suggests that these animals can potentially contribute to the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis.

At c. 1 day post-hatching (dph), the gonadal ridge was colonized with primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the periphery and transformed into the gonadal primordium, which appeared to contain two germinal epithelia. At c. 7 dph, four ovarian cavities appeared in the gonadal tissue with two in each germinal epithelial compartment, and the indifferent gonad might have begun to differentiate into the ovary. The oocytes at the leptotene stage in meiosis I appeared at c. 14 dph, and oocytes at the diplotene stage at c. 30 dph. As development proceeded, the connective tissue separating the two germinal epithelia disappeared, and two of the four ovarian cavities collapsed into one. At 60 dph, the gonad had already taken the shape as observed in the adults. One outer and two inner ovarian cavities could be easily recognized, with slightly basophilic primary growth oocytes usually residing close to the outer ovarian cavity. The expression of cyp19a1a and erb in the early gonad was detected at 6 dph. The abundant expression of foxl2 coincided with the up-regulation of cyp19a1a at 8 dph onwards. The expression of dmrt1 isoforms was not detectable until 8 dph for dmrt1a and dmrt1b and until 33 dph for dmrt1d. The earlier appearance of cyp19a1a compared to dmrt1 transcripts in the indifferent gonad may contribute to the initial differentiation of the gonad towards the ovary in M. albus.

The full-length cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 2,586 nucleotides, encoding 862 amino acids with a potential secretion signal. The A. oryzae GIF-10 bgl was functionally expressed in Pichia pastoris. After 7-day induction, protein yield reached 321 mg/mL. Using salicin as the substrate, the specific activity of the purified enzyme reached 215 U/mg. The purified recombinant beta-glucosidase was a 110-kDa glycoprotein with optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme was stable between 20 and 60 degrees C, and retained 65 % of its activity after being held at 60 degrees C for 30 min. The recombinant b-glucosidase was relatively stable in a broad range of pHs, from 4.0 to 6.5. It showed broad specific activity, hydrolyzing a range of (1-4)-beta-diglycosides and (1-4)-alpha-diglycosides, and Mn2+ stimulated its activity significantly.

The flavonoids are mainly represented by rutin, anthocyanins and proanthocyanins in tartary buckwheat. R2R3-type MYB transcription factors (TFs) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. In this study, two TF genes, FtMYB1 and FtMYB2, were isolated from F. tataricum and characterized. The results of bioinformatic analysis indicated that the putative FtMYB1 and FtMYB2 proteins belonged to the R2R3-MYB family and displayed a high degree of similarity with TaMYB14 and AtMYB123/TT2. In vitro and in vivo evidence both showed the two proteins were located in the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activities. During florescence, both FtMYB1 and FtMYB2 were more highly expressed in the flowers than any other organ. The overexpression of FtMYB1 and FtMYB2 significantly enhanced the accumulation of proanthocyanidins (PAs) and showed a strong effect on the target genes' expression in Nicotiana tabacum. The expression of dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) was upregulated to 5.6-fold higher than that of control, and the expression level was lower for flavonol synthase (FLS). To our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of two MYB TFs from F. tataricum that control the PA pathway.

However, low temperature limitation is the basic problem for the cultivation and introduction of bamboo. In this study, the symptoms of cold stress influence on the native bamboo (Neosinocalamus affinis (Rendle) Keng f.) and hybrid bamboo (Bambusa pervariabilis x Dendrocalamopsis grandis) were observed under transmission electron microscope, and the dynamic responses of FAD7, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD genes to cold stress were identified in bamboo by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Observation by electron microscopy indicated that bamboo is one of the most chilling-sensitive species with severe ultrastructural injury induced by chilling, but the native bamboo (N. affinis) is more cold-tolerant compared with the hybrid bamboo. Results obtained by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that FAD7, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD were all cold-inducible genes in N. affinis. In addition, dynamic response patterns of N. affinis Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD under cold stress were similar. This work is a fundamental research of hardiness physiology of bamboo and may contribute to the breeding program on obtaining transgenic bamboo species.	[Zhang, F.; Zhu, X. Q.; Guo, Y. L.; Chen, Q.

The results indicated that the start-up could be well improved using appropriate wastewater organic load and food-to-microorganism ratios (F/M). When digestion was initialized at low chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of 20.0 gCOD L-1, the start-up would go well using lower F/M ratio of 0.5-0.7. The OLR 7.0 gCOD L-1 day(-1) was recommended for operating the ASBR digestion, in which the COD conversion of 96.7 +/- A 0.53 % and biomethane yield of 3.5 +/- A 0.2 L gCOD(-1) were achieved, respectively. The instability would occur when OLR was higher than 7.0 gCOD L-1 day(-1), and this instability was not recoverable. Lipid was suggested to be removed before anaerobic digestion. The anaerobic digestion process in engineering project ran well, and good performance was achieved when the start-up and operational strategies from laboratory study were applied. For case application, stable digestion performance was achieved in a digester (850 m(3) volume) with biogas production of 1.0-3.8 m(3) m(-3) day(-1).

Plate counting and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) assays were used. A total of 240 one-day-old avian broilers chicks were divided into four equal groups and kept on corn-soybean basal diet along with supplementation of 0, 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg NiCl2 for 42 days. Samples were taken at 21 and 42 days of age during the experiment. The bacterial count results showed that dietary NiCl2 in the range of 300 to 900 mg/kg decreased the counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus, increased Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus spp. in the ileum and cecum. PCR-DGGE analysis showed that bacterial band numbers, profile similarity, and the Shannon index of the ileum and cecum were all decreased in the 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg groups at 21 and 42 days of age. In conclusion, dietary NiCl2 affected the amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota in the ileum and cecum of broilers. This finding implies that NiCl2 has toxicological effect on the intestinal ecosystem and, possibly functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This allows them to have more spatial options, thus avoiding excessive infra-hill competition when compared to conventional row configurations. However, there is limited information on how TPG might affect rice production, especially for newly-bred varieties featuring a heavy panicle size (5 g panicle(-1)). This study was conducted to evaluate grain yield performance and yield component changes of heavy panicle varieties under TPG. Moreover, to identify any promising agronomy traits and population structural features that might explain the difference in yield performance as well as to probe whether the high-yielding performance of TPG is reproducible in other circumstances. In 2012, Eryou498 (a heavy panicle variety) was grown under four planting geometries (PGs) in two fields that had similar soil fertility, but that were conducted with either conventional tillage or zero-tillage systems. In 2013, two heavy panicle varieties and two medium panicle varieties (2-5 g panicle(-1)) were grown under three PGs in two ecological regions. Grain yield and effective panicles were significantly affected by both variety and PG. A significant interaction of PG and variety was seen on grain yield, but the high-yielding performance of TPG was consistent with all varieties. Sufficient total spikelets were the basis of achieving a high grain yield. Effective panicles predominantly attributed to total spikelets across all four experiments. Robust spikelets were crucial when grain yield was at a high level. Heavy panicle varieties and TPG showed some similar high-yielding traits. These included rapid crop growth rate (CGR) during the two weeks before full heading, plenty non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) accumulated at full heading, mass NSC output in two weeks after full heading, and high radiation use efficiency (RUE). Rice under TPG presented a more compact top three leaves as well as more stretched lower leaves when compared to other PGs. Overall, all leaves of heavy panicle varieties were more stretched than those found in medium ones. Heavy panicle varieties accumulated more nitrogen (N) in leaves from elongation to 30 days after full heading while PG showed no significant effect on leaf N concentration during the late grain-filling period. These results suggest that the high-yielding performance of TPG is reproducible in other circumstances. The combination of TPG and heavy panicle varieties is advantageous, allowing for a more efficient canopy structure for heavy panicle varieties and a more robust photosynthetic ability at late grain-filling period under TPG.

We performed conditional and unconditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in two unrelated recombinant inbred line populations to precisely detect QTLs for uppermost internode length (UIL) and SL, and to dissect the genetic relationship between these two factors with plant height (PH). Both of the populations were derived from crosses with synthetic wheat. Ten repetitive QTLs for UIL and six environment-independent QTLs for SL were identified in this study, and twelve of these were completely independent of PH. Conditional QTL mapping analysis indicated that SL was more independent to PH than UIL was. The results indicated that the conditional QTL mapping method could evaluate PH component effects on PH, and thus accelerate the selection of suitable loci that improve commercial wheat morphology yet avoid changes to PH.

In this work we investigated the interaction among the Chinese economy, energy production and consumption and the impacts of concomitant air emissions from 2000 to 2011, using an indicator system based on energy, emergy and money units. The results show that China's rapid economic growth has promoted tremendous expansion in energy production and consumption, which have led to increasing the impact of emissions in this study period. During the time examined, energy production and use efficiencies and the structure of the energy sector improved slightly; the self-sufficiency of energy use fluctuated, as petroleum took on an increasingly strong dependence on imports; fossil energy, mainly coming from coal, still has a majority share in energy production and consumption of the nation; the environmental loading intensity of energy consumption decreased slightly while that of energy production increased; most of the impacts of energy-related emissions are derived from their impact on human health; the impact of emissions from energy production made an increasing contribution to the total impact. Generally speaking, China's economic growth still heavily depends on energy-intensive industries that put great pressure on energy supply and pollution control. Although China has made obvious progress in energy mix optimization to save energy and reduce emissions, the pace of improvement still fell behind that of economic growth. Finally, this paper discussed some related issues and presented corresponding suggestions to further coordinate the relationship between the economy, energy production and consumption and the environment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of maternal nutrition on digestive and absorptive function of offspring at both birth and weaning with pig as model. Methods: Eighteen primiparous Landrace x Yorkshire gilts (ages 253 +/- 9 d; body weight 148.6 +/- 6.9 kg) were allocated to a normal nutrition (control) group as recommended by the National Research Council (NRC; 1998), an undernutrition (UN) group (75% of NRC recommendations), and an overnutrition (ON) group (150% of NRC recommendations); the nutritional treatments were introduced from day 1 of gestation to farrowing. Results: By comparison, the small intestine weight (+33%; P < 0.01) and the ratio of small intestine weight to length (+25%; P < 0.05) for the ON group were higher than those for the control group. Meanwhile, the maternal ON treatment had significant effect on the activity of brush border lactase in the jejunum (+125%; P < 0.05) at birth. Expression of mRNA for SGLT1, GLU72, PEPT1, and GLP2R were significantly increased (+1.7 similar to 9.6-fold; P < 0.05) in jejunum of newborn or weaned piglets from the ON group; whereas maternal UN significantly affected small intestine weight (-28%; P < 0.01), length, and the ratio of weight to length (-11% and -19%; P < 0.05, respectively), and villus height (-29% and -22%; P < 0.05, respectively) in jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, maternal UN enhanced the activity of brush border lactase in the jejunum of newborn piglets (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Maternal ON enhanced intestinal function via up-regulating digestive enzyme activities and gene expression of transporters in both newborn and weaning piglets. Maternal UN impaired fetal intestinal development that could be partially compensated during the neonatal period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Several factors, in particular antibiotics, affect the gut microbiota of pigs. Cross-fostering has been applied as a regular practice to equalize litter size, reduce pre-weaning mortality and increase body weight. However, the effect of cross-fostering on cecal microbiota is unclear. In this study, we fostered three Jinhua pigs to a Yorkshire sow. The fostered Jinhua piglets grew significantly faster than their biological siblings. To explore whether the cecal microbiota of piglets will alter during fostering, we characterized the cecal microbiota of all piglets by examining the V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA. We observed altered cecal microbiota in these piglets using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and this was accompanied with an increase in growth rate after fostering. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the fostered Jinhua piglets was decreased compared with their biological siblings, although still higher in comparison with their new littermates. Beta-diversity analysis also showed that the cecal microbiota of the adopted Jinhua piglets differed from their biological siblings with a shift toward their step-siblings. Our data show that cecal microbiota of piglets were altered after cross-fostering while the growth rate increased.

A total of 540 young grass carp (295.85 +/- 2.07 g) were fed six isonitrogenous diets with graded levels of leucine (7.1, 8.9, 11.0, 13.3, 15.2 and 17.1 g kg(-1) diet) for 8 weeks. Results indicated that percent weight gain (PWG), feed intake, feed efficiency, intestine length, intestine weight and intestine protein content were significantly improved by dietary leucine. Similarly, optimum leucine supplementation significantly increased intestinal glutathione content, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities as compared with the control group. The changes in intestinal CuZnSOD, GPx and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels induced by leucine were similar to those noted in the enzyme activities. Plasma ammonia concentration (PAC), intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl contents, as well as the mRNA level of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) exhibited an opposite tendency. Interestingly, dietary leucine level higher than 13.3 or 15.2 g kg(-1) diet has adverse effect on intestinal antioxidant status. Collectively, our results indicated that optimum leucine supplementation improved fish growth and antioxidant capacity, which may be partly related to the Nrf2 signalling pathway. Based on PWG, PAC and intestinal MDA, the optimum dietary leucine requirements of young grass carp (296-690 g) were estimated to be 13.0, 12.9 and 13.2 g kg(-1) diet, corresponding to 42.4, 42.0 and 43.0 g kg(-1) of dietary protein, respectively.

However, knowledge regarding GSK3 beta in the goat is limited. In this study, we cloned and characterized the goat GSK3 beta gene. Six novel GSK3 beta transcripts were identified in different tissues and designated as GSK3 beta 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. RT-PCR was used to further determine whether the six GSK3 beta transcripts existed in different goat tissues. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the catalytic domain (S_TKc domain) is missing from GSK3 beta 2 and GSK3 beta 4. GSK3 beta 3 and GSK3 beta 6 do not contain the negative regulatory sites that are controlled by p38 MAPK. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that all the GSK3 beta transcripts were expressed at the highest level in the heart, whereas their expression levels in the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, longissimus dorsi muscle and uterus were different. These studies provide useful information for further research on the functions of GSK3 beta isoforms.

Although various pathogens, including R. solani, have been traditionally controlled using chemical pesticides, their use faces drawbacks such as environmental pollution, development of pesticide resistance, and other negative effects. Carbendazim is a well-known antifungal agent capable of controlling a broad range of plant diseases, but its use is hampered by its poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we describe an environmentally friendly pharmaceutical microemulsion system using carbendazim as the active ingredient, chloroform and acetic acid as solvents, and the surfactants HSH and 0204 as emulsifiers. This system increased the solubility of carbendazim to 30 g/L. The optimal microemulsion formulation was determined based on a pseudo-ternary phase diagram; its physicochemical characteristics were also tested. The cloud point was greater than 90 degrees C and it was resistant to freezing down to -18 degrees C, both of which are improvements over the temperature range in which pure carbendazim can be used. This microemulsion meets the standard for pesticide microemulsions and demonstrated better activity against R. solani AG1-IA, relative to an aqueous solution of pure carbendazim (0.2 g/L). The mechanism of activity was reflected in the inhibition of against R. solani AG1-IA including mycelium growth, and sclerotia formation and germination were significantly better than that of 0.2 g/L carbendazim water solution according to the results of t-test done by SPSS 19.

They were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy(EDS). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and circular dichroism spectra (CD) were used to analyse the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) layer onto ZnO. Adsorption of BSA onto ZnO was investigated under different temperatures, and the adsorption thermodynamics and interaction mechanisms were discussed. The results indicate that the isothermal adsorption of BSA can be described by the Langmuir and modified Langmuir adsorption models. With the increase of adsorption temperature, the quantity of BSA absorbed onto ZnO increased. Thermodynamic parameters( Delta G, Delta H, Delta S) show that adsorption processes of BSA onto ZnO were endothermic (Delta H>0) and spontaneous( Delta G<0) in nature. The adsorption behavior was controlled by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. The analysis shows that the ZnO NRs is better for BSA adsorption.

However, the structural alterations of wheat chromosomes in wheat-rye hybrids are seldom reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: Octoploid triticale lines were derived from common wheat Triticum. aestivum L. 'Mianyang11'xrye Seca le cereale L. 'Kustro'. Some progeny were obtained by the controlled backcrossing of triticale with 'Mianyang11' and common wheat T. aestivum L. 'Chuannong27' followed by self-fertilization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) using Oligo-pSc119.2-1, Oligo-pTa535-1 and rye genomic DNA as probes were used to analyze the mitotic chromosomes of these progeny. Alterations of wheat chromosomes including 5A, 6A, 1B, 2B, 6B, 7B, 1D, 3D and 7D were observed. SAL arm carrying intercalary Oligo-pSc119.2-1, Oligo-pTa535-1 or both Oligo-pSc119.2-1 and Oligo-pTa535-1 signals, 6A5, 1BS and 1DL arms containing terminal Oligo-pSc119.2-1 signal, 6B5 and 3D5 arms without terminal Oligo-pSc119.2-1 signal, 785 without subtelomeric Oligo-pSc119.2-1 signal and 7DL with intercalary Oligo-pSc119.2-1 signal have been observed. However, these changed wheat chromosomes have not been detected in 'Mianyang11' and Chuannong 27. The altered 5A, 6A, 7B and 7D chromosomes in this study have not been reported and represent several new karyotype structures of common wheat chromosomes. Conclusions/Significance:These rearranged wheat chromosomes in the present study afford some new genetic variations for wheat breeding program and are valuable materials for studying the biological function of tandem repetitive DNA sequences.

In order to better understand the role of apelin in the regulation of appetite in fish, we cloned the cDNAs encoding apelin and APJ, and investigated their mRNA distributions in Ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti) tissues. We also assessed the effects of different nutritional status on apelin and APJ mRNAs abundance. Apelin and APJ mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested, relatively high expression levels were detected in the heart, spleen, hypothalamus and kidney. Short-term fasting significant increased APJ mRNA expression, but no significant difference between fasted fish and fed control on 5- and 7-day. Meanwhile, apelin mRNA expression consistently increased during the 7-day food deprivation. In order to further characterize apelin in fish, we performed intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of apelin-13 and examined food intake of the injected fish. Apelin injected at a dose of 100 ng/g body weight induced a significant increase in food intake compared to saline injected fish. Our results suggest that apelin acts as an orexigenic factor in Ya-fish. Their widespread distributions also suggest that apelin and APJ might play multiple physiological regulating roles in fish.

A total of 24 protein bands and 72 protein patterns were detected in all 106 accessions. The genetic similarity value varied from 0.50 to 1.00. The seed storage protein patterns were largely independent of environmental fluctuation. Accessions of the same species or with identical genome constitutions had the same or similar protein patterns. Relatively lower within-species variations were observed compared with among-species variations. The AACCDD genome hexaploid species and the AA genome diploid species were more divergent than other species, with percentages of polymorphic bands of 85.7% and 61.1% respectively. In the AA genome diploid species, the A(s)A(s) genome diploids displayed higher variations than the modified AA genome diploid species.

NSCs were isolated from the brains of three embryonic day 30 fetal pigs and were induced to differentiate in vitro. NSCs and the differentiated cells were harvested for analysis of markers by immunostaining and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The NSCs at passage 10 were used for nuclear transfer, and the cloned embryos at the two-cell stage were transferred into the oviducts of surrogate mothers. The results showed that three NSC lines (2 male and 1 female) were successfully established. All NSCs at passage 17 continued to express nestin and Sox2. NSCs could differentiate into neurons (TUBB3+), astrocytes (GFAP+), and oligodendrocytes (O4+). After NSC nuclear transfer, 2020 two-cell stage embryos formed. After embryo transfer, 6 of 10 surrogates were pregnant, and 40 piglets (18 males and 22 females) were born. Twenty-two of these piglets reached sexual maturity and were found to be fertile. The other piglets died within 45 days post-partum. In conclusion, 3 porcine NSC lines capable of self-renewal and differentiation were established, and the cloned embryos derived from these cells could develop to term. Thus, NSCs could be efficient alternative nuclear donors for pig cloning.

The Relationship Between Industry Structure, Household-number and Energy Consumption in China	ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY			English	Article						energy policy implication; improved decomposing methodology; industry structure; modeling; number of household	ESTIMATORS	This article investigates the empirical relationship between energy consumption, industry structure, and household-number. An empirical model with energy consumption, structure and scale of industry, and household-number was built. Using ridge regression analysis and observed data from 1985 to 2007 in China, we examine the relationship between each part of energy consumption and the corresponding coefficients, including gross domestic production (GDP) in the secondary sector (IGDP), in primary and tertiary industries (PTGDP) and number of denizens (NDC). The results show that changing the independent variables (diminishing IGDP/GDP, NDC/GDP, IGDP, PTGDP, and NDC or increasing PTGDP/GDP) or their corresponding coefficients can both lower energy consumption, theoretically. But, in fact, it is not suitable to decrease total energy consumption by changing the independent variables for China. In order to diminish the parameters, the Chinese government must continue to promote energy efficiency by introducing advanced technologies and implementing the policy of saving energy.	[Deng, S.

Simulation of the Monthly Hydroelectricity Generation in China Based on a Logistic Model	ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY			English	Article						logistic model; monthly hydroelectricity; steady point; turning point	CONSUMPTION; GROWTH	Employing a logistic growth carve model, the monthly hydroelectricity generation in China during 1999-2009 is simulated. Except Parameter b (October), all parameters are linear 2-parameter regression between the actual and simulated hydroelectricity pass t-test at the significance level of 0.005. All the F-test values of linear 2-parameter regression pass the F-test at the significance level of 0.01. The maximum growth rate of monthly hydroelectricity generation and the points of 90% potential install capacity can be forecasted. The maximum growth rate of monthly hydroelectricity will occur in the period of 2010-2015. In this period, the monthly hydroelectricity will increase quickly. Then, its growth rate will decline to 0 during 2022-2034. Later in 2034, all monthly hydroelectricity generation comes to their steady line, supplying 1,266.081 billion Kwh per year.

Chao leaf essential oils were studied with special reference to the mechanism of inhibiting the standard strain of Escherichia coli (CMCC (B) 44102) growth at ultrastructural level. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill curves of alpha-terpineol were determined; Escherichia coli was treated with alpha-terpineol and observed under a transmission electron microscope. The MIC and MBC values of alpha-terpineol were all 0.78 mu L/mL, and time-kill curves showed the concentration-dependent. Under the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Escherichia coli exposed to MIC levels of alpha-terpineol exhibited decreased cell size and irregular cell shape, cell wall and cell membrane were ruptured, nucleus cytoplasm was reduced and nuclear area gathered aside. Results suggest that alpha-terpineol has excellent antibacterial activity and could induce morphological changes of Escherichia coli.

An HPLC method was developed for the determination of protocatechuic aldehyde, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA in 23 samples of Salvia. The analytes were separated on an Agilent XDB C-18 reversed-phase column coupled with a Phenomenex C-18 guard column using a gradient elution of acetonitile-0.1% aqueous phosphoric acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate 0.8 mL/min and UV detection at 280 nm. The method allowing the simultaneous quantification of six major active compositions was optimized and validated for linearity, precision, accuracy and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification. The LOD ranged from 0.019 to 0.850 mg/mL (R-2 >= 0.9998). Accuracy, precision and reproducibility were all within the required limits. The average recovery between 96.49 and 102.16% and the relative standard deviations were <3.01%. Based on the six compositions content and clustering result, this research results suggest that these six major active compositions could be distinguishing markers for Danshen and non-Danshen.

Simultaneously, expression of IL-2 and IL-10 mRNA were detected. The T cell proliferation and CSFV load in plasma were also measured. Results showed that the expression of PD-1 and its ligands mRNA were significantly increased (p < 0.01) in PBMC from 3 to 7 days post infection (dpi). Meanwhile the level of IL-10 was up-regulated (p < 0.01). The IL-2 mRNA was not obviously changed but it is significantly increased from 14 dpi. The T cell proliferation was notably decreased at 7 dpi. The CSFV load was also increased in plasma. Overall, our results suggest that the expression of PD-1 and its ligands were up-regulated and probably correlated with immune inhibition during acute CSFV infection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A growing body of evidence demonstrated that let-7 family of miRNAs, as one of the highly conserved miRNAs, plays an important role in cell differentiation and development, as well as tumor suppressor function depending on their levels of expression. To explore the physiological significance of let-7 in regulating cell fate decisions, we present a coarse grained model of let-7 biogenesis network, in which let-7 and its regulator Lin28 inhibit mutually. The dynamics of this minimal network architecture indicates that, as the concentration of Lin28 increases, the system undergoes a transition from monostability to a bistability and then to a one-way switch with increasing strength of positive feedback of let-7, while in the absence of Lin28 inhibition, the system loses bistability. Moreover, the ratio of degradation rates of let-7 and Lin28 is critical for the switching sensitivity and resistance to stimulus fluctuations. These findings may highlight why let-7 is required for normal gene expression in the context of embryonic development and oncogenesis, which will facilitate the development of approaches to exploit this regulatory pathway by manipulating Lin28/let-7 axis for novel treatments of human diseases.

A total of 319 trihelix members, identified from 11 land plant species, were classified into five clades. The results of phylogeny indicate the binding domains of GT1 and GT2 diverged early in the existence of land plants. Genomic localization revealed that the trihelix family members were highly conserved among cereal species, even though some homeologs generated during the tetraploidy of maize were lost. Three-dimensional structural analyses and an examination of subcellular localization of this family supported the involvement of all five clades in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, the family members from all clades in sorghum and rice showed a broad and dynamic expression pattern in response to abiotic stresses, indicating regulatory subfunctionalization of their original functions. This finding is further supported by the phenotypes of enhanced tolerance to cold, salt, and drought in transgenic plants overexpressing Sb06g023980 and Sb06g024110. In contrast, few Arobidopsis genes showed inducible expression under abiotic stress conditions, which may indicate a functional shift. Finally, our co-expression analysis points to the involvement of this family in various metabolic processes, implying their further functional divergence.

The phylogenetic analyses (Neighbor-Joining and MJ network) supported three major clades (Ns, St and Xm). Sequence diversity and genealogical analysis suggested that 1) Leymus species from the same areas or neighboring geographic regions are closely related; 2) most of the Eurasian Leymus species are closely related to Psathyrostachys: P. juncea might serve as the Ns genome donor of polyploid Eurasian Leymus species; 3) the Xm genome may originate from ancestral lineages of Pseudoroegneria (St), Lophopyrum (E-e), Australopyrum (W) and Agropyron (P); 4) the trnQ-rps16 sequences of Leymus are evolutionarily distinct, and may clarify parental lineages and phylogenetic relationships in Leymus.

Messenger RNA expression and immunolocalization of psoriasin in the goat mammary gland and its milk concentration after an intramammary infusion of lipopolysaccharide	VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Goat; Mammary gland; Mastitis; Psoriasin (S100A7)	LINGUAL ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DAIRY-COWS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; SKIN; MASTITIS; INFECTION	Psoriasin (S100A7) is a member of the S100 protein family of calcium-binding proteins and plays a crucial role in local host defenses. The present study aimed to identify the expression of S100A7 in the goat mammary gland and in milk. The goat S100A7 coding DNA sequence was identified using direct sequencing. An S100A7 antibody was raised in rabbits by immunization with a synthetic S100A7 peptide consisting of 13 amino acids. Messenger RNA expression and protein localization in different regions of a healthy mammary gland were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Changes in the concentration of S100A7 in the milk after an intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined by an enzyme immunoassay. The goat S100A7 peptide had 98% and 86% sequence similarity to that of sheep and bovines, respectively. The S100A7 mRNA expression was higher in the teat and udder skin than in the cistern and parenchyma of the mammary gland. Immunoreactive S100A7 was localized in the epithelial cells of the alveolus and gland cistern, and stratified squamous epithelium of the teat. Psoriasin as a secreted protein was detectable in healthy milk, and an intramammary LPS infusion increased the concentration of S100A7 in the milk. The results suggest that S100A7 is produced in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland and is secreted into the milk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, G.

Chinese T. indicum was soaked with CTA and APP alone or in combination for 10, 20, and 30 min at 35, 45, and 55 degrees C. A disinfection method using CTA and APP (3% CTA + 3% APP for 20 min at 45 degrees C) was obtained. Under this set of combination, the experimental values of microbial counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, mesophilic anaerobic bacteria, and fungi were 2.31 +/- 0.4 log CFU/g, < 1.0 log CFU/g, and < 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively. Through the analysis of sensory qualities and microbial populations for MAP-or VAC-packed Chinese T. indicum, the shelf life of soaked truffles was prolonged to 45 or 40 d, respectively. The synergistic effect of CTA and APP may provide valuable insight into the reduction of microorganisms on fresh truffles.

Methane emission inventories for enteric fermentation and manure management of yak, buffalo and dairy and beef cattle in China from 1988 to 2009	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						China; Large ruminant; Methane inventory; Tier 1; Tier 2		Large ruminant production systems (dairy, beef, buffaloes and yaks) in China have experienced significant changes during the last 30 years driven by increased demand for milk and meat consumption and discontinued use of beef cattle and buffaloes as draft animals. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of these changes on methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management in large ruminants in China. The emissions were developed using Tier 1 and 2 methodologies of the International Panel on Climate Change. The Tier 2CH(4) emission for each species was a sum of emissions calculated from several groups based on their physiological states, e.g. milking cows, dry cows, sires and steers/heifers at various ages. Total CH4 emission inventory for dairy cattle, beef cattle, buffaloes and yaks in China increased gradually from 5530 to 6761 Gg/year or 4514 to 5777 Gg/year calculated using the Tier 1 or 2 method during the period of 1988-2009. This increase was driven by increased population and production of dairy and beef cattle (e.g. Tier 2CH(4) emissions increased respectively from 125 to 1028 Gg/year and from 2915 to 3689 Gg/year). However, during the same period Tier 2CH(4) emissions from buffaloes and yaks reduced from 860 to 593 Gg/year and 614 to 467 Gg/year, respectively. Beef cattle were main emitters which produced 63.8% of total emissions in 2009, followed by dairy cattle (17.8%), buffaloes (10.3%) and yaks (8.1%). There was a large difference in provincial contributions. In 2007, the 3 highest emission provinces (Sichuan, Tibet and Henan) each contributed 8.5-10.5% to national emissions, and the lowest 3 accounted for only 0.1-0.2% (Beijing, Zhejiang and Shanghai). The uncertainties associated with these inventories were discussed. These results provide benchmark information for Chinese authorities to develop appropriate policies and mitigation strategies to reduce carbon footprint in the large ruminant production sector in China.

Two splice variants of VLDLR have been identified in several species, yet little is known about their distinctive roles in ovarian developing follicles. In the present study, the full-length cDNAs of two splice isoforms of VLDLR were obtained from geese (Anser cygnoide) ovaries using the RACE method. The longer isoform (TypeI VLDLR) is 3141 bp and contains five conserved structural domains, while the other (TypeII VLDLR) lacks 90 bp encoding for the O-linked sugar domain. TypeII VLDLR was predominantly expressed in the ovary, with greater amounts of mRNA in theca and granulosa cells from early stages of follicle development but decreased during vitellogenesis. However, there was minimal expression of the TypeI VLDLR gene in theca cells and expression was almost undetectable in granulosa cells throughout follicle development. Yolk VLDL concentrations decreased as stage of development advanced while yolk triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations increased in a follicular size-dependent manner. The significant correlations between transcripts of TypeII VLDLR and yolk lipids supported its important role on yolk lipid deposition. In addition, in vitro experiments suggested that exogenous cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevinolin (a highly potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA) treatment could significantly alter TypeII VLDLR gene expression in granulosa cells from both pre-hierarchical and pre-ovulatory follicles. Collectively, data from the present study indicate that TypeII VLDLR is more important for the transport of plasma lipoproteins into developing follicles than TypeI VLDLR, and provide new evidence about the influence of steroids in modulating VLDLR gene expression in ovarian cells.

Methods: A total of 570 strains of E. coli isolated from US retailmeats in 2006were screened for the presence of 10 QAC resistance genes [qacE, qacED1, qacF, qacG, emrE, sugE(c), sugE(p), mdfA and ydgE/ydgF]. The MICs of six common disinfectants were determined using an agar dilutionmethod. Possible associations between the presence of the gene and bacterial resistance to QACs and antimicrobials were investigated. Results: emrE, sugE(c), mdfA and ydgE/ydgF were commonly present (77.2%- 100%) in the E. coli isolates, but qac and sugE(p) were less prevalent (0.4%- 22.3%). emrE- mdfA- sugE(c)- ydgE/F was the most common QAC resistance gene profile. A significant association was found between antimicrobial resistance and the presence of sugE(p) and qacED1 (P < 0.05). Antimicrobial- resistant E. coli isolates tended to containmore diverse combinations of disinfectant resistance genes than susceptible ones. All isolates showed reduced susceptibility to five of six disinfectants compared with the control strains. Higher MICs were generally associated with the presence of qac and sugE(p) genes. Conclusions: The QAC resistance genes were commonly present among E. coli isolated from retail meats, and the qac and sugE(p) geneswere highly associatedwithmultidrug resistance phenotypes. UsingQACs in the food industry may not be as effective as expected and could provide selection pressure for strains with acquired resistance to other antimicrobials.

Western Sichuan is considered as an important area of diversity of Primula, approximately accounting for 40 % of the total found in the country. This paper focused on the distribution, classification, and evaluation of the Primula species collected from western Sichuan. A total of 29 species, four subspecies, and one variety were collected, identified, and classified based on their morphological characteristics. We also discovered some plants with different flower colors within the same species, which may be representative of new forms or ecotypes. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method through 14 indicator points was first used to evaluate the collected Primula resources based on their ornamental value, utilization potential, and ecological adaptability. The results indicated that P. denticulata subsp. sinodenticulata received the highest AHP scores making it the most potential species for sustainable exploitation. In addition, P. chionantha subsp. sinopurpurea, P. szechuanica, P. orbicularis, P. sikkimensis, P. hongshanensis, P. secundiflora, P. sonchifolia, P. polyneura, P. wilsonii, P. palmata, P. poissonii and P. watsonii showed better potential for exploitation than other species. This study also gave some suggestions regarding the protection and utilization of wild Primula resources.

A total of 96 cross 28-d old barrows weaned at 21 +/- 2 d (initial average BW= 7.39 +/- 0.40 kg) were allotted randomly on the basis of the initial body weights (BW) to dietary Tau supplementation of 0%, 03%, 1.5%, and 3% for 28 d. Each treatment had six replicate pens, and each pen had four pigs. Our results showed that gain/feed ratio (G/F) increased with the lower supplementation of Tau but decreased with the higher supplementation (quadratic, P < 0.05). The liver antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, GSH-PX and T-AOC) were lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed 0% and 3% Tau than those fed 0.3% Tau, and the lipid peroxidation (MDA) contents were lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed 0% and 0.3% Tau than those fed 1.5% and 3% Tau, which combined with the hepatic pathological analysis indicated that dietary supplementation with appropriate Tau could help maintain liver health but dietary supplementation with excessive Tau would lead to liver damage. In addition, dietary supplementation with 0.3% Tau increased (P < 0.05) villus heights related to the control group. Meanwhile, the higher diarrhea index (P <0.05), lower (P < 0.05) villus heights and deeper (P < 0.05) crypt depths in pigs fed 3% Tau than those fed 0% or 0.3% Tau may be partially due to increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and Caspase-3 levels, and decreases in GLP-2 secretions. In conclusion, our results suggested that appropriate (03%) Tau supplementation in diets had different degrees of beneficial effects on piglet health but excessive (1.5% or 3%) Tau had adverse effects on growth performance, liver and intestinal health of piglets.

To understand the expression characteristics of NCED during ABA biosynthesis in apple (Malus), two NCED genes cDNA sequence were cloned from Malus prunifolia using RT-PCR techniques, named MpNCED1 and MpNCED2. The two cDNA sequences have full-length open reading frame, encoding a polypeptide of 607 and 614 amino acids, respectively. Sequences analysis showed that the deduced two apple NCED proteins were highly homologous to other NCED proteins from different plant species. Real-time PCR analysis revealed MpNCED2 were expressed continuously during the whole period of apple fruit development with the pattern of "higher-low-highest", while the expression of MpNCED1 clearly declined to a steady low level in the mid-later period of fruit development. Expression of the MpNCED2 increased under the drought stress, high temperature and low temperature strongly and rapidly, whereas expression of the MpNCED1 was detected in response to temperature stress, but did not detected under drought stress. These results revealed that MpNCED1 and MpNCED2 may play different roles in regulation of the ABA biosynthesis in fruit development and various stresses response.

JIAN; MOLECULAR-CLONING; GENE-EXPRESSION; RAINBOW-TROUT; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; IN-VIVO; DAMAGE	The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrates, and homeostasis of the brain is crucial for fish survival. Copper (Cu) is essential for normal cellular processes in most eukaryotic organisms but is toxic in excess. Although Cu is indicated as a potent neurotoxicant, information regarding its threat to fish brain and underlying mechanisms is still scarce. In accordance, the objective of this study was to assess the effects and the potential mechanism of Cu toxicity by evaluating brain oxidative status, the enzymatic and mRNA levels of antioxidant genes, as well as the Nrf2/ARE signaling in the brain of fish after Cu exposure. The protective effects of myo-inositol (MI) against subsequent Cu exposure were also investigated. The results indicate that induction of oxidative stress by Cu is shown by increases in brain ROS production, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, which are accompanied by depletions of antioxidants, including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZnSOD, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and glutathione (GSH) content. Cu exposure increased the catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Further molecular results showed that Cu exposure up-regulated CuZnSOD, GPx1a and GR mRNA levels, suggesting an adaptive mechanism against stress. Moreover, Cu exposure increased fish brain Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and increased its ability of binding to ARE (CuZnSOD), which supported the increased CuZnSOD mRNA levels. In addition, Cu exposure caused increases of the expression of the Nrf2, Maf G1 (rather than Maf G2 gene) and PKCd genes, suggesting that de nova synthesis of those factors is required for the protracted induction of such antioxidant genes. However, the modulation of Keap1a (rather than Keap1b) of fish brain under Cu exposure might be used to turn off of the signaling cascade and avoid harmful effects. Interestingly, pre-treatment of fish with MI prevented the fish brain from Cu-induced oxidative damages mainly by increasing the GSH content and CuZnSOD and GST activities. Summarily, this study indicates that although Cu stimulates adaptive increases in the expression of some antioxidant enzyme genes through Nrf2/ARE signaling, it also induces oxidation and the depletion of most of antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH content due to the increase of ROS production, and MI protects the fish brain against Cu toxicity.

In this study, a rapid one-step reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for the detection of PKoV is developed. A set of four primers specific to six regions within the PKoV 3D gene was designed for the RT-LAMP assay using total RNA extracted from PKoV-infected tissues. The reaction temperature and time for this assay were optimized. Compared with reverse-transcription PCR, RT-LAMP was able to detect PKoV at a 100-fold lower dilution. No cross-reaction was observed with other similar viruses, indicating that the assay is highly specific for PKoV. To investigate the prevalence of PKoV in symptomatic pigs in Sichuan province, the newly developed method was used to detect PKoV in a panel of clinical specimens, yielding a positive rate of 86.7% (144/166) in piglets. The results showed that the RT-LAMP assay is highly feasible in clinical settings. The data confirm that the RT-LAMP assay is rapid, simple and cost-effective and is particularly suitable for simple diagnosis of PKoV both in the field and in the laboratory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Wide hybridization can produce de novo DNA variation that may cause novel phenotypes. However, there is still a lack of specific links between changed genes and novel phenotypes in wide hybrids. The well-studied high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes in tribe Triticeae provide a useful model for addressing this issue. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a wheat-rye hybridization method for inducing de novo phenotypes using the Glu-1Dx2.2 subunit as an example. We developed three hexaploid wheat lines with normal fertility and a Glu-1Dx2.2 variant, named Glu-1Dx2.2 (v) , derived from three F-1 hybrids. The wild-type Glu-1Dx2.2 has two direct repeats of 295 bp length separated by an intervening 101 bp in its central repetitive region. In the mutant Glu-1Dx2.2 (v) , one copy of the repeats and the intervening sequence were deleted, probably through homology-dependent illegitimate recombination (IR). This study provides a direct link between a de novo allele and novel phenotype. Our results indicate that the wheat-rye method may be a useful tool to induce de novo genetic variations that broaden the genetic diversity for wheat improvement.

Erythrocytes, thrombocytes and three types of leucocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, were distinguished and characterized. In addition to mature erythrocytes, immature and dividing erythrocytes were observed. A few organelles such as mitochondria were distributed in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes. Lymphocytes with heavily clumped heterochromatic nucleus and minimal cytoplasm were classified into small and large lymphocytes. Three different populations of granules, with distinctive ultrastructural aspect, were observed in neutrophils. Monocytes were the fewest leucocytes possessing rich organelles, phagocytized materials and vacuoles. Thrombocytes with various types were the most abundant blood cells among leucocytes and contained a prominent nucleus with dense bands of heterochromatin and many cytoplasmic vacuoles. Periodic acid-Schiff staining was positive in neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes, but not in erythrocytes. Peroxidase-positive staining was observed in neutrophils and monocytes, but not in erythrocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes. Only neutrophils were positive for oil red O. Except for erythrocytes, the other blood cells stained positively for acid phosphatase. Only neutrophils and monocytes were positive for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. None of the cells studied were positive for alkaline phosphatase. The morphologic and cytochemical features of blood cells of S. prenanti are similar to those of other fish. This investigation may be helpful as a tool to monitor the health status of cultured S. prenanti and will grant early detection of clinical pathology.	[Fang, J.; Chen, K.; Cui, H.

J	Liu, S; Xu, JW; Zhao, JF; Xie, XM; Zhang, WC				Liu, Shuang; Xu, Jingwen; Zhao, Junfang; Xie, Xingmei; Zhang, Wanchang			Efficiency enhancement of a process-based rainfall-runoff model using a new modified AdaBoost.RT technique	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						AdaBoost.RT algorithm; Particle swarm optimization; Process based hydrologic model	REGRESSION PROBLEMS; BOOSTING ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION	High-efficiency rainfall-runoff forecast is extremely important for flood disaster warning. Single process-based rainfall-runoff model can hardly capture all the runoff characteristics, especially for flood periods and dry periods. In order to address the issue, an effective multi-model ensemble approach is urgently required. The Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm is one of the most robust ensemble learning methods. However, it has never been utilized for the efficiency improvement of process-based rainfall-runoff models. Therefore AdaBoost.RT (Adaptive Boosting for Regression problems and "T" for a threshold demarcating the correct from the incorrect) algorithm, is innovatively proposed to make an aggregation (AdaBoost-XXT) of a process-based rainfall-runoff model called XXT (a hybrid of TOPMODEL and Xinanjing model). To adapt to hydrologic situation, some modifications were made in AdaBoost.RT. Firstly, weights of wrong predicted examples were made increased rather than unchangeable so that those "hard" samples could be highlighted. Then the stationary threshold to demarcate the correct from the incorrect was replaced with dynamic mean value of absolute errors. In addition, other two minor modifications were also made. Then particle swarm optimization (PSO) was employed to determine the model parameters. Finally, the applicability of AdaBoost-XXT was tested in Linyi watershed with large-scale and semi-arid conditions and in Youshuijie catchment with small-scale area and humid climate. The results show that modified AdaBoost.RT algorithm significantly improves the performance of XXT in daily runoff prediction, especially for the large-scale watershed or low runoff periods, in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients and coefficients of determination. Furthermore, the AdaBoost-XXT has the more satisfactory generalization ability in processing input data, especially in Linyi watershed. Thus the method of using this modified AdaBoost.RT to enhance model performance is promising and easily extended to other process-based rainfall-runoff models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Supplementation Dietary Zinc Levels on Growth Performance, Carcass Traits, and Intramuscular Fat Deposition in Weaned Piglets	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Dietary Zn levels; Intramuscular fat; Longissimus muscle; Weaned piglets	PORCINE ADIPOSE-TISSUE; JAPANESE BLACK CATTLE; ACID-BINDING PROTEIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CARNITINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE; MINERAL CONCENTRATIONS; OXIDE; METABOLISM; PIGS; METALLOTHIONEIN	This study was conducted to estimate dietary zinc (Zn) levels on growth performance, carcass traits, and intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in weaned piglets. Sixty piglets were randomly divided into five groups, as follows: control (basal diet), Zn250, Zn380, Zn570, and Zn760 with supplementation of 250, 380, 570, and 760 mg Zn/kg of the basal diet, respectively. The final weight, average daily gain (ADG), gain/feed (G/F), lean meat percentage, fat meat percentage, lean eye area, backfat thickness, and IMF content were dose-dependently increased in all groups of Zn treatment. The serum total triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) were significantly higher in all Zn treatments than in the control. The enzyme activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were markedly higher, while enzyme activities of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) were significantly lower in all Zn treatments than in the control. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), FAS, ACC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), LPL, and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) were significantly higher, while the mRNA levels of CPT-1 and HSL were significantly lower in all Zn treatments compared with the control. These results indicated that high levels of Zn increased IMF accumulation by up-regulating intramuscular lipogenic and fatty acid transport gene expression and enzyme activities while down-regulating lipolytic gene expression and enzyme activities.

Activity of alpha-amylase determines levels of starch degradation, seed germination, and pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), which is a serious problem in wheat production. In this study, we isolated and characterized high PI amylase coding genes from the wheat cultivar Chuanmai32 (PHS susceptible) and the synthetic wheat SHW-L1 (PHS resistant). amy1 gene sequences were 1,459 a long and contained three exons and two introns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that homologous genes obtained from the two accessions were extremely conserved and belonged to barley AMY2-1 subgroup. Six nucleotide substitutions were detected in the exon regions between the two amy1 genes. The amino acid substitutions Lys(364)/Arg(364) and Arg(366)/Trp(366) occurred in the C-terminal region, which is present in the anti beta-sheet three-dimensional structure of AMY1. Expression profiling of amy1 indicated that mRNA transcript accumulation began at a late stage of grain development. amy1 transcript accumulation in Chuanmai32 was 4.32- and 18.36-fold higher than observed in SHW-L1 at DPA25 and DPA30, respectively. Two significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on chromosome 1BS and one on 3DS were characterized by expression analysis of amy1 transcripts and genetic analysis of SHW-L1/Chuanmai32-derived recombinant inbred lines. The genes that encoded high PI amylase were located near the centromere on chromosomes 6AL/6BL/6DL. These results suggest that these eQTL regions may provide candidate genes that play potential roles in regulating PHS through effects on amy1 expression.

This paper presented an indicator system based on energy, emergy and monetary units to explore the interactions between China's economic growth, its energy production and consumption, and the related air emissions during 1995-2011. The results show that (1) China's energy utilization efficiency is continuously raised whilst the total production efficiency is just slightly improved; (2) petroleum import has surpassed international warning line (50%) since 2007, and it is further challenging China's energy security; (3) basic energy mix is still mainly composed of coal and petroleum; (4) air emissions' impact from energy production has climbed rapidly whilst that from energy consumption has declined slowly. Air emissions' impact from energy consumption still has main contribution to the total emissions' impact whilst that from energy production has an increasing share. Therein, air emissions' impact mainly comes from the impact on human health. While air emission intensity from energy consumption decreases obviously, that from energy production generally increases; (5) generally, the relationships between the structures of economy and energy and air emissions have become more coordinated. Compared with structure coordination degree, the improvement of scale harmony degree between the three aspects is much slower due to rebound effect, which will seriously challenge the presented targets in 12th Five-Year-Plan (FYP). Promoting the synergistic effect should become the underlying strategy for future economic sustainable development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effect of Dietary N-Carbamylglutamate Levels on Reproductive Performance of Gilts	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article							AMINO-ACID NUTRITION; NITRIC-OXIDE; L-ARGININE; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; FETAL-DEVELOPMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; GROWTH-FACTOR; DNA-DAMAGE; SUPPLEMENTATION; PREGNANCY	Contents The effect of dietary N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) supplementation during the entire gestation on reproductive performance of gilts was determined. At the initial day of gestation, forty-five cross-bred (LandracexLarge white) gilts were randomly assigned to five groups receiving a basal diet (control group) and basal diet supplemented with 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.15% and 0.20% NCG until parturition, respectively. At parturition, total litter size, live litter size and rate of stillbirth were not markedly affected by NCG supplementation. However, gilts in 0.05% NCG-supplemented group had more pigs born alive than gilts in control group (+1.11 pigs, p=0.12), and live litter weight was increased (+12.13-19.17%, p<0.05) in 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15% NCG-supplemented groups relative to control group. And also, average birthweight of piglets born alive was higher (+6.57%, p<0.05) in 0.05% NCG-supplemented group than in control group. Furthermore, on days 30, 60, 90 and 110 of gestation, concentrations of arginine and ornithine in plasma were higher (p<0.05) in 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.15% and 0.20% NCG-supplemented groups than in control group, respectively. In addition, the chorioallantois gene expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), placental growth factor (PLGF) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) was all increased (p<0.05) in 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15% NCG-supplemented groups than in control group. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 500mg/kg NCG during the entire gestation significantly improves pregnancy outcomes in gilts, which may be associated with the improved concentrations of arginine in plasma and placental angiogenic factors gene expression of gilts.

For a better understanding of the structure and function of the CRH gene and to study its effect on feeding regulation in cyprinid fish, the cDNA of the CRH gene from the brain of Schizothorax prenanti was cloned and sequenced. The full-length CRH cDNA consisted of 1,046 bp with an open reading frame of 489 bp encoding a protein of 162 amino acids. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that CRH was widely expressed in central and peripheral tissues. In particular, high expression level of CRH was detected in brain. Furthermore, CRH mRNA expression was examined in different brain regions, especially high in hypothalamus. In addition, there was no significant change in CRH mRNA expression in fed group compared with the fasted group in the S. prenanti hypothalamus during short-term fasting. However, CRH gene expression presented significant decrease in the hypothalamus in fasted group compared with the fed group (P < 0.05) on day 7; thereafter, re-feeding could lead to a significant increase in CRH mRNA expression in fasted group on day 9. The results suggest that the CRH may play a critical role in feeding regulation in S. prenanti.

Repair of damaged enterocytes may be involved to restore normal function of fish intestine. However, studies of fish enterocyte repair are scarce. The present study aimed to investigate the potential repair role of glutamine after a H2O2 challenge. In this study, fish enterocytes were post-treated with graded levels of glutamine (0, 4, 8, 12 and 20 mM of glutamine) after expose to 100 mu M H2O2. The basal control cells were kept in the glutamine-free minimum essential medium only. Results showed that the H2O2-induced decreases in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide optical density, alkaline phosphatase and Na+, K+-ATPase activities were completely restored by subsequent glutamine treatments. In addition, cellular injury (lactate dehydrogenase), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and protein oxidation (protein carbonyls) caused by H2O2 were reversed by subsequent glutamine treatments. Furthermore, the H2O2-induced decreases in glutathione contents, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were completely restored by subsequent glutamine treatments. In summary, the present study indicated that glutamine improved the repair activity in fish enterocytes after challenge with H2O2.

COLI; PROTEIN; TOMATO; PHOTOINHIBITION; BIOSYNTHESIS; ACCUMULATION	Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) catalyzes the synthesis of glycine betaine, a regulator of osmosis, and therefore BADH is considered to play a significant role in response of plants to abiotic stresses. Here, based on the conserved residues of the deduced amino acid sequences of the homologous BADH genes, we cloned the AnBADH gene from the xerophytic leguminous plant Ammopiptanthus nanus by using reverse transcription PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA is 1868 bp long without intron, and contains an open reading frame of 1512 bp, and 3'- and 5'-untranslated regions of 294 and 62 bp. It encodes a 54.71 kDa protein of 503 amino adds. The deduced amino add sequence shares high homology, conserved amino acid residues and sequence motifs crucial for the function with the BADHs in other leguminous species. The sequence of the open reading frame was used to construct a prokaryotic expression vector pET32a-AnBADH, and transform Escherichia coli. The transformants expressed the heterologous AnBADH gene under the induction of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and demonstrated significant enhancement of salt and heat tolerance under the stress conditions of 700 mmol L-1 NaCl and 55 degrees C high temperature. This result suggests that the AnBADH gene might play a crucial role in adaption of A. nanus to the abiotic stresses, and have the potential to be applied to transgenic operations of commercially important crops for improvement of abiotic tolerance.

In recent researches, pyrabactin resistance 1-like protein (PYL) and protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) were identified as the direct receptor and the second component of ABA signaling pathway, respectively. However, a lot of PYL and PP2C members were found in Arabidopsis and several other plants. Some of them were found not to be involved in ABA signaling. Because of the complex diversity of the genome, few documents have been available on the molecular details of the ABA signal perception system in maize. In the present study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis to find out the candidates (ZmPYL3 and ZmPP2C16) of the PYL and PP2C members most probably involved in ABA signaling in maize, cloned their encoding genes (ZmPYL3 and ZmPP2C16), verified the interaction between these two proteins in response to exogenous ABA induction by yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and investigated the expression patterns of these two genes under the induction of exogenous ABA by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results indicated that the ZmPYL3 and ZmPP2C16 proteins interacted in vitro and in vivo in response to the induction of exogenous ABA. The downregulated expression of the ZmPYL3 gene and the upregulated expression of the ZmPP2C16 gene are responsive to the induction of exogenous ABA. The ZmPYL3 and ZmPP2C16 proteins are the most probable members of the receptors and the second components of ABA signaling pathway, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Method: The CS stability was investigated at different values of pH (2.0-9.0) and temperature (4-37 degrees C). Kinetic parameters of CS degradation in alkaline environment were calculated adopting a new model that took into consideration the equilibrium between the active and a reversibly inactivated form of CS after long-time degradation. Result: All temperatures show increased CS instability, and this effect decreased in following sequence: 37 degrees C>25 degrees C>15 degrees C>4 degrees C, which describe typical Arrhenius behaviors with good correlation for K-d(R-2=0.941). Conclusion: The alkali-catalyzed degradation of CS was faster and stronger than the acidic one. The best conditions were met at a pH6.8 and 4 degrees C.

Moreover, TLRs specific expression pattern in different cells, tissue and organs have been confirmed to have correlation with the ability to resistance to pathogenic challenges. The present study aimed to determine the expression profiles and levels of TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 in the lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary, oviduct and hypothalamus of female rabbits, and whether the expression level of TLR2 and 4 in the ovary, oviduct, uterine horn and body, and cervix were affected by lipopolyasaccharide (LPS). The tissues of the lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary, oviduct and hypothalamus were collected from four rabbits which didn't be treated as Oh. 16 rabbits in LPS group were injected with LPS (according to 0.5 mg/kg body weight) and 16 rabbits in control group were injected with saline (LPS carrier), hereafter the tissues of the uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary and oviduct from 32 rabbits were collected after 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 h (n = 4 each group) postinjection. The expression profiles of TLRs were analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and expression level of TLRs were examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results shown: TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 were expressed in lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary, oviduct and hypothalamus of female rabbits, but their expression level had great difference in the same organs, and each TLR has different expression level in the different organs. After LPS-stimulation, the expression of TLR2 in the uterine body and horn was significantly higher than that in control group by 3 h and 12 h of postinjection (P < 0.05) respectively. The expression of TLR4 in ovary and uterine body was significantly higher than that in control group by 3 and 12 h of postinjection (P < 0.05), and the expression of TLR4 in uterine body was greater than that in control by 3 h postinjection (P < 0.05). The results suggested LPS upregulated the expression of TLR2 and 4 in uterine body and horn, and the expression of TLR4 in ovary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this region, slopes are composed of granite- or gneiss-derived soils that are commonly cultivated using earth-banked terraces. Based on the Cs-137 measurement for nine reference cores, the present study analysed the spatial patterns of Cs-137 inventory and soil erosion using 105 sampling points in a seven-level earth-banked terrace system. The mean Cs-137 inventory, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and allowable error for the nine reference cores were 987 Bq m(-2), 71 Bq m(-2), 7%, and 6%, respectively, values that may reflect the heterogeneity of the initial Cs-137 fallout deposit. Within each terrace, the Cs-137 inventory generally increases from the rear edge to the front edge, accompanied by a decrease in the erosion rate. This results from planation by tillage and rainfall runoff during the development of the earth-banked terraces. Across the entire seven-level terrace system, Cs-137 inventories decrease from the highest terrace downwards, but increase in the lower terraces, whereas erosion rate displays the opposite trend. These trends are the result of the combined effects of the earth-bank segmented hillslope, the limited protection of the earth banks, and rainfall runoff in combination with tillage. The high coefficients of variation of Cs-137 inventories for the 21 sampling rows, with a mean value of 44%, demonstrate the combined effects of variations in original microtopography, anthropogenic disturbance, the incohesive soils weathered from underlying granite, and the warm climate. Although earth-banked terraces can reduce soil erosion to some extent, the estimated erosion rates for the study area are still very high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, diets containing DLM and HMTBA at 25% of the total sulphur-containing amino acids (AA) present in the control (CON) diet were fed to lactating sows and weaned piglets and their responses were evaluated. Compared with the CON diet-fed sows, the HMTBA diet-fed sows exhibited a tendency (P<0.10) towards higher plasma taurine concentrations and the DLM diet-fed sows had higher (P<0.05) plasma taurine concentrations, but lower (P<0.05) isoleucine concentrations. Suckling piglets in the HMTBA treatment group had higher (P<0.05) intestinal reduced glutathione (GSH) content, lower (P<0.05) oxidised glutathione (GSSG): GSH ratio, and higher (P<0.05) plasma cysteine and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity than those in the CON and DLM treatment groups. The feed intake (P<0.05) and body weight of piglets averaged across post-weaning (PW) days were higher (P<0.05) in the HMTBA treatment group than in the DLM treatment group and were higher (P<0.05) and tended (P<0.10) to be higher, respectively, in the HMTBA treatment group than in the CON treatment group. Increased (P<0.05) GSSG content and GSSG:GSH ratio and down-regulated (P<0.05) expression of nutrient transport genes were observed in the jejunum of piglets on PW day 7 than on PW day 0. On PW day 14, the HMTBA diet-fed piglets had higher (P<0.05) intestinal GSH content than the CON diet-fed piglets and higher (P<0.05) plasma GPx activity, villus height and goblet cell numbers than the CON diet-and DLM diet-fed piglets. In conclusion, early weaning-induced growth retardation appears to be attenuated through changes in plasma AA profiles and elevation of growth performance and intestinal antioxidant capacity in piglets following increased consumption of methionine as HMTBA.

LPS molecules are transported from the inner membrane to the outer membrane by seven LPS transport proteins. LptB is vital in hydrolyzing ATP to provide energy for LPS transport, however this mechanism is not very clear. Here we report wild-type LptB crystal structure in complex with ATP and Mg2+, which reveals that its structure is conserved with other nucleotide-binding proteins (NBD). Structural, functional and electron microscopic studies demonstrated that the ATP binding residues, including K42 and T43, are crucial for LptB's ATPase activity, LPS transport and the vitality of Escherichia coli cells with the exceptions of H195A and Q85A; the H195A mutation does not lower its ATPase activity but impairs LPS transport, and Q85A does not alter ATPase activity but causes cell death. Our data also suggest that two protomers of LptB have to work together for ATP hydrolysis and LPS transport. These results have significant impacts in understanding the LPS transport mechanism and developing new antibiotics. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pigs were intravaginally infected and re-infected with C. suis strain S45, the type strain of this species. We demonstrated that S45 is pathogenic for the female urogenital tract. Chlamydia replication occurred throughout the urogenital tract, causing inflammation and pathology. Furthermore, genital infection elicited both cellular and humoral immune responses. Compared to the primo-infection of pigs with C. suis, re-infection was characterized by less severe macroscopic lesions and less chlamydial elementary bodies and inclusions in the urogenital tract. This indicates the development of a certain level of protection following the initial infection. Protective immunity against re-infection coincided with higher Chlamydia-specific IgG and IgA antibody titers in sera and vaginal secretions, higher proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), higher percentages of blood B lymphocytes, monocytes and CD8(+) T cells and upregulated production of IFN-gamma and IL-10 by PBMC.

Outbreaks of vibriosis associated with Vibrio mimicus in freshwater catfish in China	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Vibriosis; V. mimicus; Freshwater catfish; virulence genes; 16S rRNA; gyrB	STRAINS	An epidemic with a high mortality rate (80%-100%) recently occurred in yellow catfish, southern catfish, and Zhengchuan catfish in China. The clinical and pathological features were similar to those previously described for fish infected with vibriosis. Six bacterial strains were isolated from the different affected catfish species between 2011 and 2013. Based on the phenotypic characteristics, 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequence analysis, and multiplex PCR detection, all isolated strains were identified as Vibrio mimicus. The hemolysin gene was detected in all of the V. mimicus isolates, whereas none possessed the ctxA, zot, ace, or tcpA gene. The virulence tests were conducted by intraperitoneally injecting the V. mimicus isolates into healthy fish, and the results showed that all of the isolates were lethal to yellow catfish, southern catfish, and Zhengchuan catfish. The challenged fish showed similar clinical symptoms as those that were naturally infected. The results of this investigation indicate that V. mimicus was the causative agent of the natural epizootic. This is the first report of V. mimicus infection associated with mass mortality in freshwater catfish. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Geng, Y.; Liu, D.; Han, S.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, K.

To explore the function of duck FST in myoblast proliferation and differentiation, the pEGFP-FST eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and identified. The biological activities of this vector were analyzed by transfecting pEGFP-FST into cultured duck myoblasts using Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 and subsequently determining the mRNA expression profiles of FST and myostatin (MSTN). Results: The duck pEGFP-FST vector was successfully constructed and was confirmed to have high liposome-mediated transfection efficiency in duck myoblasts. Additionally, myoblasts transfected with pEGFP-FST had a higher biological activity. Significantly, the overexpression of FST in these cells significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of MSTN (a target gene that is negatively regulated by FST). Conclusions: The duck pEGFP-FST vector has been constructed successfully and exhibits biological activity by promoting myoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro.

The aim of this study is to assess the expression patterns of leptin receptor (Lepr) during ovarian follicle development and to reveal the mechanism by which leptin affects steroid hormone secretion in goose granulosa cells. Transcripts of Lepr were ubiquitous in all tested tissues, with pituitary and adrenal glands being the predominant sites. Goose ovarian follicles were divided into several groups by diameter including prehierarchical (4 to 6, 6 to 8, and 8 to 10 mm) and hierarchical (F5-F1) follicles. Lepr gene expression was significantly higher in granulosa cells than in theca cells from follicles of 4 to 8 mm in diameter. Expression of Lepr in granulosa cells decreased gradually as follicles developed, with fluctuating expression in F5 and F3 follicles. Lepr mRNA in theca cells underwent a slight decrease from the 6- to 8-mm cohorts to F5 follicle and then exhibited a transient increase and declined later. In vitro experiments in cultured goose granulosa cells showed that estradiol release was significantly stimulated, whereas progesterone increased slightly and testosterone decreased dramatically after leptin treatment. In accordance with the data for steroids, expression of Lepr, Srebp1, Cyp51, StAR, and Cyp19a1 were induced by the addition of leptin, and the concomitant changes in Hmgcs1, Dhcr24, Cyp11a1, 17 beta-hsd, Cyp17, and 3 beta-hsd gene expression were seen. These results suggested that leptin is involved in the development of goose ovarian follicles, and leptin's effect on steroid hormone secretion could be due to altered sterol/steroidogenic gene expression via interaction with its receptor.

A protocol for successful callus induction and plant regeneration from Primula forbesii Franch. anthers is described. We first examined morphological characteristics of flower buds at different microspore developmental stages, then utilized anthers at the appropriate developmental stage for callus induction. Cultures were initiated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1.0-2.0 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.5-2.0 mg/12,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The highest callus induction ratio (2.4%) was produced on MS + 1.0 mg/l BAP + 0.5 mg/l 2,4-D. Nine regeneration media were tested for callus shoot regeneration, with BAP from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/l and alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/l. The highest induction and proliferation of indefinite buds (55.2%) was produced on MS + 0.2 mg/l BAP + 0.01 mg/l NM. Plant regulator free MS was also found to be the best rooting medium. Among a total of 516 anther-derived plantlets flow cytometry and cytological analysis identified 2% to be haploid, 65% diploid, 9% triploid, 5% tetraploid, 2% hexaploid, and 17% mixoploid. This protocol provides a useful foundation for further research toward the development of homozygous P. forbesii or other Primula species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A metabolomic strategy employing high-resolution H-1 NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was used to investigate rat biological responses to spermine ingestion. Rats received intragastric administration of either 0.2 or 0.4 mu mol/g body weight of spermine or saline for 3 days. Plasma samples taken 48 h after the last spermine ingestion were analyzed. Spermine supplementation significantly increased the plasma levels of 1-methylhistidine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, glutamate, glycerolphosphocholine, phosphorylcholine, myo-inositol, phenylalanine, lysine, glutamine, trimethylanine, tyrosine, valine, formate, glucose, and lipids. These results suggest that spermine ingestion can alter common systemic metabolic processes, including cell membrane metabolism, lipid metabolism, glucose-alanine cycle metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microbiota metabolism. This study also shows the important role of spermine administration in modulating the metabolism of weaned rats.

The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein also play an essential role in postnatal growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the IRS1 and PTO genes and the regulation of growth traits in rabbits. A total of nine synonymous SNPs were detected in the IRS1 coding sequence using direct sequencing, and the c.189G>T and c.2574G>A SNPs from two linkage disequilibrium blocks were further genotyped for association analysis in 216 New Zealand rabbits. The association results revealed that the genotype of c.189G>T and the AA genotype of c.2574G>A were significantly associated with higher body weight at 70 (BW70) and 84 (BW84) days of age and with higher average daily gain (P < 0.05). Linear-regression analysis revealed that the two-gene combination model of FTO cA99G>A and IRS1 c.2574G>A was associated with BW70 and BW84. The combination model of the GA genotype of FTO c.499G>A with the AA genotype of IRS1 c.2574G>A was associated with preferred values for BW70 and BW84. The performance values for the FTO c.499G>A genotypes after stratification with regard to the IRS1 c.189G>T genotypes revealed that the TT genotype of IRS1 c.189G>T reduced the FTO cA99G>A significance associated with BW70 and BW84. Together, our data indicated that the IRS) gene was associated with growth traits in rabbits.

Although it is classified as salt tolerant crop, cotton growth and productivity are adversely affected by high salinity, especially at germination and seedling stages. Identification of genes and miRNAs responsible for salt tolerance in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) would help reveal the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance. We performed physiological experiments and transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq and small RNA-seq) of cotton leaves under salt stress using Illumina sequencing technology. Results: We investigated two distinct salt stress phases-dehydration (4 h) and ionic stress (osmotic restoration; 24 h)-that were identified by physiological changes of 14-day-old seedlings of two cotton genotypes, one salt tolerant and the other salt sensitive, during a 72-h NaCl exposure. A comparative transcriptomics was used to monitor gene and miRNA differential expression at two time points (4 and 24 h) in leaves of the two cotton genotypes under salinity conditions. The expression patterns of differentially co-expressed unigenes were divided into six groups using short time-servies expression miner software. During a 24-h salt exposure, 819 transcription factor unigenes were differentially expressed in both genotypes, with 129 unigenes specifically expressed in the salt-tolerant genotype. Under salt stress, 108 conserved miRNAs from known families were differentially expressed at two time points in the salt-tolerant genotype. We further analyzed the predicted target genes of these miRNAs along with the transcriptome for each time point. Important expressed genes encoding membrane receptors, transporters, and pathways involved in biosynthesis and signal transduction of calcium-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and hormones (abscisic acid and ethylene) were up-regulated. We also analyzed the salt stress response of some key miRNAs and their target genes and found that the expressions of five of nine target genes exhibited significant inverse correlations with their corresponding miRNAs. On the basis of these results, we constructed molecular regulatory pathways and a potential regulatory network for these salt-responsive miRNAs. Conclusions: Our comprehensive transcriptome analysis has provided new insights into salt-stress response of upland cotton. The results should contribute to the development of genetically modified cotton with salt tolerance.

Among the 13 identified bacterial genera, the most abundant genus was Bacillus (79 isolates) out of which 32 represented B. subtilis and 14 B. pumilus, followed by Rhizobium sp. (29 isolates) and Ochrobactrum intermedium (13 isolates). Altogether 93 isolates tolerated the highest concentration (1000 mg kg(-1)) of at least one of the six tested heavy metals. Five strains were tolerant against all the tested heavy metals, 71 strains tolerated 1,000 mg kg(-1) cadmium whereas only one strain tolerated 1,000 mg kg(-1) cobalt. Altogether 67% of the bacteria produced indoleacetic acid (IAA), a plant growth-promoting phytohormone. The concentration of IAA produced by 53 isolates was higher than 20 mu g ml(-1). In total 21% of the bacteria produced siderophore (5.50-167.67 mu g ml(-1)) with two Bacillus sp. producing more than 100 mu g ml(-1). Eighteen isolates produced both IAA and siderophore. The results suggested that the indigenous bacteria in the soil have beneficial characteristics for remediating the contaminated mine tailing soil.

The objective of the study was to investigate the differences in eggshell quality, bone quality and serum bone biochemistry markers associated with changes in age and dietary soybean oil levels in laying hens. 2. A total of 54, 19-week-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were housed in 18 battery cages (3 birds/cage) and randomly divided into three diet treatments for 90 d: control-fat (CF, 1.9% soybean oil), moderate-fat (MF, 7% soybean oil) and high-fat (HF, 10% soybean oil). 3. The hens' body weights (BW), egg production, egg weights, eggshell thickness and femoral diameter were higher at d 90 than at d 60 or d 30. Meanwhile, feed intake, relative bone weights, all bone strength parameters and serum Ca were lower at d 90 or 60 than at d 30. 4. Compared to the CF hens, the feed intake, BW, abdominal fat pad weights and serum alkaline phosphatase activity were elevated in MF or HF hens. The eggshell thickness, relative femoral and tibial weight, femoral stiffness, femoral modulus, tibial mixed force and serum calcium and phosphorus levels were lower in MF or HF hens than CF hens. 5. These findings suggest that bone loss in caged hens starts from an early stage of the laying period, and dietary oil (particularly with diets over 10% soybean oil) has harmful effects on eggshell quality, bone strength and bone mineralisation from an early stage of the laying period.

In particular, it would be useful to clarify which diploid progenitor contributed the D genome of this allohexaploid species. In this study, we demonstrate that the landmarks produced by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of species of Avena using probes derived from Avena sativa can be used to explore the origin of the D genome. Selected sets of probes were hybridized in several sequential experiments performed on exactly the same chromosome spreads, with multiple probes of cytological preparations. Probes pITS and A3-19 showed there might be a similar distribution of pITS between the A(c) and D genomes. These results indicated that the Ac genome is closely related to the D genome, and that Avena canariensis (A(c)A(c)) could be the D-genome donor of cultivated oat.

Their chromosome numbers were 14, 28 or 42. The karyotypcial formulae are suggested as follows: Sweden population (PI 297869), 2n = 2x = 14 = 14m; Bulgaria population (PI 636511), 2n = 2x = 14 = 8m + 6sm; Iran population (PI 401074) 2n = 4x = 28 = 10m + 18sm; Russian Federation population (PI 439948) 2n = 4x = 28 = 20m + 8sm, Russian Federation population (PI 564878), 2n = 4x = 28 = 18m + 10sm; and Iran population (PI 401080), 2n = 6x = 42 = 20m + 22sm. The relative length of the longest chromosome was 8.40 in Bulgaria population, but 4.57 in Iran population. These results indicated that discrepancies on chromosome structure and numbers existed among these populations. Sweden population is placed in 1A, and the other populations are placed in 2A for karyotype symmetry.

Comparisons of various methods of single-wavelength colorimetric procedure (SWC) for amylose, dual-wavelength colorimetric method (DWC) for amylose, amylopectin and total starch, and polarimetric method by calcium chloride dissolution (PCC) for total starch content were conducted as well in barley. The results showed that defatted samples measured by SWC had higher amylose than non-defatted ones (P<0.05). Several samples exhibited significant difference for amylose content when defatted and non-defatted samples were analyzed by DWC (P<0.05). However, for amylopectin, the defatted samples determined by DWC were significantly lower than that of non-defatted ones (P<0.05). The total starch of defatted samples measured by DWC was much lower than those with fat (P<0.05). According to various methods, the amylose contents of defatted samples measured by SWC were higher than those measured by DWC (P<0.05). The non-defatted samples measured by PCC had lower starch than those measured by DWC, but had higher starch than the defatted samples measured by DWC (P<0.05). Collectively, defatting should not be omitted in determining starch content, and DWC is a suitable method for the measuring of barley starch.

The decolourization efficiency of the reactor was higher; nearly complete bleaching was achieved in 21 min for all the monocomponent dyes and over 90% bleaching for the mixtures. The total organic carbon removal of the monocomponent was 32% for acid dyes and 22% for basic dyes; the mineralization of mixtures was lower than that of single dyes. On comparing with the single dyes, the energy yield significantly increased when this reactor was used to treat the mixtures. The initial pH and conductivities had significant effect on the degradation of both acid and basic dyes. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Various chlorinated volatile organic compounds (carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and chlorobenzene) were tested for the single-component adsorption study using the gravimetric adsorption method. The study focused on the adsorption of chlorinated volatile organic compounds, and the effect of the number of chlorine atoms in the molecule to the adsorption uptake. Results from the experiments showed that adsorption by activated carbon increased with increasing number of chlorine atoms and hence, with increasing molecular weight. There is, however, no significant difference between the adsorption of molecules with the same number of chlorine atoms but with different bond orders. It indicates that the influence of molecular weight is more important than the existence of double bonds within the molecule. The reusability of the activated carbon was proved when no significant decrease in its adsorption capacity was observed even after the fourth time of regeneration.

LIPID-PEROXIDATION; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DROUGHT; TOLERANCE; WHEAT; L.; RESPONSES	The present study was designed to examine the effects of heat acclimation on enzymatic activity, transcription levels, the photosynthesis processes associated with thermostability in orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.). The stomatal conductance (Gs), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), and transpiration rates (Tr) of both heat-acclimated (HA) and non-acclimated (NA) plants were drastically reduced during heat treatment [using a 5-day heat stress treatment (38/30 degrees C. day/night) followed by a 3-day recovery under control conditions (25/20 degrees C. day/night), in order to consolidate the second cycle was permitted]. Water use efficiency increased more steeply in the HA (4.9 times) versus the NA (1.8 times) plants, and the intercellular CO2 concentration decreased gently in NA (10.9%) and HA (25.3%) plants after 20 d of treatments compared to 0 days'. Furthermore, heat-acclimated plants were able to maintain significant activity levels of superoxide disumutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), and transcription levels of genes encoding these enzymes; in addition, HA plants displayed lower malondialdehyde content and lower electrolyte leakage than NA plants. These results suggest that maintenance of activity and transcription levels of antioxidant enzymes as well as photosynthesis are associated with variable thermostability in HA and NA plants. This likely occurs through cellular membrane stabilization and improvements in water use efficiency in the photosynthetic process during heat stress. The association between antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression, both of which may vary with genetic variation in heat tolerance, is important to further understand the molecular mechanisms that contribute to heat tolerance.

ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR evolved significant levels of resistance, with resistance ratios (RR) of 39-fold and 78.8-fold to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, respectively. The susceptibility of ACB-AbR larvae to Cry1Ac and Cry1F toxins, which had not previously been exposed, were significantly reduced, being > 113-fold and 48-fold, respectively. Similarly, susceptibility of ACB-AcR larvae to Cry1Ab and Cry1F were also significantly reduced (RR > nine-fold, RR > 18-fold, respectively), indicating cross-resistance among Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, and Cry1F toxins. However, ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR larvae were equally susceptible to Cry1Ie as were ACB-BtS larvae, indicating no cross-resistance between Cry1Ie and Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac toxins; this may provide considerable benefits in preventing or delaying the evolution of resistance in ACB to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxins. Backcrossing studies indicated that resistance to Cry1Ab toxin was polygenic in ACB-AbR, but monogenic in ACB-AcR, whilst resistance to Cry1Ac toxin was primarily monogenic in both ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR, but polygenic as resistance increased.

Here, we expanded our association panel size from 368 to 513 inbred lines with 0.5 million high quality SNPs using a two-step data-imputation method which combines identity by descent (IBD) based projection and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were carried out for 17 agronomic traits with a panel of 513 inbred lines applying both mixed linear model (MLM) and a new method, the Anderson-Darling (A-D) test. Ten loci for five traits were identified using the MLM method at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold -log(10) (P) >5.74 (alpha = 1). Many loci ranging from one to 34 loci (107 loci for plant height) were identified for 17 traits using the A-D test at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold -log(10) (P) >7.05 (alpha = 0.05) using 556809 SNPs. Many known loci and new candidate loci were only observed by the A-D test, a few of which were also detected in independent linkage analysis. This study indicates that combining IBD based projection and KNN algorithm is an efficient imputation method for inferring large missing genotype segments. In addition, we showed that the A-D test is a useful complement for GWAS analysis of complex quantitative traits. Especially for traits with abnormal phenotype distribution, controlled by moderate effect loci or rare variations, the A-D test balances false positives and statistical power. The candidate SNPs and associated genes also provide a rich resource for maize genetics and breeding.

Mechanisms of grass plants in response to drought stress and rewatering remain largely unknown. The study was designed to investigate the different physiological and molecular responses of two genotypes of orchardgrass (drought-tolerant 'Baoxing' and drought-sensitive '01998') to drought stress and rewatering. The 'Baoxing' and '01998' were exposed to drought stress for 24 and 21 days in a growth chamber, respectively, allowing the leaf relative water content of both genotypes to drop to the same level (20%). 'Baoxing' exhibited higher net photosynthetic rate, free proline content, total soluble sugar (TSS) content and ornithine aminotransferase activity as well as lower electrolyte leakage compared with '01998'. After rewatering, 'Baoxing' recovered more rapidly in all parameters than '01998' except for TSS. In addition, significantly higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) as well as lower malondialdehyde levels were observed in the 'Baoxing' when compared with the ` 01998' under drought stress and rewatering. Maintenance of higher transcripts levels of SOD and POD in 'Baoxing' suggests that SOD and POD could be involved in scavenging oxidative stress-induced reactive oxygen and removing hydrogen peroxide in orchardgrass through changes in the level of gene expression. Combined with antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression levels, our results indicate that POD could play critical roles in recovery from drought damages. The results indicated both osmolyte accumulation and antioxidant enzymes could contribute to a better drought tolerance of 'Baoxing' than '01998'.

Genetic diversity and variation in North American orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) cultivars and breeding lines	GRASSLAND SCIENCE			English	Article						Cultivar; genetic structure; orchardgrass; simple sequence repeat	DRY-MATTER YIELD; SIMILARITY INDEX; LOLIUM-PERENNE; HEADING DATE; MARKERS; POPULATIONS; GERMPLASM; PROGRESS; INDIVIDUALS; MANAGEMENT	Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a high quality forage grass naturalized to temperate climates. Used extensively in hay and grazing agriculture, hundreds of orchardgrass cultivars have been released over the past 50 years. However, progress in yield and other agronomic characteristics in orchardgrass cultivars has occurred slowly and often inconsistently. One cause of the slow progress could be a lack of genetic diversity among orchardgrass cultivars, or an over-abundance of diversity within cultivars. With an emphasis on North American cultivars, this study assessed the genetic diversity within and among 52 orchardgrass cultivars, breeding lines and accessions. Genetic similarity within cultivars ranged from 52 to 71%, similar to values from wild-land, unselected accessions. Populations from Wisconsin and Missouri breeding efforts that resulted from two cycles of genotypic recurrent selection were included as checks. Neither group of selection populations exhibited more within-population similarity compared to the wild-land accessions (ecotypes) and cultivars. Genetic differentiation was detected only for the selection populations and several cultivars and breeding lines that had a tendency to originate from eastern Asian germplasm and have late flowering times. These results indicated an abundance of genetic variation within the orchardgrass cultivars, but a paucity of genetic differentiation among cultivars.	[Xie, Wengang; Bushman, B.

A Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the extraction parameters to maximize the polysaccharide extraction yield. The polysaccharide SMP-U1 was isolated and characterized; then the antioxidant and antiproliferation activities were evaluated in vitro. The modified optimal conditions were an ultrasonic power of 180W, an extraction temperature of 54 degrees C, and an extraction time of 32 min, achieving an extraction yield of 40.54 +/- 0.25%. The results indicate that SMP-U1 has significant antioxidant activity, scavenging the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. It has also exhibited effect on the proliferation of human breast carcinoma cells Bcap-37 and human esophageal carcinoma cells Eca-109, especially at a concentration of 0.30 mg/mL. In conclusion, SMP-U1 has remarkable in vitro antioxidant and antiproliferation activity, and has potential for application as a natural antioxidant or antitumor agent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To describe the molecular features of this novel subgenotype, we sequenced and characterized the complete genome of the SD0803 virus. The genome is 12,271 bp in length and contains 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that flank an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 3,898-amino-acid polypeptide. The full-length genome of the SD0803 strain shares 78.8 % to 83.3 % identity with those of other BVDV-1 strains, 70.0 % to 70.7 % identity with those of BVDV-2 strains, and less than 67.6 % identity with those of other pestiviruses. The highest level of shared identity was 83.3 % between the complete SD0803 genome and that of the ZM-95 strain of BVDV-1. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5' UTR and the coding sequence for the N-terminal protease fragment of the SD0803 polyprotein indicated that the SD0803 virus is a member of the novel subgenotype BVDV-1q, isolates of which have been identified recently in dairy cattle and camels in China.

In this study, we proposed a feature selection-based method to accurately predict protein structural classes. Three datasets with sequence identity lower than 25% were used to test the prediction performance of the method. Through jackknife cross-validation, we have verified that the overall accuracies of these three datasets are 92.1%, 89.7% and 84.0%, respectively.

However, the UL49.5 protein of duck enteritis virus (DEV) (pUL49.5) has not been reported. In the current study, the DEV pUL49.5 gene was first subjected to molecular characterization. To verify the predicted intracellular localization of gene expression, the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-C1/pUL49.5 was constructed and used to transfect duck embryo fibroblasts. Next, the recombinant plasmid pDsRed1-N1/glycoprotein M (gM) was produced and used for co-transfection with the pEGFP-C1/pUL49.5 plasmid to determine whether DEV pUL49.5 and gM (a conserved protein in herpesviruses) colocalize. DEV pUL49.5 was thought to be an envelope glycoprotein with a signal peptide and two transmembrane domains. This protein was also predicted to localize in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum with a probability of 66.7%. Images taken by a fluorescence microscope at different time points revealed that the DEV pUL49.5 and gM proteins were both expressed in the cytoplasm. Overlap of the two different fluorescence signals appeared 12 h after transfection and continued to persist until the end of the experiment. These data indicate a possible interaction between DEV pUL49.5 and gM.

One hundred and eight (71.22 +/- 0.04 kg body weight) crossbred (Landrace x Rongchang) castrated male pigs were blocked by BW and allotted to 36 pens (three pigs per pen), and pens were randomly assigned within blocks to one of six dietary treatments arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial design, with two DE levels (13.0 or 14.5 MJ/kg) and three Lys:DE ratios (0.40, 0.50, or 0.60 g/MJ). Over the 46-d trial, dietary energy density had no effect on average daily gain (ADG) (P=0.48), however, pigs fed high-energy diets had decreasing average daily feed intake (ADFI) and the ratio of feed intake and gain (FIG) (P <0.05). Feeding of the diet with the highest Lys:DE ratio resulted in increased F/G (P <0.05) compared with other experimental diets. Increasing energy density increased hot carcass, dressing percentage and intramuscular fat (IMF) content (P < 0.05). Furthermore, IMF content decreased with increasing Lys:DE ratio (P< 0.05). An energy density x Lys:DE ratio interaction on slaughter weight and shearing force was observed (P< 0.05). In addition, pigs fed 14.5 MJ/kg had decreasing IMF content as Lys:DE ratio increased (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05), but increasing muscle pH(45) min (linear, P < 0.05). There was a quadratic effect on shearing force (P< 0.05) as Lys:DE ratio increased for pigs fed 13.0 MJ/kg. Increasing dietary DE enhanced the expression of PPAR gamma (P < 0.05) in muscle tissues, whereas the mRNA levels of PPAR gamma decreased (P< 0.05) as Lys:DE ratio increased. The results of this study indicated that a reasonably reduced Lys:DE ratio diet increased intramuscular fat deposition and improved pork tenderness. This could be partly related to the increased gene expression of PPAR gamma in muscle tissues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of dietary supplementation with benzoic acid on intestinal morphological structure and microflora in weaned piglets	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Benzoic acid; Digests pH values; Microbial metabolites; Gut histo-morphology; Piglets	ORGANIC-ACIDS; GASTROINTESTINAL MICROBIOTA; NUTRIENT DIGESTIBILITY; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; DIGESTIVE-TRACT; VILLOUS HEIGHT; CRYPT DEPTH; PIG DIETS; NUTRITION; ILEAL	A total of 72 weaned pigs [(Yorkshire x Landrace) x Duroc] with an average BW of 6.03 +/- 0.78 kg (24 d of age) were used in a 42-d trial to explore the potential mechanisms of dietary benzoic acid on gut health in weaned pigs. Pigs were randomly allotted to two groups with six replications per group and fed with a basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with 5000 mg/kg benzoic acid (benzoic acid).The results showed that benzoic acid supplementation decreased the pH values of the digesta in the colon on 14th day and in the ileum and cecum on 42nd day of pigs (P < 0.05). The number of Bifidobacterium in ileum and Bacillus in cecum of pigs fed benzoic acid diet were greater than pigs fed the control diet on 14th day (P <0.05), the number of Escherichia colt in ileum and cecum on 42nd day were decreased in pigs fed benzoic acid diet (P <0.05), the number of Enterococci in ileum were decreased on 14th and 42nd day in pigs fed benzoic acid diet (P < 0.05). When compared with control, benzoic acid increased the content of propionic acid and total VFA in cecum on 14th day (P< 0.05), decreased the concentrations of NH3-N in cecum on 14th day and 42nd day (P< 0.05). The villus height in duodenum and ileum on 14th day were greater in pigs fed benzoic acid diet (P <0.05), benzoic acid increased villus height in ileum on 42nd day (P < 0.05), decreased crypt depth in duodenum on 14th day (P< 0.05), and increased the villus height:crypt depth ratio in duodenum, jejunum and ileum on 14th day and 42nd day (P < 0.05). In conclusion, diet supplemented with 5000 mg/kg benzoic acid can improve the gut health of piglets through decreasing the digesta pH values, maintaining the balance of microflora and promoting the development of intestinal morphology in weaned pigs.

Vulgare) landraces from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using 1264 polymorphic diversity array technology (DArT) markers. The mean polymorphism information content (PIC) of the DArT markers ranged between 0.008 and 0.500 with an average of 0.213. Bayesian, principal coordinate analysis, and phylogenetic analysis supported that six-rowed barley landraces from this region are divided into five distinct subpopulations centered on the regions of origin of the germ-plasm. The genetic distances calculated for all the individual pairs were geographically dependent, as revealed by Mantel tests (r = 0.35, P < 0.001) and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The LD values, expressed as r(2), declined with increasing genetic distance, and the same tendency occurred on each chromosome. In general, LD values were low (9.1% of adjacent markers; P < 0.001), and mean LD values across the whole genome decayed to below the critical r(2) of 0.22 after 3.32 cM. Approximately 19.0% of marker pairs (mean r(2) = 0.586) located on the same chromosome and 4.9% of pairs (mean r(2) = 0.318) located on different chromosomes were in LD (r(2) = 0.22). Our results discerned relevant patterns of genetic diversity, population structure, and LD among members of a Qinghai-Tibet Plateau barley landraces panel proposed to be 'typical' of a target region or environment and have important implications for further studies on association mapping and practical breeding in high-altitude naked barley.

JIAN; AMINO-ACIDS; NONSPECIFIC IMMUNE; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS	This study investigated the effects of dietary valine on the growth, intestinal immune response, tight junction proteins transcript abundance and gene expression of immune-related signaling molecules in the intestine of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Six iso-nitrogenous diets containing graded levels of valine (4.3-19.1 g kg(-1) diet) were fed to the fish for 8 weeks. The results showed that percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency of fish were the lowest in fish fed the valine-deficient diet (P < 0.05). In addition, valine deficiency decreased lysozyme, acid phosphatase activities and complement 3 content in the intestine (P < 0.05), down-regulated mRNA levels of interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta 1, I kappa B alpha and target of rapamycin (TOR) (P < 0.05), and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 8 and nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF-kappa B P65) gene expression (P < 0.05). Additionally, valine deficiency significantly decreased transcript of Occludin. Claudin b, Claudin c, Claudin 3, and ZO-1 (P < 0.05), and improved Claudin 15 expression in the fish intestine (P < 0.05). However, valine did not have a significant effect on expression of Claudin 12 in the intestine of grass carp (P > 0.05). In conclusion, valine deficiency decreased fish growth and intestinal immune status, as well as regulated gene expression of tight junction proteins, NF-kappa B P65, I kappa B alpha and TOR in the fish intestine. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of lysozyme activity or PWG, the dietary valine requirement of young grass carp (268-679 g) were established to be 14.47 g kg(-1) diet (4.82 g 100 g(-1) CP) or 14.00 g kg(-1) diet (4.77 g 100 g(-1) CP), respectively.

Fish were fed six different experimental diets containing graded levels of Trp at 0.7(control), 1.7, 3.1, 4.0, 52 and 6.1 g kg(-1) diet for 8 weeks. The results showed that Trp supplementation significantly enhanced the percent weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency (P < 0.05), and decreased the plasma ammonia content (PAC) (P < 0.05). After the 8-week feeding trail, an environmental copper exposure trail was conducted for 4 days. Results from the copper exposure trail showed that dietary Trp enhanced the lysozyme, acid phosphatase activities and complement 3 contents in the intestine of young grass carp (P < 0.05). In addition, Trp supplementation increased the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and glutathione contents (P < 0.05), and decreased the protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde contents (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the relative gene expression levels of interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta 1, occludin, zonula occludens 1, claudin-b, -c, and 3, SOD1, GPx and NF-E2-related factor 2 in the intestine were significantly up-regulated with increasing of dietary Trp up to a certain level (P < 0.05). Conversely, the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 8, target of rapamycin, Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1, claudin-12 and -15a in the intestine were significantly down-regulated by Trp (P < 0.05). Collectively, appropriate dietary Trp level improves fish growth, intestinal immune response, barrier function and antioxidant status, and regulated the mRNA levels of related signal molecules of young grass carp. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of the PWG and PAC, the dietary Trp requirement of young grass carp (287-699 g) was estimated to be 3.81 g kg(-1) diet (12.7 g kg(-1) protein) and 3.89 g kg(-1) diet (13.0 g kg(-1) protein), respectively.

Detection, differentiation, and VP1 sequencing of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 and type 3 by a 1-step duplex reverse-transcription PCR assay	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						duck viral hepatitis; duck hepatitis A virus type 1; duck hepatitis A virus type 3; VP1; epidemic investigation	MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION; POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; MOLECULAR ANALYSIS; HUMAN ENTEROVIRUSES; GENETIC DIVERSITY; RAPID DETECTION; GENOTYPE C; CHINA; DUCKLINGS	Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) is an infectious pathogen causing fatal duck viral hepatitis in ducklings. Although both the inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines have been used to protect ducklings, DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 still cause significant serious damage to the duck industry in China and South Korea. For rapid detection, differentiation, and epidemic investigation of DHAV in China, a genotype-specific 1-step duplex reverse-transcription (RT) PCR assay was established in this study. The sensitivity and specificity of the developed RT-PCR assay was evaluated with nucleic acids extracted from 2 DHAV reference strains, and 9 other infectious viruses and bacteria. The genotype-specific primers amplified different size DNA fragments encompassing the complete VP1 gene of the DHAV-1 or DHAV-3. The assay detected the liver samples collected from experimentally infected ducklings and dead ducklings collected from different regions of China. Sequence analysis of these DNA fragments indicated that VP1 sequences of DHAV-1 can be used to distinguish wild type and vaccine strains. The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences indicated that the developed RT-PCR assay can be used for epidemic investigation of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3. The developed RT-PCR assay can be used as a specific molecular tool for simultaneous detection, differentiation, and sequencing the VP1 gene of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3, which can be used for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of DHAV.

Impact of fiber types on gut microbiota, gut environment and gut function in fattening pigs	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Dietary fiber; Intestinal bacteria; Volatile fatty acid; Disaccharidase; Glucose transporter	IN-VITRO FERMENTATION; CHAIN FATTY-ACIDS; DIETARY FIBER; INTESTINAL BACTERIA; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; WHEAT ARABINOXYLANS; MESSENGER-RNA; EXPRESSION	This study was designed to evaluate the impact of different fibrous diets on intestinal bacteria, fermentation metabolites and mucosal digestive physiology in fattening pigs. A total of 125 weaned piglets were allocated to five treatments, and each treatment was replicated in five pens of five pigs each. Pigs were fed ad libitum for 160 d. The experimental diets consisted of three-phase feeding program and four sources of fiber (maize fiber, soybean fiber, wheat bran fiber and pea fiber) were evaluated in each phase, including 10%, 20% or 30% of fiber source in the different phase feeding diets, respectively. Cereal fiber (maize fiber and wheat bran fiber) predominantly consisted of xylose and arabinose. Soybean fiber was characterized by high contents of galactose, and pea fiber was rich in glucose. Average daily feed intake (ADFI) was reduced (P<0.05) in pigs fed SF, but supplemental pea fiber had a higher feed conversion ratio (P<0.05) compared to control diet (CON). In ileum, increased villus height (P<0.05) was found in pea fiber diet (PF) and wheat bran fiber diet (WB) compared to soybean fiber diet (SF). Higher ileal sucrase (P<0.05) and maltase activities (P<0.05) occurred in pigs fed PF compared to CON and SF. In cecum, acetate concentrations in SF (P<0.05) and butyrate concentration in WB (P<0.05) were higher than those in CON. Lower ileal Lactobacillus populations (P<0.05) and higher cecal Escherichia coli populations in SF (P<0.05) were found compared to CON. Meanwhile, cecal Lactobacillus populations in PF (P<0.05) and Bifidobacterium populations in WB (P<0.05) were higher than CON. The glucose transporters gene expression was up-regulated (P<0.05) in WB and/or PF compared to CON. To be concluded, influences of dietary sources on intestinal microflora and volatile fatty acids seemed to be related to fiber components, which possibly led to the changes in intestinal mucosal digestive physiology and thus affect production parameters of fattening pigs.

The effects of particle size and temperature on rheological properties and corresponding energy reduction were studied. The results indicated that corn stover slurry exhibited pseudo-plastic flow behavior at TS of 4.23-7.32%, and was well described by Power-law model. At TS of 4.23%, rheological properties were not obviously affected by particle size and temperature. However, when TS was increased to 7.32%, there was 10.37% shear stress reduction by size-reduction from 20 to 80-mesh, and 11.73% shear stress reduction by temperature-increase from 25 to 55 degrees C. P-TS was advanced as variations of power consumption by TS-increase from 4.23% to 7.32%. There was 9.2% P-TS-reduction by size-reduction from 20 to 80-mesh at 35 degrees C. Moreover, P-TS-reduction of 10.3%/10 degrees C was achieved at 20-mesh compared with 9.0%/10 degrees C at 80-mesh. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of monochromatic light on reproductive traits, fertility, and quality of eggs of local mountainous laying hens of China. Five hundred fifty-two 19-wk-old hens were randomly divided into 4 groups, with each group consisting of 138 birds. Feed and water were provided ad libitum. Light treatments were control white (mini-incandescent light bulbs), blue (480 nm), green (560 nm), and red (660 nm). Birds maintained under green light produced fewer eggs than other groups. The red light group had a greater egg shape index than other groups and had greater fertility and hatchability than other groups. Egg weight was affected by light wavelength, but the rate of egg production was not. The ratio between egg components can be changed by the light source without changing the egg weight. Egg quality was the best for hens exposed to the green light.

Growth and photosynthetic responses of soybean seedlings to maize shading in relay intercropping system in Southwest China	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						carbon accumulation; chlorophyll a fluorescence; photosynthetic pigment; planting pattern; productivity	CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; USE EFFICIENCY; LEAF-AREA; LIGHT ENVIRONMENT; THUJA-PLICATA; FOOD SECURITY; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; MORPHOLOGY; WHEAT	Intercropping, a traditional and worldwide cropping practice, has been considered as a paradigm of sustainable agriculture based on complementary mechanisms among different crop species. Soybean (Glycine max) is widely relay intercropped about 60 days before maize (Zea mays) harvest in Southwest China. However, shade caused by tall maize plants may be a limiting factor for soybean growth at a seedling stage. In field research, we studied the ecophysiological responses of two widely cultivated soybean varieties [Gongqiudou494-1 (GQD) and Gongxuan 1 (GX)] to maize shading in a relay intercropping system (RI) compared with monocropped soybean plants (M). Our results showed that soybean seedlings intercropped with maize exhibited significantly downregulated net photosynthetic rate (P (N)) (-38.3%), transpiration rate (-42.7%), and stomatal conductance (-55.4%) due to low available light. The insignificant changes in intercellular CO2 concentration and the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry suggested that the maize shading-induced depressions in P (N) were probably caused by the deficiency of energy for carbon assimilation. The significantly increased total chlorophyll (Chl) content (+27.4%) and Chl b content (+52.2%), with lowered Chl a/b ratios (-20.5%) indicated soybean plants adjusted their light-harvesting efficiency under maize shading condition. Biomass and leaf area index (LAI) of seedlings under RI decreased significantly (-78.7 and -71%, respectively) in comparison with M. Correlation analysis indicated the relative reduction in biomass accumulation was caused by the decline in LAI rather than P (N), it affected negatively the final yields of soybean (32.8%). Cultivar-specific responses to maize shading were observed in respects of LAI, biomass, and grain yield. It indicated that GX might be a better cultivar for relay intercropping with maize in Southwest China.	[Su, B. Y.; Cui, L.; Yong, T. W.; Yang, W.

A total of 180 actinobacteria strains were isolated from the rhizosphere soil, leaves, stems, and roots of nine selected plants and have been identified as potential biocontrol agents against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. An endophytic strain CNS-42 isolated from Alisma orientale showed the largest zone of inhibition demonstrating a potent effect against F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum and a broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeasts, and other pathogenic fungi. The in vivo biocontrol assays showed that the disease severity index was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), and plant shoot fresh weight and height increased greatly (P < 0.05) in plantlets treated with strain CNS-42 compared to the negative control. This isolate was identified as Streptomyces sp. based on cultural, physiological, morphological characteristics, and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Further bioassay-guided isolation and purification revealed that staurosporine was responsible for its antifungal and plant growth promoting activities and the latter property of staurosporine is reported for the first time. The in vivo assay was further performed and indicated that staurosporine showed good growth promoting effect on the plant shoot biomass of cucumber. This is the first critical evidence identifying CNS-42 as a biocontrol agent for the soil borne pathogen, F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum.

Hens were then randomly assigned to one of three treatments, which included the control and control added with 60 or 300 mg Mn/kg diet (M-Mn or H-Mn). Duodenum, heart, liver, and tibia were collected in hens after 12-week feeding period. No significant differences were observed in egg production, feed/egg ratio, shell breaking strength, and shell thickness among different treatments. Compared with control or M-Mn, H-Mn decreased (P < 0.05) serum Fe concentration, while increased (P < 0.05) total Fe-binding capacity (TIBC). The Fe concentration decreased (P < 0.05) in duodenum, and tended to reduce (P < 0.10) in liver from control to M-Mn and to H-Mn; whereas, dietary Mn supplementation did not influence (P > 0.10) Fe concentration in the heart and tibia. In conjunction with reduced Fe retention, DMT1 mRNA expression decreased (P < 0.05) with dietary Mn concentration increasing in the duodenum and liver. Duodenal FPN1 mRNA level was higher (P < 0.05) in H-Mn group than that in control or M-Mn group, while hepatic FPN1 mRNA expression was lower (P < 0.05) in M-Mn or H-Mn group when compared with control. The results demonstrated that dietary Mn supplementation decreased Fe concentration in duodenum and liver of hens, which may be related to the alteration of DMT1 and FPN1 expression in these tissues.

Therefore, crop uptake of heavy metals may be reduced by collecting germplasm resources. In the present study, cadmium accumulation and nutrients in radish were investigated by intercropping 3 genotypes (red, green, and white radish) in different combinations. Both pot and field experiments showed that cadmium content in radish was increased by intercropping 2 or 3 genotypes, except when white radish was intercropped with green radish. The biomass of red radish was improved by a mixture of all 3 genotypes, green radish biomass was improved by intercropping with the other 2 varieties, and white radish biomass was improved by intercropping with red radish in both pot and field experiments. The pot experiment indicated that the soil exchangeable cadmium concentration of red radish grown with green radish was lower than that of monoculture, whereas red radish intercropped with white radish was between the respective monocultures; the soil exchangeable cadmium concentrations of green radish grown with white radish and with all 3 genotypes grown together were greater than those of the monocultures. Some intercropping modes also improved potassium and phosphorus contents in the edible parts of radish in the pot experiment.

The objective of the present study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chicken TBC1D1 using 128 Erlang mountainous chickens and to determine if these SNPs are associated with carcass traits. The approach consisted of sequencing TBC1D1 using a panel of DNA from different individuals, revealing twenty-two SNPs. Among these SNPs, two polymorphisms (g.69307744C>T and g.69307608T>G) of block 1, four polymorphisms (g.69322320C>T, g.69322314G>A, g.69317290A>G and g.69317276T>C) of block 2 and four polymorphisms of block 3 (g.69349746G>A, g.69349736C>G, g.69349727C>T and g.69349694C>T) exhibited a high degree of linkage disequilibrium in all test populations. An association analysis was performed between the twenty-two SNPs and seven performance traits. SNPs g.69307744C>T, g.69340192G>A and g.69355665T>C were demonstrated to have a strong effect on liveweight (BW), carcass weight (CW), semi-eviscerated weight (SEW) and eviscerated weight (EW) and g.69340070C>T polymorphism was related to BW, SEW and BMW in chicken populations. However, for the other SNPs, there were no significant correlations between different genotypes and carcass traits. Meanwhile, haplotype CT-TG of block 1 and combined genotype AG-TT-AC-CT of block 3 were significantly associated with BW, CW, SEW and EW. Overall, our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in TBC1D1 are associated with carcass traits and would be a useful candidate gene in selection programs for improving carcass traits.

The influence of LH signaling cascades action on circadian clock genes was investigated using granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles from Roman hens cultured in a serum-free system. The expression of core oscillators (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1, Per2, and Rev-erb beta), clock-controlled gene (Star), Egr-1 and LHr was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Significant changes in clock genes transcription levels were observed in control groups over 24 h, indicating that cell-autonomous rhythms exist in granulosa cells. Intriguingly, the transcript levels of clock genes increased with LH treatment during 24 h of culture; they peaked 4 h in advance of controls and second but weaker oscillations were also observed. It appeared that LH changed the cell-autonomous rhythm and cycle time of clock genes. To further investigate the LH signaling cascades, inhibitors of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways were used. The transcript levels of clock genes were suppressed by blocking cAMP, but increased with similar expression patterns by blocking the p38MPAK and ERK1/2 pathways over 24 h. Thus, the influence of LH signaling cascades in chicken ovulation is mediated by the cAMP pathway and also involves the p38MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways.

The soil fungal diversity in this region has not yet been investigated. In this study, we collected 25 soil samples from these three nature reserves. Soil fungi were isolated using the soil dilution plate technique and Rose Bengal agar medium. The culturable soil fungal density based on analysis of the 25 samples ranged from 2.18 log to 4.38 log CFU g(-1) dry weight soil, with the fungal density being highest in samples from JZNR and lowest in those from BHNR. Based on morphological characters and the results of phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rDNA operon, we identified 38 genera (two genera could not be identified) belonging to Ascomycota, Zygomycota and Basidiomycota. The dominant genera were Penicillium, Humicola, Aspergillus and Trichoderma. The species richness index S, biodiversity index H' and evenness index E of the 25 sampling sites were in the range 10-29, 1.96-3.05 and 0.74-0.95, respectively. The highest mean values of the S, H' and E indices were in soil samples from BHNR, where the values of these indices were 20.00, 2.66 and 0.90, respectively. These results indicate that the diversity of culturable fungi in these three nature reserves was high. Furthermore, a total 14 Trichoderma isolates were tested for their antagonism activity against mycelium growth of three pathogens: Bipolaris maydis, Curvularia lunata, Rhizoctonia solani. The results showed that six Trichoderma isolates had good antagonistic effects on the three pathogenic fungi.

APR catalyzes the two-electron reduction of APS and forms sulfite and adenosine 5'-monophospahate (AMP). The luciferase-based assay measures AMP production using an enzyme-coupled system that generates luminescence. The method is shown to provide an accurate measurement of APR kinetic properties and can be used for both endpoint and continuous assays. APR activity can be measured from pure enzyme preparations as well as from crude protein extracts of tissues. In addition, the assay is ideally suited to high-throughput sample analysis of APR activity in a microtiter dish format. The method adds new capability to the study of the biochemistry and physiology of APR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

At present, there is no convenient and effective method for the rapid detection of T. piszformis larvae. Here, we developed and tested the efficacy of a Dot-ELISA assay for the diagnosis of T. piszformis larval infections in rabbits, based on the expression of the recombinant fusion protein (rTp1) from the Tp1 gene. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to amplify the 3' ends of the Tp1 gene, based on the unigene similar to Ts1 gene (EU009656.1) which comes from transcriptome sequencing of T. pisiformis. The Tp1 gene was successfully amplified, cloned and expressed in BL21 (DE3). Western blot analysis revealed that the recombinant Tp1 protein is specifically recognized by rabbit T. pisiforrnis cysticercosis antisera. This purified recombinant fusion protein, rTp1, was probed by Dot-ELISA with sera from rabbits infected with T. pisiformis larvae and with other parasitic infections. Results showed that this Dot-ELISA assay had both high sensitivity (92.9-97.6%) and specificity (95.2-98.4%) to detect T. pisiformis larval infections. We also found very low levels of cross-reaction with other parasitic infections. This study has revealed that our novel Dot-ELISA assay utilizing the recombinant fusion protein, rTp1, has a strong potential for the effective diagnosis of T. pisiformis infections in rabbits.

Cuniculi; Pathologic histology; Enzyme activities	IN-VITRO; EXTRACTS; LARVAE; EFFICACY; TICK	Octadecanoic acid-3,4-tetrahydrofuran diester, isolated from neem (Azadirachta indica) oil, exhibited potent acaricidal activity against Sarcoptes scabiei var. cuniculi. In this paper, the acaricidal mechanism of octadecanoic acid-3,4-tetrahydrofuran diester against Sarcoptes scabiei var. cuniculi was evaluated based on pathologic histology and enzyme activities. The results showed that after compound treatment for 24 h at a concentration of 20 mg/mL, the lesions of mites were prominent under transmission electron microscopy. The lesions consisted of the lysis of dermis cell membranes and cell nuclear membranes, mitochondrial morphological abnormalities, the drop of spinal disorders, and mitochondrial vacuolization. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs), and Ca2+-ATPase of mites significantly changed after treatment with octadecanoic acid-3,4-tetrahydrofuran diester compared with the control group. The activities of SOD, POD, and Ca2+-ATPase were significantly suppressed, whereas that of GSTs was activated. These results indicated that the mechanism of the acaricidal activity of octadecanoic acid-3,4-tetrahydrofuran diester was mainly achieved through interference with the energy metabolism of mites, thus resulting in insect death.

Generally, viroporins are composed of 50-120 amino acid residues and possess a minimum of one hydrophobic region that interacts with the lipid bilayer and leads to dispersion. Viroporins are involved in destroying the morphology of host cells and disturbing their biological functions to complete the life cycle of the virus. The 2B proteins encoded by enteroviruses, which belong to the family Picornaviridae, can form transmembrane pores by oligomerization, increase the permeability of plasma membranes, disturb the homeostasis of calcium in cells, induce apoptosis, and cause autophagy; these abilities are shared among viroporins. The present paper introduces the structure and biological characteristics of various 2B proteins encoded by enteroviruses of the family Picornaviridae and may provide a novel idea for developing antiviral drugs.

The modified Apelblat equation the General Single model and the Hybrid model were used to fit the experimental solubility data. The thermodynamic functions were obtained from the combination of the modified van't Hoff equation with the modified Apelblat model, including standard enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy change of solution. Results showed that: the mole solubility of florfenicol in binary PEG 400 + water solvent mixture increased with the increasing temperature and the mole fraction of PEG 400; the overall mean percentage deviation (OMPD) obtained from the modified Apelblat equation, the General Single model and the Hybrid model were 3.22, 3.73, 6.52, respectively. Thus, the modified Apelblat equation can give further accuracy and reliability of the solubility of florfenicol in the selected solvent systems than the other two fitted models. The solution process for florfenicol was always endothermic and the driving mechanism was mainly classified as the following three kinds in the temperature range from 293.15 K to 316.25 K: entropy-driving (from 0.0000 to 0.0064 in mole fraction of PEG 400), enthalpy and entropy driving (from 0.0064 to 0.0138 in mole fraction of PEG 400), enthalpy driving (from 0.0138 to 0.0458 in mole fraction of PEG 400).

Studies showed that food-grade Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) and NICE expression system have superior performance in exogenous protein expression. This study aimed to construct and express porcine EGF (pEGF), and use L. lactis as vehicle for producing and delivering pEGF. Furthermore, investigating biological activity of pEGF and exploring applications feasibility of combination effects of L. lactis and pEGF on early weaned piglets' production. Results: A recombinant Lactococcus lactis which produced and secreted pEGF at 1000 ng/ml in culture supernatant was generated. Secreted pEGF was a fully biologically active protein, as demonstrated by its capacity to stimulate L929 mouse fibroblast cell line proliferation in vitro. For in vivo study, forty piglets were randomly allocated to control, antibiotic control, empty vector-expressing L. lactis (LL-EV) and pEGF-secreting L. lactis (LL-pEGF). After 14 d of rearing, final body weight and average daily gain in LL-pEGF were greater (P < 0.05, 8.95 vs. 8.37 kg, 206.1 vs. 157.7 g/day, respectively) than those in control, but no significant differences between LL-pEGF, LL-EV and antibiotic control. Overall period average daily feed intake was higher in LL-pEGF, LL-EV and antibiotic control than in control (P < 0.05, 252.9, 255.6, 250.0, 207.3 g/day, respectively). No significant difference was observed on ADFI/ADG. LL-pEGF increased villous height in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum than in control and LL-EV (P < 0.05). Sucrase in the 3 intestinal segments, aminopeptidase A in the duodenum and Jejunum, aminopeptidase N and dipeptidase IV in the duodenum in LL-pEGF were higher than those in control (P < 0.05). Furthermore, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus counts decreased in the ileum and Lactobacillus increased in the ileum and cecum digesta in LL-pEGF compare with the control (P < 0.05). Lactobacillus increased in the cecum in LL-EV compared with control and antibiotic control (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We have generated a recombinant Lactococcus lactis which produced and secreted fully biologically active porcine EGF. Oral administration of pEGF-secreting L. lactis had beneficial effects on intestinal health and performance of early-weaned piglets.

Crantz) and determined the relationship between heat-induced changes in protein molecular structural characteristics and the MP supply. Seeds from two camelina varieties were sampled in two consecutive years and were either kept raw or were heated in an autoclave (moist heating) or in an air-draft oven (dry heating) at 120 degrees C for 1 h. The MP supply to dairy cattle was modeled by three commonly used protein evaluation systems. The protein molecular structures were analyzed by Fourier transform/infrared-attenuated total reflectance molecular spectroscopy. The results showed that both the dry and moist heating increased the contents of truly absorbable rumen-undegaded protein (ARUP) and total MP and decreased the degraded protein balance (DPB). However, the moist-heated camelina seeds had a significantly higher (P < 0.05) content of ARUP and total MP and a significantly lower (P < 0.05) content of DPB than did the dry-heated camelina seeds. The regression equations showed that intensities of the protein molecular structural bands can be used to estimate the contents of ARUP, MP, and DPB with high accuracy (R-2 > 0.70). These results show that protein molecular structural characteristics can be used to rapidly assess the MP supply to dairy cattle from raw and heat-treated camelina seeds.

The experiment was conducted to determine Salmonella colonization and lymphocytes subpopulation in the ileum and spleen, and the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6], chemokine IL-8, and T helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokines [Interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-12 and IL-18; IL-4 and IL-10 respectively] in the cecal tonsil and spleen of Salmonella challenged hens. Forty Salmonella-free laying hens were challenged orally with Salmonella Typhimurium or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; control). The Salmonella challenged or non-challenged hens (n = 10) were sacrificed at 2 and 7 days post-infection (DPI). The lymphocyte subpopulation was determined via flow cytometric analysis in the ileum and spleen. The cecal tonsil and spleen samples were collected for mRNA expression through quantitative-RT-PCR. The Salmonella counts were higher (P < 0.05) in the ileum than that in the spleen at 2 and 7 DPI, and were higher (P < 0.05) at 7 DPI than that at 2 DPI in the spleen. Salmonella challenge increased (P < 0.05) Heal CD4+ and CD8 alpha+ cells ratios at 2 and 7 DPI, whereas it increased (P < 0.05) splenic CD8 alpha+ cells ratio only at 7 DPI. The magnitude of increase in ileal CD8 alpha+ cells ratio was higher (P < 0.05) than that in CD4+ cells ratio. The mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-18 were significantly up-regulated in the cecal tonsil of Salmonella challenged hens, and the magnitude of increases in IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 were significantly higher at 7 DPI than that at 2 DPI. However, Salmonella challenge increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-10 and IL-18 at 2 and 7 DPI, and IL-8 and IFN-gamma mRNA only at 7 DPI in the spleen. These findings demonstrated that there appeared the induction of cellular immune responses, and a Th1-cytokines reaction in the intestine and spleen of laying hens infected with Salmonella Typhimurium.

The cropland had been converted from adjacent forest areas 4, 50, or 100 years previously. Our specific objectives were 1) to determine the dynamics of OC and N in density fractions and of OC and N derived from forest and cropland and 2) to examine the contributions of these changes to changes in total OC and N. Conversion to cropland led to rapid losses of soil OC and N. The decreases in total soil OC and N in the 0-10 cm depth were mainly due to decreases in light-fraction OC and N. In the 10-20 cm depth, the decreases in total soil OC and N were determined by the loss of OC and N from both the light- and heavy-fractions. The losses in forest-derived OC and N were larger than the gains in crop-derived OC and N. The predicted losses of forest-derived OC and N in both depths were almost 2 times the losses of total soil OC and N. The mean residence times of forest-derived OC and N were shorter than those of total soil OC and N. Our findings indicated that the dynamics of soil OC and N after the conversion of forest to cropland were dominated by the losses of forest-derived and light-fraction OC and N. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial manner with the main effects of immune challenge (control v. porcine rotavirus (PRV) challenge) and dietary concentrations of vitamin D (200 and 5000 IU; where 1 IU of vitamin D is defined as the biological activity of 0.025 mg of cholecalciferol). The pigs were fed a diet containing 200 or 5000 IU vitamin D in the first week of the study period. On day 8, the pigs were orally dosed with 4ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing PRV or essential medium (control). Serum samples were collected on day 8 (pre-challenge), and 6 d after the PRV challenge, the pigs were killed to evaluate intestinal morphology and tissue gene expression following the last blood collection. Pigs challenged with PRV had decreased BW gain (P<0.01), feed intake (P<0.01), villus height (P<0.01), faecal consistency (P<0.05), and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration (P<0.01) and increased (P<0.01) serum IL-2, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-beta concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation mitigated these effects. The mRNA expression of RIG-I (P<0.01), IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (P<0.01), IFN-beta (P<0.01) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG(15)) (P<0.01) was up-regulated by the PRV challenge and vitamin D supplementation in the intestine. In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation could activate the RIG-I signalling pathway and thus alleviate the negative effects caused by PRV challenge.

The reactivity-selectivity descriptor Delta f(r) is proved to be an appropriate tool for predicting the local adsorption site. Our results indicate that the binding of CO to tungsten cluster prefers terminal adsorption mode except for W-3 trimer. The Wiberg bond index can predict the interaction between W atoms and CO molecule to a good accuracy using a linear fit. The dependency on number of adsorbate and charge state of host clusters is also investigated. The high CO coverage seriously weakens the W-CO interaction. The anion cluster reveals the stronger interaction with CO molecule than cation and neutral ones. Moreover, the interesting coverage-dependence is revealed for anion cluster.

Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a variety of factors involved in UV-B-specific signaling have been experimentally characterized over the past decade, including the UV-B light receptor UV resistance locus 8; the positive regulators constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 and elongated hypocotyl 5; and the negative regulators cullin4, repressor of UV-B photomorphogenesis 1 (RUP1), and RUP2. Individual genetic and molecular studies have revealed that these proteins function in either positive or negative regulatory capacities for the sufficient and balanced transduction of photomorphogenic UV-B signal. Less is known, however, regarding how these signaling events are systematically linked. In our study, we use a systems biology approach to investigate the dynamic behaviors and correlations of multiple signaling components involved in Arabidopsis UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis. We define a mathematical representation of photomorphogenic UV-B signaling at a temporal scale. Supplemented with experimental validation, our computational modeling demonstrates the functional interaction that occurs among different protein complexes in early and prolonged response to photomorphogenic UV-B.

To quantitatively clarify how early foliar litter humification responds to reduced snow cover in winter, a field litterbag experiment was conducted in an alpine forest in southwestern China. Mass losses, Delta logK, E4/E6, degrees of humification and humification rates of six typical local foliar litters were investigated at the snow formation, snow cover and snow melt stage under snowpack levels differing in depth (deep snowpack, medium snowpack, thin snowpack, no snowpack) from November 2012 to April 2013. The results indicated that 14-15% of willow (Salix paraplesia), 8-9% of fir (Abies faxoniana), 6-7% of birch (Betula albo-sinensis), 5-8% of cypress (Sabina saltuaria), larch (Larix mastersiana) and azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum) foliar litter was humified, which was about 50% of what decomposed during the first winter. Moreover, the early humification of foliar litter (except for fir and birch) responded positively to the reduced snow cover, but mass loss exhibited negative responses. Such results suggest that reduced snow cover in winter would increase soil carbon or other material sequestration in the scenario of climate change.

To control this disease, breeders have incorporated seedling resistance genes from a variety of sources outside the primary wheat gene pool. The wheat line C51, introduced from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Syria, confers resistance to all races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST) in China. To map the resistant gene(s) against stripe rust in wheat line C51, 212 F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross X440 x C51 were inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR33 (Chinese yellow rust, CYR) in the greenhouse. The result showed that C51 carried a single dominant gene for resistance (designated YrC51) to CYR33. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and resistance gene-analogue polymorphism (RGAP) markers that were polymorphic between the parents were used for genotyping the 212 F-8 RILs. YrC51 was closely linked to two SSR loci on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 5.1 cM (Xgwm429) and 7.2 cM (Xwmc770), and to three RGAP markers C51R1 (XLRR For / NLRR For), C51R2 (CLRR Rev / Cre3LR-F) and C51R3 (Pto kin4/ NLRR-INV2) with genetic distances of 5.6, 1.6 and 9.2 cM, respectively. These RGAP-linked markers were then converted into STS markers. Among them, one STS marker, C51STS-4, was located at a genetic distance of 1.4 cM to YrC51 and was closely associated with resistance when validated in several populations derived from crosses between C51 and Sichuan cultivars. The results indicated that C51STS-4 can be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) and would facilitate the pyramiding of YrC51 with other genes for stripe rust resistance.

The Arabidopsis gene locus RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8) contains two adjacent homologous genes, RPW8.1 and RPW8.2, and confers broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew. Remarkably, the RPW8.2 protein is specifically localized to the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) encasing the feeding structure of powdery mildew whereby RPW8.2 activates haustorium-targeted defenses. Here, we show that ectopic expression of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged RPW8.1 from the native promoter leads to unique cell death lesions and enhances resistance to virulent fungal and oomycete pathogens that cause powdery mildew and downy mildew diseases, respectively. In powdery mildew-infected plants, RPW8.1-YFP accumulates at higher levels in the mesophyll cells underneath the infected epidermal cells where RPW8.2-YFP is mainly expressed. This cell type-preferential protein accumulation pattern largely correlates with that of H2O2 accumulation, suggesting that RPW8.1 may spatially collaborate with RPW8.2 in activation of resistance to powdery mildew. Interestingly, when ectopically expressed from the RPW8.2 promoter, RPW8.1-YFP is also targeted to the EHM of powdery mildew and the transgenic plants display resistance to both powdery mildew and downy mildew. Using YFP as a reporter, we further reveal that the RPW8.1 promoter is constitutively active but induced to higher levels in cells at the infection site, whereas the RPW8.2 promoter is activated specifically in cells at the infection site. Taken together, our results suggest that RPW8.1 (and its promoter) is functionally distinct from RPW8.2 and may have a higher potential in engineering broad-spectrum resistance in plants.

However, the functional analysis of duck Six1 has not been reported. Here, we cloned the coding domain sequence (CDS) region of the duck Six1 gene using RT-PCR and RACE methods. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that duck Six1 CDS region comprised of 849 bp and encoded 282 amino acids and had a high degree of homology with other species, suggesting that the functions of duck Six1 gene are conserved among other animals. Real-time PCR used to determine the mRNA expression profiles of duck Six1 in different tissues and different developmental stages showed that Six1 was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and the embryonic stage. Furthermore, the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-duSix1 was constructed and transfected into the duck myoblasts; the MTT assay revealed an obvious increase of cell proliferation after transfection. The expression profiles of Six1, Myf5 and MyoD showed that their expression levels were significantly increased. These results together suggested that pEGFP-duSix1 vector was constructed successfully and overexpression of duck Six1 in the myoblasts could promote cell proliferation activity and significant up-regulate expression of Myf5 and MyoD.

However, the amount of Pb-210(ex) distributed in the soils below the plough depth, like a downward tail in the lower part of the Pb-210(ex) profile, has been largely ignored. In fact, after the initial cultivation of undisturbed soils, Pb-210(ex) will diffuse downward from plough layer to the plough pan layer due to the concentration gradient. Assuming Pb-210(ex) inventory is constant, the depth distribution in the two layers of the cultivated soils will achieve a steady state after continuous cultivation for 10.37 years, when Pb-210(ex) is evenly distributed in the soils of the plough layer with an exponential concentration decline with depth in the soils of the plough pan layer, and the Pb-210(ex) concentration at any depth will be invariable with time. The work reported in this paper attempts to explain the formation of the Pb-210(ex) tail in the soil profile below the plough depth by theoretical derivation of the Pb-210(ex) depth distribution process in the two layers of the cultivated soils, propose a Pb-210(ex) mass balance model considering Pb-210(ex) diffusion based on the existing model, and discuss the influence of the Pb-210(ex) tail to the existing model.

In this study, we used coconut transcriptome sequences to determine the distribution characteristics of gene-based microsatellite loci in Cocos nucifera L. and to develop a series of polymorphic SSR markers. A total of 6,608 SSRs were identified across 57,304 unigenes from coconut transcripts: approximately one expressed sequence tag-derived SSR locus per 10 unigenes. We developed 309 primer pairs and characterized 191 polymorphic gene-based SSR markers across a set of ten coconut accessions from different countries. A total of 615 alleles were identified from the 191 polymorphic SSR loci, with an average of 3.22 alleles per locus. These gene-based SSR markers displayed moderate levels of polymorphism, with observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.18 to 0.695 (mean = 0.385 +/- 0.14). Subsequently, 80 polymorphic markers were selected to assay genotypes of 82 coconut accessions collected from different regions in Asia. Association analysis found a total of nine markers significantly associated with coconut height (P < 0.05) using general linear models in a selective unstructured population and mixed linear models in a mixed-structure population. Two SSR markers (from Unigene9331 and Unigene3350) were significantly associated with coconut height using both statistical methods.

The polysaccharide was further purified by chromatography on AB-8 and ADS-7 columns, yielding a pure polysaccharide termed SCP-60. The molecular weight (Mw) of SCP-60 was calculated to be 50.0 kDa, based on the calibration curve obtained with a series of Dextran T standards. The results of FT-IR indicated that the polysaccharide contains the alpha-configuration of sugar units. GC-MS analysis revealed that SCP-60 was mainly composed of galactose and glucose. NMR spectroscopy revealed SCP-60 had the backbone consisting of -> 6)-alpha-Manp-(1 ->, alpha-D-Glcp-(1 ->, -> 6)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 -> and -> 6)-alpha-Galp-(1 ->. In order to evaluate the antitumor activity in vivo of the polysaccharide, a sarcoma 180 model was used. The results showed SCP-60 had strong antitumor ability, meanwhile, SCP-60 at a high dose (100 mg/kg) could significantly increase the thymic and splenic indices of S180 mice, and strongly promote the secretion of IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, increase the SOD activities and reduce the concentrations of MDA in blood. Therefore the polysaccharide SCP-60 should be explored as a novel potential antitumor drug.

In this study, the genetic diversity and the relationship of 24 different natural Miscanthus sinensis populations collected from Southwestern China were analyzed by using 33 pairs of Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) primers. A total of 688 bands were detected with 646 polymorphic bands, an average of 19.58 polymorphic bands per primer pair. The average percentage of polymorphic loci (P), gene diversity (H), and Shannon's diversity index (I) among the 24 populations are 70.59%, 0.2589, and 0.3836, respectively. The mean value of total gene diversity (HT) was 0.3373 0.0221, while the allelic diversity within populations (Hs) was 0.2589 0.0136 and the allelic diversity among populations (DsT) was 0.0784. The mean genetic differentiation coefficient (Gst = 0.2326) estimated from the detected 688 loci indicated that there was 76.74% genetic differentiation within the populations, which is consistent with the results from Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) analysis. Based upon population structure and phylogenetic analysis, five groups were formed and a special population with mixed ancestry was inferred indicating that human-mediated dispersal may have had a significant effect on population structure of M sinensis. Evaluating the genetic structure and genetic diversity at morphological and molecular levels of the wild M. sinensis in Southwest China is critical to further utilize the wild M sinensis germplasm in the breeding program. The results in this study will facilitate the biofuel feedstock breeding program and germplasm conservation.

STUDY DESIGN: The streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunohistochemical method was used to identify the distribution of somatostatin (SS), serotonin (5-HT), gastrin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in digestive tracts including proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and rectum. SPSS 19.0 software was used to perform biological statistical analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the SS and 5-HT secreting cells were mainly distributed in the proventriculus (19.2 +/- 6.9 and 16.1 +/- 3.4 cfu/mm(2)) and duodenum (2.9 +/- 2.0 and 1.9 +/- 0.6 cfu/mm(2)). Gastrin and NPY were not detected in each section of the digestive tract. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the quantitative distribution and morphological characteristics of SS and 5-HT secreting cells in the digestive tract between male and female quails. CONCLUSION: The distribution and morphological characteristics of endocrine cells were closely related to the physiological functions of different parts in the digestive tract. The preferential location of endocrine cells provides additional information for future studies on the physiological roles of gastrointestinal peptides in the gastrointestinal tract of the Chinese yellow quail.

The S. prenanti leptin and CCK full-length cDNA sequences were 1121 bp and 776 bp in length, encoding the peptide of 171 and 123 amino acid residues, respectively. Tissue distribution analysis showed that leptin mRNA was mainly expressed in the liver of S. prenanti. CCK was widely expressed, with the highest levels of expression in the hypothalamus, myelencephalon, telencephalon and foregut of S. prenanti. The CCK mRNA expression was highly elevated after feeding, whereas the leptin mRNA expression was not affected by single meal. These results suggested that CCK is a postprandial satiety signal in S. prenanti, but leptin might not be. In present study, leptin and CCK gene expression were both decreased after fasting and increased after refeeding, which suggested leptin and CCK might be involved in regulation of appetite in S. prenanti. This study provides an essential groundwork to further elucidate the appetite regulatory systems of leptin and CCK in S. prenanti as well as in other teleosts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Despite its importance, little is known about the genetic and molecular basis of heterosis. Early maize ear inflorescences formation affects grain yield, and are thus an excellent model for molecular mechanisms involved in heterosis. To determine the parental contributions and their regulation during maize ear-development-genesis, we analyzed genome-wide digital gene expression profiles in two maize elite inbred lines (B73 and Mo17) and their F-1 hybrid using deep sequencing technology. Our analysis revealed 17,128 genes expressed in these three genotypes and 22,789 genes expressed collectively in the present study. Approximately 38% of the genes were differentially expressed in early maize ear inflorescences from heterotic cross, including many transcription factor genes and some presence/absence variations (PAVs) genes, and exhibited multiple modes of gene action. These different genes showing differential expression patterns were mainly enriched in five cellular component categories (organelle, cell, cell part, organelle part and macromolecular complex), five molecular function categories (structural molecule activity, binding, transporter activity, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity and catalytic activity), and eight biological process categories (cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, regulation of biological process, establishment of localization, cellular component organization or biogenesis, response to stimulus and localization). Additionally, a significant number of genes were expressed in only one inbred line or absent in both inbred lines. Comparison of the differences of modes of gene action between previous studies and the present study revealed only a small number of different genes had the same modes of gene action in both maize seedlings and ear inflorescences. This might be an indication that in different tissues or developmental stages, different global expression patterns prevail, which might nevertheless be related to heterosis. Our results support the hypotheses that multiple molecular mechanisms (dominance and overdominance modes) contribute to heterosis.

Three samples tested positive (prevalence = 1.03%). The positive isolates were genotyped by sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA, HSP70, COWP, and Cp135 genes and characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. Phylogenetic analysis was established using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. All the isolates were identified as Cryptosporidium cuniculus. Further subtyping of the positive isolates was performed by DNA sequencing of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. Only 1 subtype family was detected, Va, which was proposed to be a new subtype, VaA31. This study is the first report about the prevalence, genetic identification, and Cp135 gene of C. cuniculus in rabbits in Sichuan Province, China. The obtained results indicate that the C. cuniculus subtype in rabbits in Sichuan Province is unique.

Cryopreservation causes a dramatic decrease in the viability, motility and fertility of spermatozoa, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, mRNA expression and protein levels of epigenetic-related genes (Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b,Jhdm2a, Kat8, Prm1, Prm2 and IGF2) in fresh and cryopreserved boar spermatozoa were evaluated using qRT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed that cryopreservation or freezing, which drastically alter the environmental stimuli, can induce epigenetic changes of boar spermatozoa. Dramatic changes of mRNA expression of epigenetic-related genes were observed before and after cryopreservation, and low protein levels of multiple genes were mainly found in program freezing groups with or without LEY. The addition of different cryoprotective agents to the freezing extender can provide better protective effects for boar spermatozoa to avoid freezing or cryopreservation-induced expression changes of epigenetic-related genes.

Two hundred and forty one-day-old avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed on a control diet and three experimental diets supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg NiCl2 for 42 days. Compared with the control group, the IgA(+) B cell number and the sIgA, IgA, IgG, and IgM contents in the NiCl2-treated groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). It was concluded that dietary NiCl2 in the excess of 300 mg/kg had negative effects on the IgA+ B cell number and the abovementioned immunoglobulin contents in the small intestine and the cecal tonsil.

A total of 900 COBB500 male broilers were randomly allocated into five groups with six replicates per group and 30 birds per replicate. The experiment lasted for 6 weeks and the five dietary treatments consisted of control, 25% contaminated corn, 50% contaminated corn, 75% contaminated corn and 100% contaminated corn groups. The histopathological spleen lesions from the contaminated corn groups was characterized as congestion of red pulp, increased necrotic cells and vacuoles in the splenic corpuscle and periarterial lymphatic sheath. The contaminated corn intake significantly increased relative weight of spleen, percentages of apoptotic splenocytes, induced cell cycle arrest of splenocytes, increased the percentages of CD3+ CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratios of CD3+ CD4+ to CD3+ CD8+. The results suggest that AFB-induced immunosuppression maybe closely related to the lesions of spleen.

Novel gammaherpesvirus functions encoded by bovine herpesvirus 6 (bovine lymphotropic virus)	JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY			English	Article							MALIGNANT CATARRHAL FEVER; ORNITHINE-DECARBOXYLASE; INTRACELLULAR DEGRADATION; GENOME; SEQUENCE; CATTLE; GENE; DNA; TRANSFORMATION; INFECTIONS	The genus Macavirus of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae includes viruses that infect lymphoid cells of domestic and wild ruminants and swine, causing asymptomatic latent infections in reservoir hosts. Here, we describe the genome of bovine herpesvirus 6 (BoHV-6), a macavirus ubiquitous in healthy cattle populations. The BoHV-6 genome exhibited architecture conserved in macaviruses, including a repetitive H-DNA region and unique 141 kbp L-DNA region predicted to encode 77 genes. BoHV-6 encoded, in variable genomic regions, a novel complement of genes relative to other characterized macaviruses, probably contributing to distinctive aspects of BoHV-6 infection biology and host range. Most notably, BoHV-6 encoded the first herpesviral protein (Bov2.b2) similar to cellular ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyses the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Bov2.b2 conceivably mediates a novel mechanism by which BoHV-6 promotes cell-cycle-dependent viral replication.

However, to obtain the phenotypes of interest in swine breeding program requires relatively a long time until the completion of performance testing, which produces an extra breeding cost for the culled pigs in swine industry. An alternative solution is to pre-select a predefined proportion of young replacement piglets for future performance testing through genomic selection, which could reduce the number of testing animals entering into performance testing program and hence reduce the breeding costs associated with the tests. In this study, four strategies of genomic selection applications in swine breeding program were compared through simulation to investigate the potential benefits in the different strategies in swine breeding program. For comparison purpose, the conventional BLUP selection was simulated as strategy 1 to form the benchmark basis for comparisons. Strategy 2 was an extreme case for applying genomic selection, where newborn piglets were selected directly based on their genomic enhanced breeding value (GEBV) only without further performance testing. Strategy 3 was to pre-select piglets, based on their GEBV, for entry to performance testing in early stage, and then the breeding stock were selected ultimately based on their EBVs predicted by BLUP method when the phenotypic records were available. Similar to strategy 3, strategies 4 and 5 also used the GEBVs to pre-select replacement piglets in an early stage; however, the breeding stocks in strategies 4 and 5 were selected based on the breeding values obtained using the bi-variable model and the conventional index method to combine GEBV and EBV information, respectively, when individuals had both GEBV and phenotypes available after the performance testing. Comparing these strategies, strategy 4 resulted in the highest accuracy in first three generations and achieved the best cumulative selection response in the last generation, followed by strategies 1, 3, 5, and 2. The proportion of pre-selection of boars and sows in the early stage affected the efficiency of genomic selection substantially. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Epiphytic colonization of Ustilaginoidea virens on biotic and abiotic surfaces implies the widespread presence of primary inoculum for rice false smut disease	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Arabidopsis; epiphytism; green fluorescent protein; rice false smut; Ustilaginoidea virens; weeds	KERNEL SMUT; PLANTS	Ustilaginoidea virens (Uv), the causative agent of rice false smut disease, infects developing rice spikelets at the booting stage, and transforms individual grains of the panicle into smut balls. Epidemics of the disease occur when the rice booting and heading stages coincide with rainy days. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled Uv isolate that can form false smut balls on rice panicles, it was found that under high humidity and free water conditions the Uv isolate could colonize leaves of plants belonging to various families including the Poaceae (Oryza sativa, Echinochloa crusgalli, Digitaria sanguinalis and Leptochloa chinensis), the Brassicaceae (Arabidopsis thaliana) and the Solanaceae (Nicotiana benthamiana) without symptoms. Over several days, some conidia could germinate on the leaves of these plants and in water on the surface of Parafilm and cellophane, form hyphae and differentiate conidiophores to generate a large number of secondary conidia, while other conidia were able to directly produce secondary conidia. Conversely, in the absence of water some conidia could either bud to form new conidia or were converted into chlamydospores. These data indicate that Uv is one of a few fungal pathogens reported to have epiphytic characteristics. The rapid generation of a large number of spores on biotic and abiotic surfaces greatly increases the inoculum that can infect rice spikelets, resulting in the occurrence of rice false smut disease epidemics. These findings are important in the development of disease control strategies.

The NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme in oleaginous fungi plays a key role in fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, the malic enzyme-encoding complementary DNA (cDNA) (malE1) from the oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein (MaME) was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme used NADP(+) as the cofactor. The K (m) values for l-malate and NADP(+) were 2.19 +/- 0.01 and 0.38 +/- 0.02 mM, respectively, while the V (max) values were 147 +/- 2 and 302 +/- 14 U/mg, respectively, at the optimal condition of pH 7.5 and 33 A degrees C. MaME is active in the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and low concentrations of Zn2+ rather than Ca2+, Cu2+, or high concentrations of Zn2+. Oxaloacetic acid and glyoxylate inhibited the MaME activity by competing with malate, and their K (i) values were 0.08 and 0.6 mM, respectively.

A total of 376 clear and reproducible DNA fragments were amplified by 29 ISSR primers, among which 368 (97.87%) fragments were found to be polymorphic. 8-18 polymorphic bands were amplified by each polymorphic primer, with an average of 12.69 bands. The data of 376 ISSR bands were used to generate Nei's similarity coefficients and to construct a dendrogram by means of UPGMA. The similarity coefficients data suggested great genetic diversity in genus Leymus and related diploid Triticeae species, the genetic diversity among the different species more abundant than that of the different accessions. The dendrogram and principal coordinate analysis showed explicit interspecific relationships and demonstrated close phylogenetic relationships between Leymus species and Psathyrostachys.

The deduced amino acid sequences contained a 28 amino acids signal peptide followed by a 36 amino acids mature neuropeptide Y (NPY). The npy mRNA was expressed mainly in the brain and eye as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR (rt-qPCR). The S. prenanti NPY was detectable from blastulation to hatch, suggesting that npy might be involved in the late embryonic development of S. prenanti. An experiment was conducted to determine the expression profile of npy during feeding of a single meal and during long-term fasting. The expression level of npy in fed fish was significantly decreased at 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 9 h post-feeding (hpf) than in fasting fish. Fasting for 14 days induced an increase in npy messenger (m) RNA expression in the brain. Overall, the results suggest that NPY is a conserved peptide that might be involved in the regulation of feeding and other physiological function in S. prenanti.

First, the full-length S. prenanti cgnrhII cDNA consisted of 693 bp with an open reading frame of 261 bp encoding a protein of 86 amino acids. Next, cgnrhII was widely expressed in the central and peripheral tissues. Last, there were significant changes in cgnrhII mRNA expression in the fasted group compared to the fed group in the S. prenanti hypothalamus during 24 h fasting (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the cgnrhII gene expression presented a significant decrease in the fasted group compared with the fed group (P < 0.05)on days 3, 5 and 7, after re-feeding, there was no significant changes in cgnrhII mRNA expression level between refed and fed group on day 9 (P > 0.05). Thus, the results suggest that cGnRH II expression is influenced by fasting and the gene may be involved in feeding regulation in S. prenanti.

It is of great importance to analyze the haplotype variation of Rht-D1, the Green Revolution gene, during wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) domestication and breeding to understand its evolution and function in wheat breeding history. In this study, the Rht-D1 and its flanking regions were sequenced and single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected based on a panel of 45 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, 51 accessions of landraces and 80 accessions of commercial varieties. Genetic diversity in the wild accessions was much higher than that in the varieties and higher than that reported previously. Seven haplotypes (Hapl I to Hapl VII) of Rht-D1 were identified and their evolutionary relationships were proposed. In addition to the well-known Green Revolution allele Rht-D1b, Hapl VII (an allele Rht-D1k) was identified in early breeding varieties, which reduced plant height by 16%. The results suggested that Rht-D1k had been used in breeding before the Green Revolution and made a great contribution to wheat production worldwide. Based on the breeding history and molecular evidence, we proposed that the wheat Green Revolution in China and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) occurred independently.

In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of M. altaica was sequenced and characterized. The genome is 16,521 bases in length (GenBank accession no. KC815122). The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of M. altaica and other 20 Mustelidae species were used for phylogenetic analyses. Trees constructed by using Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood demonstrated that M. altaica was close to Mustela nivalis and they were sister to Mustela putorius and Mustela sibirica.

Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for accurate measurement of CRBP1 and CRBP3 mRNA levels in different tissues from chickens at four ages (12, 20, 32 and 45 weeks). We found that the CRBP1 and CRBP3 were expressed in all six tissues examined in all three breeds of chicken at 32 weeks. CRBP1 mRNA levels in SD02 kidneys were slightly higher than those in SD03 and R at 12 weeks, whereas, at the other three time points, the expression levels of CRBP1 in SD03 were higher than those in SD02 and R. In addition, there was higher hepatic expression of CRBP3 mRNA in layers (R) compared to broilers (SD02 and SD03) at 20 and 32 weeks. An age-related expression pattern of CRBP1 gene was evident in liver (P < 0.01), but not in pituitary (P > 0.05). Overall, the expression level of CRBP1 gene in kidney, ovary and oviduct at the different ages had a "decline-rise-decline" trend in all three breeds. In contrast, in pituitary, hypothalamus, liver and kidney CRBP3 mRNA expression levels were significantly different at various ages (P < 0.05) and exhibited a "rise-decline-rise" pattern in all three breeds. Our results show that the expression of CRBP1 and CRBP3 in chicken tissues exhibit specific developmental changes and age-related patterns.

Exposure to Pb did not cause a significant decrease in biomass in either P. beijingensis or P. cathayana. Correspondingly, no obvious impairment in cellular organelles was observed in either species, although the former species translocated a higher fraction of Pb to its shoots than the latter. In contrast, there were significant decreases in biomass and pigment content, and serious impairments in ultrastructure in both species when exposed to either Zn alone or to a combined treatment. Under such conditions, P. beijingensis showed smaller losses of biomass and pigments but a greater ability to quench O-2(-) and maintained relatively intact cellular organelles compared with P. cathayana. Under the combined stress, there were no obvious additive effects on biomass, pigments or cellular impairment, whereas synergistic effects on metal absorption and accumulation in both species were observed when compared with exposure to either alone. Thus, the attribute of synergistic uptake and translocation in both species validates their potential to remediate soil contaminated by multiple metals. Moreover, our results indicated that P. beijingensis is a better potential candidate for phytoremediation than P. cathayana, due to its greater phytoremediation efficiency as well as its higher tolerance capacity.

Effects of dietary gossypol concentration on growth performance, blood profiles, and hepatic histopathology in meat ducks	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						duck; gossypol; growth performance; hepatic histopathology; serum biochemical profile	LACTATING DAIRY-COWS; COTTONSEED-MEAL; WHOLE COTTONSEED; BROILER-CHICKENS; PROTEIN; ENANTIOMERS; PATHOLOGY; LEVEL; SWINE	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of gossypol from cottonseed meal (CSM) on growth performance, blood biochemical profiles, and liver histopathology of ducks. A total of 900 1-d-old ducks were randomly allocated to 5 treatments with 12 pens/treatment and 15 ducks/pen. The 5 experimental diets were formulated in such a way that 0% (a corn-soybean meal basal diet, diet 1), 25% (diet 2), 50% (diet 3), 75% (diet 4), and 100% (diet 5) of protein from soybean meal were replaced with that from CSM. All diets were formulated on a digestible amino acid basis. The experiment included 2 phases, the starter phase (1 to 3 wk) where the test diets contained graded levels of CSM and the growth phase (4 to 5 wk) where birds were fed a corn-soybean basal diet to examine the recovery of ducks after CSM withdrawal. Dietary CSM and gossypol linearly (P < 0.01) and quadratically (P < 0.01) decreased ADG and ADFI during d 1 to 14. The threshold of daily total gossypol (TG) and free gossypol (FG) intake based on ADG on d 1 to 7 and d 7 to 14 were 32.20 and 2.64 mg/d, and 92.12 and 9.62 mg/d, respectively. Serum alanine aminotransferase increased (P < 0.05) linearly with increasing level of gossypol in the diets (d 7), whereas aspartate aminotransferase increased (P < 0.05) linearly and quadratically (d 14). Serum albumin concentration decreased (P < 0.05) quadratically with increasing dietary CSM concentrations on d 21. The degree of damage to the liver increased markedly with increasing dietary CSM and gossypol content and the length of CSM and gossypol intake. On d 35, there was no difference on BW and blood profiles of ducks among all treatments. These results suggest that meat ducks' dietary TG and FG concentration should be lower than 928.9 and 77.2 mg/kg, respectively, during d 1 to 21 of age and that a 2-wk withdrawal of diets containing gossypol should be considered.

The feeds investigated were barley, corn, oat, wheat, lentil, peas, canola meal, expeller meal (extruded canola meal), soybean meal, mill feeds (pelleted byproducts from cereal grains), lantic sugar beet pulp, blood meal and meat meal. The protein molecular structures were quantified from spectral data on unique bands such as amid I and amide II, and protein secondary structures such as alpha-helix and beta-sheet and their ratios using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared molecular spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The feeds were analyzed for protein solubility, in situ ruminal degradation and intestinal digestibility. The water-based (10.5-70.3 g/100 g crude protein (CP)) and buffer-based (4.4-76.3 g/100 g CP) protein solubility had a large variation among the feeds. The effective ruminal degradability (13.8-77.0 g/100 g CP), intestinal digestibility of rumen undegraded protein (RUP; 57.0-89.1 g/100 g RUP) and total protein digestibility (76.1-96.4g/100g CP) had a large variation among the feeds. Significant differences were observed in protein amide I and amide II area, model-fitted alpha-helix and beta-sheet height and in the ratio of amide I to II area. The protein molecular structural characteristics were strongly correlated with protein solubility, ruminal degradation and intestinal digestibility. Amide II area had the highest correlation with the contents of CP (r=0.713), water-soluble CP (r=0.730), buffer-soluble CP (r=0.436) and intestinal digestible CP (r=0.735). Whereas the area ratio of amide I:II showed strong correlation (r=0.707) with the content of rumen degradable CP. The protein amide II area and beta-sheet height could be used to predict the contents of intestinal digestible RUP (R-2 = 0.826) and total digestible CP (R-2 = 0.808) of prairie feeds in dairy cattle. This study report a novel data on feed protein molecular structures and showed that protein structural makeup was associated with protein nutritional value and digestive behaviour in dairy cattle.

To investigate the effect of Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 on NAFLD, 120 male ICR mice were randomly divided into four groups and administrated with BS15 (2 x 10(7) cfu/0.2 mL or 2 x 10(8) cfu/0.2 mL) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) throughout a 17-week experimental period. The mice were fed with normal chow diet (NCD) 5 weeks before the experimental period. Afterward, with the exception of the PBS group, NCD was changed into high-fat diet (HFD) for the remaining experimental period. Results showed that BS15-treated HFD mice were protected from hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte apoptosis. BS15 exhibited a positive effect on liver lipid peroxidation through an anti-oxidative stress activity by enhancing the liver antioxidant defense system. In addition, BS15 inhibited the insulin resistance; decreased the mRNA levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; and increased the expression of the fasting-induced adipose factor in livers. Meanwhile, BS15 attenuated mitochondria abnormalities when the content of uncoupling protein-2 decreased and cytochrome c increased in NAFLD mice. BS15 also reduced the level of serum lipopolysaccharide in NAFLD mice by lowering the intestinal permeability and adjusting gut flora, followed by the downregulation of the TNF alpha mRNA level in liver and the serum level of C-reactive protein.

We reanalyzed a consensus fragment of 481 bp in the D-loop region from 339 individuals. The network and neighbor-joining tree revealed three divergent maternal haplogroups (A, B-1, and B-2) in 17 local breeds. Although high polymorphism resulting in 198 different haplotypes was observed (h = 0.984 +/- A 0.002; pi = 0.0336 +/- A 0.0008), neither the distribution of haplotypes nor PCA analysis revealed any obvious geographic structure in the local breeds. Extensive gene flow was widely detected among breeds from southwest China. High levels of gene exchange were detected between Qianbei Brown goats and the other breeds, indicating either more contribution or introgression to their gene pools. This study will be helpful in understanding the phylogeography and gene flow among the goat breeds of southwest China.

The DNA fragments with methylated information were cloned by reamplified PCR and sequenced. The results of Blast alignments showed that the genes with methylation information included chitinase, nitrate reductase, chloroplast DNA, mitochondrial DNA, ornithine decarboxylase, ribulose carboxylase, and promoter sequences. Homologous comparison in three cloned gene sequences (nitrate reductase, ornithine decarboxylase, and ribulose decarboxylase) indicated that geographic factors had significant influence on the whole genome methylation. Introns also contained different information in different tobacco cultivars. These findings suggest that synthetic mechanisms for tobacco aromatic components could be affected by different environmental factors leading to variation of noncoding regions in the genome, which finally results in different fragrance and taste in different tobacco cultivars.

First, the reactions of anthranilic acid derivatives with potassium cyanate afforded the corresponding urea derivatives. Then, cyclization of the urea derivatives with NaOH afforded the monosodium salts of benzoylene urea. Finally, HCl treatment afforded the desired products in near-quantitative yields. This is an eco-efficient method because all the reactions were carried out in water, and the desired products were obtained simply by filtration. The aqueous filtrate was the only waste generated from the reaction. We scaled up the reaction to 1 kg starting material, thus establishing an alternative approach for the green synthesis of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

From 86 pairs of expressed sequence tag SSRs (EST-SSR) and 45 start-codon targeted polymorphism (SCoT) primers, eight pairs of EST-SSR primers and seven SCoT primers were chosen to construct the DNA fingerprinting of six Hemarthria cultivars in this study. Using genomic DNA from six cultivars, a total of eight pairs of EST-SSR primers were able to amplify 193 bands, producing an average of 24.1 bands per primer pair. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 83.4 %, and the polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.480 to 0.695, with an average of 0.602. A total of seven SCoT primers amplified 105 bands with an average of 15 bands per sample. The PPB was 84.8 %, and the PIC ranged from 0.471 to 0.758, with an average of 0.612. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean dendrogram from EST-SSR and SCoT markers grouped the six Hemarthria cultivars into two major groups of the same. These clusters are in accordance with their known species and origin. Our results indicate a rich genetic diversity in these six Hemarthria cultivars. The six cultivars we assayed could be easily identified using these eight pairs of EST-SSR and seven pairs of SCoT primers.

THELL.; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SPELT WHEAT; EMMER WHEAT; AESTIVUM L.; SPANISH ACCESSIONS; ALLELIC VARIATION; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; A-GENOME; BREAD	Variation of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) in 632 wild and cultivated Triticum accessions was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A total of 11 alleles of HMW-GS in diploid species, 22 in tetraploid species, and 15 in hexaploid species were detected. Diploid species on Glu-1A locus and tetraploid species Glu-1B locus showed the highest diversity, respectively. Tetraploid species had the highest level of diversity on three Glu-1 loci, followed by hexaploid and diploid, based on Shannon's information index, Nei's genetic diversity, and percentage of polymorphic loci. Molecular variance analysis confirmed main variance of HMW-GS within species, regions, and locations, respectively. Variance among species and regions was enhanced gradually with the increase of ploidy. Significant non-random distributions between the phylogenic trees of HMW-GS and the locations of accessions were tested by GenGIS software, indicated that geographic factors played an important role along the different orientations in the spread of Triticum species. We found one original diversified center in diploid what located around Elazig, Malatya, Gaziantep, Urfa, and Kiziltepe in Turkey, and three diversified centers in tetraploid wheat, including Turkey-Armenia-Georgia-Iran, Portugal-Spain, and Ethiopia, respectively, and two diversified adjacent areas between Turkey and Switzerland and around Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia. The original center of diploid species located in southeast Turkey, where the unexpressed 1Ay subunit was mainly distributed in T. urartu, could be one of the candidate regions of polyploidization of Triticum L. The regional distribution of HMW-GS and species also provided geographic evidences for the existence of founder effect on the spread of Triticum species. The present study suggests that integrating genetic diversity with geographic characterization in Triticum could very useful for collection, conservation, and utilization, as well as for research microevolution and domestication.

Based on the pi-pi stacking between phenylphosphonic acid and CNTs, abundant phosphonate groups were uniformly introduced on CNTs' surface, which significantly not only improve the solubility and dispersibility of CNTs in polar solvents but also enhance the dispersion of PtRu nanoparticles on CNTs' surface. The obtained PtRu/PPA-CNT electrocatalysts are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. The results reveal that CNTs were successfully functionalized by PPA, and PtRu nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on PPA-CNT surface with average particle diameter of 2.5 nm. Electrochemical studies certified that PtRu/PPA-CNT electrocatalysts have much higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation in comparison with PtRu nanoparticles supported on the pristine CNTs because of their highly electrochemical surface area at 612.7 cm(2) mg(-1).

Repetitive sequences pAs1, pSc119.2, pTa-535, pTa71, CCS1, and pAWRC.1 are usually used as probes in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of wheat, rye, and hybrids derived from wheat x rye. Usually, some of these repetitive sequences for FISH analysis were needed to be amplified from a bacterial plasmid, extracted from bacterial cells, and labeled by nick translation. Therefore, the conventional procedure of probe preparation using these repetitive sequences is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, some appropriate oligonucleotide probes have been developed which can replace the roles of repetitive sequences pAs1, pSc119.2, pTa-535, pTa71, CCS1, and pAWRC.1 in FISH analysis of wheat, rye, and hybrids derived from wheat x rye. These oligonucleotides can be synthesized easily and cheaply. Therefore, FISH analysis of wheat and hybrids derived from wheat x rye using these oligonucleotide probes becomes easier and more economical.

Firstly, germinal vesicle (CV) and in vitro matured oocytes (metaphase II, MID were vitrified by open-pulled straw method. Secondly, thawed GV oocytes were matured in vitro to detect the aneuploidy rate and the sister inter-kinetochore (iKT) distance (in situ spreading and immunofluorescent staining). The results revealed that the sister iKT distance and the aneuploidy rate in eggs matured from vitrified-thawed GV oocytes were higher than that from in vivo matured, in vitro matured, and in vitro matured frozen oocytes (0.47 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.01 mu m; P < 0.01 and 22.9% vs. 6.5% vs. 5.8% vs. 11.8%; P < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sister chromosome pairs whose sister iKT distances were higher than 0.9 mu m in eggs matured from vitrified-thawed GV oocytes (8.7%) was higher than that from in vivo matured (1.6%), in vitro matured (1.6%), and in vitro matured frozen oocytes (2.3%) (P < 0.05). The sister iKT distance was associated with centromere cohesion. To investigate whether vitrification of GV oocytes deteriorated centromere cohesion by affecting cohesin complex formation, thawed and fresh CV oocytes were used to detect the cohesin subunits (SMC1 beta, STAG3, SMC3, and REC8) mRNA expression (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). The relative expression of three cohesin subunits (SMC1 beta, STAG3, and SMC3) was significantly decreased in CV oocytes after vitrification. In conclusion, vitrification of CV oocytes may result in the subsequent deterioration of centromere cohesion and an increase in the aneuploidy rate. MII oocytes may be the ideal candidate to avoid aneuploidy for fertility cryopreservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that the biodegradability of food waste and corn stover was calculated to be 81.5% and 55.1%, respectively, which was main reason causing the asynchronism in the co-digestion. The asynchronism was minimized by NaOH-pretreatment for corn stover, which could improve the biodegradability by 36.6%. The co-digestion with pretreatment could increase the biomethane yield by 12.2%, 3.2% and 0.6% comparing with the co-digestion without pretreatment at C/N ratios of 20, 25 and 30 at OL of 35 g-VS/L, respectively. The results indicated that the digestibility synchronism of food waste and corn stover was improved through enhancing the accessibility and digestibility of corn stover. The biomethane production could be increased by minimizing the asynchronism of two substrates in co-digestion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, the responses of pretreatment to particle sizes were also evaluated. When the PHP-pretreatment was employed (final H2O2 and H3PO4 concentration of 1.77% and 80.0%), 71-96% lignin and more than 95% hemicellulose in various feedstocks (agricultural residues, hardwood, softwood, bamboo, and their mixture, and garden wastes mixture) can be removed. Consequently, more than 90% glucose conversion was uniformly achieved indicating PHP greatly improved the pretreatment flexibility to different feedstocks. Moreover, when wheat straw and oak chips were PHP-pretreated with different sizes, the average glucose conversion reached 94.9% and 100% with lower coefficient of variation (7.9% and 0.0%), which implied PHP-pretreatment can significantly weaken the negative effects of feedstock sizes on subsequent conversion.

Based on the role of vitamin A in chicken laying performance, we investigated the polymorphism of CRBP1 and CRBP3 genes in 349 chickens using single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. Only one polymorphism was identified in the third intron of CRBP1, two polymorphisms were detected in CRBP3; they were located in the second intron and the third intron respectively. The association studies between these three SNPs and laying performance traits were performed in Erlang mountainous chicken. Notably, the SNP g.14604G>T of CRBP1 was shown to be significantly associated with body weight at first egg (BWFE), age at first egg (AFE), weight at first egg (WFE) and total number of eggs with 300 age (EN). The CRBP3 polymorphism g.934C>G was associated with AFE, and the g.1324A>G was associated with APE and BWFE, but none of these polymorphisms were associated with egg quality traits. Haplotype combinations constructed on these two SNPs of CRBP3 gene were associated with BWFE and AFE. In particular, diplotype H2H2 had positive effect on AFE, BWFE, EN, and average egg-laying interval. We herein describe for the first time basic research on the polymorphism of chicken CRBP1 and CRBP3 genes that is predictive of genetic potential for laying performance in chicken.

The results demonstrated that different polyploids have experienced varying fates, including maintenance or homogenization of divergent arrays, occurrence of chimeric repeats and potential pseudogenes. Our data suggested that (I) the Ns, P/F, and St genomic types in Leymus were originated from Psathyrostachys, AgropyroMEremopyrum, and Pseudoroegneria, respectively; (2) the occurrence of a higher proportion of Leymus species with predominant uniparental rDNA type might associate with the segmental allopolyploid origin, nucleolar dominance of alloploids, and rapid radiation of Leymus; (3) maintenance of multiple parental ITS types in allopolyploid might result from long generation times associated to vegetative multiplication, number and chromosomal location of ribosomal loci and/or recurrent hybridization; (4) the rDNA genealogical structure of Leymus species might associate with the geographic origins; and (5) ITS sequence clade shared by Leymus species from Central Asia, North America, and Nordic might be an outcome of ancestral ITS homogenization. Our results shed new light on understanding evolutionary outcomes of rDNA following allopolyploid speciation and geographic isolation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we screened genetic polymorphisms of the MAVS gene in various Chinese domestic chicken breeds/populations and evaluated its potential effect on gene expression. Among the sequenced fragment (4678 bp), a total of 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in 46 chickens from 10 breeds/populations, including 30 coding SNPs and 45 non-coding SNPs. Extremely high haplotype diversity (37 nucleotide haplotypes, 18 amino add haplotypes) was observed in the coding region (CDS), and a similar pattern of high polymorphisms was also observed for the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Luciferase assays of two representative 3'-UTR haplotypes were performed in both HEK293 cells and DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells, and we found that they were differentially associated with different abilities on regulating mRNA expression level (P < 0.05). Collectively, we observed a considerably high genetic variability of the MAVS gene, and the 3'-UTR variants had an ability to regulate mRNA expression. These results would cast some clues on understanding the potential role of MAVS on viral resistance in chicken. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Antizymes play pivotal roles in various cellular pathways, induding polyamine anabolism and apoptosis. The molecular structure and expression profile of the OAZ2 in goose ovarian follicles have not been reported. In this study, the OAZ2 cDNA sequence of the Sichuan white goose was cloned (Anser cygnoides), and phylogenetic and structural analyses of the OAZ2 were performed. The expression profiling of OAZ2 mRNA in goose ovarian follicles was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The sequence analysis showed that the 756 bp OAZ2 sequence contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 was 99 bp in length, and encoded a 32 aa polypeptide. ORF2 was 477 bp in length, and encoded a 158 aa polypeptide. The frameshift site that initiates the translation of ORF2 was located at nucleotide position 97 in the OAZ2. The analysis of OAZ2 mRNA expression in hierarchical follicles showed that the level of OAZ2 mRNA was higher in the SWF and F2 follicular stages than that in the ovarian stroma (P < 0.05). The lowest level of OAZ2 expression was detected in the ovarian stroma. These results suggest that the highly conserved frameshift region plays an important role in sustaining the function of OAZs. Furthermore, the significantly higher level of OAZ2 mRNA in the SWF stage indicates that OAZ2 may be involved in recruiting hierarchical follicles. Our results also suggest that OAZ2 may augment the effects of OAZ1 in follicle development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mitochondrial (mt) DNA is well known to provide genetic markers for investigations in these areas, but complete mt genomic data have been lacking for many Acari species. Herein, we present the complete mt genome of the scab mite Psoroptes cuniculi. Methods: P. cuniculi was collected from a naturally infected New Zealand white rabbit from China and identified by morphological criteria. The complete mt genome of P. cuniculi was amplified by PCR and then sequenced. The relationships of this scab mite with selected members of the Acari were assessed by phylogenetic analysis of concatenated amino acid sequence datasets by Bayesian inference (BI), maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP). Results: This mt genome (14,247 bp) is circular and consists of 37 genes, including 13 genes for proteins, 22 genes for tRNA, 2 genes for rRNA. The gene arrangement in mt genome of P. cuniculi is the same as those of Dermatophagoides farinae (Pyroglyphidae) and Aleuroglyphus ovatus (Acaridae), but distinct from those of Steganacarus magnus (Steganacaridae) and Panonychus citri (Tetranychidae). Phylogenetic analyses using concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes, with three different computational algorithms (BI, ML and MP), showed the division of subclass Acari into two superorders, supported the monophylies of the both superorders Parasitiformes and Acariformes; and the three orders Ixodida and Mesostigmata and Astigmata, but rejected the monophyly of the order Prostigmata. Conclusions: The mt genome of P. cuniculi represents the first mt genome of any member of the family Psoroptidae. Analysis of mt genome sequences in the present study has provided new insights into the phylogenetic relationships among several major lineages of Acari species.

Nitrogen deposition generally affects ecosystem processes through the changes in soil biochemical properties such as soil nutrient availability, microbial properties and enzyme activities. In order to evaluate the soil biochemical responses to elevated atmospheric N deposition in bamboo forest ecosystems, a two-year field N addition experiment in a hybrid bamboo (Bambusa pervariabilis x Dendrocalamopsis daii) plantation was conducted. Four levels of N treatment were applied: (1) control (CK, without N added), (2) low-nitrogen (LN, 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), (3) medium-nitrogen (MN, 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and (4) high-nitrogen (HN, 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Results indicated that N addition significantly increased the concentrations of NH4+, NO3+, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass N, the rates of nitrification and denitrification; significantly decreased soil pH and the concentration of available phosphorus, and had no effect on the total organic carbon and total N concentration in the 0-20 cm soil depth. Nitrogen addition significantly stimulated activities of hydrolytic enzyme that acquiring N (urease) and phosphorus (acid phosphatase) and depressed the oxidative enzymes (phenol oxidase, peroxidase and catalase) activities. Results suggest that (1) this bamboo forest ecosystem is moving towards being limited by P or co-limited by P under elevated N deposition, (2) the expected progressive increases in N deposition may have a potential important effect on forest litter decomposition due to the interaction of inorganic N and oxidative enzyme activities, in such bamboo forests under high levels of ambient N deposition.

However, in pigs, the information on CAPZB is very limited. In this study, we cloned and characterized the porcine actin capping protein beta (CAPZB) gene. In addition, we present two novel porcine CAPZB splice variants CAPZB1 and CAPZB2. CAPZB1 was expressed in all twenty tissues. However, CAPZB2 was predominantly expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart. In addition, the two isoforms had different expression profiles during the skeletal muscle development and between breeds. Moreover, the SNP T394G was identified in the coding region of the CAPZB gene, which was significantly associated with the carcass traits including the LFW, CFW, SFT and LEA. Data presented in our study suggests that the CAPZB gene may be a candidate gene of meat production trait and provides useful information for further studies on its roles in porcine skeletal muscle.

Despite many years of study, virulence factors and the mechanisms of the entire infection process remain largely unclear. So two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were used to search for distinctions at the membrane protein expression level between two H. parasuis isolates aimed at uncovering some proteins potentially involved in habitat adaption and pathogenesis. Results: A comparative proteomic approach combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry was employed to explore the differences among membrane proteomes of a virulent Haemophilus parasuis strain isolated from the lung of a diseased pig and an avirulent strain isolated from the nasal swab of a healthy pig. Differentially expressed protein spots identified by mass spectrometry were annotated and analyzed by bioinformatic interpretation. The mRNA level was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Proteins representing diverse functional activities were identified. Among them, the tonB-dependent siderophore receptor was a new discovery highlighted for its activity in iron uptake. In addition, periplasmic serine protease and putrescine/spermidine ABC transporter substrate-binding protein were given focus because of their virulence potential. This study revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were important in either the habitat adaption or pathogenesis of H. parasuis. Conclusions: The outcome demonstrated the presence of some proteins which raise the speculation for their importance in helping in habitat adaption or pathogenesis within the host.

SGs are currently used in the preparation of medicines, food products and neutraceuticals because of its sweetening property (zero calories and about 300 times sweeter than sugar). Recently, some progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of SGs in Stevia, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Additionally, the genomics of Stevia, a non-model species, remains uncharacterized. The recent advent of RNA-Seq, a next generation sequencing technology, provides an opportunity to expand the identification of Stevia genes through in-depth transcript profiling. Results: We present a comprehensive landscape of the transcriptome profiles of three genotypes of Stevia with divergent SG compositions characterized using RNA-seq. 191,590,282 high-quality reads were generated and then assembled into 171,837 transcripts with an average sequence length of 969 base pairs. A total of 80,160 unigenes were annotated, and 14,211 of the unique sequences were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Gene sequences of all enzymes known to be involved in SG synthesis were examined. A total of 143 UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) unigenes were identified, some of which might be involved in SG biosynthesis. The expression patterns of eight of these genes were further confirmed by RT-QPCR. Conclusion: RNA-seq analysis identified candidate genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of SGs in Stevia, a non-model plant without a reference genome. The transcriptome data from this study yielded new insights into the process of SG accumulation in Stevia. Our results demonstrate that RNA-Seq can be successfully used for gene identification and transcript profiling in a non-model species.

Seven LPS transport proteins (that is, LptA-LptG) form a trans-envelope protein complex responsible for the transport of LPS from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, the mechanism for which is poorly understood. Here we report the first crystal structure of the unique integral membrane LPS translocon LptD-LptE complex. LptD forms a novel 26-stranded beta-barrel, which is to our knowledge the largest beta-barrel reported so far. LptE adopts a roll-like structure located inside the barrel of LptD to form an unprecedented two-protein 'barrel and plug' architecture. The structure, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays suggest that the hydrophilic O-antigen and the core oligosaccharide of the LPS may pass through the barrel and the lipid A of the LPS may be inserted into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane through a lateral opening between strands beta 1 and beta 26 of LptD. These findings not only help us to understand important aspects of bacterial outer membrane biogenesis, but also have significant potential for the development of novel drugs against multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria.

Results showed that different grafts have significant effects on the abovementioned properties. The appropriate dual/threefold rootstock grafting allowed for higher survival rates. The combined rootstock of bottle gourd and pumpkin can enhance the plant growth potential and lower the incidence of wilt. The single fruit weight of the grafted plants with a combined rootstock from bottle gourd and pumpkin was the median of the weights obtained with the pumpkin rootstock and the bottle gourd rootstock. The plot yield of grafted plants with a pumpkin rootstock was higher than that of the plants with a bottle gourd rootstock. The low soluble solids content of the fruit grafted with a pumpkin rootstock had relatively high acidity, which could be improved by adding bottle gourd to the rootstock. The vitamin C content of the grafted fruit from the combined bottle gourd and pumpkin rootstock was higher than that of plants grafted with either bottle gourd or pumpkin alone. The subsequent analysis showed that the combined rootstock of bottle gourd and pumpkin has significant or extremely significant interaction effects on the stem diameter, number of leaves, single fruit weight, plot yield, and fruit vitamin C content of the grafted watermelon plants, which probably led to the higher related index values of some of grafting combinations.

It functions as the terminal oxidase of chlororespiration, and has the potential ability to regulate the redox state of the PQ pool. Expression of the PTOX gene was up-regulated in soybean seedlings after exposure to water deficit stress for 6 h. Concomitantly expression of the NDH-H gene, encoding a component of the NADPH dehydrogenase (NDH) complex which is a key component of both chlororespiration and NDH-dependent cyclic electron transfer (CET), was also up-regulated. Transcript levels of the proton gradient regulation (PGR5) gene, which encodes an essential component of the PGR5-dependent CET, were not affected by water stress, while the expression of the alternative oxidase (AOX1) gene, which encodes a terminal oxidase of alternative respiration in mitochondria, was also up-regulated under water stress. Therefore, our results indicate that water stress induced the up-regulation of genes encoding key components of chlororespiration and alternative respiration. Transcript levels of the AOX1 gene began to increase in response to water stress before those of PTOX suggesting that alternative respiration may react faster to water stress than chlororespiration.

The pig breeds studied were the Tibetan pig (TP, high altitude), the Liang-Shan pig (LSP, middle altitude) and the Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) cross (DLY, flatland). The results indicated that TP and LSP had better meat quality than DLY (P < 0.01). The glycolytic potential (GP) increased in the order of TP < LSP < DLY and decreased with time post mortem. DLY had higher glucagon and epinephrine contents than LSP and TP (P < 0.01). The proportions of myosin heavy chain muscle fibers type I in the Longissimus dorsi increased in the order of DLY < TP < LSP, whereas the proportion of type IIb increased in the order of TP < LSP < DLY. The expression of gene PKM2 played an important role in the glycolysis rate of the different genotypes. Compared with the other two pig breeds, the high-altitude breeds had better meat quality attributes, which may be due to the slow rate of glycolysis metabolism.

However, changes in expression of protein coding genes and miRNAs that participate in glucose metabolism during development are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the expression of genes related to glucose metabolism during muscle development. We found an age-dependent increase in gene expression in cardiac muscle, with enrichment in heart development- and energy-related metabolic processes. A subset of genes that were up-regulated until 30 or 180 days postnatally, and then down-regulated in psoas major muscle was significantly enriched in mitochondrial oxidative-related processes, while genes that up-regulated in longissimus doris muscle was significantly enriched in glycolysis-related processes. Meanwhile, expression of energy-related microRNAs decreased with increasing age. In addition, we investigated the correlation between microRNAs and mRNAs in three muscle types across different stages of development and found many potential microRNA-mRNA pairs involved in regulating glucose metabolism.

Different doses (40 or 80 mg/animal) of melatonin were subcutaneously implanted into deer before the breeding season. Exogenous melatonin administration significantly elevated the serum FSH levels at the time of insemination compared with levels in control animals. During superovulation, the serum LH levels in donor sika deer reached their highest values (7.1 +/- 2.04 ng/mL) at the point of insemination, compared with the baseline levels (4.98 +/- 0.07 ng/mL) in control animals. This high level of LH was sustained until the day of embryo recovery. In contrast, the serum levels of PRL in the 80 mg of melatonin-treated group were significantly lower than those of control deer. The average number of corpora lutea in melatonin-treated deer was significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.05). The average number of embryos in the deer treated with 40 mg of melatonin was higher than that of the control; however, this increase did not reach significant difference (p > 0.05), which may be related to the relatively small sample size. In addition, embryonic development in melatonin-treated groups was delayed.

Despite the widespread vaccination of domestic carnivores, CPVs have remained important pathogens of domestic and wild carnivores. In this study, we isolated CPV-2 from Tibetan mastiffs and performed a global analysis of the complete VP2 gene sequences of CPV-2 strains in China. Six isolates were typed as new CPV-2a, according to key amino acid positions. On a phylogenetic tree, these six sequences formed a distinct clade. Five isolates occurred on the same branch as KF785794 from China and GQ379049 from Thailand; CPV-LS-ZA1 formed a separate subgroup with FJ435347 from China. One hundred ninety-eight sequences from various parts of China and the six sequences isolated here formed seven distinct clusters, indicating the high diversity of CPVs in China. Of 204 VP2 sequences, 183 (91.04%) encoded the mutation Ser297Ala, regardless of the antigenic type, implying that most Chinese CPV-2 strains contain the VP2 mutation Ser297Ala. However, the biological significance of this change from prototype CPV-2a/2b to new CPV-2a/2b types remains unclear. This study is the first to isolate new CPV-2a from the Tibetan mastiff. Our data show that new CPV-2a/2b variants are now circulating in China.

The aim of this study was to enhance the Al3+ tolerance of an elite durum cultivar by introgression of a chromosomal fragment from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) that possesses an Al3+ tolerance gene. A 4D(4B) substitution line of durum wheat 'Langdon' was backcrossed to 'Jandaroi', a current semi-dwarf Australian durum. In the second backcross, using 'Jandaroi' as the recurrent parent, a seedling was identified where TaALMT1 on chromosome 4D was recombined with the Rht-B1b locus on chromosome 4B to yield an Al3+-tolerant seedling with a semi-dwarf habit. This seedling was used in a third backcross to generate homozygous sister lines with contrasting Al3+ tolerances. The backcrossed lines were characterized and compared with selected cultivars of hexaploid wheat for their Al3+ and Na+ tolerances in hydroponic culture as well as in short-term experiments to assess their growth on acid soil. Analysis of sister lines derived from the third backcross showed that the 4D chromosomal fragment substantially enhanced Al3+ tolerance. The ability to exclude Na+ from leaves was also enhanced, indicating that the chromosomal fragment possessed the Kna1 salt tolerance locus. Although Al3+ tolerance of seminal roots was enhanced in acid soil, the development of fine roots was not as robust as found in Al3+-tolerant lines of hexaploid wheat. Analysis of plant characteristics in the absence of Al3+ toxicity showed that the introgressed fragment did not affect total grain yield but reduced the weight of individual grains. The results show that it is possible to increase substantially the Al3+ tolerance of an elite durum wheat cultivar by introgression of a 4D chromosomal fragment. Further improvements are possible, such as introducing additional genes to enhance the Al3+ tolerance of fine roots and by eliminating the locus on the chromosomal fragment responsible for smaller grain weights.

Metabolism, including lipid metabolism, during the embryonic stage is also important for the growth and development of poultry. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of incubation temperature on embryonic lipid metabolism in the liver of ducks. To fully evaluate the effects, thermal treatment was given between embryonic ages 11 and 24 days with a 1 degrees C higher incubation temperature than the control group, and lipid metabolism parameters in the liver and blood serum were analyzed both at embryonic stage day 20 and 2 weeks post-hatching. Our results showed no significant changes in the embryonic stage in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood serum (P > 0.05). Additionally, the mRNA expression levels and enzyme activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and elongase of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) did not show significant changes either in the embryonic stage or at hatching day 20 (P > 0.05). However, there were significant changes in the gene expression and enzyme activities of TC, LDL-C and FAS at post-hatching stages (P <= 0.05). These results may indicate that the thermal treatment has less influence on lipid metabolism in the embryonic stage but has a much stronger effect in the post-hatching stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we sequenced 714 bp fragment of the MC1R for 176 individuals from two goose breeds with three plumage color pattern (Landes goose, gray plumage, n=58; Landes goose, spotted plumage, near black, n=36; Zhedong White Goose, white plumage, n=82). A total of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, including c.210C>T, c.321C>T, c.411C>T, c.525C>T, and c.756G>A, which subsequently determined seven haplotypes (H1-H7). Among them, H2 and H4 were the predominant haplotypes. Association analysis revealed that haplotypes H2 and H5 were significantly associated with white plumage of Zhedong white goose, whereas H3 was significantly associated with gray plumage in Landes goose (p<0.01). Diplotypes H2H2 and H3H4 were associated with white plumage in Zhedong white goose and gray plumage in Landes goose (p <0.01), respectively.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the early attainment of puberty as a result of nutrition fortification remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hormone and gene expression changes in prepubescent gilts fed a high-fat diet to investigate whether these changes could predict the early timing of puberty. Methods: Forty gilts were fed a daily basal diet (LE) or a basal diet with an additional 270 g/d or 340 g/d of fat (HE) during the prepubescent phase. Blood samples were collected during the prepubescent phase to detect hormone secretion changes in insulin-like growth factor-1, kisspeptin, estradiol, progesterone, and leptin. The gene expressions at the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis were examined on day 73 of the experiment (average age on day 177) during the prepubescent phase. Results: An HE diet resulted in accelerated body weight gain and back-fat thickness at the P-2 point compared with LE gilts during the prepubescent phase. Gilts that were fed HE diets attained puberty 12 d earlier than LE gilts, and a larger proportion of HE gilts reached puberty at day 180 or 190 of age. A postmortem analysis revealed a promoted development of the uterus and ovary tissue that was characterized by a 53.7% and 29.5% increase in the uterine and ovary weight, respectively, and an increased length of the uterine horn and oviduct tissue in HE gilts. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that HE gilts had higher Kiss-1, G protein-coupled receptor 54, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and estrogen receptor a mRNA expression levels in the hypothalamic anteroventral periventricular nucleus; the leptin receptor mRNA expression level was higher in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and ovary tissue; the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor expression was higher in the pituitary and ovary tissues, and the follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone mRNA expression levels were higher in the pituitary gland. Conclusion: These data showed that the consumption of additional fat can facilitate early attainment of puberty, which can be predicted by the changes in secreted hormones and gene expression in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.

J	Kang, YH; Ma, XY; Khan, S				Kang, Yinhong; Ma, Xiaoyi; Khan, Shahbaz			PREDICTING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON MAIZE CROP PRODUCTIVITY AND WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN THE LOESS PLATEAU	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE			English	Article						climate scenarios; water use indices; semi-arid area; yield; maize	CHINA; WHEAT	Climate change impacts on food supply and water use efficiency have become an urgent issue for the agricultural researchers and governments. With climate change, water resources will be a restricting factor for agriculture, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. This paper mainly discusses the changing tendency of water balance components, maize yield and water use indices under rainfed and irrigated conditions in subareas of the Loess Plateau under the A2 and B2 scenarios with the SWAGMAN (R) Destiny model. The results show that evapotranspiration will increase in future for both rainfed and irrigated maize under both scenarios. The water use indices mentioned in this paper have the same tendency under both scenarios in the same subareas, but variability under the A2 scenario is higher than that under B2. The crop yield and water use indices will decrease for rainfed maize production in the whole Loess Plateau. With irrigation, crop yield will increase in Clay Loam-2 and Clay Loam-1 while it will decrease in Light Loam and Sandy Loam under the A2 scenario and B2 scenarios in 2020, 2050 and 2080 respectively. The evapotranspiration efficiency and ratio of evapotranspiration and irrigation under irrigated maize will increase in Clay Loam-2, Clay Loam-1, Light Loam and Sandy Loam under both scenarios. Crop water use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency and total water use efficiency will decrease under the A2 and B2 scenarios during irrigated maize growth. Therefore, for the rainfed crop, it is necessary to improve water harvesting technology so as to meet the increasing crop water requirements with climate change; while, for the irrigated crop, it is vital to enhance soil water capacity in order to make good use of the irrigated water.

There is considerable variation in the levels of AA in different foods and different brands of the same food; therefore, so far, a general upper limit for AA in food is not available. In addition, the link of dietary AA to human cancer is still under debate, although AA has been known as a potential cause of various toxic effects including carcinogenic effects in experimental animals. Furthermore, the oxidized metabolite of AA, glycidamide (GA), is more toxic than AA. Both AA and GA can form adducts with protein, DNA, and hemoglobin, and some of those adducts can serve as biomarkers for AA exposure; their potential roles in the linking of AA to human cancer, reproductive defects or other diseases, however, are unclear. This review addresses the state-of-the-art understanding of AA, focusing on risk assessment, mechanism of formation and strategies of mitigation in foods. The potential application of omics to AA risk assessment is also discussed. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is responsible for the most serious disease of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and causes significant yield losses in rice-growing countries. Identifying the protein protein interaction (PPI) maps of R solani can provide insights into the potential pathogenic mechanisms and assign putative functions to unknown genes. Here, we exploited a PPI map of R solani anastomosis group 1 IA (AG-1 IA) based on the interolog and domain domain interaction methods. We constructed a core subset of high-confidence protein networks consisting of 6705 interactions among 1773 proteins. The high quality of the network was revealed by comprehensive methods, including yeast two-hybrid experiments. Pathogenic interaction subnetwork, secreted proteins subnetwork, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade subnetwork and their interacting partners were constructed and analyzed. Moreover, to exactly predict the pathogenic factors, the expression levels of the interaction proteins were investigated by analyzing RNA sequences that consisted of samples from the entire infection progress. The PPIs offer an exceptionally rich source of data that can be used to understand the gene functions and biological processes of this serious disease at the system level.

Exposure to 100 mu M Ni2+ in a hydroponic system for 1 month significantly decreased the pigment content and the photosynthetic rate, caused visible impairment in cellular organelle structure, and induced obvious disturbance and imbalance in the N content of female plants, while male plants suffered a lower negative influence on all the above measured parameters. However, males accumulated a higher Ni concentration in both leaves and roots than females, while the transportation ratio of Ni from roots to shoots in males was slightly lower than that in females. Our results, therefore, suggest that males have a better tolerance capacity and a greater ability to remediate Ni-polluted soil than females. This greater tolerance capacity in males might be highly correlated with the better maintenance of N balance and more effective physiological detoxification responses (such as the response to proline) under Ni stress. The differences between the sexes in tolerance capacity to heavy metals should be verified after performing a field investigation using adult trees as materials in the future study.

A total of 240 1-day-old male AA broilers were divided into four groups of 60 each, fed with basal diet (control group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) (AFB(1) group), 0.4 mg/kg supplement Se (Se group), and 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg supplement Se (AFB(1) + Se group) for 21 days, respectively. Compared with the control group, decreased jejunal villus height, villus height/crypt ratio, and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells, and G(2)/M phase arrest and shedded epithelial cells on the tip of jejunal villus were observed in AFB(1) groups at 7 and 14 days of age. However, the villus/crypt ratio, PCNA-positive cells and cell percentage of G(0)/G(1), S, and G(2)/M phases had no significant differences between AFB(1) group and control group at 21 days. Simultaneous supplementation with sodium selenite restored these parameters to be close to those in control group. In conclusion, 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) in the diet inhibits the development of broiler's jejunum by reducing cellular proliferation and inducing G(2)/M arrest during only the first 2 weeks after hatching. Supplementation of dietary sodium selenite at the concentration of 0.4 mg/kg Se had protective action against these toxic effects of AFB(1).

The numbers of IgA(+) cells of ileum were determined by immunohistochemistry as well as the contents of sIgA, IgA, IgG, and IgM in the mucosa of ileum by ELISA. Compared with those in the control group, the numbers of IgA(+) cells as well as the sIgA, IgA, IgG, and IgM contents were decreased in the AFB(1) group. However, compared with those in the AFB(1) group, the numbers of IgA(+) cells as well as the sIgA, IgA, IgG, and IgM contents were increased in the AFB(1) + Se group, and these data had no difference between AFB(1) + Se group and control group. It was concluded that 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) could reduce the humoral immune function of the ileum mucosa, but 0.4 mg/kg supplemented dietary selenium could protect the mucosal humoral immune function from AFB(1)-induced impairment.

The optimal conditions of the extraction of polysaccharides were determined to be the extraction time of 1.6 h, extraction temperature of 88 C and ratio of liquid to raw material of 20, which contributed to the highest yield of 3.77%. The crude polysaccharide was purified and three fractions (CLP-1, CLP-2 and CLP-3) were obtained. Their physicochemical properties were investigated with chemical method. The results indicated that the uronic acid content of CLP-2 was significantly higher than those of CLP-1 and CLP-3, and CLPs were mainly composed of glucose and galactose residue. In vitro antioxidant assay indicated that three polysaccharide fractions showed remarkable antioxidant activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with CLP-1 and CLP-2, CLP-3 exhibited higher iron chelating activity. CLP-2 possessed significant higher hydroxyl radial and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrydrazy (DPPH) radical scavenging activities than those of CLP-1 and CLP-3. Overall, the polysaccharides derived from C. oleifera leaves might be explored as potential natural antioxidant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To investigate the effects of nutrient restriction on reproductive function and the underlying mechanism, changes of reproductive traits, hormone secretions and gene expressions in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis were examined in postpubertal gilts at anestrus induced by nutrient restriction. Gilts having experienced two estrus cycles were fed a normal (CON, 2.86 kg/d) or nutrient restricted (NR, 1 kg/d) food regimens to expect anestrus. NR gilts experienced another three estrus cycles, but did not express estrus symptoms at the anticipated fourth estrus. Blood samples were collected at 5 days' interval for consecutive three times for measurement of hormone concentrations at the 23th day of the fourth estrus cycle. Individual progesterone concentrations of NR gilts from three consecutive blood samples were below 1.0 ng/mL versus 2.0 ng/mL in CON gilts, which was considered anestrus. NR gilts had impaired development of reproductive tract characterized by absence of large follicles (diameter a parts per thousand yen 6 mm), decreased number of corepus lutea and atrophy of uterus and ovary tissues. Circulating concentrations of IGF-I, kisspeptin, estradiol, progesterone and leptin were significantly lower in NR gilts than that in CON gilts. Nutrient restriction down-regulated gene expressions of kiss-1, G-protein coupled protein 54, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, estrogen receptor alpha, progesterone receptor, leptin receptor, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone and insulin-like growth factor I in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis of gilts. Collectively, nutrient restriction resulted in impairment of reproductive function and changes of hormone secretions and gene expressions in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, which shed light on the underlying mechanism by which nutrient restriction influenced reproductive function.

Growth of S. viridis was significantly inhibited in the presence of decomposing E. grandis leaf litter and application of nitrogen did not overcome the inhibition. Photosynthetic pigments in S. viridis leaves were significantly decreased when exposed to allelopathic substances. The activities of antioxidant enzymes decreased with the increase in malonaldehyde content in leaves Of S. viridis treated with decomposing leaf litter of E. grandis, especially in the early stage of leaf litter decomposition. This suggested the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage to membrane lipids. Thus, failure to quench excessive ROS affected the growth of S. viridis. By GC-MS analyses, a total of 33 potential allelopathic compounds were detected in naturally decomposing E. grandis leaf litter. Of these compounds, terpenes were the major allelochemicals identified. The decomposing leaf litter of E. grandis had strong allelopathic effects on the growth of S. viridis.

Muell.) on the growth and development of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify and compare volatile compounds in the original leaf litter and decomposed leaf litter. No significant differences Were observed in leaf number of spinach between random leaf litter treatment and the control at vegetative stage (p > 0.05). However in reproductive stage, the responses of two sexual types were different to leaf litter decomposition in terms of some morphological, physiological and phenological traits. The sex ratio (F/M) was increased by 60 g but reduced by 120 g leaf litter for both years. Seventy-nine volatile compounds were identified from the original leaf litter sample and after 4-months of decomposition, the volatile compounds decreased sharply in diversity and absolute peak area. Of the majority of 52 terpenes, alpha-pinene, aromadendrene, eucalyptol and eudesmol were optimal caused the allelopathic effects.

Under low Cd stress, the new roots appeared in the cortex of four rice genotypes. The diameter of the new root in YixiangB was larger than that of E2B. The restorer line R892 generated more roots than Mianhui725. Under high Cd2+ stress, broken epidermis, damaged cortex and black spots appeared in both maintainer and restorerlines. In general, anatomical damages in the restorer lines (R892 and Mianhui725) were slighter than those of the maintainer lines (YixiangB and E2B). Thus, the restorer lines had more adaptive ability to Cd2+ stress than maintainer lines.

ALKALOIDS; EXPECTORANT; WABUENSIS; BULBUS; PLANTS	Steroidal alkaloids, as the major biologically active components in Bulbus Fritillariae, possess a variety of toxicological and pharmacological effects on humans. The objective of this work was to determine whether endophytic fungi isolated from fresh bulbs of Fritillaria unibracteata var. wabensis can produce one or more alkaloids like its host plant. Four classical reagents including Wagner's, iodine-potassium iodide, Mayer's and improved Dragendorff's were used for primary screening. Then thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) were employed to identify the fermentation products of the selected strains. The results showed that extract from one stain (WBS007) has positive reactions in process of primary screening. A further TLC scan and HPLC-ELSD showed that strain WBS007 had two components with the same TLC relative front (RI) value and HPLC retention time (RT) as authentic peimisine and peiminine. In addition, strain WBS007 was identified as Fusarium sp. based on phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences. Thus, strain WBS007 produced the bioactive ingredient peimisine and peiminine, as does its host plant, and could be used for the production of peimisine and peiminine by fermentation.

Initiation of active immunization against testosterone during early puberty alters negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis in rabbits	DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Testosterone; Immunization; Reproductive axis; Negative feedback; Rabbit	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; MALE-RAT; GENE-EXPRESSION; SEX STEROIDS; RECEPTOR; SECRETION; ANDROGEN; INHIBIN; GNRH	To investigate the effects of antitestosterone immunization, initiated during early puberty, on hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular feedback in rabbits, 16 early pubertal male rabbits were randomly allocated into 2 groups (n = 8), control or immunized against testosterone-3(O-carboxymethyl)oxime-BSA in Freund adjuvant at 4 mo of age (with a booster immunization 4 wk later). Blood samples (for antibody titers and hormone concentrations) were collected at 2- or 4-wk intervals after immunization. Compared with controls, antitestosterone immunization triggered: a substantial and sustained antibody response (P < 0.01); increases in serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone and testis weight and volume (P < 0.05); hyperplasia of testicular interstitial tissue with clustered and hypertrophic Leydig cells; and greater (P < 0.05) enzyme protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels for testicular cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450, 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450, and 3 beta-dydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Furthermore, immunoneutralization of testosterone upregulated mRNA expressions for genes in sex steroid negative feedback loops, including androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha), kisspeptin encoded gene (kiss-1) and kisspeptin receptor (G-coupled receptor 54) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, GnRH receptor and LH-beta in pituitary, and AR, inhibin-alpha and beta(A) subunits in testes (P < 0.05). However, immunization did not affect mRNA expressions for follicle-stimulating hormone beta, AR, and ER-alpha in pituitary, or ER-alpha in testes. We concluded that antitestosterone immunization in male rabbits, initiated during early puberty, increased GnRH mRNA expression, and in turn LH synthesis by reducing testicular feedback signaling. Reduction of direct steroidal effects on the testis may also have increased testosterone secretion. Consequently, there was an accelerated testicular development during puberty and enhanced testicular function after puberty, which likely conferred prolonged reproductive advantages.

Don; Cadmium; Hyperaccumulator	INDIAN MUSTARD; PHYTOREMEDIATION; PHYTOEXTRACTION; TOLERANCE; METALS; SOIL	In a preliminary study, we found that the cadmium (Cd) concentrations in shoots of the winter farmland weeds Cardamine hirsuta Linn. and Gnaphalium affine D. Don exceeded the critical value of a Cd-hyperaccumulator (100 mg kg(-1)), indicating that these two farmland weeds might be Cd-hyperaccumulators. In this study, we grew these species in soil containing various concentrations of Cd to further evaluate their Cd accumulation characteristics. The biomasses of C. hirsuta and G. affine decreased with increasing Cd concentrations in the soil, while the root/shoot ratio and the Cd concentrations in shoot tissues increased. The Cd concentrations in shoots of C. hirsuta and G. affine reached 121.96 and 143.91 mg kg(-1), respectively, at the soil Cd concentration of 50 mg kg(-1). Both of these concentrations exceeded the critical value of a Cd-hyperaccumulator (100 mg kg(-1)). The shoot bioconcentration factors of C. hirsuta and G. affine were greater than 1. The translocation factor of C. hirsuta was less than 1 and that of G. affine was greater than 1. These findings indicated that C. hirsuta is a Cd-accumulator and G. affine is Cd-hyperaccumulator. Both plants are distributed widely in the field, and they could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil in winter.

Therefore, it is important to explore a new class of Ca-enriched nutrient for the fortification of food. In this work, we prepared a novel class of soluble and edible Ca-protein complexes where approximately 140 calcium ions were encapsulated within a phytoferritin nanocage. As an alternative to other organic and/or inorganic carriers, protein nanocages were found to provide a unique vehicle of biological origin for the intracellular delivery of calcium ions for supplementation. Such encapsulation can protect calcium ions within protein cages against dietary factors such as tannic acid (TA), oxalic acid (OA), and other divalent metal ions in foodstuffs. We demonstrated that the calcium-containing ferritin composites can be absorbed by Caco-2 cells through a process where a TfR1 receptor is involved, whereas the uptake of free calcium ions has been known to be associated with another receptor, DMT1, indicating that the calcium ions encapsulated in supramolecular protein cages can be internalized by the Caco-2 cells through a different pathway from its free analogs for calcium supplementation.

An increasing number of cases of treatment failure is being reported because of drug resistance. The development of a specific vaccine would be a sustainable option for control of this disease. In this study, we cloned and expressed a S. scabiei gene encoding paramyosin (PAR) and investigated the immune response elicited by DNA encoding PAR in mice. The ability of the DNA vaccine to express antigen in COS-7 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and IFA. The immune response induced by DNA vaccine was investigated by ELISA, splenocyte proliferation assay, and cytokine production assay. Compared to the pVAX1 control group, the PAR DNA vaccination group showed the higher levels of IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgE, IgM, stronger lymphocyte proliferation in mouse spleen, and larger production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma in the supernatant of cultures from splenocytes. These results indicated that the PAR DNA vaccine induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response in mice. In conclusion, our results revealed that the S. scabiei PAR DNA vaccine induced both a humoral and cellular immune response, which would provide basic data for the further study to develop an effective vaccine against sarcoptic mange.

A total of eighty-four cross-bred piglets, weaned at an age of 28 (SEM 1) d, were allocated randomly, on the basis of average initial body weight (7.72 (SEM 0.65) kg), to seven treatment groups as follows: a 250 mg Zn (ZnO)/kg group (low Zn; LZ) and a 2250 mg Zn (ZnO)/kg group (high Zn; HZ) that were offered diets containing ZnO at 250 and 2250 mg Zn/kg, respectively; and five experimental groups in which coated ZnO was added at 250, 380, 570, 760 and 1140 mg Zn/kg basal diet, respectively. The trial lasted 2 weeks. The results indicated that, compared with LZ treatment, supplementation with coated ZnO at 380 or 570 mg Zn/kg reduced (P< 0.05) diarrhoea index, increased (P< 0.05) duodenal villus height and the ratio of villus height:crypt depth, up-regulated (P< 0.05) the gene expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, zonula occludens protein-1, occludin, IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta 1, and elevated (P< 0.05) secretory IgA concentration in the jejunal mucosa. Microbiota richness and the Shannon diversity index were also decreased (P< 0.05). Furthermore, piglets in the group fed coated ZnO at 380 or 570 mg Zn/kg did not differ from those in the HZ-fed group in relation to the aforementioned parameters. Collectively, a low concentration of coated ZnO (380 or 570 mg Zn/kg) can alleviate the incidence of diarrhoea by promoting intestinal development, protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier from damage, stimulating the mucosal immune system and regulating the microbiota composition.

CD8+ T cells, which are called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), provide potent defenses against virus infection and intracellular pathogens by killing the targets cells directly. In our previous researches, the conventional and semi-quantitative PCR were used to detect the goose CD4 and CD8 alpha. However, the semi-quantitative RT-PCR only detect the relative amount of gene transcription. Quantitative PCR assay was more sensitive than conventional PCR assay, and quantitative PCR assay has a lower limit of sensitivity. Materials, Methods & Results: Contrast to conventional assays, the detection of amplicons by quantitative RT-PCR could be visualized as the amplification progressed. This effect has provided a great deal of insight into the kinetics of the reaction and it is the foundation of kinetic of real-time qPCR. The analysis of gene transcription by qPCR has proven to be an attractive method due to its potential for increasing laboratory throughput, simultaneous processing of several samples as well as more reliable instrumentation. With those in mind, the real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods for the detection of goose CD4 and CD8 alpha transcripts were reported here for the first time. With this assay, it is possible to carry out a rapid quantitative analysis of goose CD4 and CD8 alpha transcripts over a wide linear range, with an unknown template. CD8 is expressed on the membrane of T cells either as an alpha alpha-homodimer or alpha beta-heterodimer. Since both forms of CD8 have a chain, the transcription levels of CD8 can be monitored by detecting CD8 alpha mRNA expression. Assays were based on the DNA sequence of goose CD4 [GenBank: JX902315], CD8 alpha [GenBank: KC476104], and beta-actin [GenBank: M26111]. qPCR was carried out in quadruplicates in a total volume of 20 mu L containing 10 mu L Ssoadvanced (TM) SYBR (R), 1.5 mu L of cDNA, 0.6 mu l of each primers (10 mu M), and 7.3 mu L of sterile water. The amplification program was 94 degrees C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 degrees C for 10 s, the annealing temperature of each pair primers for 30 s. The annealing temperatures for real-time qPCR were 61.4 degrees C for CD4 and CD8 alpha, 60 degrees C for beta-actin, respectively. After amplification, melting analysis of qPCR revealed specific amplification of each gene that could be visualized clearly as a single peak of melting temperature. The R2 values of the standard curves for all target genes were above 0.999. To further apply the methods we established, the specific real-time qRT-PCR methods were performed for the detection of the biology activity of CD4 and CD8a in the spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs). Fresh spleen monocytes cells (MNCs) were chosen as the responder, PHA was chosen as agonist, and the transcripts of CD4 and CD8 alpha mRNA in spleen MNCs after stimulation were investigated by qRT-PCR assay. Results documented that the transcriptions of goose CD8a and CD4 were significantly up regulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in vitro. Discussion: This paper expands the application of qPCR to analyze the mRNA transcription profiling of goose CD4 and CD8 alpha, The qRT-PCR method established in this study may provide a better way for the further research on the immunological and biological activity of goose CD4+ and CD8+ T cell in vitro and in vivo, as well as for the study on gene expression during disease.

However, the molecular mechanisms of R. anatipestifer infection are poorly understood. In particular, the lack of genomic information from a variety of R. anatipestifer strains has proved severely limiting. Results: In this study, we present the complete genomes of two R. anatipestifer strains, RA-CH-1 (2,309,519 bp, Genbank accession CP003787) and RA-CH-2 (2,166,321 bp, Genbank accession CP004020). Both strains are from isolates taken from two different sick ducks in the SiChuang province of China. A comparative genomics approach was used to identify similarities and key differences between RA-CH-1 and RA-CH-2 and the previously sequenced strain RA-GD, a clinical isolate from GuangDong, China, and ATCC11845. Conclusion: The genomes of RA-CH-2 and RA-GD were extremely similar, while RA-CH-1 was significantly different than ATCC11845. RA-CH-1 is 140,000 bp larger than the three other strains and has 16 unique gene families. Evolutionary analysis shows that RA-CH-1 and RA-CH-2 are closed and in a branch with ATCC11845, while RA-GD is located in another branch. Additionally, the detection of several iron/heme-transport related proteins and motility mechanisms will be useful in elucidating factors important in pathogenicity. This information will allow a better understanding of the phenotype of different R. anatipestifer strains and molecular mechanisms of infection.

The acaricidal activity of each compound was tested against Psoroptes cuniculi in vitro. Three compounds had strong acaricidal activity against P. cuniculi in vitro. The insecticidal effect of 0.5% compound 9 beta-hydroxy-ageraphorone was better than the insecticidal effect of fenvalerate, and compounds 9-oxo-ageraphorone and 9-oxo-10,11-dehydro-ageraphorone exhibited higher insecticidal effects than 9 beta-hydroxy-ageraphorone. Thus, the E. adenophorum petroleum ether extract contains an effective composition of acaricides that could potentially be developed as a promising plant-origin acaricide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The sediment concentration ranges of TPH, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Hg were 6.3-535 mu g/g, 58-332 mu g/g, 7.2-63 mu g/g, 4.3-138 mu g/g, 0-0.98 mu g/g, and 0.10-0.68 mu g/g, respectively. These results met the highest marine sediment quality standards in China, indicating that the sediment was fairly clean. However, based on the effects range-median (ERM) quotient method, the calculated values for all of the sampling sites were higher than 0.10, suggesting that there was a potential adverse biological risk in Bohai Bay. According to the calculated results, the biological risk decreased from 2001 to 2007 and increased afterwards. High-risk sites were mainly distributed along the coast. This study suggests that anthropogenic influences might be responsible for the potential risk of adverse biological effects from TPH and heavy metals in Bohai Bay. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Four artificial management practices (raking cropland, artificial hoeing, artificial digging, and contour tillage) were used according to the local agriculture customs of the Loess Plateau of China to simulate different types of soil surface roughness, using an additional smooth slope for comparison purposes. A total of 20 rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in five 1m by 2m boxes under two rainfall intensities (0.68 and 1.50mmmin-1) on a 15 degrees slope. During splash erosion, soil surface roughness decreased in all treatments except raking cropland and smooth baseline under rainfall intensity of 0.68mmmin-1, while increasing for all treatments except smooth baseline under rainfall intensity of 1.50mmmin-1. During sheet erosion, soil surface roughness decreased for all treatments except hoeing cropland under rainfall intensity of 0.68mmmin-1. However, soil surface roughness increased for the artificial hoeing and raking cropland under rainfall intensity of 1.50mmmin-1. Soil surface roughness has a control effect on sheet erosion for different treatments under two rainfall intensities. For rill erosion, soil surface roughness increased for raking cropland and artificial hoeing treatments, and soil surface roughness decreased for artificial digging and the contour tillage treatments under two rainfall intensities. Under rainfall intensity of 0.68mmmin-1, the critical soil surface roughness was 0.706cm for the resistance control of runoff and sediment yield. Under rainfall intensity of 1.50mmmin-1, the critical soil surface roughness was 1.633cm for the resistance control of runoff, while the critical soil surface roughness was 0.706cm for the resistance control of sediment yield. These findings have important implications for clarifying the erosive nature of soil surface roughness and harnessing sloped farmland. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies based on the neutral or nearly neutral markers (mitochondrial DNA or microsatellites) showed high levels of genetic diversity and moderate genetic differentiation in the Sichuan rhesus macaques. Variation at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci is widely accepted as being maintained by balancing selection, even with a low level of neutral variability in some species. However, in small and isolated or bottlenecked populations, balancing selection may be overwhelmed by genetic drift. To estimate microevolutionary forces acting on the isolated rhesus macaque populations, we examined genetic variation at Mhc-DQB1 loci in 119 wild rhesus macaques from five geographically isolated populations in western Sichuan, China, and compared the levels of MHC variation and differentiation among populations with that previously observed at neutral microsatellite markers. Results: 23 Mamu-DQB1 alleles were identified in 119 rhesus macaques in western Sichuan, China. These macaques exhibited relatively high levels of genetic diversity at Mamu-DQB1. The Hanyuan population presented the highest genetic variation, whereas the Heishui population was the lowest. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and pairwise F-ST values showed moderate genetic differentiation occurring among the five populations at the Mhc-DQB1 locus. Non-synonymous substitutions occurred at a higher frequency than synonymous substitutions in the peptide binding region. Levels of MHC variation within rhesus macaque populations are concordant with microsatellite variation. On the phylogenetic tree for the rhesus and crab-eating macaques, extensive allele or allelic lineage sharing is observed betweenthe two species. Conclusions: Phylogenetic analyses confirm the apparent trans-species model of evolution of the Mhc-DQB1 genes in these macaques. Balancing selection plays an important role in sharing allelic lineages between species, but genetic drift may share balancing selection dominance to maintain MHC diversity. Great divergence at neutral or adaptive markers showed that moderate genetic differentiation had occurred in rhesus macaque populations in western Sichuan, China, due to the habitat fragmentation caused by long-term geographic barriers and human activity. The Heishui population should be paid more attention for its lowest level of genetic diversity and relatively great divergence from others.

J	Fu, L; Yang, ZJ; Chen, SY; Wang, J; Lai, SJ				Fu, Lu; Yang, Zhi-Juan; Chen, Shi-Yi; Wang, Jie; Lai, Song-Jia			Investigation of JAK1 and STAT3 polymorphisms and their gene-gene interactions in nonspecific digestive disorder of rabbits	GENE			English	Article						JAK1/STAT3; NSDD; RFLP; HRM; MDR	MULTIFACTOR-DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; SPORADIC BREAST-CANCER; TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL; SYNONYMOUS MUTATIONS; TARGETED DISRUPTION; DISEASE; ASSOCIATION; IMMUNITY; REVEALS; PATHWAY	Acting in a cellular signaling pathway, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play critical roles in several kinds of physiological and pathological responses, including inflammatory response. In this study, we detected three coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) of JAK1 and four cSNPs of STAT3 in New Zealand White rabbits. We analyzed their association with genetic resistance to nonspecific digestive disorder (NSDD) based on a case-control study (253 cases and 227 controls). The rabbits were genotyped for c.1421 C>T and c.3036 G>A in JAK1 using restriction fragment length polymorphisms and for c.831 T>C and c.399 G>A of STAT3 using high-resolution melting technology. The frequencies of the alleles and genotypes differed significantly between the case and control groups (P < 0.05). The case-control association analysis revealed that in JAK1, allele C increased the risk of NSDD (OR: 1.60,95% CI 1.166-2.185, P = 0.003), whereas allele A played a potentially protective role against NSDD (OR: 0.74,95% CI 0.572-0.952, P = 0.019). We used five inheritance models to evaluate the importance of the associated genotypes. Under the dominant inheritance model, the association analysis suggested that the CT/TT genotype increased the risk of NSDD (OR: 1.65, 95% CI 1.13-2.40, P = 0.009). A haplotype analysis showed that allele H2 (the two cSNPs: CG; OR: 1.354, 95% CI 1.050-1.747, P = 0.019) markedly increased the risk of the disorder. The association analysis revealed that in STAT3, allele G played a potentially protective role against NSDD (OR: 0.74; 95% CI 0.569-0.951; P = 0.019), whereas allele C increased the risk of NSDD (OR: 1.37; 95% CI 1.059-1.760; P = 0.016). Recessive inheritance was shown to be the best fitting model for c.399 and c.831. Under the recessive inheritance model, the association analysis suggested that the G/G genotype increased the risk of NSDD (OR: 1.73; 95% CI 1.07-2.80; P = 0.025). A haplotype analysis showed that H1 ' (the two cSNPs: AC; OR: 1.365; CI 1.059-1.760; P = 0.016) significantly increased the risk of the disorder. The CATMOD program (SAS 92) and the multifactor dimensionality reduction method were used to analyze the genetic interactions between JAK1 and STAT3. Data on the genetic interactions revealed that the JAK1 and STAB risk alleles described above contribute to NSDD susceptibility in combination with each other, and that model (c1421, c3036, c831) was the best model (OR: 2.7262; 95% CI: 4.7408-5.1986; P < 0.0001). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the genetic polymorphisms of the JAK1 and STAT3 genes and their associations with the incidence of NSDD in rabbits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The sheep genome illuminates biology of the rumen and lipid metabolism	SCIENCE			English	Article							PROLINE-RICH PROTEINS; CORNIFIED ENVELOPE; IDENTIFICATION; EVOLUTIONARY; EXPRESSION; RUMINANT; FAMILY; GENES; LIVER; SITE	Sheep (Ovis aries) are a major source of meat, milk, and fiber in the form of wool and represent a distinct class of animals that have a specialized digestive organ, the rumen, that carries out the initial digestion of plant material. We have developed and analyzed a high-quality reference sheep genome and transcriptomes from 40 different tissues. We identified highly expressed genes encoding keratin cross-linking proteins associated with rumen evolution. We also identified genes involved in lipid metabolism that had been amplified and/or had altered tissue expression patterns. This may be in response to changes in the barrier lipids of the skin, an interaction between lipid metabolism and wool synthesis, and an increased role of volatile fatty acids in ruminants compared with nonruminant animals.

Torovirus infections are generally asymptomatic, however, their presence may worsen disease consequences in concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens. Methods: A total of 872 diarrheic fecal samples from pigs of different ages were collected from 12 districts of Sichuan Province in the southwest of China. RT-PCR was done with PToV S gene specific primers to detect the presence of PToV positive samples. M gene specific primers were used with the PToV positive samples and the genes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the M gene nucleotide sequences from the 19 selected novel Sichuan strains and 21 PToV and BToV M gene sequences from GenBank. Results: A total of 331 (37.96%, 331/872) samples were found to be positive for PToV and the highest prevalence was observed in piglets aged from 1 to 3 weeks old. Through phylogenetic inference the 40 PToV M gene containing sequences were placed into two genotypes (I & II). The 19 novel Sichuan strains of genotype I showed strong correlations to two Korean gene sequences (GU-07-56-11 and GU-07-56-22).

In intercropping systems, short crops often grow under vegetative shade of tall crops. Soybean, one important legume, is often planted in intercropping. However, little is known about the mechanisms of shade inhibition effect on leaf size in soybean leaves at the transcriptome level. We analyzed the transcriptome of shaded soybean leaves via RNA-Seq technology. We found that transcription 1085 genes in mature leaves and 1847 genes in young leaves were significantly affected by shade. Gene ontology analyses showed that expression of genes enriched in polysaccharide metabolism was down-regulated, but genes enriched in auxin stimulus were up-regulated in mature leaves; and genes enriched in cell cycling, DNA-replication were down-regulated in young leaves. These results suggest that the inhibition of higher auxin content and shortage of sugar supply on cell division and cell expansion contribute to smaller and thinner leaf morphology, which highlights potential research targets such as auxin and sugar regulation on leaves for crop adaptation to shade in intercropping.

This paper considers fitting each class of data with a plane by a new model, which captures separability information between classes and can be solved by fast core set methods. Then training on the core sets of the fitting-planes yields a very sparse SVM classifier. The computing complexity of the proposed algorithm is up bounded by O(1/epsilon). Experimental results show that the new algorithm trains faster than both CVM and SVMperf averagely, and with comparable generalization performance.

Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide of glucose that has been associated with tolerance to different stress conditions, including salt and drought. Bioinformatic analysis of genes involved in trehalose biosynthesis and degradation in maize has not been reported to date. Through systematic analysis, 1 degradation-related and 36 trehalose biosynthesis-related genes were identified. The conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships among the deduced maize proteins and their homologs, isolated from other plant species such as Arabidopsis and rice, were revealed. Using a comprehensive approach, the intron/exon structures and expression patterns of all identified genes and their responses to salt stress, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid treatment were analyzed. Microarray data demonstrated that some of the genes show differential, organ-specific expression patterns in the 60 different developmental stages of maize. It was discovered that some of the key enzymes such as hexokinase, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase are encoded by multiple gene members with different expression patterns. The results highlight the complexity of trehalose metabolism and provide useful information for improving maize stress tolerance through genetic engineering.

Karyotypes of all the samples belong to 2A. The number of satellite chromosomes ranges from one to three pairs. The results indicate that karyotype diversity occurred in the populations of L. secalinus. Based on our results, it can be suggested that intra-specific karyotype variation of L. secalinus might be associated with current growing habitats and morphological differences.

In this study, we investigate miRNAs in an agronomically important common tobacco in China, named Honghua Dajinyuan (a drought-tolerant cultivar). Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles in mock-treat grown (CK) and 20 % polyethylene glycol-grown (PEG-grown) tobacco roots using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 656 unique miRNAs representing 53 miRNA families were identified in the two libraries, of which 286 unique miRNAs representing 162 microRNAs were differentially expressed. In addition, nine differentially expressed microRNAs selected from different expressed miRNA family with high abundance were subjected to further analysis and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). In addition, the expression pattern of these identified candidate conserved miRNA and target genes of three identified miRNA (nta-miR172b, nta-miR156i, and nta-miR160a) were also validated by Q-PCR. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggests that the putative target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in metabolic process and response to stimulus. In particular, 25 target genes are involved in regulating plant hormone signal transduction and metabolism, indicating that these association microRNAs may play important regulatory roles in responding to PEG resistance. Moreover, this study adds a significant number of novel miRNAs to the tobacco miRNome.

We used histological, microarray, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods to examine the developmental characteristics of fetal muscle at 70, 85, 100, 120, and 135 days of gestation in sheep. We show that day 100 is an important checkpoint for change in muscle transcriptome and histomorphology in fetal sheep and that the period of 85-100 days is the vital developmental stage for large-scale myoblast fusion. Furthermore, we identified the cis-regulatory motifs for E2F1 or MEF2A in a list of decreasingly or increasingly expressed genes between 85 and 100 days, respectively. Further analysis demonstrated that the mRNA and phosphorylated protein levels of E2F1 and MEF2A significantly declined with myogenic progression in vivo and in vitro. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that PI3K and FST, as targets of E2F1, may be involved in myoblast differentiation and fusion and that downregulation of MEF2A contributes to transition of myofiber types by differential regulation of the target genes involved at the stage of 85-100 days. We clarify for the first time the timing of myofiber proliferation and development during gestation in sheep, which would be beneficial to meat sheep production. Our findings present a repertoire of gene expression in muscle during large-scale myoblast fusion at transcriptome-wide level, which contributes to elucidate the regulatory network of myogenic differentiation.

A total of 52 primiparous sows (Large White) were randomly divided into four treatments (n=13) and received 6g/kg sodium butyrate (SB), fruit-milk (FM) flavor and fruit-milk-anise (FMA) flavor with pair feeding to the mothers receiving the control diet. The feeding trial lasted for 29 days, including 21 days of nursing and 8 days of post-weaning period, respectively. The nursing and weaning piglets received creep diets with the same flavor or SB supplement as their mother. The results showed that FMA flavor increased average daily feed intake (ADFI) of lactating sows (P<0.01), as well as improved litter weight gain (P=0.05) and ADFI (P<0.01) of nursing pigs among treatments. Indeed, greater ADFI and average daily gain of weaning piglets for the initial 8 days after weaning was observed in the FMA group compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). These findings indicated that adding FMA flavor was superior to SB for increasing feed intake of lactating sows and improving growth performance of piglets.

Pigs were randomly allocated to one of three dietary treatments (seven pens/treatment, five pigs/pen) according to initial body weight and sex (two gilts and three barrows). Treatments consisted of a corn soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.05 or 0.10% SPE. There was a significant linear improvement (P<0.05) in average daily gain, gain/feed, the apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and gross energy, blood lymphocyte percentage, immunoglobulin G concentration, fecal Escherichiacoli and Lactobacillus counts as well as fecal NH3 and H2S emissions associated with the inclusion of SPE in the diet. Average daily feed intake, red blood cells and white blood cells concentration were not significantly (0.05) affected by SPE supplementation in the diets. In conclusion, results indicate that dietary SPE supplementation can improve growth performance, digestibility and fecal microbiota, and decrease fecal gas emissions in growing pigs.

One hundred and eighty one-day-old healthy male avian broilers were divided into four groups of three replicates and 15 birds per replicate and fed with basal diet (control group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) (AFB(1) group), 0.4 mg/kg Se (+Se group), and 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg Se (AFB(1)+Se group), respectively. The ileac T-cell subsets were determined by the methods of flow cytometry (FCM), and the mRNA contents of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with those in control group, the percentages of CD3 (+), CD3 +CD4 (+), CD3 +CD8 (+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and LPLs, the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio of IELs, and the mRNA contents of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were decreased in AFB(1) group. However, compared with those in AFB(1) group, these parameters of AFB(1)+Se group were increased to be close to those in control group. It was concluded that 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) could reduce the cellular immune function of the ileum mucosa, but 0.4 mg/kg supplemented dietary selenium showed protective effects on AFB(1)-induced immunologic injury.

A total of 240 1-day-old avian broilers were equally allocated into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as the control diet or the same diet supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg NiCl2 for 42 days. The mRNA expression and protein levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha/LITAF, IFN-gamma, and IgA, IgG, and IgM contents were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 300-, 600-, and 900-mg/kg NiCl2 groups when compared with those of the control group, which was consistent with the reduction of T-cell subset percentages and IgA(+) B cell numbers in the 300-, 600-, and 900-mg/kg NiCl2 groups. The abovementioned results showed that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused damage on splenocytes and splenic immune function. The results of the present study provided new experimental evidences for further study on the effect mechanism of NiCl2 on splenic immunity.

The irrigated Millville, UT, USA (41 degrees 4124N, 111 degrees 4948W) field site was characterized by a semiarid climate and elevation over 1300m. The cultivarxmixture interaction was significant for all traits but flag leaf height, and contained a substantial crossover component among the cultivars. Differences among cultivar means were significant for all traits in both the monoculture and mixture settings. Yet, concordance for high cultivar performance in both monoculture and mixture was low. Thus, the strong underlying cultivarxmixture interaction found in this study complicates the identification of best cultivars in both settings. Yet, for each trait cultivars were identified that possessed statistically high phenotypic performance under the monoculture and mixed sward conditions. Thus, despite the substantial cultivarxenvironment effect, it should be possible to develop orchardgrass cultivars with improved agronomic performance under both management conditions.

The concentrations of enrofloxacin in saturated solvent were analyzed by UV spectrometry. The experimental solubility data for pure solvents decreases in the order acetonitrile > acetic ether >2-propanol > ethanol > water. The experimental solubility data was correlated by the modified Apelblat equation, the ideal solution equation, and the Clarke-Glew equation. The results show that the mole fraction solubility of enrofloxacin in pure solvents increased with increasing temperature; the Clarke-Glew two parameters equation (Clarke-Glew 2 equation) can provide a more accurate mathematical model than the modified Apelblat equation, the ideal solution equation, and the Clarke-Glew three parameters equation (Clarke-Glew 3 equation). In addition, the discussion of Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy for enrofloxacin in different solvents indicated that the dissolution process of enrofloxacin was endothermic and entropy-driven.

The stability of color, flavor and odor demonstrated the quality of fresh FVJ decreased when they were remained more than 30min in room temperature. The correlation coefficient R2 and P-value indicated that there was significant (P<0.05) correlation between stability of the FVJ and the remaining time. The correlation between the sensory quality of FVJ and CIELAB hues showed that there were significant (P<0.05) correlations between the color, flavor or odor and CIELAB hues or part of CIELAB hues. These significant correlations suggested that the CIELAB hues or part of them could be used to replace the sensory analysis of FVJ. All these correlations demonstrated a potential application of CIELAB hues in quality monitoring and control of the homemade or industrial produced FVJ. Practical Application The results of this work have practical uses in quality and safety analysis of homemade or industrial produced fresh FVJ. In addition, an instrumental method for color determination, using CIELAB color space, is suggested for the quality and safety monitoring of the fresh FVJ's production.

In this study, molecular and phylogenetic characterization of D. immitis were performed based on complete ND1 and 16S rDNA gene sequences, which provided the foundation for more advanced molecular diagnosis, prevention, and control of heartworm diseases. The mutation rate and evolutionary divergence in adult heartworm samples from seven dogs in western China were analyzed to obtain information on genetic diversity and variability. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using both maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayes methods based on the complete gene sequences. The results suggest that D. immitis formed an independent monophyletic group in which the 16S rDNA gene has mutated more rapidly than has ND1.

Low viability and motility of post-thawed boar spermatozoa are highly associated with apoptosis during cryopreservation. Although glycerol is widely used a cryoprotectant (CPA) for boar spermatozoa cryopreservation, the mechanism and relationship between glycerol and apoptosis-related gene expression needs to be clarified. In this study, we treated boar spermatozoa with different concentrations of glycerol in lactose egg yolk (LEY) extender to evaluate the apoptosis-related gene expression and protease activities of caspases. These results show that: (1) low concentrations of glycerol (2% and 3%) were more suitable for boar spermatozoa cryopreservation; (2) apoptosis-related genes involved in intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor apoptotic signaling pathways were widely expressed in different concentrations of glycerol treated boar spermatozoa; (3) there was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.840, P = 0.037) between the percentage of Annexin V+/PI+ staining spermatozoa and caspase-6/9 protease activity. In conclusion, 2% and 3% glycerol have the best anti-apoptotic effects, and the expression of Fas/FasL and Bcl-2/Bax have a strong correlation with spermatozoa parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Jian). Fish were fed with six different experimental diets containing graded levels of choline at 165 (choline-deficient control), 310, 607, 896, 1167 and 1820 mg kg(-1) diet for 65 days. At the end of the feeding trail, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila and mortalities were recorded over 17 days. Dietary choline significantly decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in spleen and head kidney. However, anti-superoxide anion and anti-hydroxyl radical activities in spleen and head kidney also decreased. Interestingly, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) in spleen, GPx activity in head kidney, and glutathione contents in spleen and head kidney were decreased with increase of dietary choline levels up to a certain point, whereas, activities of SOD, GST and GR in head kidney showed no significantly differences among groups. Similarly, expression levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, CAT, GPx1a, GPx1b and GR gene in spleen and head kidney were significantly lower in group with choline level of 607 mg kg(-1) diet than those in the choline-deficient group. The relative gene expressions of Nrf2 in head kidney and Keap1a in spleen and head kidney were decreased with increasing of dietary choline up to a certain point. However, the relative gene expression of Nrf2 in spleen were not significantly affected by dietary choline. In conclusion, dietary choline decreased the oxidant damage and regulated the antioxidant system in immune organs of juvenile Jian carp. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus macaque (M. fascicularis, CE), both of which belong to the fascicularis group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (M. thibetana; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the sinica group. On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.

Housing system influences abundance of Pax3 and Pax7 in postnatal chicken skeletal muscles	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Pax3 and Pax7; skeletal muscle; expression; chicken; housing system	MYOGENIC SATELLITE CELLS; MESSENGER-RNA ABUNDANCE; TESTOSTERONE; HYPERTROPHY; EXERCISE; MYOD; LIMB; EXPRESSION; LINEAGE; TISSUES	Paired box (Pax) proteins 3 and 7 are associated with activation of muscle satellite cells and play a major role in hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth in postnatal skeletal muscle fibers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of housing system on abundance of Pax3 and Pax7 in postnatal chicken skeletal muscles. At 42 d, 1,200 chickens with similar BW were randomly assigned to cage, pen, and free-range group. The mRNA abundance was measured in pectoralis major and thigh muscle at d 56, 70, and 84, and the protein expression was quantified at d 84. Increases in mRNA abundance of PAX3 and PAX7 with age were less pronounced in caged system chickens than in pen and free-range chickens from d 56 to 84, and free-range chickens showed a more pronounced increase in gene expression with age compared with penned chickens. At d 84, quantities of PAX3 and PAX7 mRNA and protein were highest in both pectoralis major and thigh muscle of chickens raised in the free-range group, lowest in penned chickens, and intermediate in caged chickens (P < 0.05). These data indicate that housing system may influence muscle fiber muscle accretion by coordinating the expression of Pax3 and Pax7 in adult chicken skeletal muscles.	[Yin, H. D.; Li, D.

A total of 288 female Huoyan geese (28-wk-old) were divided into 4 experimental diets containing FSM at 0 (control), 50, 100, and 150 g/kg. There were 9 replicate pens per treatment with 8 geese per replicate pen. The total number of eggs produced (linear, P=0.04) and feed efficiency were greater (linear, P=0.04) in FSM containing groups than control diet. The inclusion of FSM in the geese diet linearly decreased the concentration of palmitic acid (linear, P=0.02) and saturated fatty acid (linear, P=0.05) in egg yolk, whereas the contents of C18:3n-3 (linear, P=0.04), C22:6n-3 (quadratic, P=0.05), total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; linear, P=0.01), and total n-3 PUFA (linear, P=0.01) were enhanced as the FSM levels increased. The arachidonic acid concentration (P=0.05) and n-6/n-3 ratio (P < 0.05) also linearly decreased as the FSM inclusion level increased. At the end of the 35-d breeder experiment, all hatching eggs laid in 6 consecutive days in each group were collected and incubated. In 1-d-old goslings, the inclusion of FSM linearly decreased C16:0 (P=0.03) and total saturated fatty acid (P=0.04) concentrations in thigh meat. The contents of C18:3n-3 increased (linear, P=0.01), whereas C20:4n-6 decreased (linear, P=0.01) in FSM supplemented groups compared to control group. The concentrations of PUFA and total n-3 PUFA were linearly increased (P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively) and the n-6/n-3 ratio decreased linearly (P=0.02) as the FSM levels increased. In conclusion, dietary addition of FSM up to 150 g/kg levels improved the egg production without any effect on egg quality and breeding performance. Moreover, feeding FSM to geese can increase the n-3 fatty acids concentration in egg yolk and deposition in the offspring in a dose-dependent manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There are three subfamilies of defensins in primates: alpha, beta and theta-defensins. alpha-defensins are most present in neutrophils and Paneth cells; beta-defensins are involved in protecting the skin and the mucous membranes of the respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts; and theta-defensins are physically distinguished as the only known fully-cyclic peptides of animal origin, which are first isolated from rhesus macaques. All three kinds of defensins have six conserved cysteines, three intramolecular disulfide bonds, a net positive charge, and beta-sheet regions. alpha and theta-defensins are closely related, comparative amino acid sequences showed that the difference between them is that theta-defensins have an additional stop codon limits the initial defensin domain peptides to 12 residues. Humans, chimpanzees and gorillas do not produce theta-defensin peptides due to a premature stop codon present in the signal sequence of all theta-defensin pseudogenes. By using comprehensive computational searches, here we report the discovery of complete repertoires of the alpha and theta-defensin gene family in ten primate species. Consistent with previous studies, our phylogenetic analyses showed all primate theta-defensins evident formed one distinct clusters evolved from alpha-defensins. beta-defensins are ancestors of both alpha and theta-defensins. Human has two copies of DEFA1 and DEFT1P, and two extra DEFA3 and DEFA10P genes compared with gorilla. As different primates inhabit in quite different ecological niches, the production of species-specific alpha and theta-defensins and these highly evolved theta-defensins in old world monkeys would presumably allow them to better respond to the specific microbial challenges that they face.

One specimen was found to be parasitized by Cryptosporidium via microscopy, and the oocysts were measured to have an average size of 7.03 x 5.50 mu m (n > 50). The isolate was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the partial 18S rRNA, COWP, and A135 genes, and was confirmed to be Cryptosporidium andersoni with minor nucleotide differences. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis indicated that the subtype of the camel-derived C. andersoni isolate was A4, A4, A4, and A1 at the four minisatellite loci (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS16, respectively). Therefore, this isolate belongs to the most common MLST subtype reported in cattle in China and is distinct from two other known camel C. andersoni MLST subtypes (A6, A4, A2, A1 and A6, A5, A2, A1). Animal transmission experiments demonstrated that the C. andersoni isolate was not infectious to immunosuppressed or immunocompetent Kun-ming mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, and hamsters but was biologically similar to most bovine C. andersoni isolates characterized so far. Therefore, transmission of this camel-derived C. andersoni isolate is very likely to occur between camels and bovine.

Their structural characterizations were determined, and antioxidant activities were investigated. The results of FT-IR demonstrated that the characteristic absorption bands exhibited slight difference among four polysaccharides. HLPC analysis presented that the molecular weights were calculated to be 394, 297, 462, and 429 kDa for COP-H, COP-U, COP-E, and COP-A, respectively. GC-MS analysis showed that the monosaccharide compositions were identical to four polysaccharides, while the molecular ratios exhibited significant difference. Four polysaccharides showed antioxidant activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Among four polysaccharides, COP-E showed a higher scavenging activity on DPPH, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide anion radical. These findings suggest camellia seed cake polysaccharides have potential as a natural antioxidant.

In this paper, we report that the mutation of a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase reduces BR sensitivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A spontaneous dwarf mutant, designated d1352, was identified from the maintainer line 1352. The plant height and grain length of d1352 decreased by 66 and 36 %, respectively, compared with those of wild-type (WT) rice. Anatomical investigation revealed that all mutant internodes were sharply shortened when compared with their WT counterparts, and the relative ratio of each internode suggested a d6-type mutation of d1352. Analysis using exogenous gibberellin (GA) and BR treatment showed that d1352 had normal sensitivity to GA but had reduced sensitivity to BR treatment compared with the WT. The mutant gene d1352 was located in a 98-kb region on rice chromosome 3 by employing a map-based cloning strategy. Sequencing comparison revealed a 24-bp insertion in the coding region of a putative U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase (LOC_Os03g13010), which led to the insertion of eight amino acids in the conserved domain of U-box. Linkage analysis in all populations showed that the insertion was co-segregated with the dwarf phenotype, indicating that the insertion of LOC_Os03g13010 was responsible for the mutant phenotype. The transcription levels of several BR-related genes were also significantly altered in d1352. In conclusion, D1352 has an important function in the BR signaling pathway.

In our study, Populus cathayana as a model species is employed to detect the sex-specific responses in growth, photosynthetic nitrogen (N) use efficiency (PNUE), carbon (C) and N partitioning when exposed to 0, 7.5 and 15 g N m(-2) year(-1) on the basis of local N deposition level. Our results showed that females had higher responses in photosynthesis and growth than males when exposed to N deposition, and also exhibited higher PNUE than males when exposed to high level of N deposition, suggesting that plasticity in the females may enhance the capacity of young seedlings to acquire resources. Moreover, we found that females mainly allocated increased N to soluble proteins and detergent-soluble proteins, but not to cell-wall proteins, while males maintained original partitioning pattern of N and also accumulated excessive N in the form of free amino acids. Females also allocated more fraction of leaf N to carboxylation (P (C)), bioenergetics (P (B)), and then more fraction of leaf N to all components of photosynthetic machinery (P (T)) than males under high level of N deposition. Such sex-specific N allocation strategy may correlate with sex-related PNUE. These results indicated that there is a higher critical N demand in females, and females could use N nutrient more efficiently than males under high N deposition. We also found that higher shift from starch to soluble sugars, such as sucrose, occurred in females than in males under N enrichment. By contrast, excessive accumulation of starch and non-structural carbohydrate in females relative to males was observed under control conditions, which might inhibit female photosynthesis rate. Accordingly, we suggested that the different leaf C and N partitioning patterns could explain the sex-specific responses in growth. Therefore, females may obtain advantageous position in the process of intraspecific competition when exposed to high level of N deposition because they have higher light capture (total leaf area) ability and utilization efficiency (PNUE) than the males that confer the ability for fast growth and thus are likely to be more responsive to N enrichment. Our results suggested that it could be important to look at the stronger growth response of the females over the males under N enrichment at both the leaf and the plant scale.

The test diets (28 % CP) contained fish meal, casein and gelatin as sources of intact protein, supplemented with crystalline amino acids. Weight gain (WG), feed intake and feed efficiency were significantly improved with increasing levels of lysine up to 12.9 g kg(-1) diet and thereafter declined (P < 0.05). Quadratic regression analysis of WG at 95 % maximum response indicated lysine requirement was 10.9 g kg(-1) diet. Activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, Na+, K+-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase in intestine, creatine kinase activity in proximal and mid-intestine responded similar to WG (P < 0.05). In addition, lipid and protein oxidation decreased with increasing levels of lysine up to certain values and increased thereafter (P < 0.05); the anti-hydroxyl radical capacity, dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities and glutathione content were increased with increasing dietary lysine levels up to certain values in the detected tissues, except for hepatopancreatic GST. Requirement estimated on the basis of malondialdehyde content in intestine and hepatopancreas was 10.6 and 9.53 g lysine kg(-1) diet, respectively.

The results showed that malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in serum, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle were significantly decreased with increasing dietary thiamin levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, the anti-superoxide anion capacity and anti-hydroxyl radical capacity in serum, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle were the lowest in fish fed the thiamin-unsupplemented diet. Meanwhile, the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase, and the contents of glutathione in serum, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle were enhanced with increasing dietary thiamin levels (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, hepatopancreas and intestine followed a similar trend as CAT (P < 0.05). However, SOD activity in muscle was not affected by dietary thiamin level (P > 0.05). The results indicated that thiamin could improve antioxidant defence and inhibit lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation of juvenile Jian carp.

The recombinant duck FST protein was injected into hatching eggs and was also added to the medium of duck myoblast to study its role on duck embryonic muscle development and gene expressions. Duck embryo weight increased 3.49% (p>0.05) in FST treatment group as compared with control group, but minor effects were found on leg or breast muscle weights of ducklings at 2days post-hatching (p>0.05). Relative expression of Pax7 was upregulated in both leg and breast muscle tissues (p<0.05), while MyoD was only upregulated in leg muscle (p<0.05), and Myf5 was only upregulated in breast muscle (p<0.05). Relative expression of myostatin was downregulated in both muscle tissues researched (p<0.05). In vitro studies also showed some maker genes relevant to protein synthesis and degradation, cells' proliferation and differentiation had significant changes in myoblasts after treated with FST. These results suggested that in ovo feeding of recombinant FST protein to duck hatching eggs had an effect on duck embryo development but have less roles on the duck embryonic muscle development.

Additionally, a trench control experiment was conducted to distinguish the effects of roots on MBC and community structure. The results showed that the number and abundance of PLFAs and MBC were higher in MP than that in PP. The soil TOC, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN and litterfall mass were significantly higher in surface soil (0-10 cm) in MP; whereas the C/N ratios of soil and litterfall were significantly lower by 37.6% and 78.5%, respectively, in MP than in PR MBC at the surface soil (0-10 cm) was significantly higher by 9.0% in MP than in PP. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that soil microbial community structure differed between the two plantations, and between the trenched and untrenched plots. Redundancy analysis (RDA) also revealed that C/N ratios of soil and litterfall, TOC, NH4-N, litterfall mass and NO3-N were key factors affecting the soil microbial community regardless of plantation types. Our study suggests that mixing N-fixing species into E. urophylla plantations can enhance soil C sequestration by increasing TOC and MBC, as well as through increased soil microbial community diversity and abundance. Findings from this study could assist sustainable management of Eucalyptus plantations for biomass carbon production, soil C sequestration and retention. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To examine whether the admixture of alder (Alnus formosana) litter could improve the decomposition of eucalyptus litter, a field litterbag experiment was conducted on a new eucalyptus plantation in southwestern China. We investigated the mass loss rate from an alder and eucalyptus foliar litter mixture every half month from May 1st to October 1st, 2009. Five mixture proportions were examined: pure eucalyptus litter (10E), 70% eucalyptus litter mixed with 30% alder litter (7E:3A), 50% eucalyptus litter mixed with 50% alder litter (5E:5A), 30% eucalyptus litter mixed with 70% alder litter (3E:7A) and pure alder litter (10A). Over 169 days of decomposition, approximately 79.22%, 70.23%, 62.82%, 49.95% and 48.59% of mass was lost from the 3E:7A, 10A, 5E:5A, 7E:3A and 10E litter mixtures, respectively. Compared with pure eucalyptus litter, 3E:7A, 10A, 5E:5A and 7E:3A litter mixtures increased 63.04%, 44.54%, 29.29% and 2.80% of accumulated mass loss. The admixture of alder litter can significantly improve eucalyptus litter decomposition, and a small proportion of eucalyptus litter (3E:7A) may also promote alder litter decomposition. As the decomposition proceeded, the litter mixture displayed exactly additive effects in the initial stage and positive non-additive effects in the middle stage. However, negative non-additive effects were detected in the 7E:3A litter mixture in the later stage, although positive non-additive effects were maintained throughout decomposition in the 5E:5A and 3E:7A mixtures. Compared to pure eucalyptus litter, mixtures containing alder litter presented increased microbial biomass carbon and bacterial DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) bands, but the litter mixture decomposition relied more on microbial biomass than on microbial diversity. The results imply that alder litter can improve material cycling on eucalyptus plantations and that alder could be a potential species for mixed planting with eucalyptus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we cloned and sequenced 1,397 bp coding region of MITF gene and a 588 bp fragment of TYR exon 1 for polymorphism analysis among 157 domestic geese showing three types of plumage colour. We detected a total of three SNPs (c.280T>C, c.345G>A, and c.369G>A) in TYR and six haplotypes (H1-H6). Among them, haplotypes H1, H2, H3, and H5 were significantly associated with white plumage trait of Zhedong White Geese. However, only diplotype H1H1 and H3H5 were significantly associated with white plumage trait of Zhedong White Geese (p<0.01). We only detected one SNP (c.1109C>T) for MITF gene and found that genotype CT and TT were significantly associated with white plumage trait of Zhedong White Geese. Briefly, our study suggested an association between polymorphisms of TYR and MITF genes and the plumage colour trait in domestic geese.

TLR4 and TLR7 have been proven to be highly expressed in chicken's spleen. Thus, this study was to evaluate the TLR4 and TLR7 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels in the spleen of broilers fed diets supplemented with nickel chloride (NiCl2) using the methods of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Two hundred forty-one-day-old avian broilers were equally divided into 4 groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. Results showed that TLR4 and TLR7 mRNA expression levels in the spleen were lower (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg groups than those in the control group. It was concluded that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg could lower TLR4 and TLR7 mRNA expression levels in the spleen of broilers, implying that NiCl2 could impair the innate and adaptive immunity in spleen by injuring immunocytes and/or decreasing the content of cytokines through TLRs.

This experiment was conducted to evaluate multiple low-P tolerance criteria and identify the suitable maize germplasm for our future low-P tolerance breeding. A total of 456 diverse maize inbreds were evaluated for low-P tolerance at seedling stage using four shoot-related traits and six root-related traits measured under applied phosphorus (AP) and non-applied phosphorus (NAP) conditions. Analysis of variance revealed significant genetic variation among genotypes for all tested traits. Medium-to-high heritability estimates were obtained for most traits. Total dry weight (DW) was highly inheritable while the widely used root/shoot ratio had only an intermediate level of heritability. Based on the synthetic index (SI), the tested inbreds were classified into three groups representing low, moderate and high tolerance to low-P stress. Regression model built based on selection criteria for low-P tolerance explained 67.8 and 76.8 % of variation for DW under NAP and AP conditions, respectively. Using low-P tolerance index for DW and SI as selection criteria, 23 and 109 maize inbreds were identified as germplasm resources that were extremely tolerant and sensitive to low-P stress, respectively, which could be further used for genetic improvement of low-P tolerance.

RAIN-FOREST TREES; FIELD PERFORMANCE; DROUGHT STRESS; WATER-UPTAKE; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; PLANT-ROOTS; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; PINUS-HALEPENSIS; USE EFFICIENCIES	A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of nitrogen content [N-1 (no fertilizer), N-2 (0.15 g.kg(-1)), and N-3 (0.3 g.kg(-1))] on the growth and the hydraulic characteristics of peach seedlings under different soil moisture conditions (W-1, W-2 and W-3, in which the soil water content was 45% to 55%, 60% to 70%, and 75% to 80% of the field water capacity, respectively) by using a specialized high pressure flow meter with a root chamber and a coupling, which was connected to plant organs. Leaf area and leaf hydraulic conductivity (K-L) increased significantly in the seedlings because of increased soil moisture and N content. K-L increased with leaf area. A linear correlation was documented between K-L and leaf area. K-L was higher in the morning and began to decline sharply after 16:00, at which K-L declined after an initial increase. Soil moisture and N content enhanced shoot (K-s) and root (K-r) hydraulic conductivities, thereby improving the low soil moisture condition to a large extent. Ks and Kr of the seedlings were reduced by 32% and 27% respectively in N-1, and by 14.7% and 9.4%, respectively in N-2, and both in W-1, compared with the control treatment. N-3 had no significant effect on Ks and Kr under similar conditions. Linear negative correlations were observed between Kr and the excised root diameter as well as between Ks and the shoot stem diameter. The shoot-to-root ratio increased with increase in N content. The shoot-to-root ratio in N-3 was increased by 14.37%, compared with N-1 in W-1 as well as by 12% and 4.39% in W-2 and W-3, respectively. Knowledge of the effects of soil moisture and N fertilizer on hydraulic characteristics and growth is important. Our results provide basic guidelines for the implementation of water-saving irrigation and fertilization management of nursery stock.

Oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests revealed differences in threshold sensitivity to insulin and glucose clearance rate between the lines. Results from real-time PCR showed greater pancreatic mRNA expression of four glucose regulatory genes (preproinsulin, PPI; preproglucagon, PPG; glucose transporter 2, GLUT2; and pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1, Pdx1) in LWS chickens, than HWS chickens. Histological analysis of the pancreas revealed that HWS chickens have larger pancreatic islets, less pancreatic islet mass, and more pancreatic inflammation than LWS chickens, all of which presumably contribute to impaired glucose metabolism.

Phytoremediation is a promising strategy for extracting excess P from manure impacted soil. P uptake characteristics of a mining ecotype (ME) and a non-mining ecotype (NME) of Polygonum hydropiper were investigated in this study by adopting soil culture containing various concentrations of swine manure (0-200 g swine manure kg(-1) soil). A peak value in the biomass of P. hydropiper was determined in 100 g kg(-1) soil. Significant increase of P content in tissues of two ecotypes was noticed with an increase in swine manure concentration. Maximum P accumulation in shoots and roots was observed at the concentration of 100 g kg(-1) soil, however, the ME accumulated more P as compared to the NME. The ME showed a lower plant effective number and a higher P extraction ratio compared to the NME. Both acid phosphatase and phytase activities of P. hydropiper were obviously enhanced under swine manure impacted soil compared with control, while those of ME higher than the NMEs. Therefore, the two ecotypes of P. hydropiper can accumulate P from soil amended with swine manure and establishes the foundation for phytoremediation. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(Asparagales: Alliaceae) against 6th instars and adults of the darkling beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), one of the main pests of materials and products of Juncus effuses L. (Poales: Juncaceae) during the storage period, were assayed, and chemical ingredients were analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in this study. While the major ingredients found in C. limonum and C. cassia were limonene and (E)cinnamaldehyde, the main constituents of L. cubea were D-limonene, (E)-3,7-dimethyl-, 2,6-octadienal, (Z)-3,7-dimethyl-,2,6-octadienal, and diallyl disulphide (18.20%), while the main constituents of and A. sativum were di-2-propenyl trisulfide and di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide. The fumigation activities of A. sativum and C. limonum on A. diaperinus adults were better than those of the other two essential oilss. The toxicities of A. sativum and C. limonum were almost equitoxic at 96 hr after treatment. Essential oils from Allium sativum and L. cubeba also showed good contact activities from 24 hr to 48 hr, and toxicities were almost equitoxic 48 hr post-treatment. The repellent activities of A. sativum and L. cubeba oils on 6th instars were also observed, showing repellence indexes of 90.4% and 88.9% at 12 hr after treatment, respectively. The effects of A. sativum on AChE activity of 6th instars of A. diaperinus were strongest compared to the other essential oils, followed by C. limonum, L. cubeba, and C. cassia. These results suggest that the essential oils of C. limonum and A. sativum could serve as effective control agents of A. diaperinus.

The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that LBW alters the response of pigs to high-fat (HF) diet-induced changes in meat quality and skeletal muscle proteome. Normal-birth weight (NBW) and LBW piglets were fed a control diet or a HF diet from weaning to slaughter at 110kg body weight. Most of the meat quality traits were influenced by LBW. Meat quality analysis revealed that LBW piglets had a greater ability to deposit intramuscular lipids than their heavier littermates when fed a HF diet. Increased shear force, lower pH(45) (min) and drip loss were observed in the skeletal muscle of LBW piglets compared with NBW piglets. Proteomic analysis revealed forty-six differentially expressed proteins in the skeletal muscle of LBW and NBW piglets fed the control diet or HF diet. These proteins play a central role in cell structure and motility, glucose and energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cellular apoptosis, as well as stress response. Of particular interest is the finding that LBW altered the response to HF diet-induced changes in the expression of proteins related to stress response (heat shock protein) and glucose and energy metabolism (pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase and triosephosphate isomerase). Taken together, our findings revealed that the HF diet-induced changes in the expression of glucose and energy metabolism-related proteins varied between NBW and LBW piglets, which provides a possible mechanism to explain higher intramuscular fat store in LBW pigs when fed a HF diet.

Eighty virgin female Sprague Dawley rats were fed one of four diets-(1) control diet (C group), (2) high fat + high fiber diet (HF group), (3) high-fat + 5% sodium butyrate diet (SB group), and (4) HF diet + alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHC group)-intraperitoneally on days 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 of gestation. SB and dietary fiber had similar effects on improving fetal number and reducing the abortion rate; however, the anti-oxidant capacity of maternal serum, placenta, and fetus was superior in the HF group than in the SB group. In comparison, CHC injection decreased reproductive performance and antioxidant defense. Both dietary fiber (DF) and SB supplementation had a major but different effect on the expression of anti-oxidant related genes and nutrient transporters genes. In summary, our data indicate that SB and DF showed similar effect on reproductive performance, but SB cannot completely replace the DF towards with respect to redox regulation in high-fat diet; and SB might influence offspring metabolism and health differently to DF.

This study aimed to investigative the mRNA expression of cathelicidins and protein localization of cathelicidin-2 in the goat mammary gland and its secretion into milk. The mRNA expression of cathelicidins was examined in different regions of the mammary gland by reverse transcription PCR. A cathelicidin-2 antibody was raised in rabbits by immunization with a synthetic cathelicidin-2 peptide consisting of 17 amino acids. The protein localization of cathelicidin-2 was investigated in the mammary gland by immunohistochemistry. Skim milk was collected before (0 h) and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after the intramammary infusion of lipopolysaccharide and saline, and the concentration of cathelicidin-2 was examined by an enzyme immunoassay. The mRNAs of cathelicidin-1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 were expressed in both the teat and deep region of the mammary gland from healthy and mastitic goats. Immunoreactive cathelicidin-2 was not localized in the epithelial cells of the teat skin, teat cistern, or mammary alveoli, whereas it was localized in polymorphonuclear cells in the mammary gland and those collected from the blood and milk. Cathelicidin-2 was detected in skim milk by Western blotting. The concentration of cathelicidin-2 in milk increased 4 h after the intramammary infusion of lipopolysaccharide. These results suggest that cathelicidin-2 is expressed in polymorphonuclear cells and is secreted into milk in goat. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cheng, DQ; Li, Y; Huang, JF				Cheng, Dong-Qiang; Li, Ying; Huang, Jing-Fei			Molecular Evolution of the Primate alpha-/theta-Defensin Multigene Family	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN INNATE IMMUNITY; ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES; FUNCTIONAL DIVERGENCE; THETA-DEFENSINS; BETA-DEFENSINS; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; HOST-DEFENSE; PANETH CELLS; GENE FAMILY	The primate alpha-/theta-defensin multigene family encodes versatile endogenous cationic and amphipathic peptides that have broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activity. Although previous studies have reported that alpha-/theta-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are under birth-and-death evolution with frequent duplication and rapid evolution, the phylogenetic relationships of the primate DEFA/DEFT genes; the genetic bases for the existence of similar antimicrobial spectra among closely related species; and the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic theta-defensins in Old World monkeys and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require further investigation. In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid alpha-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8. The prosegment of theta-defensin is detected with adaptive changes coevolving with the new protein fold of mature peptide, coincident with the importance of the prosegment for the correct folding of the mature peptide. Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process.

However, little information is available on how litter nitrogen (N) dynamics vary with snowpack variations created by tree crown canopies in alpine forests. Therefore, to understand the effects of seasonal snowpack on litter N dynamics during different critical stages, litterbags with fir (Abies faxoniana), birch (Betula albosinensis), larch (Larix mastersiana) and cypress (Sabina saltuaria) foliar litter were placed on the forest floor beneath snowpack created by forest gaps in the eastern Tibet Plateau. The litterbags were sampled at the onset of freezing, deep freezing, thawing and growing stages from October 2010 to October 2012. Mass loss and N concentrations in litter were measured. Over two years of decomposition, N release occurred mainly during the first year, especially during the first winter. Litter N release rates (both in the first year and during the entire two-year decomposition study period) were higher in the center of canopy gaps than under closed canopy, regardless of species. Litter N release rates in winter were also highest in the center of canopy gaps and lowest under closed canopy, regardless of species, however the reverse was found during the growing season. Compared with broadleaf litter, needle litter N release comparisons of gap center to closed canopy showed much stronger responses to the changes in snow cover in winter and availability of sunshine during the growing season. As the decomposition proceeded, decomposing litter quality, microbial biomass and environmental temperature were important factors related to litter N release rate. This suggests that if winter warm with climate change, reduced snow cover in winter might slow down litter N release in alpine forest.

Reference genes, which serve as endogenous controls ensure that the results are accurate and reproducible, are vital for data normalization. To bolster the literature on reference gene selection in maize, ten candidate reference genes, including eight traditionally used internal control genes and two potential candidate genes from our microarray datasets, were evaluated for expression level in maize across abiotic stresses (cold, heat, salinity, and PEG), phytohormone treatments (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene, and gibberellins), and different tissue types. Three analytical software packages, geNorm, NormFinder, and Bestkeeper, were used to assess the stability of reference gene expression. The results revealed that elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1 alpha), tubulin beta (beta-TUB), cyclophilin (CYP), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (EIF4A) were the most reliable reference genes for overall gene expression normalization in maize, while GRP (Glycine-rich RNA-binding protein), GLU1(beta-glucosidase), and UBQ9 (ubiquitin 9) were the least stable and most unsuitable genes. In addition, the suitability of EF1 alpha, beta-TUB, and their combination as reference genes was confirmed by validating the expression of WRKY50 in various samples. The current study indicates the appropriate reference genes for the urgent requirement of gene expression normalization in maize across certain abiotic stresses, hormones, and tissue types.

High efficiency conversion of bamboo was achieved under mild reaction conditions. Liquefaction temperature and time interacted to affect the liquefaction reaction. Fourier transform infrared analyzes of the residues indicated that hemicellulose and lignin could easily undergo recondensation. Thermogravimetric analysis results showed that residues obtained at higher temperature/longer reaction time displayed a superior thermal stability as compared to those obtained from mild conditions. Moreover, significant differences were observed in the morphology and structures of residues from different liquefaction conditions according to scanning electron microscopy images.

Phylogenic analyses based on the chloroplast intergenic spacer psbA-trnH confirmed that the A genome diploid might be the maternal donor of species of the genus Avena. Two haplotypes of the Acc1 gene region were obtained from the AB genome tetraploids, indicating an allopolyploid origin for the tetraploid species. Among the AB genome species, both gene trees revealed differences between Avena agadiriana and the other species, suggesting that an A(S) genome diploid might be the A genome donor and the other genome diploid donor might be the A(c) genome diploid Avena canariensis or the A(d) genome diploid Avena damascena. Three haplotypes of the Acc1 gene have been detected among the ACD genome hexaploid species. The haplotype that seems to represent the D genome clustered with the tetraploid species Avena murphyi and Avena maroccana, which supported the CD genomic designation instead of AC for A. murphyi and A. maroccana.

To better understand the molecular basis for this success, we performed mRNA and small RNA transcriptome analyses in nascent allohexaploid wheat and its following generations, their progenitors, and the natural allohexaploid cultivar Chinese Spring, with the assistance of recently published A and D genome sequences. We found that nonadditively expressed protein-coding genes were rare but relevant to growth vigor. Moreover, a high proportion of protein-coding genes exhibited parental expression level dominance, with genes for which the total homoeolog expression level in the progeny was similar to that in T. turgidum potentially participating in development and those with similar expression to that in Ae. tauschii involved in adaptation. In addition, a high proportion of microRNAs showed nonadditive expression upon polyploidization, potentially leading to differential expression of important target genes. Furthermore, increased small interfering RNA density was observed for transposable element-associated D homoeologs in the allohexaploid progeny, which may account for biased repression of D homoeologs. Together, our data provide insights into small RNA-mediated dynamic homoeolog regulation mechanisms that may contribute to heterosis in nascent hexaploid wheat.

However, the involvement of PYY in the feeding behavior of teleosts has not been well understood. In this study, we employed molecular, real-time quantitative PCR and physiological studies to characterize the structure, distribution, and appetite regulatory effects of PYY in Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti). A very high conservation in PYY sequences was found in teleosts. PYY is widely expressed, with the highest levels of expression in telencephalon, medulla oblongata, pituitary and hypothalamus of S. prenanti. The PYY mRNA expression in the hypothalamus was highly elevated after a meal, suggesting a satiety signal role for PYY in S. prenanti. In addition, PYY gene expression in the hypothalamus was decreased after fasting and increased sharply after refeeding, which suggested that PYY might be involved in the central regulation of appetite in S. prenanti. Overall, our result provides basis for further investigation into the regulation of feeding in S. prenanti. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we report a 39.4 Mb draft genome sequence of U. virens that encodes 8,426 predicted genes. The genome has similar to 25% repetitive sequences that have been affected by repeat-induced point mutations. Evolutionarily, U. virens is close to the entomopathogenic Metarhizium spp., suggesting potential host jumping across kingdoms. U. virens possesses reduced gene inventories for polysaccharide degradation, nutrient uptake and secondary metabolism, which may result from adaptations to the specific floret infection and biotrophic lifestyles. Consistent with their potential roles in pathogenicity, genes for secreted proteins and secondary metabolism and the pathogen-host interaction database genes are highly enriched in the transcriptome during early infection. We further show that 18 candidate effectors can suppress plant hypersensitive responses. Together, our analyses offer new insights into molecular mechanisms of evolution, biotrophy and pathogenesis of U. virens.

Similar to other ascomycetes, the sexual compatibility of V. virens is controlled by the mating type (MAT) locus. In this study, we applied a PCRbased approach to screen mating type genes in the single asexual spore isolate. Our results showed that V. virens possesses the two master genes required for mating (MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1), suggesting that this fungus is likely to be homothallic. Mating type primer pairs were developed to genotype the single ascospore isolates from different places in China. These analyses provided further evidence that V. virens is a homothallic species and suggest novel genetic mechanisms of sexual reproduction in V. virens.

Reduced signalling through the insulin/IGF-like (IIS) and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathways also extend lifespan. In Drosophila melanogaster the lifespan benefits of DR can be reproduced by modulating only the essential amino acids in yeast based food. Here, we show that pharmacological downregulation of TOR signalling, but not reduced IIS, modulates the lifespan response to DR by amino acid alteration. Of the physiological responses flies exhibit upon DR, only increased body fat and decreased heat stress resistance phenotypes correlated with longevity via reduced TOR signalling. These data indicate that lowered dietary amino acids promote longevity via TOR, not by enhanced resistance to molecular damage, but through modified physiological conditions that favour fat accumulation.

Together with the spent PPF from the first hydrolysis and the further doubly-treated PPF, the proportions of three main components were determined and analyzed based on a triangle figure. The proportion (cellulose/hemicelluloses/lignin) in the spent PPF was equal to 44:23:33 and the surface morphology of the spent PPF looks very similar to the native PPF surface showing poor hydrolysis efficiency. After further double treatment, the proportion was changed evidently from the original 44:23:33 to 54:21:25 and the surface structure was significantly disrupted showing a potential to be hydrolyzed completely. Additionally, all samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractogram through considerations of alkaline solution treatment, so as to understand better the nature of biomass hydrolysis, from the aspect of three biomass components.

In the present study, we used genomic PCR to identify the partial genomic locus of goose (Anser cygnoides) GPR103 and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR to identify five GPR103 variants, including the full-length variant (aGPR103-n) and four alternatively spliced variants (aGPR103-va,-vb, -vc and -vd). Sequence analysis showed that aGPR103-va and -vd are less likely to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting that they may be translated into truncated proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the five variants are widely distributed in the brain and peripheral tissues of geese and show specific expression patterns. Thus, we here provide the first account of the GPR103 genomic locus and illustrate its transcriptional diversity and widespread distribution in geese. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

A 1.02 kb DNA fragment, encoding for a portion of the surface immunogenic protein (Sip) of S. agalactiae was inserted into pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX1-sip was transfected in EPC cells to detect the transient expression by an indirect immunofluorescence assay, together with Western blot analysis. The pVAX1-sip was transformed by electroporation into SL7207. The stability of pVAX1-sip into Salmonella was over 90% after 50 generations with antibiotic selection in vitro while remained stable over 80% during 35 generations under antibiotic-free conditions. The LD50 of SL/pVAX1-sip was 1.7 x 10(11) CFU/fish by intragastric administration which indicated a quite low virulence. Tilapias were inoculated orally at 10(8) CFU/fish, the recombinant bacteria were found present in intestinal tract, spleens and livers and eventually eliminated from the tissues 4 weeks after immunization. Fish immunized at 10(7), 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/fish with different immunization times caused various levels of serum antibody and an effective protection against lethal challenge with the wild-type strain S. agalactiae. Integration studies showed that the pVAX1-sip did not integrate with tilapia chromosomes. The DNA vaccine SL/pVAX1-sip was proved to be safe and effective in protecting tilapias against S. agalactiae infection. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Huang, L. Y.; Wang, K. Y.; Chen, D.

(S. chamaejasme for short) is one of the most noxious unpalatable weeds in China, which has been frequently reported its negative interaction (i.e. competition and allelopathy) with other herbaceous species in grasslands. This study compared species diversity, biomass and sexual reproduction of herbaceous plants in meadows with S. chamaejasme and in open meadows without S. chamaejasme in overgrazing meadows on the Tibetan Plateau in China to determine whether positive facilitation exist between S. chamaejasme and other herbaceous species under livestock's overgrazing. The results showed that there are more herbaceous species in meadows with S. chamaejasme than those in open meadows (35s and 30s, respectively). Diversity index and above-ground biomass were also significantly higher in meadows with S. chamaejasme. There were 39% (11/28) of all species with sexual reproduction found in meadows with S. chamaejasme, which was 7 times more than those in open meadows. Our study showed that S. chamaejasme could provide biotic refuge for neighboring plants and preserve plant diversity from livestock's overgrazing in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. It also suggested that inter-specific facilitation between S. chamaejasme and other herbaceous species may play a key role in overgrazing alpine meadows.

However, efficient and sensitive diagnostic methods for the various infection models are limited. In order to provide a more simple and convenient method for serologic diagnosis, we improved the production of recombinant DHBV viral capsid protein (core protein) and then used it to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting anti-DHBc antibodies (DHBcAg ELISA) in DHBV-infected ducks. Given the positive/negative cut-off value, the maximum dilution of duck sera in which anti-DHBc antibodies could be detected was 1:12,800. In addition, the DHBcAg ELISA displayed no cross reactivity with duck antisera against duck circovirus (DuCV), duck plague virus (DPV), duck hepatitis virus (DHV), duck swollen head septicemia virus (DSHSV), avian influenza virus (AIV), Riemerella anatipestifer, Salmonella anatum, or Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the coefficients of variation (CVs) of inter-assay and intra-assay experiments were both below than 10 %. When compared to PCR for accuracy on clinical samples from cases of suspected DHBV infection, the DHBcAg showed 95.45 % coincidence with PCR. In conclusion, recombinant DHBc was readily produced and used to establish a simple DHBcAg ELISA that provided a highly specific and sensitive method for analysis of clinical samples.

These differences may be partially due to the host response to DHV infection. In order to understand this difference, we characterized the pathobiology of and innate immune response to DHV infection in 1-day-old (1D) and 3-week-old (3 W) ducks. Viral RNA was detected in duck livers at 24, 36 and 72 h after inoculation with DHV at a dose of 10(3) LD50. Virus-induced pathology ranged from no clinical signs to severe disease and death, and it was more severe in the 1D ducks. Infection with DHV induced up-regulation of gene expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7, TLR3, retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-alpha, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), interferon-stimulated gene 12 (ISG12), and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like gene (OASL) in the livers of 3 W ducks. Of these, IL-6, OASL and ISG12 mRNA levels were more than 100-fold higher in infected 3 W ducks than in mock-infected ducks of the same age. These genes were induced much less in infected 1D ducklings. We present evidence that a lower level of viral replication in the hepatocytes of 3 W ducks, whose basal level of cytokines is higher than that in 1D ducklings, may be related to the strong innate immunity induced. From our data, we conclude that duck age plays an important role in the pathogenicity of and innate immune responses to DHV.

Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of variants in POMC and NPY genes on growth, carcass and meat quality traits in rabbits. A total of six SNPs were identified for POMC (n = 2) and NPY (n = 4) genes by direct sequencing. Three SNPs were subsequently genotyped by using MassArray system (Sequenom iPLEXassay) in 235 individuals, which belong to three meat rabbit breeds, including 93 Ira rabbits; 81 Champagne rabbits and 61 Tianfu black rabbits. The SNP c.112-12G>T was in intron-exon boundaries (intron 1) of POMC gene, and the association analysis showed that individuals with TT genotype had a greater 84 d body weight (BW84), eviscerated weight and semi-eviscerated weight than those with GT genotype (p<0.05); the TT individuals were also higher than those GO in the ripe meat ratio (RMR) (p<0.05). The g.1778G>C SNP, which was in complete linkage with other three SNPs (g.1491G>A, g.1525G>T and g.1530C>T) in intron 1 of NPY gene, was significantly correlated with eviscerated slaughter percentage and semi-eviscerated slaughter percentage in rabbits, and the individuals with CC genotype had a better performance than CG genotype (p<0.05). These findings would provide primary clues for the biological roles of POMC and NPY underlying the rabbit growth-related traits.

However, there is little known about the intracellular mechanisms of GLP-2 in the regulation of TJ proteins in piglets' intestinal epithelial cells. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that GLP-2 regulates the expressions of TJ proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in piglets' intestinal epithelial cells. The jejunal tissues were cultured in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose medium containing supplemental 0 to 100 nmol/L GLP-2. At 72 h after the treatment with the appropriate concentrations of GLP-2, the mRNA and protein expressions of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and claudin-1 were increased (p<0.05). U0126, an MAPK kinase inhibitor, prevented the mRNA and protein expressions of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1 increase induced by GLP-2 (p<0.05). In conclusion, these results indicated that GLP-2 could improve the expression of TJ proteins in weaned pigs' jejunal epithelium, and the underlying mechanism may due to the MAPK signaling pathway.

A complementary log-log (CLL) model was used to analyze the data of the toxicity tests in vitro. The results showed euptox A had strong toxicity against mites, killing all S. scabiei at 3 and 4 mg/ml (m/v) concentration, while 4 mg/ml euptox A was also found to kill all P. cuniculi within a 4 h period. Similarly, 2, 3 and 4 mg/ml concentration of euptox A had strong toxicity against S. scabiei, with median lethal time (LT50) values at 0.687, 0.526, 0.326 h, respectively. 3 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml showed strong acaricidal action against P. cuniculi; the LT50 values were 0.693 and 0.493 h, respectively.

Enteric and serological distribution of serotonin and its precursor tryptophan in perinatal low and normal weight piglets	ANIMAL			English	Article						low birth weight; serotonin; pig; small intestine; serum	GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; SMALL-INTESTINE; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE SEROTONIN; GROWTH RESTRICTION; MUCOSAL CELLS; NEONATAL PIGS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; SERUM-LEVELS; AMINO-ACIDS; BRAIN	Perinatal mortality is high among small-for-gestational age (SGA) piglets and continues to be an economic burden and threat to animal welfare. As the physiological role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in perinatal development and gastrointestinal function in the pig remains unknown, the aim of this study was to assess the enteric distribution of 5-HT cells and to determine 5-HT together with its precursor tryptophan in the serum of perinatal normal and SGA piglets. For this purpose, proximal and distal parts of the small intestine (SI) were processed for immunohistochemical analysis to assess the presence of 5-HT endocrine cells. Serum 5-HT was measured with ELISA, whereas its precursor, that is, the free fraction of tryptophan (FFT) together with albumin-bound tryptophan and total tryptophan, were analysed with HPLC in postnatal piglets. In addition, the morphological growth patterns of the different intestinal tissue layers of both normal and SGA piglets were stereologically analysed. The stereological volume density of 5-HT enteroendocrine cells showed a significant interaction effect between age and region. Indeed, the amount of 5-HT cells in both the proximal and distal part of the SI tended to decrease according to age, with the lowest values detected at day 3 postpartum. No differences could be observed related to BW. Interestingly, the serum concentration of 5-HT was higher in normal piglets compared with SGA piglets. Moreover, the ratio of FFT to total tryptophan was significantly affected by age and BW. Normal piglets had, on average, a lower FFT/total tryptophan ratio compared with SGA piglets. An approximate linear decrease was observed with increasing age. Finally, the immaturity of the intestinal system of the SGA piglets was not reflected in altered volume densities of the different intestinal layers. To conclude, although no BW effect could be detected in the distribution of enteric 5-HT cells, serum 5-HT and the ratio of FFT to total tryptophan ratio showed significant differences between normal piglets and their SGA littermates.

We have found that sequencing of the IGFALS gene in Chinese Qinchuan beef cattle (n = 300) revealed four SNP loci in exon two of the gene (g1219: T>C, g1893: T>C, g2612: G>A, and g2696: A>G). The SNP g2696: A>G resulted in a change from asparagine to aspartic acid (p.N574D) in the leucine-rich repeat region in the carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFALS. Four SNPs were in low linkage disequilibrium, and 12 different haplotypes were identified in the population. Association analysis suggested that SNP g1219: T>C had a significant association with hip width (P < 0.05) and SNP g2696: A>G displayed a significant association with stature (P < 0.05). The results from our investigation indicated that polymorphisms in the IGFALS gene were associated with growth traits of bovine, and may serve as a genetic marker for selection of beef cattle for growth traits, including stature.

In the Southwestern China, the species is found restricted growing in the karst limestone or rock in the edge of farmland, moist hillsides or river. In the present study, the genetic diversity and differentiation was estimated within and among habitats, populations and groups of this species by ISSR markers. Using 13 polymorphic primers, an intermediate level of genetic diversity was found at the species level and population level with the percentage of polymorphic bands (P) of 64.7 and 50.9 %, Shannon index of diversity (I) of 0.3873 and 0.2949, respectively. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the high level of population differentiation was presented with 45.63 % relative to the total genetic variation residing among eight populations. It was noteworthy that as much as 69.17 % of the total diversity was most likely attributed to the difference among the populations in fragmentation habitat conditions, while 16.32 % of the total diversity could be attributed to the difference among the populations in stable and favorable habitat conditions. The in situ conservation is a top strategy, thus the mycorrhizal fungi and pollinators are protected by protecting habitat and avoiding fragmentation which is helpful to the cycle of this endangered orchid species and recovery of its wild populations. In addition, to maintaining the germplasm bank of this species, the ex situ conservation by habitat simulation and reintroduction has been considered in the living collection at Kaili University ecological garden and Yuntai Mountain scenic spot using the plants collected in this study.

The ovaries were collected from four healthy New Zealand white rabbits, and the mRNA expression and protein levels of GnRHR1, FSHR, LHR, PGR, and PGRMCI were examined with real-time PCR and immuno-histochemistry. The results showed that GnRHR1, FSHR, LHR, PGR, and PGRMCI mRNA was expressed in the ovary; furthermore, we show cell-type specific and follicular development stage-specific expression of these receptors at the protein level. Specifically, all of the receptors were detected in the oocytes from the primordial to the tertiary follicles and in the granulosa and theca cells from the secondary and tertiary follicles. In the mature follicles, all receptors were primarily localized in the granulosa and theca cells. In addition, LHR was also localized in the granulosa cells from the primordial and primary follicles. With follicular development, the expression level of all of the receptors, except GnRHR1, in the follicles showed a tendency to decrease because the area of the follicle increased sharply. The expression level of GnRHRI, FSHR, and PGR in the granulosa and theca cells showed an increasing trend with ongoing follicular development. Interestingly, the expression level of FSHR in the oocytes obviously decreased from the primary to the tertiary follicles, whereas LHR in the oocytes increased from the secondary to tertiary follicles. In conclusion, the expression of GnRHRI, the gonadotropin receptors, PGR, and PGRMCI decreased from the preantral follicles (primordial, primary, and secondary follicles) to the tertiary follicles. The expression of GnRHR1 and LHR in the oocytes increased from the secondary to the tertiary follicles, whereas FSHR decreased from the primary to the tertiary follicles. The expression of GnRHRI and PGR in the granulosa and theca cells increased from the secondary to the mature follicles. These observations suggest that these receptors play roles in follicular development and participate in the regulation of follicular development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Lan, R.

Plant miRNAs regulate gene expression mainly by guiding cleavage of target mRNAs and subsequently play important roles in diverse developmental processes, nutrient homeostasis and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. MiRNA393 plays important and diverse roles in defense against bacterial pathogens by negatively targeting transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) in plant development. It will be essential for understanding complex feedback regulations in the development pathway by unraveling the miR393 network in a temporal and spatial manner. Here, we report that Zma-miR393b down-regulates its putative target TIR1-like (F-box) gene by guiding the cleavage of their mRNAs in development of leaf sheaths in response to R. Solani infection, Zma-miR393b and its putative target gene TIR1 were confirmed through Q-PCR and the spatial expression of Zma-miR393b was further analyzed by in situ hybridization. These findings suggested that, as a negative feedback regulation of TIR1-like (F-box) gene, Zma-miR393b plays an important role in defense against R. Solani infection.

Marchal is a serious disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Southwestern China. A line of common wheat designated 08-723 isolated from the progeny of a hybrid between common wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & Dewey, was highly resistant to the existing powdery mildew races in the region. This line had a similar phenotype to its wheat parent, and it showed normal bivalent pairing at metaphase I of meiosis. It was analyzed by genomic in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization and sequential C-banding-GISH to determine the amount, location and origin of the alien chromatin present. The results revealed that line 08-723 is homozygous for a two-point translocation replacing chromosome 6A of wheat. The translocation chromosome appears to have a normal 6AL arm; its short arm has a short terminal segment of ca. 10 % in length originating from an unidentified B-genome chromosome of wheat and a long proximal segment of ca. 90 % of the arms' length originating from one of the St-genome chromosomes of Th. intermedium. Genetic analysis of powdery mildew resistance in F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations from a cross of 08-723 with a susceptible wheat line indicated that the resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene and in a sample of F2 plants it always associated with the translocated chromosome. The gene responsible for resistance on the translocated chromosome may provide an alternate source of resistance in wheat breeding programs.

Nests were bowl-shaped built by both sexes mainly of bamboo leaves, fibrous roots and mosses. They were located within dense bamboo clusters, about 0.70-1.90m above the ground. The clutch size averaged (mean +/- SD) 3.38 +/- 0.72 (n=16) and eggs were oval, pale blue in colour, weighing 1.24 +/- 0.10g (n=13). Both pair-bond members incubated eggs and shared nestling care. Compared with control sites, the nestsites (n=33) had smaller canopy closure (73 +/- 12% vs 84 +/- 16%). Overall nesting success was 18.18% (6/33).

In this study, we isolated a yellow-green leaf mutant, 502ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant exhibited reduced level of Chls, arrested development of chloroplasts, and retarded growth rate. The phenotype of the 502ys mutant was controlled by by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene on the long arm of rice chromosome 2. Map-based cloning of the mutant resulted in the identification of an OsChl P gene (LOC_Os02g51080). In the 502ys mutant, a single base pair mutation was detected at residue 1279 in DNA sequence of the gene, resulting in an amino acid change (Gly-206 to Ser) in the encoded protein. HPLC analysis of Chls indicated that the majority of Chl molecules are conjugated with an unsaturated geranylgeraniol side chain, in addition to small amount of normal Chls in the mutant. Furthermore, the mutant phenotype was complemented by transformation with the wild-type gene. Therefore, this study has confirmed the 502ys mutant resulted from a single base pair mutation in OsChl P gene.

This paper explores building SVM classifier on the fitting-plane of each class of data, which captures the distributing trend of the corresponding class of data. The newly developed plane-fitting model can be solved by core set methods, and the SVM is trained only on the core sets which are small subsets of the original data. The computing complexity of the proposed algorithm is up bounded by O(1/epsilon). Experimental results show that the new algorithm scales better than SVMperf and CVM/BVM, while their predicting accuracies are almost comparable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Protein spots were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The ten proteins unique to Nagasaki were putative adhesin AidA protein, putative extracellular serine protease (autotransporter) (771aa), putative extracellular serine protease (autotransporter) (780aa), protective surface antigen D15, 30S ribosomal protein S2, periplasmic serine protease do/hhoA-like protein, acid phosphatase, membrane protein, protein-disulfide isomerase, and iron ABC transporter substrate-binding protein. Meanwhile, the two proteins unique to SW114 were C4-dicarboxylate ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein. Quantitative PCR was used to analyze the mRNA transcript levels of three randomly selected proteins. The afuA, AidA, and ompD15 genes encoding iron ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, putative adhesin AidA protein and protective surface antigen D15 respectively demonstrated significantly higher mRNA transcript levels (39.606, 3.924, and 36.668, respectively) in Nagasaki than in SW114. These observations suggest the levels of differentially expressed proteins were directly proportional to their cellular mRNA levels. Three virulence-related proteins, namely, putative adhesin AidA protein, putative extracellular serine protease (autotransporter) (771aa) and putative extracellular serine protease (autotransporter) (780aa) were identified in Nagasaki.

Hand.-Mazz. Three independent variables, including extraction temperature (degrees C), ratio of water to raw material, and extraction time (h), which significantly affected the yield of polysaccharides, were investigated. The experimental data were fitted to a quadratic polynomial equation using multiple regression analysis and also examined using appropriate statistical methods. The optimum conditions were as follows: extraction temperature, 90.8 degrees C; ratio of water to raw material, 21.3:1; and extraction time 4.8 h. Under these conditions, the experimental yield was 54.18%, which matched the predicted value well. Furthermore, the purified polysaccharide exerted strong antioxidant effects on DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals in vitro. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we evaluated APOBEC2 mRNA abundance and protein expression and the results indicated that APOBEC2 mRNA was most abundant in skeletal and cardiac muscle, with relatively low expression in the gonads, gizzard and subcutaneous fat tissues of chickens. Immunoreactive APOBEC2 was localized to the cell nucleus of developing myocardium and skeletal myofibers. There were significant differences in mRNA and protein abundance among ages, tissues, and between males and females. In conclusion, APOBEC2 was expressed as the greatest in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle where it localized to the nucleus. Thus, APOBEC2 may play an important role in muscle development in chickens. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The genome of native and domesticated pigs provide a unique opportunity for tracing the history of domestication and identifying signatures of artificial selection. Here we used whole-genome sequencing to explore the genetic relationships among the European native pig Berkshire and breeds that are distributed worldwide, and to identify genomic footprints left by selection during the domestication of Berkshire. Numerous nonsynonymous SNPs-containing genes fall into olfactory-related categories, which are part of a rapidly evolving superfamily in the mammalian genome. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a deep phylogenetic split between European and Asian pigs rather than between domestic and wild pigs. Admixture analysis exhibited higher portion of Chinese genetic material for the Berkshire pigs, which is consistent with the historical record regarding its origin. Selective sweep analyses revealed strong signatures of selection affecting genomic regions that harbor genes underlying economic traits such as disease resistance, pork yield, fertility, tameness and body length. These discoveries confirmed the history of origin of Berkshire pig by genome-wide analysis and illustrate how domestication has shaped the patterns of genetic variation.

To improve the efficiency of vitrification in straw, bovine oocytes were used to test a new two-step vitrification method in this study. Results: When in vitro matured oocytes were exposed to 20% ethylene glycol (EG20) for 5 min and 40% ethylene glycol (EG40) for 30 s, followed by treatment with 30% glycerol (Gly30), Gly40 or Gly50, a volume expansion was observed in Gly30 and Gly40 but not Gly50. This indicates that the intracellular osmotic pressure after a 30 s differs between EG40 and ranged between Gly40 (approximately 5.6 mol/L) and Gly50 (approximately 7.0 mol/L). Since oocytes are in EG40 just for only a short period of time (30 s) and at a lower temperature (4 degrees C), we hypothesize that the main function of this step in to induce dehydration. Based on these results, we omitted the EG40 step, before oocytes were pretreated in EG20 for 5 min, exposed to pre-cooled (4 degrees C) Gly50, for 30 s, and then dipped into liquid nitrogen. After warming, 81.1% of the oocytes survived, and the surviving oocytes developed into cleavage stage embryos (63.5%) or blastocysts (20.0%) after parthenogenetic activation. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that in a two-step vitrification procedure, the permeability effect in the second step is not necessary. It is possible that the second step is only required to provide adequate osmotic pressure to condense the intracellular concentration of CPAs to a level required for successful vitrification.

J	Huang, J; Si, WN; Deng, QM; Li, P; Yang, SH				Huang, Ju; Si, Weina; Deng, Qiming; Li, Ping; Yang, Sihai			Rapid evolution of avirulence genes in rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	BMC GENETICS			English	Article						Magnaporthe oryzae; Avr-genes; Evolutionary features; Rapid evolution	AVR-PIA; RESISTANCE; GRISEA; SPECIFICITY; AVR1-CO39; GENETICS; PROTEIN; SEQUENCE; IMMUNITY; FAMILY	Background: Rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating pathogens in rice. Avirulence genes in this fungus share a gene-for-gene relationship with the resistance genes in its host rice. Although numerous studies have shown that rice blast R-genes are extremely diverse and evolve rapidly in their host populations, little is known about the evolutionary patterns of the Avr-genes in the pathogens. Results: Here, six well-characterized Avr-genes and seven randomly selected non-Avr control genes were used to investigate the genetic variations in 62 rice blast strains from different parts of China. Frequent presence/absence polymorphisms, high levels of nucleotide variation (similar to 10-fold higher than non-Avr genes), high non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios, and frequent shared non-synonymous substitution were observed in the Avr-genes of these diversified blast strains. In addition, most Avr-genes are closely associated with diverse repeated sequences, which may partially explain the frequent presence/absence polymorphisms in Avr-genes. Conclusion: The frequent deletion and gain of Avr-genes and rapid non-synonymous variations might be the primary mechanisms underlying rapid adaptive evolution of pathogens toward virulence to their host plants, and these features can be used as the indicators for identifying additional Avr-genes. The high number of nucleotide polymorphisms among Avr-gene alleles could also be used to distinguish genetic groups among different strains.

In this study, we determined the amylose content, characterized granule-binding proteins, analyzed the expression of key genes involved in starch synthesis, and examined starch granule structure of both normal (Bowman and Morex) and shrunken endosperm (seg1, seg3, seg4a, seg4b, seg5, seg6, seg7, and sex1) barley accessions. Our results showed that amylose contents of shrunken endosperm mutants ranged from 8.9% (seg4a) to 25.8% (seg1). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that 87 kDa proteins corresponding to the starch branching enzyme II (SBEII) and starch synthase II (SSII) were not present in segl, seg3, seg6, and seg7 mutants. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that waxy expression levels of segl, seg3, seg6, and seg7 mutants decreased in varying degrees to lower levels until 27 days after anthesis (DAA) after reaching the peak at 15-21 DAA, which differed from the pattern of normal barley accessions. Further characterization of waxy alleles revealed 7 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding sequences and 16 SNPs and 8 indels in the promoter sequences of the mutants. Results from starch granule by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that, in comparison with normal barley accessions, seg4a, seg4b, and sex1 had fewer starch granules per grain; seg3 and seg6 had less small B-type granules; some large A-type granules in seg7 had a hollow surface. These results improve our understanding about effects of seg and sex mutants on starch biosynthesis and granule structure during endosperm development and provide information for identification of key genes responsible for these shrunken endosperm mutants.

To detect their functions in pig skeletal muscle, we cloned and characterized the pig ALP subfamily genes, drew their genomic structure maps, and detected their tissue expression patterns. We identified a new spliced variant of PDLIM3 in pig skeletal muscle and named it as PDLIM3-4, which was only expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle. Our results showed that PDLIM3-4 was expressed in adult pig skeletal muscle with the highest expression level, and both PDLIM3-4 isoform and PDLIM4 had different expression profiles during the prenatal and postnatal stages of skeletal muscle development among the three pig breeds. These studies provide useful information for further research on the functions of pig ALP subfamily genes in skeletal muscle development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ammopiptanthus nanus is the unique evergreen broadleaf bush endemic to the Mid-Asia deserts. It survives at the west edge of the Tarim Basin from the disappearance of the ancient Mediterranean in the Tertiary Period. Its distribution region is characterized by the arid climate and extreme temperatures, where the extreme temperatures range from - 30 degrees C to 40 degrees C. In the present study, the antifreeze protein gene AnAFP of A. nanus was used to transform Escherichia coli and tobacco, after bioinformatics analysis for its possible function. The transformed E. coli strain expressed the heterologous AnAFP gene under the induction of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and demonstrated significant enhancement of cold tolerance. The transformed tobacco lines expressed the heterologous AnAFP gene in response to cold stress, and showed a less change of relative electrical conductivity under cold stress, and a less wilting phenotype after 16 h of 3 C cold stress and thawing for 1 h than the untransformed wild-type plants. All these results imply the potential value of the AnAFP gene to be used in genetic modification of commercially important crops for improvement of cold tolerance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we determined tissue expression pattern and polymorphism of G0S2 gene in porcine. The results showed that the G0S2 transcript levels were very high in the liver and, to a lesser degree, in adipose tissues of greater omentum and suet fat; and low G0S2 transcript levels were observed in other tissues. A comparative study on the transcript levels between ATGL and G0S2 genes showed that ATGL transcript levels were high in all six adipose tissues, but negligible in the liver. Higher transcript levels were obtained for sows in adipose tissues of the inner layer of subcutaneous fat and suet fat, but higher expression values were found for boars in the liver, spleen, and stomach. 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 4 nonsynonymous SNPs (g.-307A>T, g.-394C>G, g.-565G>A, and g.-566T>C), were found in porcine G0S2 genomic DNA. Association analyses showed that-the g.-565G>A and g.-742T>A SNPs were associated with back fat thickness (BFT). In conclusion, G0S2 mRNAs are abundantly expressed in porcine liver and adipose tissues of greater omentum and suet fat, and sex affects porcine G0S2 tissue transcript levels; meanwhile, the genetic diversity of porcine G0S2 gene is abundant and 2 SNPs are a genetic factor affecting BFT.

To gain a better understanding of Capsicum evolution, domestication, and specialization, we present here the genome sequence of the cultivated pepper Zunla-1 (C. annuum L.) and its wild progenitor Chiltepin (C. annuum var. glabriusculum). We estimate that the pepper genome expanded similar to 0.3 Mya (with respect to the genome of other Solanaceae) by a rapid amplification of retrotransposons elements, resulting in a genome comprised of similar to 81% repetitive sequences. Approximately 79% of 3.48-Gb scaffolds containing 34,476 protein-coding genes were anchored to chromosomes by a high-density genetic map. Comparison of cultivated and wild pepper genomes with 20 resequencing accessions revealed molecular footprints of artificial selection, providing us with a list of candidate domestication genes. We also found that dosage compensation effect of tandem duplication genes probably contributed to the pungent diversification in pepper. The Capsicum reference genome provides crucial information for the study of not only the evolution of the pepper genome but also, the Solanaceae family, and it will facilitate the establishment of more effective pepper breeding programs.

Data sources The data used in this review were obtained from PubMed and CNKI up to May 2013. Terms of Chinese herbs and infections of respiratory tract were used in the search. Study selection Articles related that Chinese herbs preventing and treating infections in respiratory tract were retrieved and reviewed. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed by the method in the "Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reveiws of Interventionsand studies" with high risk of bias were excluded. Four criteria for selections were set as following: randomized controlled trial, particular effective compound or derivative, reproducible result and animal test. Results Infectious respiratory tract diseases cause most mortality among infectious illnesses around the world. As traditional medicines, Chinese herbs have been widely used to deal with diseases for centuries and have been proved effective in practice. The administration of some Chinese herbs stimulates, suppresses or regulates the activity of immune system, thus protecting the respiratory tract or relieving infections of pathogens. Many herbs have remarkable antiviral effects, therefore they are used as substitutes of antimicrobial drugs. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, mix-using herbs provide a synergistic benefit on preventing and healing respiratory tract infections. Many commercial herbal medicines containing one or more compounds have been successfully applied to prevent and treat viral infections of respiratory tract clinically. Conclusions Traditional Chinese herbs could directly inhibit pathogens infecting respiratory tract, or coordinate the activity of immune system to avoid or relieve infections. With the emergence of antidrug pathogens or new variants, Chinese herbs give strong evidence to protect human health.

The fantastic structural characteristics of NMPCs such as ultrahigh BET surface area (1960 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (1.16 cm(3) g(-1)), and nitrogen doping make it an excellent catalyst support. PtRu nanoparticles (with a size of approximately 1.9 nm) were homogeneously supported on NMPCs by microwave-assisted reduction in ethylene glycol, and the obtained PtRu/NMPCs catalyst shows a significantly higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation than the typical commercial PtRu/C (E-TEK) catalyst.

However, the stability of the expression of reference genes is necessary to ensure accurate qRT-PCR assessment of expression in genes of interest. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is important forage and turf grass species in temperate regions, but the expression stability of its reference genes under various stresses has not been well-studied. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, 11 candidate reference genes were evaluated for use as controls in qRT-PCR to quantify gene expression in perennial ryegrass under drought, high salinity, heat, waterlogging, and ABA (abscisic acid) treatments. Four approaches - Delta C-T, geNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder were used to determine the stability of expression in these reference genes. The results are consistent with the idea that the best reference genes depend on the stress treatment under investigation. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4 alpha (eIF4A), Transcription elongation factor 1 (TEF1) and Tat binding protein-1 (TBP-1) were the three most stably expressed genes under drought stress and were also the three best genes for studying salt stress. eIF4A, TBP-1, and Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) were the most suitable reference genes to study heat stress, while eIF4A, TEF1, and E2 were the three best reference genes for studying the effects of ABA. Finally, Ubiquitin (UBQ), TEF1, and eIF4A were the three best reference genes for waterlogging treatments. Conclusions/Significance: These results will be helpful in choosing the best reference genes for use in studies related to various abiotic stresses in perennial ryegrass. The stability of expression in these reference genes will enable better normalization and quantification of the transcript levels for studies of gene expression in such studies.

Fifty weaned piglets were randomly allocated into 2 groups receiving control and fibrous diet with inclusion of PF from weaning to Day 160 postweaning, with 5 pens in each group and 5 pigs in each pen. Compared with control diet, long-term intake of PF diet induced deeper crypt and increased colonic barrier-related protein expression of mucin and sIgA. As indicated by the increased lactobacillus content, pigs fed PF diet had a stimulating effect on bacterial fermentation in the colon, thus a higher concentration of colonic total short chain fatty acid and acetic acid were observed. DNA microarray results suggested that feeding PF diet inhibited 77% of genes (40 downregulated and 12 upregulated genes) related to colonic cancer, immune response, and lipid metabolism, involving in signal pathway such as intestinal immune network for IgA production, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway and nutrient metabolism-related pathways. Collectively, our results suggested that long-term intake of PF would improve colonic function via altering colonic barriers, colonic immune and metabolism-related protein or gene expressions.

XBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1 alpha pathway	NATURE			English	Article							UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; STEM-CELLS; STRESS-RESPONSE; ER STRESS; HYPOXIA; METASTASIS; TUMORS; GENERATION; PHENOTYPE; CARCINOMA	Cancer cells induce a set of adaptive response pathways to survive in the face of stressors due to inadequate vascularization(1). One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein(UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours(4-6), but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)-is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options(7,8). Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44(high)CD24(low) population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs9,10. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1 alpha that regulates the expression of HIF1 alpha targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1 alpha and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and indicate that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.

The satellite repeat-based centromeres are believed to have evolved from "neocentromeres" that originally contained only single-or low-copy sequences. However, the emergence and evolution of the satellite repeats in centromeres has been elusive. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) provides a model system for studying centromere evolution because each of its 12 centromeres contains distinct DNA sequences, allowing comparative analysis of homoeologous centromeres from related species. We conducted genome-wide analysis of the centromeric sequences in Solanum verrucosum, a wild species closely related to potato. Unambiguous homoeologous centromeric sequences were detected in only a single centromere (Cen9) between the two species. Four centromeres (Cen2, Cen4, Cen7, and Cen10) in S. verrucosum contained distinct satellite repeats that were amplified from retrotransposon-related sequences. Strikingly, the same four centromeres in potato contain either different satellite repeats (Cen2 and Cen7) or exclusively single-and low-copy sequences (Cen4 and Cen10). Our sequence comparison of five homoeologous centromeres in two Solanum species reveals rapid divergence of centromeric sequences among closely related species. We propose that centromeric satellite repeats undergo boom-bust cycles before a favorable repeat is fixed in the population.

Here, the gamma-prolamin genes from the diploid Triticeae species were systemically characterized. Most of the gamma-prolamins (except 75 K gamma-secalins) characterized were defined as gamma-gliadin-like gamma-prolamins, since they shared same characteristic model structure with gamma-gliadins. Over one-third of these putatively functional gamma-prolamin peptides contained different number of cysteine residues as compared to the eight residues present in gamma-gliadins. Sequence polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium analyses showed the conservation of gamma-prolamin genes in Triticeae species under evolutionary selection. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these gamma-prolamin genes can not be clearly separated according to their genomic origins, reflecting the conservation of gamma-gliadin-like gamma-prolamin genes after the divergence of Triticeae species. A screening of coeliac disease (CD) toxic epitopes shows that the gamma-prolamins from some other genomes contain much fewer epitopes than those from the A, S (B) and D genomes of wheat. These findings contribute to better understanding of gamma-prolamin family in Triticeae and build a ground for breeding less CD-toxic wheat cultivars.

Results showed that supplementary dietary protein significantly increased final weight, average daily gain (ADG), intramuscular fat (IMF), serum free fatty acid (FFA), total triglycerides, total cholesterol (Ch), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) content. There was a quadratic response of ADG, IMF, FFA, Ch, HDL and LDL to dietary crude protein (CP) level. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) enzyme activities were significantly increased by supplementary dietary CP, while hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activities were significantly decreased. LPL, ACC and FAS enzyme activities showed quadratic increase as dietary CP increased. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?), LPL, FAS, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), ACC, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and heart fatty-acid binding protein (H-FABP) gene expression were significantly increased by supplementary dietary CP, while HSL and CPT-1 gene expression were significantly decreased. PPAR?, LPL, SREBP-1, ACC and H-FABP gene expression showed quadratic increase as dietary CP increased. These results indicated that supplementary dietary protein increased IMF accumulation mainly to increased intramuscular lipogenic gene expression and decreased lipolytic gene expression.

With the availability of maize B73 reference genome and whole-genome resequencing of 15 maize inbreds, common variants (CV) and clustering analyses were applied to identify non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and corresponding candidate genes for drought tolerance. Results: A total of 524 nsSNPs that were associated with 271 candidate genes involved in plant hormone regulation, carbohydrate and sugar metabolism, signaling molecules regulation, redox reaction and acclimation of photosynthesis to environment were detected by CV and cluster analyses. Most of the nsSNPs identified were clustered in bin 1.07 region that harbored six previously reported QTL with relatively high phenotypic variation explained for drought tolerance. Genes Ontology (GO) analysis of candidate genes revealed that there were 35 GO terms related to biotic stimulus and membrane-bounded organelle, showing significant differences between the candidate genes and the reference B73 background. Changes of expression level in these candidate genes for drought tolerance were detected using RNA sequencing for fertilized ovary, basal leaf meristem tissue and roots collected under drought stressed and well-watered conditions. The results indicated that 70% of candidate genes showed significantly expression changes under two water treatments and our strategies for mining candidate genes are feasible and relatively efficient. Conclusions: Our results successfully revealed candidate nsSNPs and associated genes for drought tolerance by comparative sequence analysis of 16 maize inbred lines. Both methods we applied were proved to be efficient for identifying candidate genes for complex traits through the next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS). These selected genes will not only facilitate understanding of genetic basis of drought stress response, but also accelerate genetic improvement through marker-assisted selection in maize.

The neutral endoglucanase (EG1) gene was reconstructed. A redesigned endoglucanase, named EG2, was constructed with a CBM containing a linker from Corticium rolfsii (GenBartk Accession No. D49448). The redesigned EG genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their characteristics are discussed.. Results showed that the degradation of cellulose by EG2 was about double that by EG1. The specific activities of EG1 and EG2 were tested under optimal conditions, and EG2 had higher activity (169.1 +/- 2.74 U/mg) toward CMC-Na than did EG1 (84.0 +/- 1.98) in the process of cellulose degradation. The optimal pH and temperature, pH stability, and heat stability of EG1 and EG2 were similar. Results indicated that the CBM plays an essential role in the hydrolysis of cellulose. We can improve EG's catalytic power by adding the CBM from Corticium rolfsii.

To date, there has been limited information available on the early detection of infection by this parasite. This study describes a dot-ELISA method based on an autologous antigen annexin B1 (Tpanxb1). Its potential for serodiagnosis of rabbit cysticercosis was also evaluated. Western blot analysis revealed that the recombinant Tpanxb1 (rTpanxb1) protein could be specifically recognized by rabbit anti-sera. In serum trials, the antibodies could be detected by dot-ELISA using rTpanxb1 at 14 days post-infection. The positive response was present for up to 49 days post-infection. Based on the necropsy results of 169 rabbit samples, the relative sensitivity and specificity of the dot-ELISA were 94.55% and 92.86%, respectively. This study provides a foundation for studying the immunological function of annexin and its application to control Taenia cestodes.

In this study, the full-length coding sequences of goose GATA-4 and GATA-6 were cloned and characterized. GATA-4 and GATA-6 consist of 1236 and 1104 nucleotides encoding proteins with 411 and 367 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of both proteins include two adjacent zinc finger domains with the distinctive form (CVNC-X-17-CNAC)-X-29-(CANC-X-17-CNAC) and share 84.76% identity within this domain. In silico prediction together with matching of the high affinity RRXS(T)Y motif revealed that the GATA-4 protein might be phosphorylated predominantly at S-233, but no phosphorylation site was found in the GATA-6 protein. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that GATA-4 and GATA-6 mRNAs were co-expressed in goose follicles, moderately expressed in granulosa cells and weakly expressed in theca cells. The expression level of GATA-4 mRNA in healthy follicles was significantly higher than in atretic follicles or postovulatory follicles (P<0.01), and the expression level of GATA-6 mRNA in healthy follicles was significantly lower than in atretic follicles or postovulatory follicles (P<0.01). The expression level of GATA-4 mRNA in granulosa cells was downregulated during follicle development; the peak of expression occurred in the 8-10 mm follicles, and the lowest expression was in the F1 follicles. GATA-6 was upregulated and reached its peak expression in the Fl follicles. These results indicate that the molecular structural differences in goose GATA-4 and GATA-6 may be related to their different roles during follicle development.

Our main objective was to discuss the genotypes and genetic diversity of E. granulosus present in domestic animals and humans in western China. A total of 45 hydatid cyst samples were collected from sheep, humans, and a yak and subjected to an analysis of the sequences of mitochondrial cytochronne b (cytb) gene. The amplified PCR product for all samples was a 1,068 bp band. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all 45 samples were identified as E granulosus (genotype G1). Ten haplotypes were detected among the samples, with the main haplotype being H1. The haplotype diversity was 0.626, while the nucleotide diversity was 0.001. These results suggested that genetic diversity was low among our samples collected from the west of China based on cytb gene analysis. These findings may provide more information on molecular characteristics of E granulosus from this Chinese region.

A total of 400 one-day-old male Cobb broilers were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments as follows: 1) LAT and a basal diet; 2) LAT and a basal diet supplemented with 1,000 mg of VC/ kg (LAT + VC); 3) normal ambient temperature (NAT) and a basal diet; 4) NAT and a basal diet supplemented with 1,000 mg of VC/ kg (NAT + VC). All birds were fed to 21 d of age. Broilers in groups 1 and 2 were raised at 24 to 26 degrees C during 1 to 7 d, and at 9 to 11 degrees C during 8 to 21 d, whereas groups 3 and 4 were raised at 29 to 31 degrees C during 1 to 7 d and at 24 to 26 degrees C during 8 to 21 d. The LAT increased the feed conversion ratio during the whole experimental period (P < 0.01), whereas it increased heart index at 21 d (P < 0.05) and hematocrit and hemoglobin level at 14 d (P < 0.05). Supplementing the diet with VC increased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell count at 21 d (P < 0.05). At 21 d, LAT conditions decreased total antioxidant capacity in the serum, liver, and lungs (P < 0.05), and it also increased the levels of VC in the serum and liver, the amount of protein carbonylation in liver and lungs, and the malondialdehyde level in the lungs (P < 0.05). The addition of VC tended to increase the total antioxidant capacity level in serum (P < 0.1). Low ambient temperature resulted in oxidative stress for broilers that were fed from 1 to 21 d of age, whereas no significant effect was found on the antioxidant activity by dietary VC supplementation.

Urbanization has been recognized as a complex ecosystem which is affected by economic, social, and ecological factors. With this in mind, this paper looks at many factors to first evaluate based on the matter-element (ME) method and then model an Economy-Society-Ecology (ESE) subsystem using a hybrid method by a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), and then by using the entropy method (EM) to determine the relevant index weights. To avoid subjectivity when defining the model's boundaries, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is introduced. Then, a coupling coordination degree model focusing on the degree of coordination in the ESE subsystem is established. Panel data collected from 2003 to 2012 for Chengdu, China, is then simulated to analyze the development process. The results show that: (1) The quality of urbanization continues to improve and the phasic features are presented; (2) The sensitivity analysis of subsystem weight shown that it had less effect on the coupling coordinated system; (3) The coordination in the ESE subsystem has also improved. However, the development rate of the economic subsystem is greater than that of the societal and ecological subsystem. The approach used here therefore, is shown to provide a promising basis for policy-making to support healthy urban development.

Purifying contaminated environment using the tall, colored-leaf woody plants has been proved as an aesthetically pleasing approach. However, the effects of Cd stress on colored-leaf woody plants have been little reported. Present hydroponic experiments were carried out to study the physiological and related anthocyanin biosynthesis genes responses to Cd stress in "Quanhong Poplar" plants. The experiments consisted of four Cd levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 mu M). Leaves were sampled at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 days after the first treatment for detection of related enzyme activities and genes expression. The results showed that the plants treated with 100 or 150 mu M Cd presented obvious toxicity symptom, i.e. the inhibition of growth and the decrease of chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents. However, plants growth was enhanced and the synthesis of chlorophyll, anthocyanin were promoted when the plants were subject to 50 mu M Cd stress. Furthermore, the activities of relative enzymes as well as their genes expression were induced, which indicated that low concentration of Cd induced the anthocyanin accumulation in "Quanhong Poplar" plants, which suggested that using "Quanhong Poplar" to purify contaminated environment would be an aesthetically pleasing approach, which would not only remediate contaminated environments but also bring landscape effects.

One component designated as P-C with pathogenic activity and a molecular weight of about 27kDa was obtained from this fungus by ammonium sulphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol concentration, Sephadex G-100 gel chromatography and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange resin. The toxin P-C was shown to cause the same typical symptoms caused by the pathogen itself, although the reaction of the toxin was quicker than the pathogen in all four hybrid bamboo varieties. A threshold toxic dose of 10-20g/ml was observed for two resistant varieties, while only 5-10g/ml was observed for two susceptible varieties. Moreover, effects of the purified toxic protein on the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, phenylalanine amonnialyase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase and -1,3 glucanase in the different bamboo varieties were analysed using the impregnation and leaf disc methods. The results showed a positive correlation between the resistance of bamboo and the activities of all six enzymes. The activities of all enzymes except -1,3 glucanase decreased over the time course of investigation. These results proved the important role played by toxic proteins in the pathogenicity of A.phaeospermum and their potential for selecting resistant varieties or identify the resistance of this bamboo.

In this study, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA control region sequence variation of 245 domestic geese to discern the main matrilineal components and their phylogenetic relationships. The result of phylogenetic analysis indicated the distinct lineage of clade II and the result of network analysis further suggested the major group of Chinese native goose breeds (subclade S) and introgressive goose breeds (subclade G). Except Yili geese, all Chinese domestic goose breeds were clustered in S, whereas clade II were widely distributed in 2 European breeds, Yili geese as well as 3 domestic Graylag geese. The results support that Chinese domestic goose breeds (except the Yili breed) originated from Swan goose (Anser cygnoides) while European goose breeds originated from Graylag goose (Anser anser). In total, 17 Landoise and 16 White Roman geese were clustered in subclade G together with 1 domestic goose (A. anser, AY112966), which supported the previous finding that European geese originated from Graylag goose (A. anser). But 9 unanticipated samples of two Chinese domestic goose breeds including 7 Lion-head geese and 1 Zhedong White goose in haplotype H9 were also clustered in subclade G as well as 3 Lion-head geese in haplotypes H13, H15 and H16 and 2 Zhedong White geese in haplotypes H18 and H19, which may be caused by the potential gene introgressions between swan goose breeds and graylag breeds with a directional contribution towards graylag geese.

Four hundred and fifty 1-d-old male broiler chicks were randomly allotted to control (no AF), and the diet with the corn contaminated with AF as a substitute for 50% or 100% of the corn in control (HAC or AAC). The broilers in HAC and AAC were administered with 6.5-8.0 and 13.0-16.0 mu g AF/kg BW per day respectively in overall period (1-42 d). Ten birds per treatment were selected at d 43 to explore the apparent digestibility of Ca and P using all excreta collection method after 2 days adaptation. The AAC diet reduced (P<0.05) the performance of birds in overall period, whereas the HAC diet temporarily decreased (P<0.05) the performance of birds in starter phase (1-21 d). The corn contaminated with AF had no effect (P>0.24) on the apparent digestibility of Ca and P. The increasing AF intake content linearly increased (P<0.001) serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, and decreased (P<0.05) serum 1,25-dihydroxychocalciferol and P concentrations on d 42. On d 21, the AAC diet reduced (P<0.05) tibia breaking strength (TBS) when compared to control or HAC group, however, it did not affect (P>0.10) the percentages of ash, Ca and P in tibia. On d 42, the increasing AF intake level linearly decreased (P<0.05) TBS, and the percentages of Ca and P in tibia. These results indicated that the low level of AF intake had negative effects on the P metabolism and bone mineralization of broilers at exposure of 42 days, which might relate to the changes in vitamin D and PTH metabolism.

Current commercial vaccines are mainly attenuated and inactivated; as such, problems concerning safety may occur. To resolve this problem, researchers developed virus-like particles (VLPs) as biological nanoparticles resembling natural virions and showing high bio-safety. This property allows the use of VLPs for vaccine development and mechanism studies of viral infections. Tissue-specific drug delivery also employs VLPs as biological nanomaterials. Therefore, VLPs derived from CPV have a great potential in medicine and diagnostics. In this study, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) fusion motif was utilized to express a whole, naturalVP2 protein of CPV in Escherichia coli. After the cleavage of the fusion motif, the CPV VP2 protein has self-assembled into VLPs. The VLPs had a size and shape that resembled the authentic virus capsid. However, the self-assembly efficiency of VLPs can be affected by different pH levels and ionic strengths. The mice vaccinated subcutaneously with CPV VLPs and CPV-specific immune responses were compared with those immunized with the natural virus. This result showed that VLPs can effectively induce anti-CPV specific antibody and lymphocyte proliferation as a whole virus. This result further suggested that the antigen epitope of CPV was correctly present on VLPs, thereby showing the potential application of a VLP-based CPV vaccine.

Bursin (BS) is a peptide isolated from the bursa of Fabricius for use as an adjuvant for a variety of immunogens. To investigate the synergistic effects of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) dietary supplementation and BS immunization on production performance, immune characteristics, antioxidant status, and intestinal microflora in broilers, we randomly allocated 200 1-day-old broilers of mixed sex into 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (LP-/BS-, LP-/BS+, LP+/BS-, LP+/BS+) for 42 days. BS immunization enhanced immune response by increasing serum total immunoglobulin G concentration and interleukin-6 concentration, promoted antioxidant capacity by increasing catalase activities in serum and liver and by decreasing serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content at 42 days of age (DOA), and enriched intestinal microflora diversity. LP supplementation enhanced immune response by increasing interleukin-2 concentration at 42 DOA; promoted antioxidant capacity by increasing liver catalase activities, increasing glutathione peroxidase activities in serum and liver at 21 DOA, and decreasing serum MDA content at 42 DOA; promoted intestinal microflora composition by decreasing total aerobes and Escherichia coli counts at 21 DOA, by increasing total anaerobes count at 21 DOA, and by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. counts at both 21 and 42 DOA. The interactions between BS and LP had a significant effect on daily body mass gain and feed conversion ratio in the starter period (1-21 DOA); on interleukin-2 concentration and liver MDA content at 21 DOA; and on thymus index, peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, and E. coli counts at 42 DOA. Overall, these data suggest that the combination of LP dietary supplementation and BS immunization promoted the production performance, immune characteristics, antioxidant status, and intestinal microflora of broilers.

All the Serratia strains were potently pathogenic to G. mellonella larvae, leading to death within 48 h. The strains were shown to possess a metalloprotease gene encoding for a novel serralysin-like protein. Rapid establishment of the bacteria in infected larvae was confirmed by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of a DNA fragment encoding for this protein. Detection of the viable Serratia strains in infected larvae was validated using the SYBR Green reverse transcriptase real-time PCR assay targeting the metalloprotease gene. Nucleotide sequences of the metalloprotease gene obtained in our study showed 72 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 3 insertions compared with the metalloprotease gene of S. marcescens E-15. The metalloprotease gene had 60 synonymous and 8 nonsynonymous substitutions relative to the closest GenBank entry, S. marcescens E-15. A comparison of the amino acid composition of the new serralysin-like protein with that of the serralysin protein of S. marcescens E-15 revealed differences at 11 positions and a new aspartic acid residue. Analysis of the effect of protein variation suggests that a new aspartic acid residue resulting from nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the protein structure could have the most significant effect on its biological function. The new metalloprotease gene and (or) its product could have applications in plant agricultural biotechnology.	[Tambong, J.

In this study, the cDNAs encoding two Dicer isoforms (gDicer-a and gDicer-b, respectively) were isolated and cloned from goose ovary using RT-PCR. This is the first time a new Dicer splice variant has been characterized at the molecular level in vertebrates. Sequence analysis indicated that both of the two isoforms consist of seven conserved functional domains, where gDicer-b lacks a linker sequence between DEAD box and helicase C domain composed of 158 amino acids. Each domain of gDicer-a/gDicer-b showed higher than 89.5% identity to corresponding domain of Dicers from chicken, human, and mouse. The ubiquity of transcripts of gDicer-a/gDicer-b was found in all tested tissues by real time PCR with the pituitary, oviduct, and hypothalamus being the predominant site of expression of gDicer-a. A similar expression profile of the gDicer-a/gDicer-b mRNAs was found during follicle development. The abrupt changes in transcripts of gDicer in 2-4 mm, 9-10 mm, F5, and F1 follicles support its participation in the process of follicle recruitment, selection, dominance, and ovulation. However, high mRNA levels of gDicer-b and caspase-3 were detectable in atretic and post-ovulatoiy follicles, where expression of gDicer-a was considerably low. These findings suggest that gDicer is required for follicle development, and structural differences in the helicase domain of two gDicer isoforms might contribute to their different roles in controlling granulosa cell apoptosis.

Hoolock gibbons (genus Hoolock) live in lowland and montane forests in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China. All information about hoolock gibbons comes from studies on western hoolock gibbons (Hoolock hoolock) living in lowland forest. Between August 2010 and September 2011, we studied the ranging behavior of one habituated group of eastern hoolock gibbon (H. leuconedys) living in a seasonal montane forest in Gaoligongshan, Yunnan, China. Results show that the study group did not increase foraging effort, calculated in this study as the daily path length, when fruit was less available. Instead, the gibbons fed more on leaves and decreased traveling to conserve energy. They relied heavily on a single food species in most study months which was patchily distributed within their total (14-month) home range, and during most months they used only a small portion of their total home range. In order to find enough food, the group shifted its monthly home range according to the seasonal availability of food species. To satisfy their annual food requirements, they occupied a total home range of 93 ha. The absence of neighboring groups of gibbons and the presence of tsaoko cardamom (Amomum tsaoko) plantations may also have influenced the ranging behavior of the group. Further long-term studies of neighboring groups living in intact forests are required to assess these effects.

To address the objectives how an altered snow removal could affect soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycling and pools, plastic film coverage and returning of melt snow water were applied to simulate the absence of snow cover in a Tibetan alpine forest of western China. Soil temperature and moisture, nutrient availability, microbial biomass and enzyme activity were measured at different periods (before snow cover, early snow cover, deep snow cover, snow cover melting and early growing season) over the entire 2009/2010 winter. Snow removal increased the daily variation of soil temperature, frequency of freeze-thaw cycle, soil frost depth, and advanced the dates of soil freezing and melting, and the peak release of inorganic N. Snow removal significantly decreased soil gravimetric water, ammonium and inorganic N, and activity of soil invertase and urease, but increased soil nitrate, dissolve organic C (DOC) and N (DON), and soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN). Our results suggest that a decreased snow cover associated with global warming may advance the timing of soil freezing and thawing as well as the peak of releases of nutrients, leading to an enhanced nutrient leaching before plant become active. These results demonstrate that an absence of snow cover under global warming scenarios will alter soil microbial activities and hence element biogeochemical cycling in alpine forest ecosystems.

Empirical biogeographic data currently available are mostly based on the traditional method of observational survey, which typically involves comparing indigenous microbial communities across spatial scales. Here, we report a long-term soil transplantation experiment, whereby the same two soils (red Acrisol and purple Cambisol from Yingtan) were placed into two geographic locations of 1000km apart (i.e., Yingtan in the mid-subtropical region and Fengqiu in warm-temperate region; both located in China). Twenty years after the transplantation, the resulting soil microbial communities were subject to high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA genes. Additionally, bacteria and archaea involved in nitrogen cycling were estimated using clone library analysis of four genes: archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nirK, and nifH. Data of subsequent phylogenetic analysis show that bacteria, fungi, and other microbial eukaryotes, as well as the nitrogen cycling genes, are grouped primarily by the factor of geographic location rather than soil type. Moreover, a shift of microbial communities toward those in local soil (i.e., Chao soil in Fengqiu) has been observed. The results thus suggest that the historical effects persistent in the soil microbial communities can be largely erased by contemporary disturbance within a short period of 20years, implicating weak effects of historical contingencies on the structure and composition of microbial communities in the soil.

In this study, our data demonstrated that oral administration of RCPS significantly enhanced the phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophage, splenocyte proliferation, the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and OVA-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers. Furthermore, RCPS promoted the level of interleukin-2(IL-2), IFN-gamma and IL-4 in CD4(+)T cells and level of IFN-gamma in CD8(+)T cells. In addition, RCPS enhanced the expression of CD40(+), CD80(+) and CD86(+) on the dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, RCPS down-regulated the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg cells. Taken together, these results suggested that RCPS could increase both cellular and humoral immune responses via up-regulating DCs maturation, and suppressing Treg frequency.

A storage medium, which consisted of sand, 20% water, and 3.75% super absorbent polymers delayed weight loss and loss of firmness at 12 degrees C and 90% relative humidity. Microorganisms were isolated and purified from decayed rhizomes; among these, 3 fungi were identified as pathogens. The results of 18S rDNA sequence analysis showed that these fungi belonged to Penicillium, Fusarium, and Mortierella genera. The use of essential oil for controlling these pathogens was then investigated in vitro. Essential oils extracted from Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon) and Thymus vulgaris (thyme) completely inhibited the growth of all of the above pathogens at a concentration of 2000 ppm. Cinnamon oil showed higher antifungal activity in the drug sensitivity test with minimal fungicidal concentration (<500 ppm against all pathogens). In the in vivo test, cinnamon fumigation at a concentration of 500 ppm reduced infection rates of Penicillium, Fusarium, and Mortierella by 50.3%, 54.3%, and 60.7%, respectively. We recommended cinnamon oil fumigation combined with medium storage at 12 degrees C as an integrated approach to baby ginger storage. Practical Application This research identified optimal storage conditions for baby ginger, a cold sensitive vegetable with tender skin and high MC. These optimized conditions will be useful for storage, transport, and preservation of fresh vegetables and fruits that are sensitive to cold exposure and have high MC and tender skin.

In this study, we isolated and characterized a SUPERMAN-like gene DgSZFP from chrysanthemum. DgSZFP contains one conserved Cys2/His2-type zinc finger motifs in the N-terminal region and an EAR-box in C-terminus. Its expression was significantly higher in nodes, flower buds, disc stamens, and petals than in the other tissues. Overexpression of DgSZFP in tobacco resulted in enhanced branching, reduced plant height, increased the width of petal tubes, produced the staminoid petals and petaloid stamens in flowers, and enhanced the seed weight and size. In addition, DgSZFP-over expression tobacco plants accumulated high concentrations of cytokinin and chlorophyll. These results suggest that DgSZFP may be the candidate gene for regulating branching and floral organ development in chrysanthemum. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Control of the disease is recognized as one of the biggest challenges in avian medicine. Vaccination is an efficient way to control DPV, and an attenuated vaccine is the main routine vaccine. The attenuated DPV vaccine strain CHa is a modified live vaccine, but the systemic and mucosal immune responses induced by this vaccine have been poorly understood. In this study, the immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine were evaluated after subcutaneous immunization of ducks. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were counted by flow cytometry, and humoral and mucosal Ig anti-bodies were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that high levels of T cells and Ig antibodies were present postimmunization and that there were more CD4(+) T cells than CD8(+) T cells. Titers of humoral IgG were higher than those of humoral IgA. Local IgA was found in each sample, whereas local IgG was found only in the spleen, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, harderian gland, liver, bile, and lung. In a protection assay, the attenuated DPV vaccine completely protected ducks against 1,000 50% lethal doses (LD50) of the lethal DPV strain CHv via oral infection. These data suggest that this subcutaneous vaccine elicits sufficient systemic and mucosal immune responses against lethal DPV challenge to be protective in ducks. This study provides broad insights into understanding the immune responses to the attenuated DPV vaccine strain CHa through subcutaneous immunization in ducks.

Our previous studies demonstrated that ENO1 gene expression was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. However, the molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in geese tissues and ovarian follicles remain to be determined. In this study, ENO1 cDNA (1,445 bp long) of the Sichuan white goose was cloned and characterised. The ORF of ENO1 cDNA is 1,305 bp in length and encodes a 434 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 47.27 kDa. ENO1 expression in all of the examined tissues was the highest in spleen and the lowest in breast muscle. High expression of ENO1 appeared in the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and retina. With increasing follicle growth, ENO1 gene expression began to decrease from the small white follicle to F5, which was followed by a sharp increase in expression in F4 and then a gradual decrease in expression from F3 to F1. Furthermore, in the postovulatory follicles (POF), the levels of ENO1 gene expression decreased gradually from POF1 to POF4. In conclusion, the ENO1 transcript was widely distributed in various tissues of the Sichuan white goose, but ENO1 expression was tissue-specific. Furthermore, the results of the ENO1 expression profiling of ovarian follicles suggest that ENO1 may play an important dual role in the progress of follicular development, where ENO1 acts as a glycolytic enzyme and also mediates apoptosis.

To investigate the primary functions of ACSL3 and ACSL5 and to evaluate their expression levels during goose fatty liver development, we cloned the ACSL3 and ACSL5 coding domain sequences (CDSs) of geese using RT-PCR and analyzed their expression characteristics under different conditions using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the goose ACSL3 (JX511975) and ACSL5 (JX511976) sequences have high similarities with the chicken sequences both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Both ACSL3 and ACSL5 have high expression levels in goose liver. The expression levels of ACSL3 and ACSL5 in goose liver and hepatocytes can be changed by overfeeding geese and by treatment with unsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Together, these results indicate that ACSL3 and ACSL5 play important roles during fatty liver development. The different expression characteristics of goose ACSL3 and ACSL5 suggest that these two genes may be responsible for specific functions.	[He, H.; Liu, H. H.; Wang, J. W.; Lv, J.; Li, L.; Pan, Z.

To gain insight into the transcriptome dynamics that are associated with their disease-resistant, genome-wide gene expression profiling was conducted by Solexa sequencing. More than four million tags were generated from sheath tissues without any leaf or development leaf, including 193,222 and 204,824 clean tags in the two libraries, respectively. Of these, 82,864 (55.4 %) and 91,678 (51.5 %) tags were matched to the reference genes. The most differentially expressed tags with log2 ratio > 2 or <-2 (P < 0.001) were further analyzed, representing 1,476 up-regulated and 1,754 down-regulated genes, except for unknown transcripts, which were classified into 11 functional categories. The most enriched categories were those of metabolism, signal transduction and cellular transport. Next, the expression patterns of 12 genes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and it is showed the results were general agreement with the Solexa analysis, although the degree of change was lower in amplitude. In conclusion, we first reveal the complex changes in the transcriptome during the early development of maize sheath infected by BLSB and provide a comprehensive set of data that are essential for understanding its molecular regulation mechanism.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Subcellular distribution; Chemical forms; Heavy metals; Phytostabilization	SUBCELLULAR-DISTRIBUTION; CHEMICAL FORMS; TOLERANCE; ACCUMULATION; TOXICITY; CD; HYPERACCUMULATOR; DETOXIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; MECHANISMS	Athyrium wardii (Hook.) is a promising herbaceous plant species for phytostabilization of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated sites with large biomass and fast growth rate. However, little information is available on its tolerance mechanisms toward Cd. To further understand the mechanisms involved in Cd migration, accumulation and detoxification, the present study investigated subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in the mining ecotypes and corresponding non-mining ecotypes of A. wardii via greenhouse pot experiment. Subcellular fractionation of Cd-containing tissues demonstrated that the majority of the element was mainly located in soluble fraction in cell walls. This indicated that both the vacuoles and cell walls might be evolved the Cd tolerance mechanisms to protect metabolically active cellular compartments from toxic Cd concentrations. Meanwhile, Cd taken up by the plant existed in different chemical forms. Results showed that the majority of Cd in plant was in undissolved Cd-phosphate complexes (extracted by 2 % CH3COOH), followed by water-soluble Cd-organic acid complexes, Cd(H2PO4)(2), pectates and protein form (extracted by deionized water and 1 M NaCl), whereas only small amount of Cd in roots was in inorganic form (extracted by 80 % ethanol), which suggests low capacity to be transported to aboveground tissues. It could be suggested that Cd integrated with undissolved Cd-phosphate complexes in cell wall or compartmentalization in vacuole might be responsible for the adaptation of the mining ecotypes of A. wardii to Cd stress.

Genetic mapping of a putative Thinopyrum intermedium-derived stripe rust resistance gene on wheat chromosome 1B	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							F-SP TRITICI; WILD EMMER WHEAT; POWDERY MILDEW; BREAD WHEAT; LEAF RUST; MOLECULAR MARKERS; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; DRAFT GENOME; COMMON WHEAT; YR26	Stripe rust resistance transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium into common wheat was controlled by a single dominant gene, which mapped to chromosome 1B near Yr26 and was designated YrL693. Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is a highly destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Stripe rust resistance was transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium to common wheat, and the resulting introgression line (L693) exhibited all-stage resistance to the widely virulent and predominant Chinese pathotypes CYR32 and CYR33 and to the new virulent pathotype V26. There was no cytological evidence that L693 had alien chromosomal segments from Th. intermedium. Genetic analysis of stripe rust resistance was performed by crossing L693 with the susceptible line L661. F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 populations from reciprocal crosses showed that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. A total 479 F-2:3 lines and 781 pairs of genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were employed to determine the chromosomal location of the resistance gene. The gene was linked to six publicly available and three recently developed wheat genomic SSR markers. The linked markers were localized to wheat chromosome 1B using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines, and the resistance gene was localized to chromosome 1B based on SSR and wheat genomic information. A high-density genetic map was also produced. The pedigree, molecular marker data, and resistance response indicated that the stripe rust resistance gene in L693 is a novel gene, which was temporarily designated YrL693. The SSR markers that co-segregate with this gene (Xbarc187-1B, Xbarc187-1B-1, Xgwm18-1B, and Xgwm11-1B) have potential application in marker-assisted breeding of wheat, and YrL693 will be useful for broadening the genetic basis of stripe rust resistance in wheat.

Jian) were investigated after feeding graded levels of biotin (0.010, 0.028, 0.054, 0.151, 0.330, 1.540 and 2.680 mg kg(-1) diet) for 63 days. Both malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content in all studied tissues and serum were the lowest in fish fed diets containing 0.151-0.330 mg biotin kg(-1) diet and then increased in fish fed the diet with 2.680 mg biotin kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Similarly, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities in serum significantly decreased with biotin levels up to 0.151 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Conversely, capacities of anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR) and anti-superoxide anion (ASA) in the detected tissues and serum significantly improved with biotin levels up to 0.054-1.540 mg kg(-1) diet and then decreased in 2.680 mg biotin kg(-1) diet group for muscle and intestinal AHR as well as hepatopancreas ASA (P < 0.05). Activities of superoxide dismutase in all studied tissues and serum significantly elevated with biotin levels up to 0.330 mg kg(-1) diet and then decreased when fish fed the diet with 2.680 mg biotin kg(-1) diet, except intestine (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase and total thiol content in all studied tissues and serum showed the upward trend with biotin supplementations (P < 0.05). These results indicated that biotin improved antioxidant status and depressed lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in all studied tissues and serum.

The variants have many novel structural features compared with typical subunits encoded by Glu-1 loci: 1Fx3.7 and 1Fy1.5 exhibit hybrid properties of x- and y-type subunits. In addition, unusual molecular mass and altered number and distribution of cysteine residues were unique features of HMW-GSs encoded by Glu-F1 from E. bonaepartis. The mature 1Fx3.7 subunit has a full length of 1,223 amino acid residues, making it the largest subunit found thus far, while 1Fy1.5 is just 496 residues. In addition, the mutated PGQQ repeat motif was found in the repetitive region of 1Fx3.7. Although it has a similar molecular mass to that previously reported for 1Dx2.2, 1Dx2.2* and 1S(sh)x2.9 subunits, 1Fx3.7 appears to have had a different evolutionary history. The N-terminal and repetitive regions have a total of four additional cysteine residues, giving 1Fx3.7 a total of eight cysteines, while 1Fy1.5 has only six cysteines because the GHCPTSPQQ nonapeptide at the end of the repetitive region is deleted. With its extra cysteine residues and the longest repetitive region, features that are relevant to good wheat quality, the 1Fx3.7 subunit gene could be an excellent candidate for applications in wheat quality improvement.

A few existing reports on Artemisia annua L. response to salinity are concentrated on plant growth and artemisinin content; the physiological response and salt damage mitigation are yet to be understood. In this study, the physiological response of varying salt stresses (50, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mM NaCl) on A. annua L. and the effect of exogenous salicylic acid (0.05 or 0.1 mM) at 300-mM salt stress were investigated. Plant growth, antioxidant enzyme activity, proline, and mineral element level were determined. In general, increasing salt concentration significantly reduced plant growth. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were stimulated by salt treatment to a higher enzyme activity in treated plants than those in untreated plants. Content of proline had a visible range of increment in the salt-treated plants. Distribution of mineral elements was in inconformity: Na+ and Ca2+ were mainly accumulated in the roots; K+ and Mg2+ were concentrated in leaves and stems, respectively. Alleviation of growth arrest was observed with exogenous applications of salicylic acid (SA) under salt stress conditions. The activity of SOD and POD was notably enhanced by SA, but the CAT action was suppressed. While exogenous SA had no discernible effect on proline content, it effectively inhibited excessive Na+ absorption and promoted Mg2+ absorption. Ca2+ and K+ contents showed a slight reduction when supplemented with SA. Overall, the positive effect of SA towards resistance to the salinity of A. annua will provide some practical basis for A. annua cultivation.

Sequence analysis showed that while each of the orthologous genes from indica varieties and most wild accessions encodes a complete NBS-LRR protein, each of the proteins encoded by those from japonica varieties and few wild rice accessions presents a premature termination. Eleven of the 26 orthologs were selected for blast resistance testing by transforming into the blast susceptible rice variety TP309, respectively. Inoculation of 23 M. oryzae strains collected from diverse regions of China to the respective transgenic plants revealed that 6 Pid3 orthologs showed susceptible to all the tested strains, while the other 5 orthologs showed differential resistance spectra in a gradually spectrum-widen order as Pid3-W3, Pid3-W4, Pid3-I3, Pid3-W5 and Pid3-I1. Amino acid sequences alignment of these orthologs indicated that the sequence diversities between the blast resistance orthologs were mostly located in the LRR domain such as the substitutions of Q694H, D856H, Q896R, D899E etc. However, the differences between the resistance orthologs and the susceptible ones were mostly located in the NBS domain.

However, almost all sequenced domestic animal genomes are not 'finished'. Many functionally important genes are located in these gapped regions. It can be difficult to obtain full-length cDNA for which only partial amino acid/EST sequences exist. In this study we report a general pipeline to obtain full-length cDNA, and illustrate this approach for one important gene (Ovocleidin-17, OC-17) that is associated with chicken eggshell biomineralization. Chicken OC-17 is one of the best candidates to control and regulate the deposition of calcium carbonate in the calcified eggshell layer. OC-17 protein has been purified, sequenced, and has had its three-dimensional structure solved. However, researchers still cannot conduct OC-17 mRNA related studies because the mRNA sequence is unknown and the gene is absent from the current chicken genome. We used RNA-Seq to obtain the entire transcriptome of the adult hen uterus, and then conducted de novo transcriptome assembling with bioinformatics analysis to obtain candidate OC-17 transcripts. Based on this sequence, we used RACE and PCR cloning methods to successfully obtain the full-length OC-17 cDNA. Temporal and spatial OC-17 mRNA expression analyses were also performed to demonstrate that OC-17 is predominantly expressed in the adult hen uterus during the laying cycle and barely at immature developmental stages. Differential uterine expression of OC-17 was observed in hens laying eggs with weak versus strong eggshell, confirming its important role in the regulation of eggshell mineralization and providing a new tool for genetic selection for eggshell quality parameters. This study is the first one to report the full-length OC-17 cDNA sequence, and builds a foundation for OC-17 mRNA related studies. We provide a general method for biologists experiencing difficulty in obtaining candidate gene full-length cDNA sequences.

It can be extracted using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and then detected via HPLC. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize UAE conditions for obtaining the maximum yield of artemisinin. Three independent variables (ratio of solvent to material, extraction temperature, and ultrasonic power) were evaluated using the Box-Behnken experimental design, with the yield of artemisinin as a response variable. Experimental data were highly fitted to a mathematical-regression model using multiple linear regression (MLR). Based on response surface plots, the three independent variables exhibited interactive effects on the yield of artemisinin. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: 42.71mL/g ratio of solvent to material, 41.86 degrees C extraction temperature and 120W ultrasonic power. The predicted yield of artemisinin by model was 0.7848%, whereas the actual yield in the extracts was 0.7826%+/- 0.0790% in adjusted optimal conditions, with a relative error of 0.28%. The results undoubtedly demonstrated that RSM could be used to explore the optimum conditions of artemisinin extraction.

However, the enzyme mixtures produced in such a complex medium are poorly characterized. In this study, the secretome of Trichoderma reesei grown on a cane molasses medium (CMM) as well as on a lactose-based conventional medium (LCM) were compared and analyzed by using proteomics. Results: In this study we show that both the CMM and LCM can serve as excellent growth media for T. reesei. The enzyme expression patterns in the two media were similar and a considerable number of the identified proteins on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) gels were those involved in biomass degradation. The most abundant cellulolytic enzymes identified in both media were cellobiohydrolases (Cel7A/Cel6A) and endoglucanases (Cel7A/Cel5A) and were found to be more abundant in CMM. We also found that both media can serve as an inducer of xylanolytic enzymes. The main xylanases (XYNI/XYNIV) and xyloglucanase (Cel74A) were found at higher concentrations in the CMM than LCM. Conclusions: We analyzed the prevalent proteins secreted by T. reesei in the CMM and LCM. Here, we show that hydrolytic enzymes are cost-effective and can be produced on cane molasses as a carbon source which can be used to digest lignocellulolytic biomass.

This paper addresses the feasibility of a new land use of chicken farming (CF) from natural, economic and social perspectives for devising sustainable development in a semi-arid grassland in northern China. The results of a 4-year controlled field experiment showed that CF could amend the infertile soils through feces inputs as indicated by the improvements in soil properties. Although there were some damage to grass growth in the first year of the experiment, vegetation coverage and aboveground biomass increased greatly in the following years, particularly in the third and fourth years. A quarter of feedstuff could be saved by chickens farmed in grassland compared with cage-raised chickens, accompanied by biological control of pest outbreaks. The 4-year practice at large scales by local household suggested that CF could be a more profitable enterprise compared to the conventional land use of ruminate grazing. Besides, CF could diversify livelihoods, which will lighten the reliance on traditional livestock grazing and thus help improve local social-ecological development. It was concluded that CF could be an integrative ecosystem management to rehabilitate the degraded grassland ecosystems toward a sustainable way. Finally, we highlighted an essential integration of bottom-up mechanism among local households with top-down incentives created by governments for sustainable development of chicken farming in the degraded grassland regions.

The two polymers are respectively constituted of 2,5-diethoxy-1,4-phenyleneethynylene (DPV) and 2,5-diethoxy-1,4-phenyleneethynylene (DPE) with 1,4-diketo-2,5-bis(4-sulfonylbutyl)-3,6-diphenylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (SDPP) which is a novel water soluble diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative. PSDPPPV and PSDPPPE show broad absorption band in visible region and they exhibit strong fluorescence quenching in aqueous solution. The fluorescence of their aqueous solutions can be enhanced in the presence of cationic surfactant or polymer nonionic surfactant. Fluorescence enhancement by introduction of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) shows linear response. This result provides a controllable method to increase fluorescence intensity of dipyrrolopyrrole-based conjugate polyelectrolytes in aqueous phase. The optical properties suggested that PSDPPPV and PSDPPPE which are negatively charged conjugated polymers can assemble with positively charged photovoltaic materials to form ionic photoactive layer.

In total, 12 different types of feeds were selected, each type of feed was from three different source with total 37 samples. Six types of them were energy-sourced feeds and the others were protein-sourced feeds. The carbohydrates molecular spectral intensity of various functional groups were collected using Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FT/IR) spectroscopy. In the in situ study, the results showed that the rumen digestibility and digestible fractions of primary nutrients (DM, OM, NCP, and CP) were significantly different (P < 0.05) among the feeds. The spectral bands features were significantly different (P < 0.05) among the feeds. Spectral intensities of A_Cell, H_1415 and H_1370 were weakly positively correlated with in situ rumen digestibility and digestible fractions of DM, OM and NCP. Spectral intensities of H_1150, H_1015, A_1, and A_3 were weakly negatively associated with in situ rumen degradation of CP. Spectral intensities of A_1240 and H_1240, mainly associated with cellulosic compounds, were correlated with rumen CP degradation. The multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the spectral intensities of A_3 and H_1415 played the most important role and could be used as a potential tool to predict rumen protein degradation of feeds in dairy cattle. In conclusion, this study showed that the carbohydrates as a whole have an effect on protein rumen degradation, rather than cellulose alone, indicating carbohydrate-protein matrix structure impact protein utilization in dairy cattle. The non-invasive molecular spectral technique (ATR-FT/IR) could be used as a rapid potential tool to predict rumen protein degradation of feedstuffs by using molecular spectral bands intensities in carbohydrate fingerprint region.

Weaned piglets with IUGR or normal birthweight (NBW) (n=20 each) received during the whole fattening period control diets (0% lard) or HF diets (HF, 10% lard). At about 110kg body weight, pigs were euthanised to collect hepatic samples. Compared with NBW pigs, IUGR pigs had lower daily gain and feed intake. Growth rate of pigs was increased by HF feeding. Pigs fed HF diets had lower peak concentrations of glucose and insulin, which decreased more slowly than in pigs that received the control diets. The mRNA expression abundances of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Rn) were significantly affected by HF feeding, and IL-6 and IL-1Rn mRNA expressions were up-regulated in IUGR pigs compared with NBW pigs. Western blot analysis indicated that HF feeding elevated the protein expressions of TLR4 signalling pathway, as TLR4, MyD88, I kappa B kinase beta and nuclear factor-kappa B, and insulin signalling-related proteins, as phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphorylated protein kinase B. In summary, hepatic TLR4 signalling pathway and inflammatory response induced by HF feeding played an important role in the aggravated development of insulin resistance in pigs.

J	Peng, YL; Gao, XF; Li, RY; Cao, GX				Peng, Yulan; Gao, Xinfen; Li, Renyuan; Cao, Guoxing			Transcriptome Sequencing and De Novo Analysis of Youngia japonica Using the Illumina Platform	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SSR MARKERS; RNA-SEQ; GENOME; RICE; TOOL; ANNOTATION; DIVERGENCE; ASTERACEAE; EVOLUTION; DISCOVERY	Youngia japonica, a weed species distributed worldwide, has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is an ideal plant for studying the evolution of Asteraceae plants because of its short life history and abundant source. However, little is known about its evolution and genetic diversity. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing was conducted for the first time for the comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity of Y. japonica. The Y. japonica transcriptome was sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. We produced 21,847,909 high-quality reads for Y. japonica and assembled them into contigs. A total of 51,850 unigenes were identified, among which 46,087 were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 41,752 were annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. We mapped 9,125 unigenes onto 163 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. In addition, 3,648 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. Our data provide the most comprehensive transcriptome resource currently available for Y. japonica. C-4 photosynthesis unigenes were found in the biological process of Y. japonica. There were 5596 unigenes related to defense response and 1344 ungienes related to signal transduction mechanisms (10.95%). These data provide insights into the genetic diversity of Y. japonica. Numerous SSRs contributed to the development of novel markers. These data may serve as a new valuable resource for genomic studies on Youngia and, more generally, Cichoraceae.

F; INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID; DONOR PLANTS; IN-VITRO; AUXIN; PEROXIDASE; INDUCTION; SEEDLINGS; SHOOTS; GROWTH	In order to find a way to induce rooting on cuttings of Hemarthria compressa cv. Ya'an under controlled conditions, a project was carried out to study the effect of naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on rooting in stem cuttings and related physiological changes during the rooting process of Hemarthria compressa. The cuttings were treated with five concentrations of NAA (0, 100, 200 300, 400 mg/l) at three soaking durations (10, 20, 30 minutes), and cuttings without treatment were considered as control. Samples were planted immediately into pots after treatment. IAA-oxidase (IAAO) activity, peroxidase (POD) activity and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity were determined after planting. Results showed that NAA had positive effect on rooting at the concentration of 200 mg/l compared to other concentrations at 30 days after planting (DAP). Among the three soaking durations, 20 minutes (min) of 200 mg/l NAA resulted in higher percentages of rooting, larger numbers of adventitious roots and heavier root dry weight per cutting. The lowest IAAO activity was obtained when soaked at 200 mg/l NAA for 20 min soaking duration. This was consistent with the best rooting ability, indicating that the lower IAAO activity, the higher POD activity and PPO activity could be used as an indicator of better rooting ability for whip grass cuttings and might serve as a good marker for rooting ability in cuttings.

The two strains were characterized using nutritional and physiological testing and DNA sequence analysis. They were found to produce acid from D-glucose. Haemolysis was not observed on agar medium supplemented with sheep erythrocytes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA, rpoB and gyrB gene sequences revealed that the strains formed a distinct cluster with 100% bootstrap support within the genus Acinetobacter in all phylogenetic trees. The phenotypic characteristics most useful for the differentiation of the two strains from other species of the genus Acinetobacter were their ability to grow at 41 degrees C and to assimilate malonate, phenylacetate and trigonelline. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the two strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Acinetobacter, for which the name Acinetobacter qingfengensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 2BJ1(T) (=CFCC 10890(T)=KCTC 32225(T)).

The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of hybridization with 129/Sv mice, and culture media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) or Knockout serum replacement (KSR) on ES cell isolation from Kunming mice. The results demonstrated that ES cells had been effectively isolated from the hybrid embryos of Kunming and 129/Sv mice using all three media containing 15% FBS, 15% KSR and their mixture of 14% KSR and 1% FBS, individually. These isolated ES cells had maintained in vitro undifferentiated for a long time, exhibiting all features specific for mouse ES cells. In addition, the rates of ES cell isolation in the medium containing 14% KSR and 1% FBS, was 46.67% and significantly higher than those in another two media containing only FBS or KSR (p < 0.05). Contrarily, no ES cell line had been established from Kunming mouse inbred embryos using the same protocols. These results suggested that ES cells with long-term self-renewal ability could be efficiently generated from hybrid embryos of Kunming and 129/Sv mice, and a small volume of FBS was necessary to isolate ES cells in the KSR medium when embryos and early ES cells cultured.

Blood samples (for antibody titres and hormone concentrations) were collected at 2 or 4 wk-intervals after immunisation until rabbits were killed, 24 wk after the primary immunisation. Compared to controls, rabbits immunised against pregnenolone had increased serum antibody titres (P < 0.01) and decreased serum concentrations of both testosterone and LH (P < 0.01 for each). At 24 wk after the primary immunisation, testes were severely atrophied, spermatogenesis was arrested and steroidogenesis was suppressed, as evidenced by lesser amounts of testicular cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 and 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 mRNA (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the amounts of mRNA for GnRH in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), of the hypothalamus and GnRH receptor and LH-beta in the pituitary and genes in sex-hormone negative feedback loops (androgen receptor, oestrogen alpha receptor, kisspeptin encoded gene and kisspeptin receptor) in the Arc were decreased in pregnenolone-immunised rabbits compared to controls (P < 0.05). It was concluded that immunisation against pregnenolone directly blocked testicular steroidogenesis, which reduced synthesis of hypothalamic GnRH and subsequently synthesis of pituitary LH by abolishing the permissive action of sex steroids on hypothalamic GnRH neurons, thereby disrupting spermatogenesis. This was apparently the first report that active immunisation against pregnenolone was a means of immunological castration (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For 8-wk BW, the difference between lines LWS and HWS in generation 54 was approximately 10-fold, whereas for the relaxed contemporary lines they were approximately 7-fold. Three trials were designed to measure developmental, nutritional, and genetic aspects of blood glucose homeostasis during the first 2 wk posthatch. In trial 1, we measured BW, whole blood glucose (BG), and weights (relative to BW) of liver, pancreas, and yolk sac of chicks fed from day of hatch to d 15. In trial 2, we compared those traits in chicks feed-delayed 72 h posthatch and in chicks without feed delay. In trial 3, we evaluated the effect of a 16-h fast on BW and BG on d 3, 8, and 15. There were higher levels of BG in HWS than LWS, and males than females in the fed state. Delayed access to feed for 72 h after hatch was associated with a dramatic reduction in BG. Feeding triggered a compensatory response whereby LWS displayed greater BG but smaller pancreases (% BW; d 15), compared with the controls. There were maternal effects for BW in both fed and fasted states and the reciprocal crosses exhibited heterosis for BG in the fasted state. These results show that chickens selected for high or low BW differ in BG regulation during the early posthatch period.

The results showed that 95 % ethanol extracts at concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 g/mL (w/v) were highly toxic to C. texanus in vitro, killing 100 % of mites in 4 h. Similarly, petroleum ether extracts of E. adenophorum resulted in between 80 and 100 % mortality of mites in vitro at concentrations of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mL/mL (v/v) within 4 h. In clinical trials, all infected individuals completely recovered after two treatments administered at 7-day intervals and remained disease-free at 60 days posttreatment. The clinical effect of treatment with E. adenophorum petroleum ether extracts was similar to that of treatment with the acaricide fenvalerate. These results indicated that E. adenophorum contains novel potential acaricidal compounds that can effectively control mites in livestock.

In addition, because vitamin A is correlated with reproductive performance, we measured CRBP II mRNA abundance in erlang mountainous chickens by real-time PCR using the relative quantification method. The expression of CRBP II showed a tissue-specific pattern and egg production rate-dependent changes. The expression was very high (p<0.05) in jejunum and liver, intermediate in kidney, ovary, and oviduct, and lowest (p<0.05) in heart, hypothalamus, and pituitary. In the hypothalamus, oviduct, ovary, and pituitary, CRBP II mRNA abundance were correlated to egg production rate, which increased from 12 wk to 32 wk, peaked at 32 wk relative to the other time points, and then decreased from 32 wk to 45 wk. In contrast, the expression of CRBP II mRNA in heart, jejunum, kidney, and liver was not different at any of the ages evaluated in this study. These data may help to understand the genetic basis of vitamin A metabolism, and suggest that CRBP II may be a candidate gene to affect egg production traits in chickens.	[Yin, H.

However, potential use of metallophytes in phytostabilization is limited by a lack of knowledge of many basic plant processes. A mining ecotype (ME) Athyrium wardii, Pb/Cd phytostabilizer, and a non-mining ecotype (NME) A. wardii were grown in a pot experiment to investigate the chemical characteristics of the rhizosphere when exposed to the Cd polluted soils. Rhizobags were used to collect rhizosphere and bulk soils, separately. The results indicated that the ME A. wardii was more efficient in Cd accumulation in the root than NME after growing in Cd polluted soils for 50 days in a green house. Soil solution pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the rhizosphere of ME A. wardii were higher than in the bulk soil and initial values (before planting), whereas the increment in the ME A. wardii were greater than NME. Owing to the increasing of rhizosphere soil pH, exchangeable Cd significantly decreased, whereas the other Cd species were increased with increasing soil DOC values. It is assumed that the ME A. wardii was effective in stabilizing Cd from the mobile fraction to non-mobile fractions. Results from this study suggest that rhizosphere alkalinization and the exudation of high amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to reduce heavy metal mobility might be the two important mechanisms involved in the metal tolerance/accumulation of ME A. wardii.

Acute toxicity of butanol soxlilet extracts from Eupatorium adenophorum in mice	MINERVA BIOTECNOLOGICA			English	Article						Butanols; Lethal dose 50; Toxicity tests, acute	HEPATOTOXICITY; RATS	Aim. Eupatorium adenophorum. Spreng (also called crofton weed) is a perennial plant of daisy family, producing volatile phytochemical poisonous to human and livestock upon contact. In recent years, studies have shown that crofton weed extracts are active on aphid, mite and many pathogens. In order to determine the acute toxicity of butanol Soxhlet extract from crofton weed (above ground parts), we used the modified Karber's method to determine the LD50 and acute toxicity effect by intragastric administration in Kunming breed mice. Methods, Mortality, body and organ weight were recorded and pathological changes were examined. The LD50 of extract is 18369.6 mg/kg. Body weight of mice is inversely proportional to the dosage of administration. Mice that treated the highest dosage showed the least body weight gain (P<0.01). Results. There were very significant differences in intestine index, liver index, and testis index in mice that received the second highest dose compared with control, but no significant differences in the least dosage treatment. The dead animals receiving the highest dosage showed marked pathological changes, while animals receiving the least dosage did not. Conclusion. These results indicate that the butanol Soxhlet extract of crofton weed is a slight toxic substance, which has different levels acute toxic effects to various tissue. The toxicity has a certain level of dose-effect relationship. This study provides a reference for plant source pesticide development from crofton weed.

However, breeding of elite switchgrass cultivars is required to meet the challenges of large scale and sustainable biomass production. As a native perennial adapted to North America, switchgrass has lowland and upland ecotypes, where most lowland ecotypes are tetraploid (2n = 4x = 36), and most upland ecotypes are predominantly octoploid (2n = 8x = 72). Hybridization between lowland and upland switchgrass plants could identify new cultivars with heterosis. However, crossing between tetraploid and octoploid switchgrass is rare in nature. Therefore, in order to break down the cross incompatibility barrier between tetraploid lowland and octoploid upland switchgrass lines, we developed autoployploid switchgrass lines from an anueploid lowland cv. Alamo. In this study, colchicine was used in liquid and solid mediums to chemically induce chromosome doubling in embryogenic calli derived from cv. Alamo. Thirteen autopolyploid switchgrass lines were regenerated from seedlings and identified using flow cytometry. The autoplyploid switchgrass plants exhibited increased stomata aperture and stem size in comparison with the cv. Alamo. The most autooplyploid plants were regenerated from switchgrass calli that were treated with 0.04 % colchicine in liquid medium for 13 days. One autopolyploid switchgrass line, VT8-1, was successfully crossed to the octoploid upland cv. Blackwell. The autoployploid and the derived inter-ecotype hybrids were confirmed by in situ hybridization and molecular marker analysis. Therefore, the results of this study show that an autopolyploid, generated by chemically induced chromosome doubling of lowland cv. Alamo, is cross compatible with upland octoploid switchgrass cultivars. The outcome of this study may have significant applications in switchgrass hybrid breeding.

However, few in vivo mixture studies have been conducted to understand the health effects of chemical mixtures compared with single chemicals. In this study, the acute and 90 day sub-chronic toxicity tests of combined Pb and Cd were conducted. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 value of Pb(NO3)(2) and CdCl2 mixture by the oral route was 2696.54 mg/kg by Bliss method. The sub-chronic treatment revealed that the low-dose combination of Pb and Cd exposures can significantly change the physiological and biochemical parameters of the blood of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with dose-response relationship and causes microcytic hypochromic anemia and the damages of liver and kidney of the SD rats to various degrees. Histopathological exams showed that the target organs of Pb and Cd were testicle, liver, and kidneys. These observations suggest that Pb and Cd are practically additive-toxic for the SD rats in oral acute toxicity studies. The lowest observed adverse-effect level in rats may be lower than a dose of 29.96 mg/(kg bw day) when administered orally for 90 consecutive days. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enterocytozoon bieneusi is an important zoonotic pathogen. To assess the human-infective potential of E. bieneusi in nonhuman primates (NHPs), we examined the prevalence and genotype distribution of E. bieneusi in 23 NHP species by PCR and sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS). A total of 1,386 fecal specimens from NHPs from five provinces in China were examined, and E. bieneusi was detected in 158 (11.4%) specimens from five NHP species, including cynomolgus monkey (67.7%), rhesus macaque (8.8%), Japanese macaque (33.3%), white-headed langur (13.6%), and golden snub-nosed monkey (3.5%) (P < 0.0001). The infection rates were 70.2%, 21.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, and 5.6% in Guangdong, Yunnan, Guangxi, Henan, and Sichuan Provinces, respectively (P < 0.0001). The prevalence was significantly higher in captive (13.7%) than in free-range (5.0%) animals (P < 0.0001). Altogether, 16 ITS genotypes were observed, including nine known genotypes (IV, D, Henan V, Peru8, PigEBITS7, EbpC, Peru11, BEB6, and I) and seven new genotypes (CM1 to CM7). The common genotypes included CM1, IV, and D, which were detected in 43, 31, and 30 specimens, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that seven known genotypes (but not BEB6 and I) and four new genotypes (CM1, CM2, CM3, and CM6) belonged to the previously described group 1 with zoonotic potential. Genotypes CM5 and CM7 clustered with group 2, whereas genotype CM4 did not belong to any of the previously proposed groups. It was concluded that humans and NHPs residing in the same geographical location shared the same E. bieneusi genotypes, indicating a potential role of these animals in the zoonotic transmission of E. bieneusi.

However, little is known about the effects of exclosure on soil organic carbon (SOC) in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and whether different ecosystems response equally to exclosure. In this study, we evaluated the effects of grazing removal exclosure on SOC and total nitrogen (TN) as well as SOC quality for the top soil layer (0-10 cm) through comparing three grazing-removal exclosure pairs of ecosystems (i.e., marsh, wet meadow, and meadow) in Zoige, east Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Both SOC and labile OC (i.e. microbial biomass carbon, MBC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC; light fraction organic carbon, LFOC) were investigated. Our results indicated that the exclosures of five years old significantly increased SOC stock and marginal significantly increased soil N stock for meadow. No exclosure effects on SOC and N stocks were found for marsh and wet meadow. No significant changes of MBC and DOC were found for the three ecosystems as a consequence of five years grazing removal. However, grazing exclosures significantly increased LFOC, light fraction nitrogen (LFN), heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC), and lability of carbon pool as determined by a density fractionation method (L-LFOC) for meadow, but no corresponding change occurred in wet meadow and marsh. The increase of SOC after grazing removal was attributed to increases in both labile (represented by LFOC) and non-labile (represented by HFOC) OC. Furthermore, the change of SOC is associated with TN both in light, heavy and dissolved fractions. Soil bulk density (BD) well explained the change of SOC after grazing exclusion, whereas the change of BD was mainly attributed to the change of heavy fraction. These results suggested that exclosure effects on SOC of rangeland were determined by ecosystem types. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, they represent one of the most attractive regulons for breeding programs. However, no comprehensive summary of grapevine DREB family genes is available. During this study, 38 VvDREB members were identified from the entire grapevine genome and its expression sequence tag assembly. These were organized into the same subgroups, A1 through A6, as for Arabidopsis DREBs. The VvDREB genes were distributed in 15 out of 19 chromosomes in grapevine. Multiple sequence alignments were performed and a three-dimensional structure was created to demonstrate sequence conservation. Microarray analysis showed potential regulatory roles for VvDREBs in responses to various abiotic stresses, hormone treatments, berry ripening, exposure to light, and bud development. Cis-acting regulatory elements, such as W-box, MYB-binding site, and light-responsive elements, were the most frequently found in the putative promoter regions. Furthermore, microarray transcriptional profiling of grapevine plants that over-expressed VvDREB23 revealed 248 up-regulated and 229 down-regulated genes, with fold-changes of > 1.5 when compared with the empty vector control. Gene ontology classifications showed that different genes function in cellular glucan metabolism, lipid transport, the endomembrane system, cell wall structure, and other important metabolic and developmental processes, as well as in the regulation of molecular functions. Our report provides an overview and constitutes a foundation for further study of this VvDREB gene family. All the microarray data and transcription profiling of transgenic versus empty-vector control transformant grapevines were retrieved from the online resources.

However, existing knowledge is based on studies of rotation-aged tree crops. We investigated how Eucalyptus afforestation of agricultural land affected plant species composition and biodiversity across a range of plantation ages (1-10 years). We also studied whether the soil seed bank could contribute to regeneration of existing vegetation in such plantations. We used a chronosequence approach to evaluate plant and seed species composition and diversity in forests and soil seed banks. We also quantified the similarity of seed banks and aboveground vegetation within plantation sites of a given age. Plantation sites were also compared to a nearby, mature pine forest. Total plant species number, density and diversity in Eucalyptus grandis plantations increased for the first 3 years plantation establishment, then stabilized or decreased for the next 1-2 years and then increase significantly over the following years. Species number and density in soil seed bank increased significantly with plantation age only after an initial 6-year decrease. Shannon-Wiener index of total species diversity did not significantly differ with plantation age. The understory vegetation and soil seed bank were dominated by pioneer species in the first 3 years, but intermediate-successional and shade-tolerant species gradually invaded as plantations developed further. After 7 years, E. grandis plantation understories were composed of mainly shade-tolerant species. Nevertheless, the diversity of the diversity of intermediate-successional in soil seed banks were higher than that of shade-tolerant species in soil seed banks at this age range (7-10 year). Among species successfully germinated from soil seed banks, 48 % were not found in the aboveground plant community. Similarities between the species in the soil seed bank and the aboveground vegetation were low for both plantation and control forests and did not significantly change with plantation ages. E. grandis likely produces a changing microclimate during plantation development, which in turn drives composition and diversity dynamics in understory vegetation and soil seed banks after the afforestation of agricultural land. The first 4 years after plantation establishment is associated with lower plant and soil seed bank diversity, meriting a greater focus on biodiversity stabilization and possibly longer rotation periods.

WULIANG	Forest fragmentation and isolation can reduce the size of available habitat and lead to lower food availability for some primate species. The persistence of nonhuman primates in fragments depends largely on their ability to adjust their diet in response environmental change. The western black crested gibbon (Nomascus concolor) is distributed in northern Vietnam, northwestern Laos, and southwestern China, but little is known about its diet except from studies in the well-protected forests of Mt. Wuliang and Mt. Ailao, central Yunnan. We studied food abundance and diet over 2 years in a small group surviving in an isolated and disturbed forest at Bajiaohe, southern Yunnan, and drew a comparison with the population at Dazhaizi in Mt. Wuliang. We found that gibbons at Bajiaohe consumed mostly fruit, but did not eat figs, unlike most other gibbon populations. Liana fruits and mature leaves were used as alternative foods during periods of tree fruit scarcity. Our results indicate that gibbons in Bajiaohe respond to habitat fragmentation and isolation by consuming a variety of plant species, depending on those that are locally available, and increasing time spent feeding on fruits of trees and lianas rather than increasing time spent consuming leaves.

In this study, we isolated and characterized WOX5 from common wheat and its relatives Triticum monococcum, Triticum urartu, Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops searsii, Aegilops sharonensis, Aegilops longissima, Aegilops bicornis, Aegilops tauschii, and Triticum turgidum. The size of the characterized WOX5 alleles ranged from 1029 to 1038 bp and encompassed the complete open reading frame (ORF) as well as 5' upstream and 3' downstream sequences. Domain prediction analysis showed that the putative primary structures of wheat WOX5 protein include the highly conserved homeodomain besides the WUS-box domain and the EAR-like domain, which is/are present in some members of the WOX protein family. The full-length ORF was subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pET30a, and an approximate 26-kDa protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells with IPTG induction. The WOX5 genes from wheat-related species exhibit a similar structure to and high sequence similarity with WOX5 genes from common wheat. The degree of divergence and phylogenetic tree analysis among WOX5 alleles suggested the existence of three homoeologous copies in the A, B, or D genome of common wheat. Quantitative PCR results showed that TaWOX5 was primarily expressed in the root and calli induced by auxin and cytokinin, indicating that TaWOX5 may play a role related to root formation or development and is associated with hormone regulation in somatic embryogenesis.

Characterization and utilization of novel resistant genes is the most effective, economic and environmentally friendly approach to controlling the disease. Wheat line LM168-1, which was derived from a cross between common wheat Chuannong 16 and Milan, has good adult-plant resistance to stripe rust, based on field tests over several years. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, LM168-1 was crossed with susceptible variety SY95-71. Parents and F1, F2, BC1 and F2:3 progenies were tested in 2009-2011 in a field inoculated with the predominant races of Pst in China. The genetic analysis showed that resistance to stripe rust in LM168-1 was controlled by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated yrLM168. Simple sequence repeat (SSR), resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance locus. Finally, a linkage group consisting of two SSR, four RGAP and five TRAP markers was constructed for yrLM168 with 102 F2 plants. The closest markers R1 and R2 flanked the resistance gene locus at 2.4 and 2.4 cM, respectively. Furthermore, two SSR markers Xwmc59 and Xwmc145 assigned the gene to chromosome 6A. Because yrLM168 confers high-level resistance to the predominant races of Pst in China, it should be useful in stripe rust resistance breeding programs. The closely linked markers can be used for rapidly transferring yrLM168 to wheat breeding populations.

In this study, the 5' flanking region of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene was isolated from Fagopyrum tataricum by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR method, named PFtPal (GenBank: KF463139). To investigate the functional properties of PFtPal, we constructed a series of plant expression vectors that contained different promoter fragments resulting from nest deletions and had successfully transformed them into tobacco leaves by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Histochemical assay of GUS suggested that PFtPal could drive GUS gene expression in leaves and roots, while GUS activity was not detected in the stem. In addition, the region of -274 bp to -1 bp was enough to drive normal expression of GUS gene. Low temperature treatment of transgenic tobacco plants demonstrated that PFtPal conferred cold-induced expression. Taken together, our study will help to better understand the Pal promoter, and provides a candidate promoter for molecular breeding in Fagopyrum plants.

However, the involvement of NUCB2 in feeding behavior has not well been studied in fish. In the present study, we characterized the structure, distribution, and meal responsive of NUCB2A/nesfatin-1 in Ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti) for the first time. The full length cDNA of Ya-fish was 2140 base pair (bp), which encoded a polypeptide of 487 amino acid residues including a 23 amino acid signal peptide. A high conservation in NUCB2 sequences was found in vertebrates, however the proposed propeptide cleavage site (Arg-Arg) conserved among other species is not present in Ya-fish NUCB2A sequence. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that Ya-fish NUCB2A mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all test tissues, and abundant expression was detected in several regions including the hypothalamus, hepatopancreas, ovary and intestines. NUCB2A mRNA expression respond to feeding status change may vary and be tissue specific. NUCB2A mRNA levels significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the hypothalamus and intestines after feeding and substantially decreased (P < 0.01) during a week food deprivation in the hypothalamus. Meanwhile, NUCB2A mRNA in the hepatopancreas was significantly elevated (P < 0.001) during food deprivation, and a similar increase was also found after short-time fasting. This points toward a potential hepatopancreas specific local role for NUCB2A in the regulation of metabolism during food deprivation. Collectively, these results provide the molecular and functional evidence to support potential anorectic and metabolic roles for NUCB2A in Ya-fish. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper reports on the relationships between 30 species in subtribe Crepidinae, based on an analysis of nucleotides from one nuclear (ITS) and three chloroplast DNA regions (trnL-F, rps16 and atpB-rbcL). The phylogenetic analyses used maximum parsimony with maximum likelihood inference. The monophyly of Crepidiastrum in the most recent generic classification of Shih & Kilian (2011) is explored. The results show that 12 species in Crepidiastrum constitute a monophyletic group, and that Paraixeris humifusa should be treated as Youngia humifusa.

Eight affecting factors, namely, Population (P), Urban Population (UP); the Output Values of Primary Industry (PIOV), Secondary Industry (SIOV), and Tertiary Industry (TIOV); and the Proportions of Primary Industry's Output Value (PPIOV), Secondary Industry's Output Value (PSIOV), and Tertiary Industry's Output Value (PTIOV), are chosen. PCA is employed to eliminate the multicollinearity of the affecting factors. Two principal components, which can explain 92.86% of the variance of the eight affecting factors, are chosen as variables in the regression analysis. Ordinary least square regression is used to estimate multiple linear regression models, in which COEs and the principal components serve as dependent and independent variables, respectively. The results are given in the following. (1) Theoretically, the carbon intensities of PIOV, SIOV, and TIOV are 2573.4693, 552.7036, and 606.0791 kt per one billion $, respectively. The incomplete statistical data, the different statistical standards, and the ideology of self sufficiency and peasantry appear to show that the carbon intensity of PIOV is higher than those of SIOV and TIOV in China. (2) PPIOV, PSIOV, and PTIOV influence the fluctuations of COE. The parameters of PPIOV, PSIOV, and PTIOV are -2706946.7564, 2557300.5450, and 3924767.9807 kt, respectively. As the economic structure of China is strongly tied to technology level, the period when PIOV plays the leading position is characterized by lagging technology and economic developing. Thus, the influence of PPIOV has a negative value. As the increase of PSIOV and PTIOV is always followed by technological innovation and economic development, PSIOV and PTIOV have the opposite influence.

However, the effects of N addition on forest litter decomposition, in ecosystems receiving increasingly higher levels of ambient N deposition, are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a two-year field experiment in five forests along the western edge of the Sichuan Basin in China, where atmospheric N deposition was up to 82-114 kg N ha(-1) in the study sites. Four levels of N treatments were applied: (1) control (no N added), (2) low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), (3) medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and (4) high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), N additions ranging from 40% to 370% of ambient N deposition. The decomposition processes of ten types of forest litters were then studied. Nitrogen additions significantly decreased the decomposition rates of six types of forest litters. N additions decreased forest litter decomposition, and the mass of residual litter was closely correlated to residual lignin during the decomposition process over the study period. The inhibitory effect of N addition on litter decomposition can be primarily explained by the inhibition of lignin decomposition by exogenous inorganic N. The overall decomposition rate of ten investigated substrates exhibited a significant negative linear relationship with initial tissue C/N and lignin/N, and significant positive relationships with initial tissue K and N concentrations; these relationships exhibited linear and logarithmic curves, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: This study suggests that the expected progressive increases in N deposition may have a potential important impact on forest litter decomposition in the study area in the presence of high levels of ambient N deposition.

And demand for advanced fuels impels us to develop biosynthetic routes for the production of sabinene from renewable sugar. Results: In this study, sabinene was significantly produced by assembling a biosynthetic pathway using the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) or heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathway combining the GPP and sabinene synthase genes in an engineered Escherichia coli strain. Subsequently, the culture medium and process conditions were optimized to enhance sabinene production with a maximum titer of 82.18 mg/L. Finally, the fed-batch fermentation of sabinene was evaluated using the optimized culture medium and process conditions, which reached a maximum concentration of 2.65 g/L with an average productivity of 0.018 g h(-1) g(-1) dry cells, and the conversion efficiency of glycerol to sabinene (gram to gram) reached 3.49%. Conclusions: This is the first report of microbial synthesis of sabinene using an engineered E. coli strain with the renewable carbon source as feedstock. Therefore, a green and sustainable production strategy has been established for sabinene.

Like giant pandas, red pandas are also highly specialized to feed mainly on highly fibrous bamboo. Although several studies have focused on the gut microbiota in the giant panda, little is known about the gut microbiota of the red panda. In this study, we characterized the fecal microbiota from both wild (n = 16) and captive (n = 6) red pandas using a pyrosequecing based approach targeting the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Distinct bacterial communities were observed between the two groups based on both membership and structure. Wild red pandas maintained significantly higher community diversity, richness and evenness than captive red pandas, the communities of which were skewed and dominated by taxa associated with Firmicutes. Phylogenetic analysis of the top 50 OTUs revealed that 10 of them were related to known cellulose degraders. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the gut microbiota of the red panda. Our data suggest that, similar to the giant panda, the gut microbiota in the red panda might also play important roles in the digestion of bamboo.

However, little information is available concerning the expression of calcineurin in goat. Therefore, protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha isoform (PPP3CA) gene, also called calcineurin A, was cloned and its expression characterized in Tianfu goat muscle. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses revealed that Tianfu goat PPP3CA was detected in cardiac muscle, biceps femoris muscle, abdominal muscle, longissimus dors muscle, and soleus muscle. High expression levels were found in biceps femoris muscle, longissimus muscle and abdominal muscle (p < 0.01), and low expression levels were seen in cardiac muscle and soleus muscle (p > 0.05). In addition, the spatial-temporal mRNA expression levels showed different variation trends in different muscles with the age of the goats. Western blotting further revealed that PPP3CA protein was expressed in the above-mentioned tissues, with the highest level in biceps femoris muscle, and the lowest level in soleus muscle. In this study, we isolated the full-length coding sequence of Tianfu goat PPP3CA gene, analyzed its structure, and investigated its expression in different muscle tissues from different age stages. These results provide a foundation for understanding the function of the PPP3CA gene in goats.

To evaluate the ability of selenium (Se) to counteract the deleterious effects of AFB(1), two hundred 1-day-old male avian broilers, divided into five groups, were fed with basal diet (control group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) (AFB(1) group), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1)+0.2 mg/kg Se (+Se group I), 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1)+0.4 mg/kg Se (+Se group II) and 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1)+0.6 mg/kg Se (+Se group III), respectively. Compared with control group, the relative weight of spleen in the AFB(1) group was decreased at 21 days of age. The relative weight of spleen in the three +Se groups was higher than that in the AFB(1) group. By pathological observation, the major spleen lesions included congestion in red pulp and vacuoles appeared in the lymphatic nodules and periarterial lymphatic sheath in the AFB(1) group. In +Se groups II and III, the incidence of major splenic lesions was decreased. The percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in the AFB(1) group were lower than those in control group from 7 to 21 days of age, while there was a marked increase in the three +Se groups compared to the AFB(1) group. The results indicated that sodium selenite could improve the cellular immune function impaired by AFB(1) through increasing the relative weight of spleen and percentages of splenic T cell subsets, and alleviating histopathological spleen damage.

Seven independent variables, including solvent type, pressure, particle size, liquid-to-solid ratio, extraction temperature, ultrasound power, and extraction time were examined. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) using a Central Composite Design (CCD) was employed to optimize the experimental conditions (extraction temperature, ultrasonic power, and extraction time) on the basis of the results of single factor tests for the extraction of these six major components in L. chuanxiong rhizomes. The experimental data were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation using multiple regression analysis and were also examined using appropriate statistical methods. The best extraction conditions were as follows: extraction solvent: 40% ethanol; pressure: 10 MPa; particle size: 80 mesh; liquid-to-solid ratio: 100: 1; extraction temperature: 70 degrees C; ultrasonic power, 180 W; and extraction time, 74 min.

The crude extract of Streptomyces sp. strain Y3111, which was associated with the stems of Heracleum souliei, showed good anti-BCG activity with an MIC value of 12.5 mu g/mL. Bioassay-guided isolation led to four new pluramycin-type compounds, heraclemycins A-D (1-4). Their structures were determined by different spectroscopic techniques including HRMSESI, 1D NMR, and 2D NMR. This is the first report of pluramycin analogues produced by TCM endophytic microbes as well as the first example of BCG-selective pluramycins. Heraclemycin C (3) showed selective antitubercular activity against BCG with a MIC value of 6.25 mu g/mL and a potential new mode of action.

Gene expression profiling of melatonin receptor subtypes in the ovarian hierarchical follicles of the Sichuan white goose	ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						Melatonin receptor; Oestrogen; Hierarchical follicle; Quantitative real-time PCR	ORPHAN GPR50 RECEPTOR; INTERNATIONAL UNION; GALLUS-DOMESTICUS; GRANULOSA-CELLS; CHICK; MT1; NOMENCLATURE; PHARMACOLOGY; MATURATION; APOPTOSIS	Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), an indole hormone, regulates a variety of important central and peripheral actions related to circadian rhythms and reproduction through its specific receptor subtypes (Mel-1a, Mel-1b and Mel-1c). However, the expression profile of melatonin receptor genes (MTNR1A, MTNR1B and MTNR1C) in ovarian hierarchical follicles of geese remains to be clarified. In this study, the expression level of melatonin receptors in small white follicle (SWF), small yellow follicle (SYF), the largest follicle (F1), second largest (F2), third largest (F3), fourth largest (F4), fifth largest (F5), and postovulatory follicle (POF) in the Sichuan white goose were examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the expression levels of MTNR1A, MTNR1B and MTNR1C initially increased and later decreased. The highest levels of gene expression of these receptor subtypes were observed in F5 or F4 in all examined follicles. Furthermore, the expression of MTNR1A and MTNR1B mRNA was significantly greater in SYF compared with SWF (P < 0.05), but MTNR1C was absent in SWF. The expression of MTNR1A, MTNR1B and MTNR1C mRNA was significantly greater in F5 compared with SYF (P < 0.05), and the expression of MTNR1A and MTNR1C mRNA was higher in F1 compared with POF (P < 0.05). In addition, the oestrogen concentration in SWF, SYF, F4, F3, F2, F1 and POF was measured using ELISA. The oestrogen concentration and melatonin receptor expression both were initially observed to increase and subsequently decrease. The oestrogen concentration in F4 and F3 was highest in all examined samples and was 1318.2 pg/g and 1318.1 pg/g, respectively. These results suggest that the melatonin receptor may be involved in the activation of the SWF and SYF to allow the SWF and SYF to develop into the subsequent follicles. Furthermore, follicles and the expression of the melatonin receptors may be regulated by the secretion of the oestrogen. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[He, H.; Jiang, D.

To research the relationships between IGF-1 and the follistatin-mediated TGF-beta pathways in duck skeletal muscle development, a series of studies were conducted. The results showed that follistatin had similar expression patterns to IGF-1 during duck embryonic muscle development The in ovo feeding of IGF-1 to duck eggs was shown to increase follistatin expression in the duck skeletal muscle. Thus, IGF-1 may induce the mRNA expression of follistatin. These results suggest that follistatin may be a key regulator of multiple signaling cascades responding to the cross-talk between the IGF-1 and TGF-beta pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

More sensitive antibody detection methodologies are required to diagnose asymptomatic dirofilariasis with low worm burdens. Applying current transcriptomic technologies would be useful to discover potential diagnostic markers for D. immitis infection. A filarial homologue of the mammalian translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) was initially identified by screening the assembled transcriptome of D. immitis (DiTCTP). A BLAST analysis suggested that the DiTCTP gene shared the highest similarity with TCTP from Loa loa at protein level (97%). A histidine-tagged recombinant DiTCTP protein (rDiTCTP) of 40 kDa expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) showed immunoreactivity with serum from a dog experimentally infected with heartworms. Localization studies illustrated the ubiquitous presence of rDiTCTP protein in the lateral hypodermal chords, dorsal hypodermal chord, muscle, intestine, and uterus in female adult worms. Further studies on D. immitis-derived TCTP are warranted to assess whether this filarial protein could be used for a diagnostic purpose.

The effects of PSB on microbial activity and soil quality are not well known. This study aims to determine the effect of inoculation with three PSB strains on the solubilization of rock phosphate (RP) in soil and growth promotion, nutrient uptake, photosynthetic capacity, and soil enzyme activities of 1-year-old walnut seedlings by using potted experiments with a completely randomized design under single or mixed inoculations. Inoculation with Pseudomonas aurantiaca or P. fluorescens significantly improved the plant height, shoot and root dry weight, phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) uptake, and net photosynthetic rate of walnut seedlings. Application of these two PSB strains also improved soil quality, as indicated by increased activities of dehydrogenase, neutral phosphatase, and urease in the soil. These increases were higher when PSB was applied together with RP. The most pronounced beneficial effects on plant growth and soil enzyme activities were observed when the three PSB strains were co-inoculated with RP. Bacillus cereus failed to promote plant growth. The results demonstrated that P. aurantiaca or P. fluorescens could be used as an environment-safe biofertilizer of walnut seedlings and other woody plants.

Seeds with microcapsulated tebuconazole were investigated to determine effects of this method on maize seedlings and the bioefficacy against maize head smut (Sphacelotheca reiliana). The ethyl cellulose (EC)-based microcapsules had encapsulation efficiency of 90.6%, and average size of 1.6 mu m. A release kinetic study revealed that tebuconazole release from EC-based microcapsules fits the model (M-t/M-z = kt(n) +C). Glasshouse studies indicated that maize seedling emergence and growth were negatively affected in an exponential manner as predicted by model Y=A+B x e((-x/k)). However, microencapsulation could induce tebuconazole's growth promoting effects by increasing emergence, shoot fresh weight, root fresh weight, carotenoid and chlorophyll content. Phytohormone analysis indicated the beneficial effects of microencapsulated tebuconazole were due to the sustained release of tebuconazole that appeared to influence the balance of phytohormones in maize seedlings. Contrary to conventional tebuconazole, microencapsulated seed-coated tebuconazole can lead to slightly increased gibberellins (GA) level and disappearance of abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in maize. In addition, microcapsule formulation of tebuconazole was found to provide better protection against maize head smut when compared to conventional formulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is important to select reference genes with high quality for the accurate interpretation of qRT-PCR data. Although several studies have attempted to validate reference genes in pigs, no validation studies have been performed on spermatozoa samples frozen with different cryoprotectants. In this study, 11 commonly used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPL4, SDHA, YWHAZ, PPIA, PGK1, S18, and BLM) were investigated in boar spermatozoa frozen with six different cryoprotectants using qRT-PCR. The expression stability of these reference genes in different samples was evaluated using geNorm (qbase(Plus) software), NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The geNorm results revealed that PGK1, ACTB, and RPL4 exhibit high expression stability in all of the samples, and the NormFinder results indicated that GAPDH is the most stable gene. Furthermore, the BestKeeper results indicated that the three most stable genes are PPIA, GAPDH, and RPL4 and that S18, B2M and BLM are the three least stable genes. There are a number of differences in the ranking order of the reference genes obtained using the different algorithms. In conclusion, GAPDH, RPL4, and PPIA were the three most stable genes in frozen boar spermatozoa, as determined based on the cycle threshold coefficient of variation (Ct CV%) and the comprehensive ranking order, and this finding is consistent with the BestKeeper results (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We studied aboveground litterfall, litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics for two years in two subtropical bamboo ecosystems in Southwest China so as to test the hypothesis that litter quality determine the rate and nutrient dynamics during decomposition of different litter fractions. Mean annual total aboveground litter production ranged from 494 to 434 g m(-2) in two bamboo stands (P stand, dominated by Pleioblastus amarus and H stand, hybrid bamboo dominated by Bambusa pervariabilis x Dendrocalamopsis daii). Bulk (similar to 80%) of litter production was contributed by leaf litter in two stands followed by twigs and sheathes. Different litter fractions represented considerable variations in the rates of mass loss and nutrient release. Variation of the mass remaining after 2 years of decomposition was significantly explained by initial C/N ratio and initial P concentration. Initial concentrations of N, P, Ca, and Mg explained 57.9%, 95.0%, 99.8% and 98.1%, respectively, of the variations of these elements mass remaining after 2 years of decomposition. The patterns of nutrient dynamics and the final amount remaining were mainly determined by their initial litter substrate quality in these two subtropical bamboo plantations.

Multilocus sequence typing employing four micro and minisatellites (MS1, MS3, MS4 and MS7) and ITS were used to analyze population structure of 85 isolates successfully amplified at all five loci, which yielded 59 multilocus genotypes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was measured using both multilocus sequences and allelic profile data. The observation of strong and significant LD with limited recombination in multilocus sequence analysis indicated the presence of overall clonal population structure of E. bieneusi, which was supported by allelic profile data analysis. Fu's selective neutrality test demonstrated the absence of neutral mutations and molecular selection. The population structure of common ITS genotypes (CM1, Type IV and D) was compared. Strong LD in multilocus sequence analysis versus insignificant LD and/or LE in allelic profile data analysis implied epidemic population in common ITS genotypes. No significant genetic isolation was evidenced by either phylogenetic or substructural analyses. The population genetics was also compared among the sub-population 1 (contained mainly genotype Type IV), sub-population 2 (contained mainly genotypes CM1 and D), sub-population 3 (contained mixed genotypes) and sub-population 4 (contained genotype Henan V). The presence of strong LD in multilocus data analysis with insignificant LD and/or LE in allele profile data analysis suggested the epidemic population in sub-populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Association of myostatin (MSTN) gene polymorphisms with morphological traits in the Italian Heavy Draft Horse breed	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Myostatin gene; SNP; Cold-blooded horse; Morphological traits	OPTIMUM RACING DISTANCE; THOROUGHBRED RACEHORSES; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; POPULATION; EXPRESSION; PROGRAM; MAMMALS	The myostatin (MSTN) gene encodes a protein well known as a negative regulator of muscle mass in mammalian species. In a previous study, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the equine MSTN gene that could be associated with variability of morphological traits in different horse breeds. In this study we carried out a first evaluation of the association of MSTN gene with morphological traits and body measurements obtained at adult age in the Italian Heavy Draft Horse (IHDH), an autochthonous cold-blooded breed currently selected for meat production and for heavy draught. We genotyped 202 horses for four SNPs of the MSTN gene: two located in the promoter (GQ193900:g.26T > C and GQ193900:g.156T > C) and two in the first intron (GQ193900: g.2077T > C and GQ193900:g.2115A > G). Minor allele frequencies of SNPs varied from 0.118 to 0.148. The haplotype [g.26T:g.156T:g.2077T:g.2115A] showed the greater frequency (0.596). Biometric measurements of three body measurements (height at withers, chest girth, and cannon bone circumference) and 14 linear type data related to general aspects (head size and expression, temperament/blood, frame size, fleshiness and bone incidence), trunk (thorax depth, fore diameter, rear diameter, upper line length, and upper line direction) and feet and legs (e.g. side and back view of rear legs, fore and rear feet) were used in the association study. Among the investigated SNPs, the GQ193900:g.26T > C polymorphism was the most interesting as it resulted associated with cannon bone circumference (P nominal=0.001) and side view of rear legs (P nominal=0.006) and suggestively associated with fleshiness (P nominal = 0.027). In silico transcription factors binding sites (TFBSs) prediction located putative TFBSs involved in growth and differentiation of multiple cell types, including myoblasts and osteoblasts in the SNP positions, suggesting that the analyzed SNPs could play a functional role. Gene expression studies should be carried out to verify this hypothesis. Further association studies in the present and other heavy horse breeds are needed to confirm the effects of MSTN polymorphisms on morphological traits, and potentially apply these markers in breeding programs to improve selection efficiency for muscularity and strength in horses.

At day 84 of gestation, a total of 58 PIC sows at five-parity were randomly assigned to two groups receiving diets containing organic iron complex (n=33) and ferrous sulfate (n=25). According to a 2 x 2 factorial design of treatments, nursing pigs (2.09 +/- 0.34 kg) within a given litter were divided into two groups and given either an injection with or without iron (0 vs. 200 mg/pig) on day three of lactation. The feeding trial lasted for 51 days, including 30 days of gestation and 21 days of lactation. The results showed that organic iron complex did not improve the reproductive performance of sows or the growth performance of piglets. In particular, nursing pigs injected with iron had greater individual body weight at day 21 of lactation compared to pigs that were not treated with iron (P < 0.05). Compared with ferrous sulfate, organic iron complex significantly increased the Cu content in mature milk (P < 0.01), and the serum iron concentration at day one of lactation (P < 0.05), as well as ceruloplasmin activity at day 21 of lactation (P < 0.01). Piglets from sows fed organic iron complex tended to have a greater total iron binding capacity (P = 0.08) and ceruloplasmin activity (P = 0.05) at day 10 of lactation, and tended to have a higher concentration of hemoglobin (P=0.08), total iron binding capacity (P < 0.01) and serum iron (P < 0.01) at day 21 of lactation compared with piglets from sows fed ferrous sulfate. Piglets injected with iron had a greater red blood cell count (P < 0.01), hemoglobin (P < 0.01), serum iron (P < 0.01) and total iron binding capacity (P < 0.05) at day 10 and 21 of lactation compared to piglets that were not treated with iron. In conclusion, organic iron complex had minor positive effects on the iron status of sows and nursing pigs, but did not significantly improve the performance of sows and their offspring. Therefore, attempts to replace the commonly used Fe injection with a maternal organic iron complex dietary supplement failed to prevent iron-deficiency anemia of nursing pigs. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

In this study, Aegilops sharonensis was successfully hybridized to three tetraploid wheat species with crossability varying from 0.86 to 1.76 %. F1 hybrids were verified by their display of intermediate characteristics in morphology, cytology, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles. The exogenous x- and y-type subunits of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits of Ae. sharonensis were expressed in F1 hybrid seeds and showed identical electrophoretic mobilities to those originally present in Ae. sharonensis. In F2 hybrids, the x-type subunit migrated faster, indicating that a decrease in molecular mass had occurred. Cloning of the open reading frames of subunit variants revealed that the x-type subunit had protein sequence variations, including single residue mutations, and insertions and deletions involving one or more repeat motifs. The two deletions causing the size reduction of the exogenous x-subunits of Ae. sharonensis in the F2 seeds were most likely the result of slip-mismatching.

Previous studies noted a marked variation in the number of Tas2r genes among species, but the underlying cause is unclear. To address this question, we compile the Tas2r gene repertoires from 41 mammals, 4 birds, 2 reptiles, 1 amphibian, and 6 fishes. The number of intact Tas2r genes varies from 0 in the bottlenose dolphin to 51 in the Western clawed frog, with numerous expansions and contractions of the gene family throughout vertebrates, especially among tetrapods. The Tas2r gene number in a species correlates with the fraction of plants in its diet. Because plant tissues contain more toxic compounds than animal tissues do, our observation supports the hypothesis that dietary toxins are a major selective force shaping the diversity of the Tas2r repertoire.

In the studies, our objective is to reveal the expression patterns of MyHC genes in longissimus dorsi (Ld), semitendinosus (Se) and soleus (Sol) of Simmental hybrids cattle, and their association with intramuscular fat (IMF) content and meat shearing force (MSF). The muscle tissue of Ld, Se and Sol were collected from 6, 12 and 36-month old Simmental hybrids respectively, then the expression levels of MyHCs were examined by real-time PCR, at the same time, IMF, MSF and muscle type were measured with chemical assessment, shearing force measurer and immunostaining respectively. Our results showed that t Ld, Se, and Sol expressed MyHC-I, MyHC-IIa and MyHC-IIx isoforms but not MyHC-IIb, furthermore MyHC-I, MyHC-IIa and MyHC-IIx had different expression patterns in different skeletal muscle. The expression of MyHC-I in Se and Sol, MyHC-IIa in Ld, Se, and Sol, and MyHC-IIx in Sol was decreased with increasing age. The highest expression of MyHC-I in Ld, and MyHC-IIx in Ld and Se was observed in 12-month-old animals. The percentage of type-IIa fiber approximately occupied 70-80 % among various muscle fiber of Ld, Se and Sol. The percentage of different type fiber was not related to IMF content and MSF, but the expression levels of MyHC-I and MyHC-IIa were negatively related to IMF content (r = -0.724, and -0.681, respectively) and MSF (r = -0.672, and -0.641, respectively). The expression level of MyHC-IIx was also negatively related to MSF (r = -0.655). In conclusion, MyHC gene might be considered as a negative factor in genetic selection of IMF content and MSF.

However, its mechanism of synthesis is not fully understood, especially in terms of the expression and regulation of the starch synthetic genes. It was reported that the starch synthetic genes were co-expressed during maize endosperm development; however, the mechanism of the co-expression was not reported. In this paper, the ZmaNAC36 gene was amplified by homology-based cloning, and its expression vector was constructed for transient expression. The nuclear localization, transcriptional activation and target sites of the ZmaNAC36 protein were identified. The expression profile of ZmaNAC36 showed that it was strongly expressed in the maize endosperm and was co-expressed with most of the starch synthetic genes. Moreover, the expressions of many starch synthesis genes in the endosperm were upregulated when ZmaNAC36 was transiently overexpressed. All our results indicated that NAC36 might be a transcription factor and play a potential role in the co-expression of starch synthetic genes in the maize endosperm.

The majority of cereal endosperm AGPase is located in the cytosol with a minor portion in amyloplasts, in contrast to its strictly plastidial location in other species and tissues. To investigate the potential functions of plastidial AGPase in maize (Zea mays) endosperm, six genes encoding AGPase large or small subunits were characterized for gene expression as well as subcellular location and biochemical activity of the encoded proteins. Seven transcripts from these genes accumulate in endosperm, including those from shrunken2 and brittle2 that encode cytosolic AGPase and five candidates that could encode subunits of the plastidial enzyme. The amino termini of these five polypeptides directed the transport of a reporter protein into chloroplasts of leaf protoplasts. All seven proteins exhibited AGPase activity when coexpressed in Escherichia coli with partner subunits. Null mutations were identified in the genes agpsemzm and agpllzm and shown to cause reduced AGPase activity in specific tissues. The functioning of these two genes was necessary for the accumulation of normal starch levels in embryo and leaf, respectively. Remnant starch was observed in both instances, indicating that additional genes encode AGPase large and small subunits in embryo and leaf. Endosperm starch was decreased by approximately 7% in agpsemzm- or agpllzm- mutants, demonstrating that plastidial AGPase activity contributes to starch production in this tissue even when the major cytosolic activity is present.

However, the miRNA species have not been explored for rice (Oryza sativa) immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the most devastating fungal pathogen in rice production worldwide. Here, by deep sequencing small RNA libraries from susceptible and resistant lines in normal conditions and upon M. oryzae infection, we identified a group of known rice miRNAs that were differentially expressed upon M. oryzae infection. They were further classified into three classes based on their expression patterns in the susceptible japonica line Lijiangxin Tuan Hegu and in the resistant line International Rice Blast Line Pyricularia-Kanto51-m-Tsuyuake that contains a single resistance gene locus, Pyricularia-Kanto 51-m (Pikm), within the Lijiangxin Tuan Hegu background. RNA-blot assay of nine of them confirmed sequencing results. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the expression of some target genes was negatively correlated with the expression of miRNAs. Moreover, transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR160a and miR398b displayed enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, as demonstrated by decreased fungal growth, increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation at the infection site, and up-regulated expression of defense-related genes. Taken together, our data indicate that miRNAs are involved in rice immunity against M. oryzae and that overexpression of miR160a or miR398b can enhance rice resistance to the disease.

They shared an extra glutamine in the N-terminal and LAAQLPAMCRL peptides in the C-terminal with x-type HMW glutenins but had different N-terminal lengths. Like other y-type HMW glutenins, Chiy2 and Racy had 104 (or 105) amino acid (aa) residues at the N-terminal and started with EGEASR, whereas Chiy1 had 99 aa in this domain and started with QLQCER because of the deletion of EGEASR. Five other y-type glutenins, including those from Elymus ciliaris, Pseudoroegneria libanotica, and Leymus mollis, were similar to Chiy1. The ORF of Chiy2 was probably not expressed. The ORFs of both Chiy1 and Racy were expressed in bacteria. The maximum likelihood phylogenic tree based on the signal peptide and N-terminal and C-terminal aa residues revealed two clades of y-type HMW glutenins in Triticeae; the first contained Ay, By, Cy, Dy, Eey, Gy, Ky, Ry, Tay, and Uy, while the second clade contained the remaining y types, including those from Leymus. Within the second clade, HMW glutenins lacking the EGEASR peptide formed a subclade. These y-type HMW glutenins in Leymus could not be targeted to the Xm or Ns genome.

The new taxon was studied based on morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses of three nuclear loci, i.e., the internal transcribed spacer rDNA operon (ITS), and large and small subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA (nuc28S rDNA, nuc18S rDNA). The analyzed Trematosphaeria species were clustered in several clades within the Pleosporales and the genus was shown to be polyphyletic. The new species is introduced as Trematosphaeria terricola, and it is characterized by short-papillate ascomata with suborbicular ostiolum, 3-septate, cinnamon-brown, fusiform ascospores with narrowly rounded ends, verruculose at maturity. Trematosphaeria terricola is compared with morphologically similar species T. confusa, T. mangrovis, and T. pertusa, which differ from the former species in the number of septa, and the shape and size of the ascospores with or without a sheath. This is the first report of a Trematosphaeria isolate from alpine soil in China.

This regulation confers spatial specificity to signal initiation and transduction in eukaryotic cells and thus is fundamental to the viability of all eukaryotic organisms. Here, we developed a simple and rapid method in which activity of putative NLSs or NESs was reported by subcellular localization of two tandem fluorescent proteins in fusion with the respective NLSs or NESs after agroinfiltration-mediated transient expression in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb). We further demonstrated that the predicted NES from amino acid residue (aa) 9 to 22 and the NLS from aa91 to 101 in the broad-spectrum disease resistance protein RPW8.2 possess nuclear export and import activity, respectively. Additionally, by testing overlapping fragments covering the full length of RPW8.2, we identified another NLS from aa65 to 74 with strong nuclear import activity and two tandem non-canonical NESs in the C-terminus with strong nuclear export activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated the utility of a simple method to evaluate potential NLSs and NESs in plant cells and suggested that RPW8.2 may be subject to opposing nucleocytoplasmic trafficking forces for its subcellular localization and functional execution.

However, their roles in abiotic stresses are still not well known in chrysanthemum. Here, we isolated a novel WRKY gene, DgWRKY1, from chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum). DgWRKY1 contains one WRKY domain and one C2H2 zinc-finger motif (C-X-4-C-X-23-H-X-H), and was localized in the nucleus. Expression of DgWRKY1 was up-regulated by drought, salinity, and ABA. The DgWRKY1-overexpression tobacco plants were more tolerant to salt, and seed gerrmination was more sensitive to ABA, than the wild-type (WT). The transgenic lines exhibited less accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) under salt stress, and less antioxidant enzyme activity, including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), than the WT under both control conditions and salt stress. In addition, there was greater up-regulation of the ROS-related enzyme genes (NtSOD, NtPOD, and NtCAT) in transgenic lines under normal or salt conditions. These findings suggest that DgWRKY1 plays a positive regulatory role in salt stress response.

We have found that expression of miR-27a and myostatin were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during myoblast differentiation. Overexpression of miR-27a increased the number of myosin heavy chain (MHC)-positive cells and upregulated mRNA and protein of MyoD and myogenin.

In China, diagnosis of P. cuniculi is currently based on conventional clinical methods that entail numerous disadvantages, including their failure to diagnose subclinical infections. Hence, alternative measures are required, and dot-ELISA is one of the most promising strategies. We cloned and expressed the recombinant P.cuniculi troponin C gene for use as a basis for novel dot-ELISA assay to detect P. cuniculi infections in rabbits. This amplified sequence encoded a 153 amino acid protein of 17.6 kDa and theoretical pI 4.18 without signal peptide. The recombinant troponin C of P. cuniculi is an outer membrane protein and may also be a new P.cuniculi allergen. Results of dot-ELISA test showed that this novel assay had more than 90% sensitivity but low specificity in distinguishing infections with P.cuniculi or Sarcoptic scabiei, despite very high agreement between observers (97-99%; values ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 for inter- and intra-observer variability test). This study showed that this novel method, at present, lacks diagnostic utility. Therefore, although simple serological assays such as dot-ELISA show great promise as diagnostic tools, we suggest that troponin C is not a suitable diagnostic antigen candidate.

A. altissima bark extract was obtained by ethanol thermal circumfluence and tested at four concentrations (1.0, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 g/ml) on mites collected from rabbits. Compared to the fenvalerate treatment group, the A. altissima bark exhibited significant acaricidal properties for both mite species treated. The extract of concentrations of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml killed all tested S. scabiei within 7 h, however, only 1.0 and 0.5 g/ml of extract killed all treated P. cuniculi. The median lethal time (LT50) values at 1, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml were 0.60, 0.78, 1.48 h for S. scabiei and 0.74, 1.29, 3.33 h for P. cuniculi. The median lethal concentration (LC50) for P. cuniculi was approximately 1.6 times that for S. scabiei var. cuniculi at 4 h. The extract showed stronger toxicity against S. scabiei than against P. cuniculi. Mortality rates increased with increasing concentration of extract administered and with increasing time post-treatment, indicating that the acaricidal activity of A. altissima bark extract is both time-dependent and dose-dependent. This is the first report on acaricidal activity of A. altissima against P. cuniculi and S. scabiei var. cuniculi. It indicates that A. altissima contain potential acaricidal compounds. Our study is the first step to develop potentially novel compounds from A. altissima for the effective control of mites in livestock.

Recent studies have suggested a crucial role for mammalian sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in regulating lipid metabolism and cell proliferation, so we hypothesize that resveratrol -activated and nicotinamide -inhibited SIRT1 acts goose hepatocellular lipid metabolism and cell proliferation by mTOR signal pathway. Here we show that both resveratrol and nicotinamide could evidently affect the DNA synthesis rate, the lipids accumulation, the mRNA level and protein content of genes involved in the lipids metabolism, mTOR signal pathway, and the cell cycle progression of goose primary hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin decreased the effect of nicotinamide on lipids accumulation and cell proliferation. These findings suggest that SIRT1 functions as a regulator for mTOR signaling and plays an essential role in the regulation of hepatocyte lipid metabolism and cell proliferation.

To avoid the risk of OTA consumption, the detection and quantitation of OTA level are of great significance. Based on the fact that ssDNA aptamer has the ability to form a double-strand structure with its complementary sequence, a simple and rapid aptamer-based label-free approach for highly sensitive and selective fluorescence detection of OTA was developed by using ultra-sensitive double-strand DNA specific dyes PicoGreen. The results showed that as low as 1 ng/mL of OTA could be detected with a dynamic range of more than 5 orders of magnitude which satisfies the requirements for OTA maximum residue limit in various food regulated by European Commission. With the specificity of aptamer, the assay exhibited high selectivity for OTA against two other analogues (N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine and zearalenone). We also tested the aptasensor practicability using real sample of 1% beer spiked with a series of concentration of OTA and the results show good tolerance to matrix effect. All detections could be achieved in less than 30 min, which provides a simple, quick and sensitive detection method for OTA screening in food safety and could be easily extend to other small molecular chemical compounds detection which aptamer has been selected.

Development of prediction models for quantification of total methane emission from enteric fermentation of young Holstein cattle at various ages	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Methane emission; Young Holstein cattle; Prediction model	DAIRY-COWS; BEEF-CATTLE; ENERGY; CONCENTRATE; SILAGE; IMPACT	Methane (CH4) emissions from ruminant animals contribute significantly to the global greenhouse gas budget. The accurate quantification of this source of emissions requires detailed animal and feed information, however there is little information available on systematic measurement of CH4 emissions from young cattle at various ages. The present study was designed to address this gap of knowledge. Data used were derived from a study with 20 Autumn-calved Holstein cattle (10 steers and 10 heifers) with CH4 emissions measured at age of 6, 12, 18 and 22 months, respectively. The cattle were offered a typical diet used on UK commercial farms containing a single grass silage mixed with concentrates. In each period, the cattle were housed as a single group in cubicle accommodation for the first 20 days, individually in metabolism units for the next 3 days, and then in indirect open-circuit respiration calorimeter chambers for the final 5 days with feed intake, feces and urine outputs and gaseous exchange measured during the final 4 days. Within each period, gender had no effect (P>0.05) on nutrient digestibility and any CH4 emission variable in terms of total CH4 emission, CH4 emission as a proportion of live weight or feed intake, or CH4 energy output as a proportion of energy intake. The data from the two groups were therefore pooled to develop prediction equations for daily CH4 emissions (g day(-1)). A range of prediction equations have been developed using BW (body weight), feed intake and energy intake. The present data were also used to calculate accumulated CH4 emissions for the two genders. Although gender had no effect (P>0.05) on the results, the accumulated CH4 emissions increased with the growth of cattle (mean 36.2 and 64.3 kg year(-1) for both genders in years 1 and 2, respectively). A number of prediction equations were developed for total CH4 emission factors (kg year(-1)) for heifers and steers during the first and second year of the rearing. These factors were very strongly related to (r(2) = 0.75-0.95) to BW recorded at the beginning, middle and the end of 1 or 2 year of age. These data can add novel information to the scientific literature and can be used to improve national inventories of CH4 emissions and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies for young Holstein cattle of high genetic merit herds.

Influence of natural organic matter on transport and retention of polymer coated silver nanoparticles in porous media	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						PVP coated silver nanoparticle; Transport in porous medium; Differential organic matter effect; Humic acid; Cysteine	IRON-OXIDE; HUMIC-ACID; MICROSPHERE DEPOSITION; AGGREGATION KINETICS; IONIC-STRENGTH; SATURATED SAND; PARTICLE-SIZE; SURFACE; NANOMATERIALS; ADSORPTION	Interactions between organic matter (OM) and engineered polymer coatings as they affect the retention of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were studied. Two distinct types of OM-cysteine representing low molecular weight multivalent functional groups, and Suwannee River Humic Acid (HA) representing high molecular weight polymers, were investigated with respect to their effects on particle stability in aggregation and deposition. Aggregation of the PVP coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) was enhanced by cysteine addition at high ionic strengths, which was attributed to cysteine binding to the AgNPs and replacing the otherwise steric stabilizing agent PVP. In contrast the addition of HA did not increase aggregation rates and decreased PVP-AgNP deposition to the silica porous medium, consistent with enhanced electrosteric stabilization by the HA. Although cysteine also reduced deposition in the porous medium, the mechanisms of reduced deposition appear to be enhanced electric double layer (EDL) interaction at low ionic strengths. At higher ionic strengths, aggregation was favored leading to lower deposition due to smaller diffusion coefficients and single collector efficiencies despite the reduced EDL interactions.

The objectives of this project were to identify ghrelin gene organization, study tissue specific ghrelin mRNA expression and investigate the short- (0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 h post-fasting) and long- (1, 3, 5, 7 days) term fasting as well as refeeding after a 7 day fasting induced changes in the expression of ghrelin mRNA in Schizothorax davidi. Our reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the predicted ghrelin sequence available in the GenBank and identified ghrelin mRNA expression in several tissues including the gut, liver, brain, heart, spleen, head kidney, gill and muscle. Quantitative PCR studies indicated that the expression level of ghrelin mRNA presented ascendant trend in short-term fasting group compared to the fed group, but it did not reach the significant level on statistics, while there is a significant increase in ghrelin mRNA expression in the gut of Schizothorax davidi fasted for 3, 5 and 7 days when compared to the expression in ad libitum fed fish. Refeeding after a 7 day fasting caused a significant and dramatic decrease in ghrelin mRNA expression in the gut of Schizothorax davidi. An increase in the expression of ghrelin mRNA during fasting, and its decrease following refeeding suggests an orexigenic role for ghrelin in Schizothorax davidi. Overall, our results provide evidence for a highly conserved structure and biological actions of ghrelin during evolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Extensive studies of miRNAs have been performed in model plants such as rice and Arabidopsis thaliana. In maize, most miRNAs and their target genes were analyzed and identified by clearly different treatments, such as response to low nitrate, salt and drought stress. However, little is known about miRNAs involved in maize ear development. The objective of this study is to identify conserved and novel miRNAs and their target genes by combined small RNA and degradome sequencing at four inflorescence developmental stages. Results: We used deep-sequencing, miRNA microarray assays and computational methods to identify, profile, and describe conserved and non-conserved miRNAs at four ear developmental stages, which resulted in identification of 22 conserved and 21-maize-specific miRNA families together with their corresponding miRNA*. Comparison of miRNA expression in these developmental stages revealed 18 differentially expressed miRNA families. Finally, a total of 141 genes (251 transcripts) targeted by 102 small RNAs including 98 miRNAs and 4 ta-siRNAs were identified by genomic-scale high-throughput sequencing of miRNA cleaved mRNAs. Moreover, the differentially expressed miRNAs-mediated pathways that regulate the development of ears were discussed. Conclusions: This study confirmed 22 conserved miRNA families and discovered 26 novel miRNAs in maize. Moreover, we identified 141 target genes of known and new miRNAs and ta-siRNAs. Of these, 72 genes (117 transcripts) targeted by 62 differentially expressed miRNAs may attribute to the development of maize ears. Identification and characterization of these important classes of regulatory genes in maize may improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling ear development.

A recent report based on the study of DELLA-producing reduced height (Rht) genes in wheat and barley also hypothesized that DELLA genes likely increased susceptibility to necrotrophs but increased resistance to biotrophs. Results: Effects of uzu, a non-GA (gibberellic acid)-responsive semi- dwarfing gene, on Fusarium crown rot (FCR) resistance in barley were investigated. Fifteen pairs of near isogenic lines for this gene were generated and assessed under two different temperature regimes. Similar to its impacts on plant height, the semi-dwarfing gene uzu also showed larger effects on FCR severity in the high temperature regime when compared with that in the low temperature regime. Conclusions: Results from this study add to the growing evidence showing that the effects of plant height on Fusarium resistances are unlikely related to DELLA genes but due to direct or indirect effects of height difference per se. The interaction between these two characteristics highlights the importance of understanding relationships between resistance and other traits of agronomic importance as the value of a resistance gene could be compromised if it dramatically affects plant development and morphology.

Swine plays an important role as a carrier of this pathogen. In this study we determined the prevalence and characteristics of STEC from healthy swine collected between May 2011 and August 2012 from 3 cities/provinces in China. Results: A total of 1003 samples, including 326 fecal, 351 small intestinal contents and 326 colon contents samples, was analyzed. Two hundred and fifty five samples were stx positive by PCR and 93 STEC isolates were recovered from 62 stx-positive samples. Twelve O serogroups and 19 O:H serotypes including 6 serotypes (O100: H2O/[ H2O], O143: H38/[ H38], O87: H10, O172:H30/[H30], O159:H16, O9: H30/[ H30]) rarely found in swine and ruminants were identified. All 93 STEC isolates harbored stx(2) only, all of which were stx(2)e subtype including 1 isolate being a new variant of stx(2)e. 53.76%, 15.05% and 2.15% STEC isolates carried astA, hlyA and ehxA respectively. Four STEC isolates harbored the high-pathogenicity island. Of the 15 adherence-associated genes tested, 13 (eae, efa1, iha, lpfA(O113), lpfAO157/OI-154, lpfAO(157/OI-141), toxB, saa, F4, F5, F6, F17 or F41) were all absent while 2 (paa and F18) were present in 7 and 4 STEC isolates respectively. The majority of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline (79.57%), nalidixic acid (78.49%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.12%) and kanamycin (55.91%). The STEC isolates were divided into 63 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and 21 sequence types (STs). Isolates of the same STs generally showed the same or similar drug resistance patterns. A higher proportion of STEC isolates from Chongqing showed multidrug resistance with one ST (ST3628) resistant to 14 antimicrobials. Conclusions: Our results indicate that swine is a significant reservoir of STEC strains in China. Based on comparison by serotypes and sequence types with human strains and presence of virulence genes, the swine STEC may have a low potential to cause human disease.

Changes in quality, antioxidant compounds and DPPH radical-scavenging activity of Rosa hybrida flowers during development	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						antioxidant activity; flower quality; maturation; rose flower; antioxidants	EDIBLE FLOWERS; DAYLILY FLOWERS; EXTRACTS; PHENOLICS; CULTIVAR; CAPACITY; MATURITY; PLANTS	The antioxidant activity of rose petals harvested at six different stages of flower development was determined for two different-coloured cultivars, 'Carola' and 'Iceberg'. Antioxidant assayed included phenolic compounds, vitamins and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH). Significant variation in antioxidant properties and quantity was observed at six different maturity stages, but there was no significant difference in antioxidant activity between the two cultivars. Correlation analysis indicated that total phenols, total flavonoids, vitamin C and vitamin E might be the main contributors to the antioxidant activity of rose petal extracts. DPPH radical-scavenging activity peaked in the early bloom stage, and flowers in this stage possessed the highest functional benefits of all maturity stages.

Thirty crossbred piglets weaned at 21days of age were randomly assigned to three groups receiving diets containing true ileal digestible threonine (TIDT) at 0.74, 0.89 and 1.11% for 14days. On day 8, all pigs were injected intramuscularly with SPLV or sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. SPLV injection enhanced serum IgA, IgM, IgG, IFN-, IL-1, TNF- and IL-10 concentrations (p<0.05) and stimulated the relative mRNA abundance of Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9) in different tissues (p< 0.05). Under no challenge, increasing dietary TIDT levels enhanced serum IgG (p<0.05), IgM (p=0.07) and IFN- (p< 0.05) concentration, tended to decrease serum IL-1, TNF- and IL-10 concentration, and regulated relative mRNA abundance of TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9 in different tissues (p<0.05). However, there was a synergistic role for increasing the serum IL-10 concentration between dietary TIDT levels and SPLV injection (p< 0.05). Under SPLV challenge, increasing dietary TIDT levels attenuated the increase of the serum IFN- concentration, and the increase of the relative mRNA abundance of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 in the different tissues (p<0.05). These results suggest that an appropriate dietary threonine supplementation could improve the immune status of weaned pigs injected with SPLV by down-regulating the expression of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 in tissues, and thus regulating T-helper cytokine secretion.

GMCS was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and potentiometric titration. The results reveal that nano-Fe3O4 was stably cross-linked with the corn straw, and the carboxyl on the MCS surface was modified. GMCS was used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB). Several factors affecting MB adsorption on MCS and GMCS, namely, pH, contact time, initial MB concentration, and reaction temperature were investigated. The adsorption capability of GMCS for MB was observed to be superior to that of MCS. The maximum adsorption capacity of GMCS for MB (196.46mgg(-1)) was attained with an initial MB concentration of 300mgL(-1) at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C for a contact time of 60min. The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm equation. Desorption and regeneration experiments were conducted, and the recovery efficiencies were maintained between 90 and 70% using absolute ethanol as eluent.

Two experiments were conducted in this study. The first was to investigate the deposition and depletion of melamine in blood and tissues of pigs exposed to adulterated feed with high doses of melamine. A total of 500 or 1000mgkg(-1) melamine was added to the diet for fattening pigs (initial BW=+/- 60.24kg). Melamine residues were detected in tissues (brain, duodenum, liver, heart, muscle and kidney) by LC-MS/MS. Dose-dependent effects were found between melamine residual concentration and its dose in feed. Five days after the withdrawal of melamine from the diets, the residue concentration in tissues fell below 2.5mgkg(-1). In the second experiment, blood samples were taken at different time points from fattening pigs (BW=100kg) fed with adulterated feed with 1000mgkg(-1) of melamine for 42days. Results from the pharmacokinetics analysis showed that it would take 83h for the melamine level in plasma depleting to the safe level of 50ngml(-1) after an expose of 1000mgkg(-1) melamine contaminated feed for 42days.

In the past few decades, aluminum (Al) toxicity has become one of biggest stress factors in the production and growth of Chinese fir, although this species prefers an acidic environment. To date, the selection of indicator species for Al toxicity remains critical in the field, and Al toxicity has not been successfully treated by artificially controlling Chinese fir plantations. To assess the Al toxicity risk, the height of the dominant tree, the concentration of calcium (Ca2+)/Al3+ in soil solution, and the concentration of Ca2+/[Ca2+ + iron (Fe3+) + Al3+] in litter leached organic acids were introduced. The results indicated that eight plots had suffered Al toxicity. The threshold of Al toxicity was 37.53 mg kg(-1) in soil or 1.39 mmol L-1 in soil solution, a pH of 4.15, a Ca2+/(Ca2+ + Fe3+ + Al3+) molar ratio of 0.487, and a Ca2+/Al3+ molar ratio of 1.599. The positive effects of exogenous nutrition (Ca, phosphorus [P], and nitrogen [N]) on the growth of Cunninghamia lanceolata seedlings was also studied in pot experiments based on results in the field. The cation nutrition can lead to detoxification, and the exogenous nutrition thresholds were Ca2+/Al3+ 2.8, phosphorus (P)/Al3+ 4.4, ammonium (NH4 (-))-nitrogen (N)/Al3+ 4.5. The data presented in this study are very helpful for the understanding of the degree of Al toxicity and have notable significance for the management of Chinese fir plantations.

The optimal extraction parameters were obtained by using a Box-Behnken design as follows: extraction temperature 88.9 degrees C, extraction time 128.2 min and ratio of water to solid 11.4 mL/g. The crude HMP was sequentially purified by chromatography of DEAE-52, and two purified fractions, HMP-1 and HMP-2, were obtained. HMP-1 and HMP-2 were mainly composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose and mannose with the molecular weight of 133 and 100 kDa, respectively. For antioxidant activities in vitro, HMP-1 had strong 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing activity power (FRAP). These results provide a scientific basis for the further use of polysaccharides from this traditional herb tea. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The first ORF encoded 743 amino acids. It had a deduced molecular mass of 84.5 kDa and 73.2% identity with Cry54Aa1 protein as indicated by amino acid homology. This cry gene was designated as cry54Ab1 by the Bt Toxin Nomenclature Committee. The second ORF encoded 503 amino acids and had a deduced molecular mass of 58.2 kDa. It is here called as orf2. The whole cry54Ab1 operon, cry54Ab1 and orf2 were digested with BamHI/SalI and inserted into a shuttle vector, pSTK. The recombinant plasmids were transferred into an acrystalliferous mutant Bt HD73(-). Parasporal inclusions were observed only under expression of the whole cry54Ab1 operon. The bioassay experiments showed that expressed products of the cry54Ab1 and the whole cry54Ab1 operon were all toxic to Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera).

The development of theory and technology in proteomics has provided new ideas and research fields for cancer research. Proteomics can be used not only for elucidating the mechanisms of carcinogenesis focussing on whole proteins of the tissue or cell, but also seeking the biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy of cancer.

Development-related expression patterns of protein-coding and miRNA genes involved in porcine muscle growth	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Muscle growth; Porcine; Expression pattern; qRT-PCR	SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; MICRORNAS; DIFFERENTIATION; DISEASE; ATROPHY; CELLS; MICE	Muscle growth and development is associated with remarkable changes in protein-coding and microRNA (miRNA) gene expression. To determine the expression patterns of genes and miRNAs related to muscle growth and development, we measured the expression levels of 25 protein-coding and 16 miRNA genes in skeletal and cardiac muscles throughout 5 developmental stages by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The Short Time-Series Expression Miner (STEM) software clustering results showed that growth-related genes were downregulated at all developmental stages in both the psoas major and longissimus dorsi muscles, indicating their involvement in early developmental stages. Furthermore, genes related to muscle atrophy, such as forkhead box 1 and muscle ring finger, showed unregulated expression with increasing age, suggesting a decrease in protein synthesis during the later stages of skeletal muscle development. We found that development of the cardiac muscle was a complex process in which growth-related genes were highly expressed during embryonic development, but they did not show uniform postnatal expression patterns. Moreover, the expression level of miR-499, which enhances the expression of the beta-myosin heavy chain, was significantly different in the psoas major and longissimus dorsi muscles, suggesting the involvement of miR-499 in the determination of skeletal muscle fiber types. We also performed correlation analyses of messenger RNA and miRNA expression. We found negative relationships between miR-486 and forkhead box 1, and miR-133a and serum response factor at all developmental stages, suggesting that forkhead box 1 and serum response factor are potential targets of miR-486 and miR-133a, respectively.

Sequence- related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were used to analyze and estimate the genetic variability, level of diversity, and relationships among 20 cultivars and strains of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). Eighteen SRAP primer combinations generated 334 amplification bands, of which 298 were polymorphic. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.4715 (me10 + em1) to 0.5000 (me5 + em7), with an average of 0.4921. The genetic similarity coefficient ranged from 0.4304 to 0.8529, and coefficients between 0.65 and 0.90 accounted for 90.00%. The cluster analysis separated the accessions into five groups partly according to their germplasm resource origins.	[Huang, L. K.; Jiang, X. Y.; Zhang, X. Q.; Miao, J. M.; Yan, H.

In this study, the optimized hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) modified florfenicol microcrystals with small particle size and high solubility were successfully prepared by an improved solvent-antisolvent recrystallization method, and the morphology of microcrystals was investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the original drug has two crystal forms, but one form for microcrystals. For florfenicol microcrystals, an accelerated dissolution velocity and increased saturation solubility were achieved in vitro and a markedly different pharmacokinetic property in vivo was exhibited with magnified area under the curve (AUC) compared with the original drug. These results implied that developing florfenicol as HPMC modified microcrystals is a promising choice for oral delivery and further clinical application.

The present study investigated the acute and subchronic toxicity of eucalyptus oil emulsion in water (EOE). In addition, we conduct safety pharmacology evaluation of EOE to supplement the toxicity tests and provide a basis for a comprehensive understanding of the toxicity of EOE. Acute administration of EOE was done as single dose from 2772 mg to 5742 mg of EOE per kg/bodyweight (b.wt.) and subchronic toxicity study for thirty days was done by daily oral administration of EOE at doses of 396, 792 and 1188 mg/kg b.wt. In SPF SD rats. The acute toxicity study showed the LD50 of EOE was 3811.5 mg/kg. The subchronic toxicity study suggested the high-dose and middle-dose EOE slowed down the growth of male rats. The clinical pathology showed the high-dose and middle-dose EOE could cause damage to liver and kidney. The safety pharmacology indicated that EOE had no side effects on rats. These results suggest that EOE is a safe veterinary medicine for external use.

The influence of the essential oil on histological changes and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) production associated with carrageenan-induced rat paw edema was also investigated. The essential oil (0.5, 0.25, 0.13 ml/kg b.w.) showed significantly inhibition of inflammation along with a dose-dependent manner in the three experimental models. The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oil was occurred both in early and late phase and peaked at 4 h after carrageenan injection. The essential oil resulted in a dose dependent reduction of the paw thickness, connective tissue injury and the infiltration of inflammatory cell. The essential oil also significantly reduced the production of PGE(2), histamine and 5-HT in the exudates of edema paw induced by carrageenan. Both the essential oil and indomethacin resulted relative lower percentage inhibition of histamine and 5-HT than that of PGE(2) at 4 h after carrageenan injection.

In order to segment the PCB photoelectric image better, on the basis of the traditional Otsu algorithm, considering the different influence of image segmentation about the factors of the distance between target and background as well as each kind of cohesion, an improved Otsu algorithm is proposed, and its basic principle and segmentation advantages are analyzed in detail. In order to evaluate these segmentation results impersonally by using different algorithms, the quantitative criteria of gray-level contrast and district interior uniformity are adopted to evaluate these segmentation results impersonally. Finally, the different segmentation experiment contrasts of PCB photoelectric image between our algorithm and other algorithms is executed, the results of experiment indicate that our algorithm has relatively better segmentation quality.

In the past two decades the number of birdwatchers throughout China has greatly increased, resulting in wider coverage of forest sites, and consequently more sightings of this species have been documented. We found several accounts where observations have been overlooked, leading to an underestimate of the distribution of the species in mainland China. Our review indicates that it occurs in eight continental provinces, one autonomous region and on the islands of Hainan and Taiwan, and at present its range extends over more than 20,000 km(2); the lowest altitude at which it has been recorded is 70 m in Anhui and the highest is 3,250 m in Yunnan	[Lei, Zhu; Sun Yue-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang Xiao-Nong; Guang, Hao] Sichuan Agr Univ, Dept Biol & Sci, Yaan 625014, Peoples R China; [Qin, Huang] Zhejiang Museum Nat Hist, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu Tian-Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dai Zi-Yue; Qian, Wei] China Bird Watch, Beijing 100026, Peoples R China; [Lewthwaite, Richard W.] Hong Kong Bird Watching Soc, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Lei, Z (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.	sunyh@ioz.ac.cn						59	0	0	0	4	ORIENTAL BIRD CLUB	BEDFORD	P.

Such a tool would need to be standardized for practical and routine use in a breeding program with large numbers of plants. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum time for measuring ear moisture using this meter. In a split-plot design with three replicates in 2007, 2008 and 2009, ear moisture of six inbred lines and eight F-1 hybrids were measured weekly from one to eight weeks post-silking using a modified MT808 moisture meter. To determine if multiple ear moisture readings (EMRs) could be made on the same ear, an additional treatment was added so that all eight readings were made on the same ear. There was a positive correlation between weekly EMRs readings done on separate ears and those done on the same ear, indicating that repeated readings, if desired, could be made on the same ear. Significant genotypic differences in EMRs were found five to eight weeks post-silking. The EMRs at week one, five, and eight could be used to calculate a daily drydown rate (DDR). Maize genotypes (hybrids and inbreds) could be divided into four groups based on their DDRs during development as: high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low DDRs from weeks one to five and five to eight, respectively. Genotypes with higher DDRs from weeks one to five tended to have overall higher DDRs by eight weeks post-silking. Inbred lines with higher DDRs at either stage expressed this trait in their hybrid crosses. This non-destructive method will improve selection for fast kernel drydown in maize breeding programs, especially in short-season areas.

The exon/intron structures and motif compositions of these WRKY genes were highly conserved in each subfamily suggesting their functional conservation. Moreover, based on qTellier analyses, the majority of these WRKY genes showed a specific temporal and spatial expression pattern. These WRKY genes, within the same group, manifested a distinct expression, indicating a similar function in their expression during the evolutionary process; this is reflected by their sub-functionalizations in their expression pattern concerning leaf developmental gradient, while mature bundle sheath, and mesophyll cells had a similar cellular localization and modality of expression. This study has also provided evidence of the presence of a subset of WRKY genes exhibiting a putative functional role in leaf sheath when infected with Rhizoctonia solani. This finding appears helpful for future functional investigations to unravel the roles of WRKY genes in plant pathogen resistance. Interestingly, in this study we have identified three WRKY genes that are predicted to be potential targets of miR160 and miR171b families. Therefore, this finding appears relevant in elucidating the biological functions of these transcription factors to clarify the molecular mechanisms affecting leaf sheath growth and development during fungal infection and plant resistance.

This study was conducted to detect temporal variation and quantify the potential factors causing changes in rill erodibility by using natural, undisturbed soil samples collected from two grasslands and one bare soil near Beijing, China. Sampling was at similar to 20-day intervals from April to October 2011. Soil detachment capacity by concentrated flow was measured in a hydraulic flume with the fixed bed under six different flow shear stresses to determine rill erodibility. Root mass density was measured to analyse potential effects on temporal variability in rill erodibility. Mean rill erodibility of bare soil was 13.2 and 19.6 times greater than under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis). The temporal variability in rill erodibility under grasslands differed significantly from that of bare soil. Distinctive temporal variation patterns were found throughout the growing season. Rill erodibility declined as root density increased, and the rill erodibility of grassland could be well estimated from the measured erodibility of bare soil and root density (R-2 >= 0.92).

Impacts of freezing and thawing dynamics on foliar litter carbon release in alpine/subalpine forests along an altitudinal gradient in the eastern Tibetan Plateau	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; SUB-ALPINE FORESTS; DECOMPOSITION RATES; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SUBALPINE/ALPINE FORESTS; EXTRACTION METHOD; TUNDRA; CLIMATE; QUALITY; TEMPERATURE	Carbon (C) release from foliar litter is a primary component in C exchange among the atmosphere, vegetation, soil and water from respiration and leaching, but little information is currently related to the effects of freezing and thawing dynamics on C release of foliar litter in cold regions. A 2-year field litter decomposition experiment was conducted along an altitudinal gradient (similar to 2700 to similar to 3600 m) to mimic temperature increases in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. C release was investigated for fresh foliar litter of spruce, fir and birch. The onset of the frozen stage, deep frozen stage and thawing stage was partitioned according to changes in the freezing and thawing dynamics of each winter. More rapid 2-year C released from fresh foliar litter at upper elevations compared to lower elevations in the alpine/subalpine region. However, high C release was observed at low altitudes during winter stages, but high altitudes exhibited high C release during growing season stages. The deep frozen stage showed higher rates of C release than other stages in the second year of decomposition. Negative-degree days showing freezing degrees were correlated to C release rates for the deep frozen stages in both years, and this relationship continued for the duration of the experiment, indicating that changes in freezing can directly modify C release from foliar litter. The results suggested that the changed freezing and thawing dynamics could delay the onset of C release in fresh litter in this cold region in the scenario of climate warming.

Experiments were carried out in potted plants treated with (NH4)(2)CO3, Cd(NO3)(2), CdCl2 and CdCl2 plus (NH4)(2)CO3. After treatment, plant height, biomass, chlorophyll content, the precursors content and GS(2) were investigated. Results showed that the plants treated with cadmium showed toxicity symptoms, decrease in growth and Chl content. Cd inhibited Chl synthesis seriously by blocking the site located on the steps between UrogenIII and Coprogen III. However, the plants treated with cadmium and nitrogen grew well without any toxicity symptoms. Nitrogen supplement can alleviate Cd inhibition on chlorophyll synthesis by unblocking the pathway. The results indicated that nitrogen can effectively alleviate cadmium toxicity to poplar plants.

J	He, JY; Li, C; Wu, G				He, Jiao-Yu; Li, Cheng; Wu, Guo			Discovery of potential drugs for human-infecting H7N9 virus containing R294K mutation	DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY			English	Article						H7N9; neuraminidase; mutation; virtual screening; inhibitor	FREE-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; INFLUENZA-A VIRUS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; DOCKING; SIMULATION; RESISTANCE; THERAPY; ALGORITHM	Background: After the first epidemic wave from February through May 2013, the influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and has followed a second epidemic wave since June 2013. As of June 27, 2014, the outbreak of H7N9 had caused 450 confirmed cases of human infection, with 165 deaths included. The case-fatality rate of all confirmed cases is about 36%, making the H7N9 virus a significant threat to people's health. At present, neuraminidase inhibitors are the only licensed antiviral medications available to treat H7N9 infections in humans. Oseltamivir is the most commonly used inhibitor, and it is also a front-line drug for the threatening H7N9. Unfortunately, it has been reported that patients treated with oseltamivir can induce R294K (Arg294Lys) substitution in the H7N9 virus, which is a rare mutation and can reduce the antiviral efficacy of inhibitors. Even worse, deaths caused by such mutation after oseltamivir treatment have already been reported, indicating that the need to find substitutive neuraminidase inhibitors for currently available drugs to treat drug-resistant H7N9 is really pressing. Materials and methods: First, the structure of H7N9 containing the R294K substitution was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, and structural information of approved drugs was downloaded from the ZINC (ZINC Is Not Commercial) database. Taking oseltamivir carboxylate as a reference drug, we then filtered these molecules through virtual screening to find out potential inhibitors targeting the mutated H7N9 virus. For further evaluation, we carried out a 14 ns molecular dynamic simulation for each H7N9-drug complex and calculated the binding energy for each candidate drug. Results: We found five inhibitors that could be candidate drugs for treating the mutated H7N9 virus. Docking poses showed these drugs could bind to the virus effectively, with the contribution of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. With regard to the molecular dynamic simulations, receptor-ligand complexes formed by these candidate drugs were more stable than the one formed by oseltamivir carboxylate. The binding energy of oseltamivir carboxylate was-122.4 kJ/mol, while those for these potential inhibitors were-417.5, -404.7, -372.2, -304.3, and -289.9 kJ/mol, much better than the reference drug. Conclusion: Given the current and future threat of the mutated H7N9 virus, it is urgent that potent drugs and effective antiviral therapeutics be found. Our study therefore is able to complement currently available drugs for influenza A infectors and helps to prevent the ongoing threat of H7N9 virus.

The gldJ gene was conserved in RA, and it had a typical TATA promoter region and AU-rich sequence within the 5' untranslated region. The GldJ protein was an outer-membrane lipoprotein with a signal peptide cleavage site between amino acids 20 and 21. GldJ was also a member of proteins involved in gliding motility. The RA GldJ protein had 16 phosphorylation sites and 4 N-glycosylation sites. These functional sites played an important role in the posttranslational modification of the GldJ protein. In addition, the GldJ protein of RA CH-1 had strong immunogenicity. Fifteen B-cell epitopes were identified in the GldJ protein, which might be a good biological material for the development of a subunit vaccine and diagnostic reagents. The GldJ protein also had the activity of formylglycine-generating sulfatase enzyme. The 3-dimensional structure models of GldJ were constructed based on 2 templates using the SwissModel automatic modeling mode in the SWISS-MODEL workplace. Here, we characterized the RA gldJ gene and GldJ protein to contribute to the functional annotation for the GldJ protein.	[Yuan, B.; Cheng, A. C.; Wang, M.

Diversity resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp Tritici in rye chromosome arm 1RS expressed in wheat	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Triticum aestivum; Secale cereale; 1BL.1RS translocation; Puccinia striiformis f. sp Tritici pathotypes; Diversity of R-genes	DISEASE RESISTANCE; BREAD WHEAT; STRIPE RUST; PLANT-RESISTANCE; POWDERY MILDEW; ADDITION LINES; AESTIVUM L; GENES; TRANSLOCATIONS; IDENTIFICATION	The 1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation contained in the Russian cultivar Aurora has been the most widespread alien translocation in wheat-breeding programs all over the world. However, following the prevalence of new biotypes of the pathogens, disease-resistance genes in this translocation chromosome have been overcome and consequently they have been eliminated in modern wheat-breeding programs. In this paper, we report on 12 new primary 1BL.1RS translocation lines derived from the crosses of a Chinese high yield wheat cv. Mianyang 11 with three rye cultivars collected from China. GISH, C-banding and PCR techniques using the specific primers for 1BS, 1RS and centromeres of wheat and rye were applied to identify the constitution of chromosomes. The results confirmed that all 1BL.1RS chromosomes in the 12 primary translocation lines contained integrated 1RS chromosome arms. In the resistance analysis using five kinds of Pst pathotypes, the 12 primary translocation lines showed diversity resistance to stripe rust, which contained at least five different new genes (alleles), significantly different from the Yr9 gene coming from Russian wheat cultivar Aurora. The results indicated that the chromosome arm 1RS in the rye population carries abundant yet untapped genes (alleles) for resistance to wheat stripe rust, which would originate from the neutral diversity in the natural population of rye. It is suggested that creating more primary translocation lines in genome modification will be extremely important to use the diversity of alien R-genes, which was generated by long-term neutral mutation and maintained in the population of alien species.

Isolation of the P5CS gene from reed canary grass and its expression under salt stress	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Reed canary grass; P5CS; Gene clone; Salt stress	INCREASES PROLINE PRODUCTION; 1ST 2 STEPS; DELTA(1)-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; VIGNA-ACONITIFOLIA; PLANTS; BIOSYNTHESIS; ACCUMULATION; TOLERANCE; ENERGY	Reed canary grass (RCG) is a perennial grass traditionally cultivated for forage. It is also used as fuel to produce energy in Finland and Sweden, and other countries have expressed interest in the cultivation of RCG. In China, arable land is limited. Salinity is considered to be a major factor limiting plant crop development and productivity. To boost biofuel production of RCG and extend its range in saline soil, we seek to improve its salt tolerance. Proline acts as an osmolyte that accumulates when plants are subjected to abiotic stress. P5CS plays a crucial role in proline biosynthesis. We isolated a P5CS gene from RCG, designated B231P5CS (GenBank accession No. JQ622685). B231P5CS is a fragment (971 bp) that encodes a 323-amino acid polypeptide. We also cloned an actin gene fragment from RCG as a reference gene in expression analysis of B231P5CS gene. Expression analysis revealed that B231P5CS transcripts were upregulated in leaves after treatment with salt (200 mM NaCl) and that transcript levels of B231P5CS reached a maximum 12 h after exposure, which was 14.69 times the level in control plants. The trends of expression were exactly opposite in roots; transcripts were downregulated after salt treatment. Proline concentration increased in leaves after stress. In contrast, proline content of roots decreased up to 3.6-fold relative to controls. Changes in proline concentration after stress were correlated with B231P5CS expression. Our results suggest that B231P5CS is a stress-inducible gene and plays a non-redundant role in plant development. This gene may be used to improve stress tolerance of RGC and other bioenergy feedstock.	[Cong, L. L.; Yang, F. Y.; Liu, S. J.; Zhang, Y.

The commercial Texel sheep are more muscular than the indigenous Ujumqin sheep. Results: We performed serial transcriptomics assays and systems biology analyses to investigate the dynamics of gene expression changes associated with fetal longissimus muscles during different fetal stages in two sheep breeds. Totally, we identified 1472 differentially expressed genes during various fetal stages using time-series expression analysis. A systems biology approach, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), was used to detect modules of correlated genes among these 1472 genes. Dramatically different gene modules were identified in four merged datasets, corresponding to the mid fetal stage in Texel and Ujumqin sheep, the late fetal stage in Texel and Ujumqin sheep, respectively. We further detected gene modules significantly correlated with fetal weight, and constructed networks and pathways using genes with high significances. In these gene modules, we identified genes like TADA3, LMNB1, TGF-beta 3, EEF1A2, FGFR1, MYOZ1, and FBP2 correlated with fetal weight. Conclusion: Our study revealed the complex network characteristics involved in muscle development and lipid metabolism during fetal development stages. Diverse patterns of the network connections observed between breeds and fetal stages could involve some hub genes, which play central roles in fetal development, correlating with fetal weight. Our findings could provide potential valuable biomarkers for selection of body weight-related traits in sheep and other livestock.

In the present study, the Cap gene that defect the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of DuCV was amplified and connected to the express vector pET-32a (+), to express the recombinant Cap protein in the bacterium Escherichia coli Rosetta. The recombinant Cap protein was purified and an indirect ELISA method was developed based on the recombinant Cap protein. The results showed that the truncated Cap gene was 567 bp and cloned into pET-32a (+) vector successfully. The recombinant Cap protein was expressed as inclusion bodies. The results of optimization for indirect ELISA revealed that the optimal antigen and serum dilutions were selected to be 4 mu g/well and 1: 40, respectively; the coating condition was 37 degrees C for 1 h and 4 degrees C overnight; the blocking time in 1% BSA was 1 h at 37 degrees C and the second antibody dilution was 1: 800, the cut-off value was 0.352. Known anti-sera samples of other duck common pathogens were tested by the developed ELISA and the results showed it was specific for DuCV anti-sera detection.

Methods: By using recombinant cholera toxin subunit B (rCTB) as an adjuvant, hens received intramuscular injection immunization for continuous 7 times at an interval of 14 days. Then, the eggs were collected; IgY was purified. Results: On day 49 after hens were immunized, levels of two antibodies all reached 1:12800; after they were purified by Ammonium sulfate precipitation, their purity was over 80%. IgY-Hp could inhibit Hp growth and inhibit Hp urease activity; although in vitro, IgY-IB could not inhibit Hp growth but could inhibit Hp urease activity. The experiments in vivo found that when IgY-Hp or IgY-IB with sucralfate dual oral therapy was used to treat Hp infected mouse model, the cure rate all could reach 83.3%. Conclusion: According to immunization procedure, high titer specific IgY antibody (1:12800) can be obtained in 49 days and its titer remains stable. Oral administration of the specific IgY antibodies in Hp infected mice can reach a cure rate of 83.3%, and the antibodies are expected to become new drugs and therapeutic methods of targeted therapy against Hp infection.

Here, BEL-7402 cells were treated with various concentrations (40, 80, 160, 320 and 640 mu g/ml) of gamma-terpineol for 48 h, cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-thiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromides (MTT) assay. Cell colony inhibition was determined by soft agar assay. Apoptosis and possible molecular mechanisms were evaluated by morphological observation, flow cytometry analysis, and DNA fragmentation assay. The gamma-terpineol significantly suppressed BEL-7402 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Characteristic morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis such as cells shrinkage, deformation and vacuolization of mitochondria, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies were observed after BEL-7402 cells treated with gamma-terpineol for 24 h and 48 h. Cell cycle were displayed by flow cytometry analysis, the gamma-terpineol treatment resulted in accumulation of cells at G(1) or S phase and a blockade of cell proliferation compared to control group. Treating BEL-7402 cells with 320 mu g/ml of gamma-terpineol for 36 h and 48 h, a typical apoptotic "DNA ladder" was observed using DNA fragmentation assay. The present study demonstrated that possible anti-cancer mechanism of gamma-terpineol on human hematomas cells is through inducing cell apoptosis to suppress tumor cell growth.

Increasing the bioavailable concentrations of essential elements in the edible portions of crops is an effective resolution to address this issue. To determine the genetic factors controlling micronutrient concentration in wheat, the quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for iron, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium concentrations in two recombinant inbred line populations was performed. In all, 39 QTLs for five micronutrient concentrations were identified in this study. Of these, 22 alleles from synthetic wheat SHW-L1 and seven alleles from the progeny line of the synthetic wheat Chuanmai 42 showed an increase in micronutrient concentrations. Five QTLs on chromosomes 2A, 3D, 4D, and 5B found in both the populations showed significant phenotypic variation for 2-3 micronutrient concentrations. Our results might help understand the genetic control of micronutrient concentration and allow the utilization of genetic resources of synthetic hexaploid wheat for improving micronutrient efficiency of cultivated wheat by using molecular marker-assisted selection.

We sought to investigate whether FST promotes the proliferation of myoblasts through the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling. In the present study, we transfected the pEGFP-duFST plasmid and added PI3K and mTOR inhibitors to the medium of duck primary myoblasts. Then, we analysed the cellular phenotypic changes that occurred and analysed the expression of target genes. The results showed that FST promoted myoblast proliferation, induced the mRNA expression of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6K (S6 kinase) and the protein expression of phospho-Akt (Thr(308)), mTOR, phospho-mTOR (serine 2448), phospho-S6K (Ser(417)), inhibited the mRNA expression of FoxO1, MuRF1 (muscle RING finger-1) and the protein expression of phospho-FoxO1 (Ser(256)). Moreover, we found that the overexpression of FST could alleviate the inhibitory effect of myoblast proliferation caused by the addition of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the overexpression of duck FST also relieved the inhibition of myoblast proliferation caused by the addition of rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling. In light of the present results, we hypothesize that duck FST could promote myoblast proliferation, which is dependent on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling.

A total of 80 weaned piglets (PIC 327 x 1050, 26 +/- 2 days old, 6.20 +/- 0.10 kg) were randomly allocated into 2 groups, 5 pens per each group and 8 piglets per each pen, receiving control diet and diet with inclusion of 4% YP at the expenses of fish meal (YP diet) for a period of 28 days. The diets were formulated to contain similar nutrient levels. Compared with control, piglets fed YP diet had markedly higher overall average daily growth (+14%, P < 0.05) and lower final feed conversion ratio (-8%, P < 0.01). Concentrations of serum serine, cystathionine, histidine, hydroxyproline, and urea were decreased in piglets fed YP diet (P < 0.05), whereas alanine and aspartate were increased (P < 0.01). Moreover, serum antioxidant enzyme activity (glutathione peroxidase) was markedly increased (+19%, P < 0.01) in piglets fed YP diet relative to piglets fed control diet. In addition, feeding YP diet considerably (P < 0.05) increased the copy numbers of lactobacilli and total bacteria in the colon of piglets at the end of the experiment. Furthermore, the mRNA abundance of innate immunity-related genes (TLR4, NF-kappa B1, and IL-6) was increased (P < 0.06) in the ileum of piglets fed YP diet. Collectively, results of this study indicated that diet with the inclusion of YP improved growth performance and partially enhanced anti-oxidative capability as well as intestinal innate immunity of weaning piglets.

The poplar plants were grown in a Hoagland nutrient solution and treated with extra N, Cd, and N + Cd. After treatment, plant growth and chlorophyll content were recorded. The oxidative stress, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and the expression of related genes were also examined. The results indicated the plants treated with sole Cd presented obvious toxicity symptoms, i. e. growth inhibition, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and chlorophyll content decrement. However, when N was added to the plants under Cd stress, plant growth was enhanced, chlorophyll synthesis was promoted, and the oxidative stress was alleviated. Further, the expression of antioxidant enzymes genes was upregulated by N. The results indicated that N partially reversed the toxic effect of Cd on poplar plants, which can provide new methodology to enhance the phytoremediation technology for heavy metal pollution soil.

Such stress results in damage to cellular antioxidant defense, suboptimal livestock health conditions, and decrease in production efficiency. Spermine supplementation is known to have the potential to mitigate the effects of oxidative stress. However, the systematic changes in metabolic biochemistry associated with oxidative stress and spermine intervention remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the effects of oxidative stress and spermine supplementation on the metabolism of weaned rats. Rats received intragastric administration of either 0.4 mmol g(-1) body weight of spermine or saline solution for 3 days. The rats in each treatment were then intraperitoneally injected with diquat at 12 mg kg(-1) body weight or sterile solution. The 24 h urine and 48 h plasma samples after the last spermine ingestion were analyzed by using nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics. Spermine supplementation and diquat injection can change common systemic metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism, glucose and energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, as well as gut microbiota functions. Moreover, diquat can induce oxidative stress and alter bile acid metabolism. Under oxidative stress, spermine supplementation could partially counteract the metabolite changes induced by oxidative stress, including amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. This study demonstrates the importance of spermine supplementation in regulating the metabolism of weaned rats.

With application of new research techniques such as high-throughput sequencing, the biological functions of LncRNAs are gradually becoming to be understood. Multiple studies have shown that LncRNAs serve as carcinogenic factors or tumor suppressors in breast cancer with abnormal expression, prompts the question of whether they have potential value in predicting the stages and survival rate of breast cancer patients, and also as therapeutic targets. Focusing on the latest research data, this review mainly summarizes the tumorigenic mechanisms of certain LncRNAs in breast cancer, in order to provide a theoretical basis for finding safer, more effective treatment of breast cancer at the LncRNA molecular level.

As a basis for comparison, the first, multiagent Stackelberg model has been structured based on perfect rationality. Further, fairness preference theory will be embedded in marketing channel multiagent Stackelberg model, and the results show that if the retailers have a jealous fairness preference, the manufacturer will reduce the wholesale price, retailers will increase the effort level, product sales will be increased, and the total channel utility and manufacturers' utility will be pareto improvement, but the pareto improvement of retailers' utility is associated with the interval of jealousy fairness preference coefficient. If the retailers have a sympathetic fairness preference, the manufacturer increases wholesale price, retailers reduce the effort level, and the total channel utility, manufacturer's utility, and retailers' utility are less than that of the no fairness preference utility.

Transcript analysis showed that the highest transcript levels were detected for CtFAD3 and the low transcript levels were detected for CtFAD7 and CtFAD8 in flowers. This result indicates that CtFAD3 enzyme activity is important for fatty acid desaturation in flowers. The low transcript level of CtFAD3 in developing seeds was consistent with the recorded high level of linoleic acid (18:2) and lack of linolenic acid (18:3) in safflower seed oil. At low temperatures, the induced transcription levels of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes in the stems and petioles were consistent with increased polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In the roots, omega-3 fatty acid desaturase noticeably increased at low temperatures, whereas PUFA levels decreased. Interestingly, C18:3(Delta 9,12,15) alcohol was specifically found in safflower roots, and showed a significant increase, indicating a flux in the acid to alcohol ratio of this compound in safflower roots.

Distribution of H-FABP and ACSL4 gene polymorphisms and their associations with intramuscular fat content and backfat thickness in different pig populations	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Pig; H-FABP; ACSL4; Polymorphism; Intramuscular fat content; Backfat thickness	MEAT QUALITY TRAITS; ACID-BINDING PROTEINS; PORK LOIN CHOPS; TECHNOLOGICAL VALUE; CANDIDATE GENES; DANISH PIGS; SUS-SCROFA; ADIPOCYTE; LANDRACE; GROWTH	Here, we analyzed the distribution of H-FABP/(HinfI, MspI, and HaeIII) and ACSL4/RsaI polymorphisms, and the associations of these 4 polymorphic loci with intramuscular fat (IMF) content and backfat thickness (BFT) in Yanan, Jinhua, Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire, and Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) (DLY) pigs. H-FABP/HinfI polymorphisms were present in all the 6 populations. At the ACSL4/RsaI locus, sows had 3 genotypes, whereas boars only had haplotype A or G, in Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire, and DLY pigs. H-FABP/(MspI and HaeIII) and ACSL4/RsaI polymorphisms were absent in Yanan and Jinhua pigs. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that the 3 loci (HinfI, MspI, and HaeIII) were separated. Association analysis showed that the H-FABP/HinfI locus significantly affected IMF content in DLY (P < 0.05) and Yanan (P < 0.001) pigs. The highest IMF content was recorded in the adH haplotype of the 3 H-FABP polymorphic loci (2.59%, P < 0.05) in DLY pigs. At the ACSL4/RsaI locus, higher IMF content was recorded for sows with a GG genotype or boars with a G haplotype compared to those with an AA genotype (2.53 vs 2.10%, P < 0.05) or A haplotype (2.48 vs 1.73%, P < 0.01) in DLY pigs. Significant differences were not obtained among these 4 polymorphic loci and BFT (P > 0.05). The results indicate that H-FABP and ACSL4 genes might serve as markers to improve IMF content (but not BFT) in the pig breeding system.	[Chen, J. N.; Jiang, Y. Z.; Cen, W. M.; Xing, S. H.; Wen, A.

Improvement in the carcass traits and meat quality of growing-finishing Rongchang pigs by conjugated linoleic acid through altered gene expression of muscle fiber types	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Conjugated linoleic acid; Meat quality; Pig Muscle fiber; Gene expression	SKELETAL-MUSCLE; FAT; MECHANISMS; GROWTH; TISSUE; PORK; CLA	A total of 160 Rongchang pigs (26.76 +/- 1.78 kg) were randomly assigned to 5 dietary treatment groups until their body weight (BW) reached 90 kg. The diets were supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Our results showed that the 1.0 to 2.0% CLA-fed pigs had less back fat deposition when their BW reached 90 kg than the pigs that received less than 1% CLA. During the 30 to 60 kg growing period, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% CLA treatments improved pork quality by significantly reducing the pork pH (P < 0.01) and color value (P < 0.05), but they increased marble scaling (P < 0.01). Similarly, the 1.5 and 2.0% CLA-fed pigs had more marble than other pigs when their BW reached 90 kg. Furthermore, CLA significantly affected the expression of muscle fiber-type genes. The 1.5% CLA-fed pigs exhibited the highest mRNA expression of MyHC1 and MyHC2a (P < 0.05) at 60 kg BW. At 90 kg BW, the highest expression of MyHC1 and MyHC2a (P < 0.05) was found in the 2.0% CLA group. However, MyHC2x was downregulated in the CLA-fed pigs at this time. In addition, CLA supplements did not evidently alter mRNA expression of MyHC2b at all times. These results demonstrate that CLA could affect carcass traits and improve the meat quality of growing-finishing pigs by altering the expression of genes related to muscle growth and development; 1-1.5% CLA was the most appropriate CLA dose.

Genetic diversity and relationship of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) using sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Chicory; Cluster analysis; Genetic diversity; Genetic relationship; Sequence-related amplified polymorphism	AFLP MARKERS; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; CULTIVATED CHICORY; SRAP ANALYSIS; WILD CHICORY; SSR MARKERS; GERMPLASM; BIOSYNTHESIS; POPULATIONS; IMPROVEMENT	Chicory is a crop with economically important roles and is cultivated worldwide. The genetic diversity and relationship of 80 accessions of chicories and endives were evaluated by sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers to provide a theoretical basis for future breeding programs in China. The polymorphic rate was 96.83%, and the average polymorphic information content was 0.323, suggesting the rich genetic diversity of chicory. The genetic diversity degree of chicory was higher (G(S) = 0.677) than that of endive (G(S) = 0.701). The accessions with the highest genetic diversity (effective number of alleles, N-E = 1.609; Nei's genetic diversity, H = 0.372; Shannon information index, I = 0.556) were from Italy. The richest genetic diversity was revealed in a chicory line (N-E = 1.478, H = 0.289, I = 0.443) among the 3 types (line, wild, and cultivar). The chicory genetic structure of 8 geographical groups showed that the genetic differentiation coefficient (G(ST)) was 14.20% and the number of immigrants per generation (N-m) was 3.020. A G(ST) of 6.80% and an N-m of 6.853 were obtained from different types. This observation suggests that these chicory lines, especially those from the Mediterranean region, have potential for providing rich genetic resources for further breeding programs, that the chicory genetic structure among different countries obviously differs with a certain amount of gene flow, and that SRAP markers could be applied to analyze genetic relationships and classifications of Cichorium intybus and C. endivia.

To exploit Huahui 1 to develop a new Bt rice, the insertion site of the Bt gene was determined by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR). Bt was located in the promoter region of LOC.Os10g10360, approximately 5.35 Mb from the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 10. For the first time, a Bt cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) system was developed by introgressing Bt from Huahui 1. The recipient CMS system used consisted of Indonesia paddy rice-type II-32B (maintainer line) and II-32A (male sterile line). Marker-assisted selection was used to increase selection efficiency in the backcrossing program. In BC5F1, the Bt plant 85015-8 was selected for further analyses, as it had the highest SSR marker homozygosity. In addition, the linkage drag of the foreign Bt gene in 85015-8 was minimized to 8.01-11.46 Mb. The foreign Bt gene was then delivered from 85015-8 into II-32A. The resultant Bt II-32A and Bt II-32B lines were both resistant to lepidopteran in field trials, and agronomic traits were not disturbed. The maintainability of II-32B, and the male sterility and general combining ability of II-32A, were not affected by the Bt introgression. This study demonstrates a simple and fast approach to develop Bt hybrid rice.

To achieve better air quality and landscape, planting appropriate grass species in severe SO2 polluted areas is very critical. Cynodon dactylon, a widely used warm season turfgrass species, has good SO2-tolerant ability. In this study, we selected 9 out of 38 C. dactylon accessions from Southwest China as representatives of high, intermediate SO2-tolerant and SO2-sensitive accessions to comparatively analyze their physiological differences in leaves under SO2 untreated and treated conditions. Our results revealed that SO2-tolerant C. dactylon accessions showed higher soluble sugar, proline, and chlorophyll a contents under both SO2 treated and untreated conditions; higher chlorophyll b and carotenoid under SO2 treated condition; lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, oxidative damages, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities under SO2 treated condition; and higher peroxidase (POD) activities under SO2 untreated condition. Further results indicated that SO2-tolerant C. dactylon accessions had higher sulfur contents under both SO2 treated and untreated conditions, consistent with higher SO activities under both SO2 treated and untreated conditions, and higher SiR activities under SO2 treated condition. Taken together, our results indicated that SO2 tolerance of C. dactylon might be largely related to soluble sugar, proline and chlorophyll a contents, and SO enzyme activity.

According to the maturity degree of raw materials, Hawk tea can usually be divided into three types: Hawk bud tea (HB), Hawk primary leaf tea (HP), and Hawk mature leaf tea (HM). In this study, some of the bioactive constituents and antioxidant properties of the three kinds of Hawk tea infusions were comparatively investigated. The results showed that the contents of total flavonoids, vitamin C, and carbohydrates inHawk bud tea infusion (HBI) were higher than those inHawk primary leaf tea infusion (HPI) and Hawkmature leaf tea infusion (HMI). HPI had higher contents of total polyphenols and exhibited better DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing activity power. HBI could provide more effective protection against erythrocyte hemolysis. As age is going from bud to mature leaf, the ability to inhibit the formation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) conjugated diene and the loss of tryptophan fluorescence decreased.

In this work, we describe the characterization of a third gene (AcSERK3) in this family. AcSERK3 had all the characteristic domains and shared extensive sequence homology with other plant SERKs. AcSERK3 expression was studied by in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR to analyze its function. Intense in situ hybridization signals were observed only in single competent cells and competent cell clusters; no hybridization signal was detected in the subsequent stages of somatic embryogenesis. AcSERK3 was highly expressed in embryogenic callus compared to other organs, e. g., 20-80 fold more than in anther but similar to that of non-embryogenic callus, which was 20-50 fold that of anther. AcSERK3 expression in root was 80 fold higher than in anther and the highest amongst all organs tested. These results indicate that AcSERK3 plays an important role in callus proliferation and root development. His-tagged AcSERK3 protein was successfully expressed and the luminescence of His6-AcSERK3 protein was only similar to 5% of that of inactivated AcSERK3 protein and reaction buffer without protein, and 11.3% of that of an extract of host Escherichia coli pET-30a. This finding confirmed that the AcSERK3 fusion protein had autophosphorylation activity.

The use of principal component analyses and hierarchical cluster analyses in the quality evaluation of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge	QUALITY ASSURANCE AND SAFETY OF CROPS & FOODS			English	Article						hierarchical cluster analyses; principal component analyses; Salvia miltiorrhiza	DANSHEN; DISEASE; LEAVES	Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) are quite useful chemometrics tools for the data analysis in many fields. In China P.R., Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge is a traditional medicinal plant. Due to the unique action of its biologically active compounds in treating cardiovascular disease, S. miltiorrhiza was planted in many regions as the local economic crop. The roots, which are also called 'Danshen', were the original economical products. In this study, PCA and HCA were used to determine the quality of Danshen from two aspects, namely, agronomic traits and active compounds. PCA revealed that the first principal component cumulatively accounted for 50.1% of the total variance in the data set, while PC2 and PC3 explained 20.0 and 13.1%, respectively. The quality descending order of all samples obtained by PCA was as follows: tissue culture lobular Danshen, tissue culture broad leaf Danshen, short stalk and lobular leaf Danshen, broad leaf Danshen, lobular Danshen, and white leaf Danshen. Samples were classified into three main groups by HCA. Therefore, based on the provisions in the Chinese pharmacopoeia about the content of tanshinone IIA, ZD was considered the best line for the farmers. The research showed that PCA and HCA also could be used in the quality evaluation of medicinal crops.	[Jiang, Y. Y.; Zhong, G. C.; Wang, T.; Wang, M.; Zhang, L.; Ding, C. B.; Yang, R. W.; Wang, X.

The [6:6] structure is more stable than the [5:6] isomer for all of the studied heterofullerenes. Among the title heterofullerenes, C58Zn has the largest heat of formation, and shows low thermal stability due to a great expansion deformation of the C-58 cage. For open-shell heterofullerenes, the spin densities are localized on the TM atoms, except for C58Sc and C58Cu in which the spin densities are delocalized over the C-58 cage. The QTAIM analyses indicate that the TM-C bonds show a partial covalent characteristic. The degree of covalence slightly increases from left to right across the 3d-block of the periodic table. The chemical reactivity of the studied heterofullerenes can be tuned by substituted TM atoms, deduced from frontier molecular orbitals and Fukui function analyses. The Fukui function also shows that the earlier TM-substituted species, C58Ti, C58V, C58Cr and C58Mn, are more active than other heterofullerenes. The adsorption of ethylene molecules on heterofullerenes is investigated to probe the chemical reactivity of the studied heterofullerenes; the fact that earlier TM atoms show greater reactivity than later TM atoms is in excellent agreement with Fukui function predictions. Moreover, the adsorption energies (E-ads) of earlier TM-substituted heterofullerenes are comparable to that of the previously reported C58Ir(C2H4) complex.
