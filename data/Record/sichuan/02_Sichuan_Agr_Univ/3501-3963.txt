Characterization and Classification of gamma-Gliadin Multigene Sequences from Aegilops Section Sitopsis	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						wheat; Aegilops; seed storage protein; gamma-gliadin	WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; GLUTENIN SUBUNITS; DISULFIDE BONDS; BREAD WHEAT; DURUM-WHEAT; B-GENOME; GENES; QUALITY; IDENTIFICATION	The most abundant seed storage proteins of wheat are gliadins and glutenins. Gliadins, including alpha/beta, gamma and omega types, are normally monomeric proteins and account for about 50% of the gluten proteins. In this study, 55 sequences of gamma-gliadin genes were obtained from species of Sitopsis section, the deduced B genome donors of wheat. Despite the high sequence similarities to the known gamma-gliadin genes, extensive variations were also found. Using the extensive sequence information deposited in database and obtained in this study, a comprehensive classification of the gamma-gliadin multigene families were performed based on the primary structures and phylogenic analysis. All the gamma-gliadin genes analyzed could be divided into 2 types, which contain 8 and 9 cysteines, respectively. Type I (with 8 cysteines) and type II (with 9 cysteines) are further classified to 7 and 4 groups, respectively, and several subgroups are also identified. The genes derived from A, B and D genomes of common wheat were clustered distinctly, indicating that there was apparent genomic specificity in gamma-gliadins genes. Besides the high homology between gamma-gliadin genes from Sitopsis species and B genome of wheat, some unique groups or subgroups were also identified in Sitopsis section, suggesting that it could be considered as a valuable source of gamma-gliadin genes. The comparison of deduced primary structures of each group and/or subgroup was conducted, from which their evolution and quality properties were also speculated.	[Huang, Z.; Wei, Y. M.; Qi, P.

Here we use the General Ensemble biogeochemical Modeling System to simulate the terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics in the Jinsha watershed of China's upper Yangtze basin from 1975 to 2000, based on unique combinations of spatial and temporal dynamics of major driving forces, such as climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, and land use and land cover changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the Jinsha watershed ecosystems acted as a carbon sink during the period of 1975-2000, with an average rate of 0.36 Mg/ha/yr, primarily resulting from regional climate variation and local land use and land cover change. Vegetation biomass accumulation accounted for 90.6% of the sink, while soil organic carbon loss before 1992 led to a lower net gain of carbon in the watershed, and after that soils became a small sink. Ecosystem carbon sink/source patterns showed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Carbon sinks were associated with forest areas without disturbances, whereas carbon sources were primarily caused by stand-replacing disturbances. It is critical to adequately represent the detailed fast-changing dynamics of land use activities in regional biogeochemical models to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of regional carbon sink/source patterns.

Previous works have observed unreduced gametes in F(1) hybrids of Ae. tauschii with six of the eight T. turgidum subspecies. It is not clear, however, whether the formation of these unreduced gametes is a norm in the F(1) hybrids. In the present study, we tried to answer this question by assessing the occurrence frequency of unreduced gametes in 115 T. turgidum-Ae. tauschii hybrid combinations, involving 76 genotypes of seven T. turgdium subspecies and 24 Ae. tauschii accessions. Our data show that these hybrid combinations differed significantly (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01, F = 11.40) in selfed seedset, an indicator for production of unreduced gametes. This study clearly showed that meiotic restitution genes are widely distributed within T. turgidum. However, significant differences were found between as well as within T. turgidum subspecies and in the interaction of the T. turgidum genotypes with those of Ae. taushii. The possible application of the meiotic restitution genes from T. turgidum in production of double haploids is also discussed.

From these four forms, water extracted polysaccharides were prepared and their antioxidant properties were investigated. Among the four forms of G. sinense, mycelia showed the largest extraction polysaccharide content (14.68%). Compared with ascorbic acid, the extracted polysaccharides from four forms exhibited stronger capability of inhibiting lipid oxidation in a linoleic acid system and more efficient radical-scavenging activity on 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).The extracted polysaccharides from four forms could scavenge hydroxyl radicals and showed good reducing powers evidenced by their low EC(50) values (< 13 mg/mL). However, the scavenging ability on superoxide-anion radicals was not found in our investigation. All extracted polysaccharides possessed good antioxidant properties except for scavenging ability on superoxide-anion radicals and could be utilized as a new dietary supplement and functional food or tea.

J	Wilkes, A; Tan, JZ; Mandula				Wilkes, Andreas; Tan, Jingzheng; Mandula			The myth of community and sustainable grassland management in China	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						community; grassland management; sustainable development		Within national and international domestic academic circles, there are increasing calls for enhanced involvement of communities in formulating and implementing grassland management arrangements. In contrast to the current national policy of contracting grasslands to households, many scholars call for support for collective grassland use arrangements. Several reasons are given for increased recognition and support for community-based management of grasslands, including lower costs of exclusion and dispute resolution, economies of scale in herding and marketing, mitigation of environmental risk, and ensuring equitable access to grassland resources. One conclusion from this literature is that devolving authority for designing and implementing grassland management systems to communities would lead to more sustainable grassland use, a position that I term as the 'myth of community.' This paper presents the results of a study of grazing systems in two communities in Hongyuan County, Sichuan Province. Each community uses its grasslands collectively. However, the study found evidence of severe overgrazing, especially in winter pastures, suggesting that community-based management of grasslands is not necessarily sustainable. The paper discusses three potential policy innovations required to support sustainable grazing systems in China's grassland areas: overcoming constraints in labor and land markets, and payments for environmental services that reward sustainable stocking levels.

Subspecies tauschii has a wide geographic distribution spreading westwards to Turkey and eastwards to Afghanistan and China, while ssp. strangulata has a narrower distribution occurring only in two disjoined regions, southeastern Caspian Iran and Transcaucasia. A collection of 56 Ae. tauschii accessions was screened at adult stage against a mixture of pathotypes of stripe rust prevalent in the current wheat production in China. The results for three crop seasons indicated that among the 38 ssp. tauschii accessions, 37 were susceptible and only one was resistant, while all the 18 ssp. strangulata accessions were resistant. These results indicated that stripe rust resistance was related to taxonomic origin. Further genetic analysis revealed the resistance of stripe rust in ssp. strangulata accession AS2388 was conferred by a single dominant gene.

In this study, genetic relationships among a total of nine populations of these two species, collected from Sichuan Province in southwestern China, were investigated by cytological and RAPD analyzing. With the exception of ploidy levels, R. parvifolius and R. coreanus had similar cytological features. Six R. parvifolius populations included diploids, triploid, tetraploid, and mixed diploid-tetraploid cytotype plants; among them, the population that produced the fewest seeds was the triploid, while the three R. coreanus populations were all diploid. But obvious genetic differentiation between R. parvifolius and R. coreanus was revealed by RAPD markers, the Euclidean's GS coefficient generated by UPGMA cluster analysis between R. parvifolius and R. coreanus was only 0.442, about half of that observed within species. Both genetic relationships among these populations and the origin of polyploidy in R. parvifolius populations are also discussed.

Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are major signalling events induced by osmotic stress in higher plants. Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase2 family members play essential roles in response to hyperosmotic stresses in Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. In this study, the function of TaSnRK2.4 in drought, salt, and freezing stresses in Arabidopsis was characterized. A translational fusion protein of TaSnRK2.4 with green fluorescent protein showed subcellular localization in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. To examine the role of TaSnRK2.4 under various environmental stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing wheat TaSnRK2.4 under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. Overexpression of TaSnRK2.4 resulted in delayed seedling establishment, longer primary roots, and higher yield under normal growing conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSnRK2.4 had enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses, which were simultaneously supported by physiological results, including decreased rate of water loss, enhanced higher relative water content, strengthened cell membrane stability, improved photosynthesis potential, and significantly increased osmotic potential. The results show that TaSnRK2.4 is involved in the regulation of enhanced osmotic potential, growth, and development under both normal and stress conditions, and imply that TaSnRK2.4 is a multifunctional regulatory factor in Arabidopsis. Since the overexpression of TaSnRK2.4 can significantly strengthen tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses and does not retard the growth of transgenic Arabidopsis plants under well-watered conditions, TaSnRK2.4 could be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stresses in crops.

Analysis of a germplasm collection of loquat using ISSR markers	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LINDL	A collection of loquat germplasm from China, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the USA, consisting of 41 accessions (including eight wild species and 33 cultivars), was analysed using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Twenty primers selected from 100 candidate primers were applied to the PCR amplifications, producing 436 bands, of which 392 bands (89.9%) were polymorphic. The average value of the effective number of alleles (Ne), Nei's gene diversity (H), and Shannon's information index (I) were 1.333, 0.209 and 0.332, respectively. There were 33 specific markers for the collection, but no markers were specific for the wild species or for the cultivars which flowered in Spring or in Autumn-Winter. According to the dendrogram, Spring-flowering accessions could not be clustered into one Group. The collection was divided into non-cultivated types and cultivated types, but the latter could not be classified further based upon a single trait. The experimental data are used to discuss genetic diversity and flowering-time as a criterion for the classification of wild species and cultivars, and the taxonomic status of Eriobotrya prinoides var. dadunensis.

Then, the UL31 gene was cloned and sequenced, which was composed of 933 nucleotides encoding 310 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that the UL31 gene was highly conserved in Alphaherpesvirinae and similar to the other herpesviral UL31. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene had a close evolutionary relationship with the avian herperviruses, and DEV should be placed into a single cluster within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Antigen prediction indicated that several potential B-cell epitopes sites located in the UL31 protein. To further study, the UL31 gene was cloned into a pET prokaryotic expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). A 55 kDa fusion protein was induced by the further culture at 37A degrees C after addition of 0.8 mM IPTG. Polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant UL31 from rabbit was prepared. A protein about 55 kDa that reacted with the antibody was detected in immunoblots of bacterial proteins, suggesting that the 55 kDa protein was the product of the UL31 gene. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the protein was localized in very fine punctate forms in the nuclei of infected cells. Our results may provide some insight for further research about the gene and also enrich the database of herpesvirus.

In this study, the expressions of genes porcine beta-defensins-1(pBD-1), pBD-2 and pBD-3 were determined using real-time PCR for Chinese Meishan pigs and Crossbred (Duroc x Yorkshire x Landrace) pigs of 7 days old in various tissues. The results showed that expressions of pBD-1, 2 and 3 of Meishan pigs in most tissues were higher than those of crossbred pigs and main expression sites for pBD-1 and pBD-3 were tongue and oral mucosa in two varieties of pigs, whereas pBD-2 of crossbred pig was mainly expressed in kidney and liver, and pBD-2 of Meishan pigs mainly in tongue and oral mucosa. The higher expression of pBDs might be the reason of Meishan pigs has higher immunity and disease resistance. The mechanisms of this need a further research.

Based on the sequences of a single-copy nuclear gene encoding plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc-1), a total of 47 accessions Triticum and Aegilops representing diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid were used to estimate the origin of Triticum petropavlovskyi. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the intron, intron + sy and exon data sets sequence using maximum likelihood, neighbor-joining and median-joining networks. The A and B genome sequences from Acc-1 loci show that T. petropavlovskyi shares the highest averaged sequence identity with T. polonicum from Xinjiang and exotic landraces of T. aestivum, and reveals specific progenitor-descendant relationships. The D genome sequences of the Acc-1 genes from T. petropavlovskyi are identical to the sequences of the D genome orthologs in T. aestivum, while the relationship of T. petropavlovskyi and Ae. tauschii are most distant. Our findings do not suggest the probability of an independent allopolyploidization event and a single mutation in T. aestivum in the origin of T. petropavlovskyi, but indicate a greater degree of gene flow between T. aestivum and T. polonicum leading to origin of T. petropavlovskyi. It is most likely that T. petropavlovskyi was originated from T. polonicum from Xinjiang to exotic landraces of T. aestivum via a spontaneous introgression or breeding effort.

By utilizing Poincare inequality, constructing suitable Lyapunov functional method, some new sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point. The obtained sufficient conditions depend on the reaction-diffusion terms. A comparison between our results and the previous results shows that diffusion terms can be used to exponentially stabilize some reaction-diffusion neural networks with delays and the previous results have been improved.

The length of the amplified y-HGP sequences ranged from 845 to 915 base pairs (bp) in the 25 species of Triticeae. Multiple sequence alignment showed conserved and variable parts in the y-HGP sequences. Higher sequence conservation was detected in the regulatory elements of y-HGP. An 85-bp deletion was found in eight species of Triticum, Aegilops, and Hordeum. Several species-specific indels were identified in the y-HGP from Psathyrostachys, Hordeum, and Pseudoroegneria. Maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analyses defined an Aegilops/Triticum group consisting of closely related species. A close relationship between Pseudoroegneria and the clade of Australopyrum, Dasypyrum, and Agropyron was also strongly supported in the topologies of MP and Bayesian trees. As y-HGP has sufficient amounts of genetic variation and is a single-copy region in diploid Triticeae, it is useful in phylogenetic analyses of this group.

Furthermore, as a significant essential agent for viral attachment, release, stability and virulence, gC (UL44) gene and its protein product (glycoprotein C) may play a key role in the epidemiological screening. The objectives of this study were to rapidly, sensitively, quantitatively detect gC gene of AHV-1 and provide the underlying basis for further investigating pcDNA3.1-gC DNA vaccine in infected ducks by TaqMan (TM) fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR assay (FQ-PCR) with pcDNA3.1-gC plasmid. Results: The repeatable and reproducible quantitative assay was established by the standard curve with a wide dynamic range (eight logarithmic units of concentration) and very good correlation values (1.000). This protocol was able to detect as little as 1.0 x 10(1) DNA copies per reaction and it was highly specific to AHV-1. The TaqMan (TM) FQ-PCR assay successfully detected the gC gene in tissue samples from pcDNA3.1-gC and AHV-1 attenuated vaccine (AHV-1 Cha) strain inoculated ducks respectively. Conclusions: The assay offers an attractive method for the detection of AHV-1, the investigation of distribution pattern of AHV-1 in vivo and molecular epidemiological screening. Meanwhile, this method could expedite related AHV-1 and gC DNA vaccine research.

The complete coding regions of two alpha-gliadin, two gamma-gliadin and two LMW-GS gene sequences, which designed as Gli-Mal, Gli-Ma2, Gli-Mr2, Glu-LM1 and Glu-LM2, encoded the mature proteins with 307, 241, 348, 302, 474 and 377 amino acid residues, respectively. Gli-Mal and Gli-Ma2 were recognized as pseudogenes due to the in-frame stop codons. The amino acid sequences deduced from these gene sequences were characterized with the typical structure of alpha- or gamma-gliadin or LMW-m type proteins with the exception of Gli-Ma2. Phylogenetic analysis showed Gli-Mal was closely related to those from T. aestivum, whereas Gli-Ma2 seemed to be more homologous with the gene sequences from Dasypyrum breviaristatum. Gli-Mr1 was closely related to those from T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, while Gli-Mr2 was the nearest to those from T. aestivum. Glu-LM1 was closely related to those from Aegilops tauschii, whereas Glu-LM2 seemed to be more homologous with those from T. durum.

China	ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; UNITED-STATES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONSTRUCTION	Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection of ruminants is endemic throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. However, the molecular epidemiology of BTV infection in China has not yet been reported. In this study, the S10 gene segments from 30 BTV isolates, one attenuated BTV strain, one vaccine BTV strain, and one South Africa BTV prototype strain, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S10 genes showed that Chinese BTV isolates could be classified into two phyletic subgroups, and the clustering of Chinese BTV viruses was dependent on their geographical origin and the number of generations for which they had been propagated, rather than their host species or year of isolation.

Two hundred and forty four fragments out of 438 were polymorphic. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P), the genetic diversity (He), and Shannon's information index were 0.557, 0.198, and 0.295, respectively. The population Amirim had the highest genetic variation, whereas the Population of Tabigha had the lowest genetic variation. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that most of the variation was presented within populations. The value of genetic distance (D) between the Populations varied from 0.027 to 0.165 with an average of 0.079, and the estimates of genetic distance were geographically independent based on the Mantel test (r = 0.105, P = 0.168). A total of 30 significant (P < 0.05) correlations were detected between 14 SRAP loci and 12 ecogeographic factors. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel cry-type gene, encoding a 664 amino acid protein with 34% homology to cry29Aa1, was found and cloned from this strain. This gene belongs to a novel holotype cry and is designated as cry56Aa1. It was expressed in E. coli. Insecticidal activity assays showed that recombinant Cry56Aa1 was toxic to both Dipteran (Aedes aegypti) and Lepidopteran (Plutella xylostella and Helicoverpa armigera) pests. Cloning of this gene may help to overcome the increasing resistance of pests to currently used insecticides.	[Zhu, J.; Zheng, A. P.; Tan, F. R.; Wang, S. Q.; Deng, Q. M.; Li, S. C.; Wang, L.

Wilson) and Asian white birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) using buried litterbags in their respective habitats in western Sichuan, China Over one freeze thaw season, 14%-20% of mass was lost and 12%-31% of C, 6%-36% of N. 15%-25% of P. and 37%-43% of K were released. These losses accounted for about 40%-55% of mass lost and 23%-54% of C. 23%-89% of N. 25%-42% of P. and 48%-58% of K released within the first year of fine root decomposition. The amount of mass loss and bioelements release during the freeze thaw season correlated closely with initial substrate quality and bioelement traits.

Forty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), nine indels, and 26 haplotypes were determined by sequence analysis. The genetic polymorphism (P), genetic diversity (He), and Shannon's information index (I) in the 18 populations were 0.486, 0.181 and 0.269, respectively. Approximately 2/3 genetic variations of Hina genes were presented within populations, while approximately 1/3 genetic variations were observed between populations. Broad gene flow (Nm = 3.31) and low genetic variation (Gst = 0.0702) were detected. However, the genetic differentiation between populations was independent of geographical distances according to the Mantel test (p = 0.478). The result of Spearman rank correlations (r(s)) showed that the genetic indices (P, He and I) of Hina were not significantly correlated with ecological factors. Only eight SNP positions correlated significantly with ecological factors. Of the eight SNP positions that positively correlated with ecological factors, only one SNP (769, T-C) was located in the coding region; however, it was not responsible for the amino acid change.

NOV.; ZYMOBACTER; ALIGNMENT; TREES	A novel bacterium, TRM 0175(T), belonging to the genus Halomonas, was isolated from a soil sample taken from a salt lake in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. The isolate was Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped and motile by means of peritrichous flagella. It was catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations of 0-20% (optimum at 10-13%), at 15-50 degrees C (optimum at 37 degrees C) and at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum at pH 7.0). Metabolism was respiratory with oxygen as terminal electron acceptor. Acid was produced from D-ribose, D- and L-arabinose, D-Xylose, D-galactose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, cellobiose, maltose, trehalose and D- and L-fucose and was produced weakly from aesculin. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-9. The major fatty acids were C(18: 1)omega 7c and C(19:0) cyclo omega 8c. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 60.0 mol%. The affiliation of strain TRM 0175(T) with the genus Halomonas was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons. The most closely related species was Halomonas anticariensis; 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between H. anticariensis FP35(T) and strain TRM 0175(T) was 95.3%. Phenotypically, some characteristics of TRM 0 175 T differed from those of H. anticariensis. On the basis of data from this polyphasic study, strain TRM 0175(T) represents a novel species of the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas xinjiangensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is TRIM 0175(T) (=CCTCC AB 208329(T) =KCTC 22608(T)).

In this study, trends in synonymous codon usage in maize have been firstly examined through the multivariate statistical analysis on 7402 cDNA sequences. The results showed that the genes positions on the primary axis were strongly negatively correlated with GC3s, GC content of individual gene and gene expression level assessed by the codon adaptation index (CAI) values, which indicated that nucleotide composition and gene expression level were the main factors in shaping the codon usage of maize, and the variation in codon usage among genes may be due to mutational bias at the DNA level and natural selection acting at the level of mRNA translation. At the same time, CDS length and the hydrophobicity of each protein were, respectively, significantly correlated with the genes locations on the primary axis, GC3s and CAI values. We infer that genes length and the hydrophobicity of the encoded protein may play minor role in shaping codon usage bias. Additional 28 codons ending with a G or C base have been defined as "optimal codons", which may provide useful information for maize gene-transformation and gene prediction.

To detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for FHB resistance, plants of the F (2:3) population derived from a 'Wangshui-bai' x 'Sy95-7' cross were artificially inoculated. Of 396 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), 125 amplified fragment length polymorphisms were used for FHB resistance QTL analysis. Five QTLs for FHB resistance were detected on chromosomes 3B, 6B, 7A, 1B and 2D. The effect of the QTL located on chromosome 3B on phenotypic variation was 31.69%, while that of the QTL found on 2D was the smallest and only accounted for 4.98% of the variation. The resistance alleles originated from 'Wangshibai' and association of the QTLs using these SSR markers may facilitate marker-assisted selection to improve FHB resistance in the wheat breeding programs of southwest China.

Phylogenetic analyses reveal that Hystrix taxa contain two distinct types of genome constitution, despite the overall morphological and ecological similarity among Hystrix taxa. One type of genome constitution is StH (Hy. patula) as Elymus, the other is NsXm (Hy. californica, Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei, Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata and Hy. komarovii) as Leymus. The St, H and Ns genomes in Hystrix are donated by Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum and Psathyrostachys, respectively. The donor of the Xm genome is closely related to Agropyron (P). The trnL-F data especially indicate that there has been a maternal haplotype polymorphism in Hystrix species. Based on these results, we suggest that Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei, Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata, Hy. komarovii and Hy. californica should be included in the genus Leymus, and Hy. patula in the genus Elymus.

Only two alleles, insensitive Ppd-D1a and sensitive Ppd-D1b, were known previously, and these did not adequately explain the broad adaptation of wheat to photoperiod variation. In this study, five diagnostic molecular markers were employed to identify Ppd-D1 haplotypes in 492 wheat varieties from diverse geographic locations and 55 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor species of wheat. Six Ppd-D1 haplotypes, designated I-VI, were identified. Types II, V and VI were considered to be more ancient and types I, III and IV were considered to be derived from type II. The transcript abundances of the Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed continuous variation, being highest for haplotype I, lowest for haplotype III, and correlating negatively with varietal differences in heading time. These haplotypes also significantly affected other agronomic traits. The distribution frequency of Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed partial correlations with both latitudes and altitudes of wheat cultivation regions. The evolution, expression and distribution of Ppd-D1 haplotypes were consistent evidentially with each other. What was regarded as a pair of alleles in the past can now be considered a series of alleles leading to continuous variation.

Identification and molecular tagging of a stripe rust resistance gene in wheat line P81	PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						Triticum aestivum; Puccinia striiformis; Yellow rust; SSR-RGAP; Genetic mapping	ANALOG POLYMORPHISM MARKERS; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; WILD EMMER WHEAT; YELLOW RUST; MICROSATELLITE; LOCATION; YR5; DICOCCOIDES; LINKAGE; BARLEY	Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most devastating diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). With the objective of identifying and tagging a new gene for resistance to stripe rust in wheat line P81, F(1), F(2) and F(2:3) populations from the cross 'Chuanmai 28'/P81 were inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR32 in greenhouse and field trials. P81 carried a single dominant gene for resistance ( designated YrP81) to CYR32. Tests of allelism showed that YrP81 was different from Yr5, Yr10, Yr15 and Yr26. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and resistance gene-analogue polymorphism (RGAP) between the parents were used for genotyping the F(2) populations. YrP81 was closely linked to four SSR loci on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 18.3 cM (Xwmc25), 1.8 cM (Xgwm429), 4.1 cM (Xwmc770) and 5.3 cM (Xgwm148). Two RGAP markers RGA1 (NLRR/XLRR) and RGA2 (Pto kin4/NLRR-INV2) were also closely linked to YrP81 with genetic distances of 4.7 and 6.3 cM, respectively. The linkage map of YrP81 and molecular markers was established in the order Xwmc25-RGA2-RGA1-Xgwm429-YrP81-Xwmc770-Xgwm148. Pedigree analysis, response patterns with Chinese PST races and associations with markers suggested that YrP81 is a novel stripe rust resistance gene. The PCR-based microsatellite and RGAP markers identified here could be applied in selection of YrP81 in wheat breeding.	[Pu, Z. J.; Chen, G. Y.; Wei, Y. M.; Yan, Z. H.; Zheng, Y.

It was found that (1) at the neutral pH Trx-GcGASA had maximum fluorescence emission at 305 run following excitation at different wavelengths varying from 250 to 280 nm, which was ascribed to the fluorescence emission from tyrosine residues. (2) The reduction of disulphide bonds lead to the changes in the relative fluorescence intensity between tyrosine and tryptophan residues from 0. 7 to 1. 8. (3) Both Tyr and Trp residues underwent 12%-21% decrease in fluorescence intensity with the addition of 0. 5 mmol . L(-1) GSSG or 5 mmol . L(-1) peroxide. The latter was roughly consistent with the antioxidative activity reported in vivo. (4) No matter whether 1 mmol . L(-1) DTT was absent or present, the fusion protein could not be fully unfolded with lambda(max)<350 nm following the treatment of 6 mol . L(-1) GdnHCl. (5) Fusion protein Trx-GcGASA experienced GdnHCl-induced denaturation process, and the unfolding equilibrium curve could be well fitted by using two-state model, giving the Gibbs free energy change (Delta G) of 3. 7 kJ . mol(-1). However, it was not the case for reduced Trx-GcGASA protein. The aforementioned experimental results will not only provide some guides to investigate the effects of fusion partner Trx on the unfolding thermodynamics, kinetics and refolding process of Trx-GcGASA, but also will be useful for further studies on the strucuture of GA-induced cysteine-rich protein with the help of spectroscopic methods.

Currently, in a worldwide scale, GPV severely affects geese production. The objective of this study is to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive detection of GPV in the field. Results: A set of six specific primers was designed by targeting the GPV VP3 DNA. With Bst DNA polymerase large fragment, the target DNA could be amplified at 65 degrees C as early as 20 min of incubation in a simple water bath. A positive reaction was identified through the detection of the LAMP product by color change visible to the naked eye. The detection limit of the assay was 28 copies/mu l of plasmid pVP3, and with equal sensitivity and specificity to fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR). Conclusions: The high sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity, as well as the high throughput, make this method suitable for specific detection of GPV infection in both field conditions and laboratory settings. The utilization of complicated equipment and conduct of technical training on the GPV LAMP were not necessary.

A pot experiment was conducted involving a soil Cd concentration gradient (0, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg kg(-1)) to determine if Malva sinensis Cavan. from two lead-zinc mines in Kangding and Yajiang in western Sichuan, China, is a Cd-hyperaccumulator. The highest Cd concentrations in plant shoots from Kangding and Yajiang were 154.30 and 122.77 mg kg(-1), respectively, at a soil Cd concentration of 200 mg kg(-1). The largest amounts of accumulation in plant shoots from Kangding and Yajiang were 700.5 and 1403.2 mu g pot(-1), respectively. The bioconcentration factors in shoots were 0.53-1.03 for Kangding and 0.69-1.25 for Yajiang. Moreover, all translocation factors of plants from the two sites were over 1.0. Therefore, M. sinensis can be classified as a Cd-accumulator or non-standard Cd-hyperaccumulator. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to characterize litter decomposition during the freeze-thaw season in a subalpine forest region of western China, a field experiment using the litterbag method was conducted on the decomposition of foliar litter of two dominant species, fir (Abies faxoniana) and birch (Betula platyphylla) under their respective forests. Over the freeze-thaw season following leaf-fall, about 18% and 20% of mass, 13% and 14% of lignin, 30% and 26% of cellulose, 14% and 21% of C, 30% and 27% of N, 17% and 15% of P, and 17% and 13% of K were lost from fir and birch litters, respectively. The lost mass and components accounted for more than 64% and 65% of mass, 72% and 69% of lignin, 75% and 60% of cellulose, 49% and 59% of C, 56% and 71% of N, 62% and 37% of P. and 38% and 37% of K in I year net loss rate of fir and birch litter, respectively. In addition, the loss of mass, lignin, Cellulose and component bio-elements during the freeze-thaw season correlated closely with the initial substrate type and the levels of the individual bio-elements. The results demonstrated that litter decomposition during the freeze-thaw season contributes significantly to the first year decomposition in these subalpine forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Twenty-eight characteristic peaks in the 16 grants of Ophiopogon japonicus were determined in samples from different habitats. Their chromatographic patterns were generally consistent although their content of chemistry composition is greatly different. The results of hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the samples can be divided into 3 groups; it was able to select excellent resources from the groups. This was the first report of hierarchical cluster analysis of wild germplasm resource of Ophiopogon japonicus according to their chemical fingerprint.

Purified collagenase has a 31.53-fold increase in specific activity of 87.33 U/mg and 7.00% recovery. The collagenase has a relative molecular weight of 58.64 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimal temperature for the enzyme reaction was 45 degrees C. More than 50% of the original activity still remained after 5 min of incubation at 70 degrees C or 10 min at 60 degrees C. The maximal enzyme activity of collagenase was obtained at pH7.5, and it was stable over a pH range of 6.5-8.0. The collagenase activity was strongly inhibited by Mn(2+), Pb(2+), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and beta-mercaptoethanol. However, Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) greatly increased its activity. The collagenase from B. pumilus Col-J showed highly specific activity towards the native collagen from calf skin. The K(m) and V(max) of the enzyme for collagen were 0.79 mg/mL and 129.5 U, respectively.

After intake of either basal diet or TP-supplemented diet for 7 d, half of the piglets in each group were challenged with diquat. Results showed that dietary TP alleviated growth depression to some extent. A T lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) demonstrated that TP promoted the proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes. The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ was elevated, indicating a recovering tendency from immune damages caused by oxidative stress. The increment of pro-inflammatory IL-1 caused by oxidative stress was attenuated, and the concentration of serum IFN-gamma was decreased by TP-supplementation. However, the serum concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-4, were greatly enhanced by TP, which suggested an immune shift from Th1 to Th2. These findings supported the immunomodulatory potential of TP for piglets subjected to oxidative stress.

Pigs in the oxidative stress group were injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mg/kg BW of diquat, while the control group were injected with isotonic saline. All pigs were fed ad libitum. The experiment lasted for 7 days. The results indicated that compared with control treatment, oxidative stress induced by diquat significantly decreased average daily gain, intake and feed conversion. The treatment decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes, increased concentration of malondialdehyde in plasma, increased cationic amino acid transporter-1 mRNA level and activity of ornithine aminotransferase and concentrations of arginine and citrulline in the jejunum, decreased the concentrations of arginine in plasma and kidney, and decreased induced nitric oxide synthase mRNTA level. It is concluded that oxidative stress induced by diquat can influence absorption and metabolism of arginine and consequently modify the requirement of arginine for post-weaning pigs.

RNA profiling of fusarium head blight-resistant wheat addition lines containing the Thinopyrum elongatum chromosome 7E	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE			English	Article						Fusarium graminearum; fusarium head blight; gene expression; microarray; tall wheatgrass; Triticum aestivum; wheat scab	GENE-EXPRESSION; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; FUNGAL PATHOGENS; SCAB RESISTANCE; DEFENSE; BARLEY; GRAMINEARUM; DISEASE; ACID; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Fusarium graminearum is the major causal agent of fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, a fungal disease causing significant yield losses and reduction in grain quality due to the production and deposition of mycotoxins in the seed. Relatively few sources of resistance to FHB have been identified in wheat and other cereal crops. Thinopyrum elongatum (2n = 14, EE genome), a wild relative of wheat, was identified as a new source with a high level of resistance to FHB. Greenhouse inoculation experiments have determined that the resistance is located on the long arm of its chromosome 7E. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in that resistance, we have used gene expression profiling by microarray to compare the susceptible wheat 'Chinese Spring' (CS), with two resistant addition lines containing either the 7E chromosome or a long arm telocentric of that chromosome in the CS background. The results have shown that many genes were affected similarly by F. graminearum in the resistant and susceptible lines. Seventy genes were selected for further characterization. Those genes were grouped into five major expression patterns: genes expressed at higher or lower level in both F. graminearum- and water-treated samples in resistant lines, genes that were upregulated faster or to a higher level in resistant lines and genes that were downregulated more significantly in the susceptible line. Pathogenesis-related genes, genes from the phenylpropanoid pathway or from the jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signalling pathway, a group of kinase proteins and many other genes with unknown function are considered in this report.

Diversity comparison and phylogenetic relationships of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) germplasm as revealed by SSR markers. Can. J. Plant Sci. 90: 13-21. Phylogenetic relationships among and within 16 accessions collected from China, Russia, Kazakhstan, India and Japan were investigated using SSR markers. The 21 SSR primer pairs generated a total of 143 polymorphic alleles, with an average of 6.8 alleles per locus, and a range of 3-13 alleles. The average genetic diversity, as measured by the polymorphic information content (PIC), was 0.33. The average polymorphic rate (P) for this species was 90.7%, Suggesting a high degree of genetic diversity. Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) revealed larger genetic variation within accessions (65.75%) and geographical regions (75.58%) rather than between them, while among ploidy level variance contributed only 2.62%. A high degree of genetic diversity within tetraploid group was detected based on the polymorphic rate (P = 94.23%) and shannon's information index of diversity (I = 0.4300) when compared with diploid group (P = 91.25%, I = 0.3922). The values of the genetic identity (GI) among accessions ranged from 0.7320 to 0.9691 and were used to produce a dendrogram using the UPGMA approach. The 16 accessions were grouped into two major clusters (GI = 0.876); specifically, all tetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) accessions originating from different regions were grouped into the same cluster, whereas the diploid (2n = 2x = 14) accessions were grouped into the two major clusters. The dendrogram was concordant with the morphological variability, agronomic traits and karyotype. Generally, the results of this study indicate that cocksfoot germplasm contains high molecular variation within accession and geographical region. The implications of these results for conservation of the species were discussed.

J	Li, DM; Liu, MM; Deng, GY				Li, Dongmei; Liu, Mingming; Deng, Guoyan			Willingness and determinants of farmers' adoption of new rice varieties	CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article						China; Agricutlure; Rice; Innovation		Purpose - This paper aims to investigate farmers' willingness to adopt new rice varieties and the factors influencing their seed-selection behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The Logit model was used to analyze farmers' willingness and the determinants of the behaviors in selecting and using new varieties. A total of 402 farming households in the main rice-producing areas of Sichuan Province were surveyed. Findings - The results indicate that rice yield and sales, agro-technicians' popularization, kith and kin's seed purchase behaviors have a positive impact on fanners'choice, while the present production income has a negative effect But previous seed purchasing behaviors, soil characteristics, media publicity, seed companies' recommendation and age of farmer have either positive or negative impact on farmers' choice. Research limitations/implications - The paper is however unable to explain the general situation of China so it considers Sichuan province as a case. Increased sample quantities may be necessary in further research. Originality/value - The paper proposes an hypothesis of farmers' willingness and determinants in choosing new rice varieties and verifies it by Logit model. It first analyzes the fanners'decision-making behavior in choosing new rice varieties in Sichuan, and investigates the farmers' behavior more scientifically.

The reasonable fitting formula of attenuation relationship of embankment vibration is put forward in a negative exponential function form. The quantitative understanding of the vibration property is obtained according to the statistic of the two well-defined eigenvalues of vibration acceleration response, as well as the analysis of the acceleration time histories and the corresponding frequency spectra. The results suggest that: the effect of rail gap on the maximal vertical vibration response of rail is not evident; vibration response of sleeper near the rail gap is obviously larger than that of other sleepers, especially having intensive shock pulse, and the maximum is more than three times that of the vibration response of the sleeper lying in the very middle of the two rail gaps from one compartment passing by; the rail vibration energy concentrates within 10 Hz, and the rail predominant frequencies mainly correlate with train speed and bogie spacing: the dominant frequencies of the embankment vibration, varying from 40 to 70 Hz for the embankment shoulder and reducing with the distance increasing from the track, are influenced chiefly by train speed and sleeper spacing. The results mentioned above have important significance for rational cognition of vibration response characteristics of track structure at permafrost site, and moreover for the dynamic stability evaluation for the long-term operation of the Qinghai-Tibet railway. Meanwhile. the investigation provides basic data for the further research on the rail transit dynamics and the improvement of railroading criterion in cold regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Greater P concentration was observed in ME of P. sinofasciata. The concentration of chlorophyll a in the ME increased with an increase of P concentration in soil, whereas the reverse tendency was observed in the NME. A slight decrease of chlorophyll b concentration existed at 100 mg P kg-1 soil for ME. Pilea sinofasciata of ME growing under high P concentration presented greater bioactivities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) and less concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and free proline than under low-P conditions, whereas the opposite tendency was manifested in the NME, which demonstrated normal growing status and steady accumulation efficiency.

Forty-six clones were isolated and they were grouped into seven families of resistance gene analogues (RGA). All families were characterised as the Toll-Interleukin receptor group of R-genes (plant disease resistance genes). The putative chromosome-specific SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) loci were identified by multiple sequence alignments. Furthermore, 20 E chromosome-specific RGA markers were used to identify polymorphic fragments in wheat-Lo. elongatum addition lines and amphidiploid. The results suggested that these chromosome-specific markers could be not only useful for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning of R-genes in Lo. elongatum, but also feasible for investigating the evaluation process of the E genome.

To understand the allelopathic potential of the eucalypt (Eucalyptus grandis) roots and rhizosphere soil along a chronosequence (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 years), the germination and growth characteristics of three plant species (Raphanus sativus, Phaseolus aureus, and Lolium perenne) growing nearby or beneath the eucalypt plantations were measured. The results showed that aqueous extract of E. grandis root suppressed the germination and early seedling growth of the target plants. The younger E. grandis exhibited a comparatively stronger allelopathic potential. The highest dose root extracts from 4 years old E. grandis showed the strongest inhibitory effects on the germination rates of the target species, the inhibitory rates were about 48, 51.2, and 56.56% for R. sativus, P. aureus, and L. perenne, respectively. However, present biotests of rhizosphere soils from 6, 8, and 10-year-old plantations exhibited a remarkable stimulative effect on L. perenne, which indicated that the soil might neutralize or dilute allelopathic agents with the increase of plantation age. In addition, according to GC-MS analysis, more allelopathic potential compounds were found in the rhizosphere soil and roots of younger E. grandis plantation. Moreover, more allelochemicals were obtained from soil than from roots. The allelopathic compounds in roots and rhizosphere soil may play important roles in allelopathy of E. grandis plantation. More attention should be paid to the younger E. grandis plantations for the relative higher allelopathic effects.

However, whether melatonin possesses similar benefits to the in vitro mouse embryonic development has yet to be determined. In this study, we assessed the effects of various concentrations of melatonin (10-13 to 10-3 M) on the in-vitro development of mouse embryos cultured in HTF medium for 96 hr; embryos cultured without melatonin were used as control. The in vitro development of mouse two-cell embryos significantly benefited from treatment with melatonin in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of melatonin on the rates of blastocyst formation, hatching/hatched blastocysts and cell number per blastocyst were bi-phasic; all significantly increased by melatonin at 10-13 to 10-5 M and decreased by melatonin at 10-3 M. Maximal benefit of melatonin on in vitro mouse 2-cell embryo development was achieved at a concentration of 10-9 M. In comparison to control, 10-9 M melatonin increased blastocyst formation rate from 48.08 +/- 5.25% to 82.08 +/- 2.34% (p < 0.05), hatched blastocyst rate from 25.65 +/- 11.79% to 66.47 +/- 4.94% (p < 0.05), and cell number per blastocyst 62.71 +/- 5.97 to 77.91 +/- 10.63 (p < 0.05). Thus, our datas demonstrated firstly that melatonin has beneficial effects on the in vitro development of 2-cell mouse embryos cultured in HTF medium.</.

The oxygenated compounds quantified include C-2-C-10 dicarboxylic acids, C-3-C-9 ketoacids and C-2-C-3 dicarbonyls, their combined concentrations accounting for 3.2-18.2% of water-soluble organic carbon on a carbon mass basis. Six C-2 and C-3 oxygenated compounds, namely oxalic acid, malonic acid, glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid, glyoxal, and methyl glyoxal, dominate this suite of oxygenated compounds, accounting for 75% of the total quantified oxygenated species. Good correlations were observed among most of the quantified oxygenated compounds, suggesting that a relatively stable abundance distribution exists under varying synoptic conditions. These composition profiles provide a comprehensive dataset for use in modelling and theoretical studies of aerosol-water interactions, secondary aerosol formation pathways, and speciated organic mass distributions.

Using this method, one novel holotype cry gene, cry30Fa1, encoding a polypeptide of 687 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 77.1 kDa, 74% identical to Cry30Aa1, was cloned from the B. thuringiensis strain BtMC28. Furthermore, the cry30Fa1 gene was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The Cry30Fa1 proteins, isolated from the cultures of recombinant E. coli, had remarkable insecticidal effects against Plutella xylostella and Aedes aegypti with LC50 at 6.477 and 15.359 mu g mL-1, respectively. Our results strongly suggest that this strategy is highly efficient and advantageous in terms of rapid cloning of holotype cry genes that have minimal identity to known genes. The cloning of the cry30Fa1 gene would be useful in the resources of the insecticidal crystal genes and may serve as an alternative choice of an insecticide for potential problems associated with insect resistance.

The results showed that FSHR mRNA expression was greater at the age of I to 5 and 8 months compared to expression at day 1 (P < 0.05). Particularly, the expression of FSHR mRNA at 4, 5 and 8 months was much greater, 1.86 +/- 0.14, 3.50 +/- 0.19 and 5.11 +/- 0.27 fold, respectively, compared to expression at day 1 (P < 0.01). The level of FSHR mRNA expression at 1, 2 and 3 months was 1.35 +/- 0.12, 1.31 +/- 0.05 and 1.28 +/- 0.09 fold greater, respectively, compared to day 1 (P < 0.05). The results indicate that the expression of FSHR mRNA remains at a stable level during the early developmental stage, and increases initially from 4 months until the egg laying stage. In addition, these results Support the possibility that FSHR plays a pivotal role in mediating the response of the goose ovary to follicle-stimulating hormone during the developmental and egg laying stages, and especially during the latter.

PHW-SA pollen mother cells (PMCs) regularly revealed averagely 0.57 univalents, 24.51 ring bivalents, 3.19 rod bivalents and 0.01 trivalents per cell. Complete homologous chromosome pairing was seen in 81% of the PMCs, indicating a degree of cytological stability. P. huashanica C-banding karyotypes of PHW-SA displayed strong heterochromatin terminal bands at either or both ends. 24 P. huashanica chromosome arms showed telomeric bands. Using P. huashanica DNA as a probe and J-11 DNA as blocker, distinctive P. huashanica chromosomes, which were presented entirely greenish-yellow hybridization signals, were observed in a somatic metaphase of PHW-SA. GISH also revealed the chromosomal breakage and translocation occurring in the amphiploid PHW-SA, which may represent a centromeric fusion between P. huashanica and wheat chromosomes. Seeds storage proteins electrophoresis indicated that PHW-SA expressed some of P. huashanica specific gliadin and glutenin bands, and a few gliadin and glutenin bands of the parents disappeared and new bands appeared. The results indicated that the amphiploid PHW-SA could serve as novel germplasm sources for wheat improvement.

One diploid plant was chosen among the various F, progenies and developed into an F(2) population via self-pollination. Compared with the control variety Shanyou 63, this F(2) population had a stable agronomical performance in field trials, as confirmed by the F-test. The stability of the F(2) population was further substantiated by molecular analysis with simple sequence repeat markers. Specifically, of 160 markers assayed, 37 (covering all 12 chromosomes) were polymorphic between the parental lines. Testing the F(1) hybrid individually with these markers showed that each PCR product had only a single band instead of two bands from each parent. The bands were identical to either maternal (23 markers) or paternal (eight markers) bands or distinct from both parents (six markers). The amplified bands of all 60 randomly selected F(2) plants were uniform and identical to those of the F(1) hybrid. These results suggest that the F(1) plant is a non-segregating hybrid and that a stable F(2) population was obtained. This novel system provides an efficient means for shortening the cycle of hybrid rice seed production.

Variation characteristics of the nitrate reductase gene of key inbred maize lines and derived lines in China	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Maize inbred lines; Derived lines; Variation characteristics; Nitrate reductase gene	ZEA-MAYS L.; IDENTIFICATION; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; MARKERS; PLANTS	Key inbred lines have played a fundamental role in maize genetics and breeding. Research on variation characteristics of key genes from key inbred lines and from derived lines is important for early identification and evaluation of inbred maize lines. The nitrate reductase (NR) gene, which plays a central role in nitrate acquisition, was the target gene for this research. Forty-one inbred maize lines were investigated, including four key inbred lines: Huangzaosi, Mo17, Dan340, and Ye478. Through multiple sequence alignment with the NR gene from B73, used as a control, we found that: 1) the NR gene of most inbred lines from Huangzaosi and from derived lines had two insertion fragments and two replacement fragments; 2) the NR gene of most inbred lines from Mo17 and derived lines had one insertion fragment and one replacement fragment; 3) there were two common variations and eight common SNPs in the NR gene of the four key lines. Huangzaosi and Mo17 also had three common variations compared with the other key lines. Moreover, Mo17 had some unique variations; there were no unique variations in the other key lines, even for SNPs, and 4) phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the NR gene of the derived lines from the same key line had higher sequence homology. Based on the above NR gene variation characteristics and sequence homology of key inbred lines and derived lines, a candidate inbred line can be preliminarily selected and evaluated by marker development and/or sequence alignment of the NR gene.

In the present study, to elucidate the properties and functions of its encoding protein, the UL35 gene product (VP26) was identified by using the prepared rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Methods: Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to determine the transcription and expression kinetics and subcellular localization of DPV VP26 in DPV-infected cells. Results: A protein of approximately 13 kDa that reacted with the antiserum was detected in immunoblot of DPV-infected cellular lysates. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis of DPV-infected cells showed that VP26 was produced predominantly at the late stage of infection, its production was highly dependent on viral DNA synthesis, and the UL35 gene was regulated as a late viral gene, suggesting that the gene should be categorized as gamma 2 class. Additionally, analysis of the association of DPV VP26 with purified virions revealed that VP26 was a component of extracellular mature DPV virions. Subcellular localization demonstrated that VP26 firstly localized in cytoplasm, then it transferred to the nucleus and aggregated in the punctate region of the nucleus in DPV-infected cells. Conclusion: Taken together, these results will provide a foundation for further functional analysis of the DPV UL35 gene. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the etiology of RHD in recent outbreaks in Sichuan Province, China. Two dominant bacteria (CHNCY001 and CHNCY002) were isolated from RHD in Xinjin and Meishan Counties. Characteristics found by morphological, physiological, and biochemical tests showed that the two strains were the same and similar to Edwardsiella ictaluri, but had atypical characteristics in that they tested positive for urease and methyl red. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed that the strains were highly homogeneous with E. ictaluri. Based on the phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis by 16S rRNA, both isolates were identified as E ictaluri. Koch's postulates were fulfilled using the strains in healthy yellow catfish. Mortality was 100% when the isolates were injected intraperitoneally (2.7 and 1.8 x 10(6) cfu/fish) and 60-65% when catfish were immersed in the isolates (3.4 and 4.2 x 10(7) cfu/ml). The isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, florfenicol, fradiomycin, and lomefloxacin, but not to acetylspiramycin, ampicillin, azithromycin, medemycin, novobiocin, oxytetracycline, sinomin (SMZ/TMP), and sulfamethoxazole.

One hundred piglets weaned at 28 +/- 2 d were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 5 replicates of 5 piglets each. Piglets received for 28 d the base diet with i) no addition (control) or with copper addition (from copper sulfate) at ii) 100, iii) 175, and iv) 250 mg/kg(-1). On day 21, twenty piglets were randomly selected (one from each replicate) to slaughter and investigate the population and diversity of cecal microorganisms. The results showed that the diets containing 175 and 250 mg/kg(-1) copper improved the average daily gain (ADG) by 51% and 60% and decreased the feed to gain ratio (F/G) by 21% and 16%, respectively. Adding 175 or 250 mg/kg(-1) copper improved crude protein, ether extract, calcium and phosphorus digestibility. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacilli in cecum tended to be reduced, while the concentrations of cecal volatile fatty acids (VFA) were increased in pigs fed diet supplemented as copper level increased. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that adding 175 or 250 mg/kg(-1) copper reduced the lactobacilli in cecum. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) maps showed that band numbers and intensity of cecal bacterial 16S rDNA decreased as the copper levels increased. The results suggested that the effects of high dietary copper on microflora and their activities and metabolic products might contribute to the intestinal health and result in improved growth performance.

Using Landes geese (Anseranser) and Sichuan White geese (Anser cygnoides) as experimental animals, we quantified the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACC alpha) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and of two transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1) and carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), and measured the lipid and triglyceride (TG) content in the liver and the plasma level of glucose, insulin and TG. Our results indicated that compared to the control group, the overfeeding induced an increase of the lipid and TG content in the liver and also of the plasma insulin and TG concentration in both breeds. However, the plasma glucose level decreased after overfeeding in the Sichuan White goose, and there was no evident change in the Landes goose. Lastly, the mRNA expression of ACC alpha, FAS, SREBP-1 and ChREBP in the overfed group was lower than in the control group in both breeds. We concluded that the lipogenesis pathway plays a role in overfeeding-induced hepatic steatosis and that the decreased mRNA level of related genes may be the indicator of hepatic steatosis.

Effects of encapsulated and non-encapsulated compound acidifiers on gastrointestinal pH and intestinal morphology and function in weaning piglets	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						piglets; encapsulated compound acidifiers; gastrointestinal pH; intestinal morphology; intestinal function	DIGESTIVE-TRACT; ORGANIC-ACIDS; WEANLING PIGS; GROWTH; RESPONSES; DIETS	The experiment was conducted to study the effects of the addition of encapsulated and non-encapsulated compound acidifiers in a diet based on maize-soyabean meal-extruded soyabean on gastrointestinal growth performance, villus height and crypt depth of jejunum, intestinal digestive enzymes activities, microbial population and intestinal mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A in weaning piglets. Sixty-four 28-day-old, crossbred piglets (LandracexLarge White), weighing an average of 7.00 +/- 0.10 kg, were randomly assigned to four treatments with four replicates and four piglets (2 male and 2 female) per pen, according to single-factor design principle. The feeding trial lasted 35 days. The results showed that encapsulated compound acidifiers significantly reduced the gastrointestinal pH (P<0.01), and improved the average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio (P<0.05), but they had no significant effect on the average daily feed intake. In addition, encapsulated compound acidifiers significantly increased the ratio between the villus height and crypt depth of jejunum (P<0.01), and stimulated the sucrase activity and lactase activity (P<0.05) as well; during the later weaning period, encapsulated compound acidifiers significantly increased the counts of Lactobacillus and decreased the counts of Escherichia cob in the caecum and the colon (P<0.01); it was also noted that there was an insignificant tendency of lower secretion of intestinal mucosa! secretory IgA (P>0.05). These results indicate that the encapsulated compound acidifiers improve the intestinal morphology and function by reducing the gastrointestinal pH, so as to enhance the intestinal adaptation and immunity, and consequently improve the growth performance of weaning piglets.

Forty Duroc x Yorkshire x Landrace growing pigs were allocated to four high-linseed oil (3%) experimental diets formulated as basal diet (CON), basal diet supplemented with 300 mg/kg alpha-tocopherol (VE), 100 mg/kg beta-carotene (beta-C), or combination of alpha-tocopherol (300 mg/kg diet) and beta-carotene (100 mg/kg diet) [VE+beta-C]. The meat quality traits, as shown by post-mortem changes of pH value, drip loss and Hunter values, were improved in VE group, but not in beta-C or VE+beta-C groups. alpha-Tocopherol concentrations in plasma, liver and meat reflected its dietary treatment and was higher in VE and VE+beta-C than CON and beta-C. Lipid oxidation products (TBARS) was lower and antioxidation capacity (SOD and T-AOC) was higher in response to VE supplementation, combination of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene did not result in superior effects on lipid antioxidant capacity compared with alpha-tocopherol. Collectively, beta-carotene was not qualified for quenching free radicals and combination of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol was inferior to single use of alpha-tocopherol to improve meat quality.

In this study, we reported the isolation and characterization of 8 novel LMW-GS genes from Ae.longissima Schweinf. & Muschl., a species of the section Sitopsis of the genus Aegilops, which is closely related to the B genonic of common wheat. Based on the N-terminal domain sequences, the 8 genes were divided into 3 groups. A consensus alignment of the extremely conserved domains with known gene groups and the subsequent cluster analysis showed that 2 out of the 3 groups of LMW-GS genes were closely related to those from the B genonic, and the remaining was related to those from A and D genomes of wheat and Ae. tauschii. Using 3 sets of gene-group-specific primers, PCRs in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats and Ae. tauschii failed to obtain the expected products, indicating that file 3 groups of LMW-GS genes obtained in this study were new members of LMW-GS multi-gene families. These results suggested that the Sitopsis species of the genus Aegilops with novel gene variations could be used as valuable gene resources of LMW-GS. The 3 sets of group-specific primers could be utilized as molecular markers to investigate the introgression of novel alien LMW-GS genes from Ae. longissima into wheat.

While 1R296 and 1R330 were highly susceptible to stripe rust and powdery mildew, 1314, 1R725 and 1R734 were highly resistant to both diseases. Acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the omega-secalin bands were absent in 1R314, but present in the other 4 wheat lines. Genomic in silo hybridization indicated that 1R296, 1R330, and 1R725 contained translocations involving the whole short arm of chromosome IR. However, 1R314 and 1R734 contained a pair of wheat chromosomes with small, terminal, rye-derived chromosome segments. The results suggest that the translocation breakpoint of 1RS in 1R314 was located between the Sec-I locus and the disease-resistance loci, while in line 1R734, the breakpoint was located between the Sec-1 locus and the centromere. Taking account of the improved disease resistance of 1R725, 1R314 and 1R734, the chromosome arm 1RS of R12 may represent new and valuable disease resistance resources for wheat improvement.

Characterization of omega-secalin genes from rye, triticale, and a wheat 1BL/1RS translocation line	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article						1BL/1RS translocation; grain quality; secale cereale; storage proteins; Triticum aestivum; x Triticosecale; omega-secalin	1B/1R CHROMOSOME-TRANSLOCATION; CELIAC-DISEASE; SEC-1 LOCUS; DNA; EVOLUTION; POLYMORPHISM; SEQUENCES; CEREALE; GENOMES	Sixty-two DNA sequences for the coding regions of omega-secalin (omega-secalin) genes have been characterized from rye (Secale cereale L.), hexaploid and octoploid triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 1BL/1RS translocation line. Only 19 out of the 62 omega-secalin gene sequences were full-length open reading frames (ORFs), which can be expressed into functional proteins. The other 43 DNA sequences were pseudogenes, as their ORFs were interrupted by one or a few stop codons or frameshift mutations. The 19 omega-secalin genes have a typical primary structure, which is different from wheat gliadins. There was no cysteine residue in omega-secalin proteins, and the potential celiac disease (CD) toxic epitope (PQQP) was identified to appear frequently in the repetitive domains. The omega-secalin genes from various cereal species shared high homology in their gene sequences. The omega-secalin gene family has involved fewer variations after the integration of the rye R chromosome or whole genome into the wheat or triticale genome. The higher Ka/Ks ratio (i.e. non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions per site) in omega-secalin pseudogenes than in omega-secalin ORFs indicate that the pseudogenes may be subject to a reduced selection pressure. Based on the conserved sequences of omega-secalin genes, it will be possible to manipulate the expression of this gene family in lye, triticale, or wheat 1BL/1RS translocation lines, to reduce its negative effects on grain quality.

Melamine, which is often one of the adulterants in fishmeal, will indirectly or directly cause hazards to human or animal health. In this study, Fourier near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) was applied to achieve a rapid and cost-efficient classification and quantification technique for the authentification of fishmeal. The best model parameters and the characteristic wave bands of melamine were explored. The calibration models were established based on a principal components analysis (PCA)-Euclidean distance and partial least squares (PLS) regression algorithm. Five informative spectral bands (6828-6796 cm(-1), 5022-4978 cm(-1), 4776-4763 cm(-1), 4637-4616 cm(-1) and 4496-4481 cm(-1)) selected by the correlation coefficient method, were considered to be the characteristic wave bands of melamine. Savitzky-Golay (S-G) second derivative with smoothing over nine points and vector normalisation were the best pre-processing methods for a qualitative model; the 6873-6514 cm(-1) region was selected to establish a qualitative model according to the spectra of a melamine standard and fishmeal, and the correct classification rate for a set of test samples was 99.5%. The best parameters were S-G first derivative with smoothing over nine points and multiplicative scatter correction pre-processing over the spectral regions of 9947-7394 cm(-1) and 6915-5697 cm(-1) for a wide range model (samples with melamine concentrations of 0-15%). S-G first derivative with smoothing over nine points and vector normalisation pre-processing over the spectral ranges of 9947-5697 cm(-1) and 4605-4246 cm(-1) were selected for a narrow range model (samples with melamine concentrations of 0-5.5%). The root mean square error of cross-validation of the wide range model and the narrow range model were 0.396% and 0.25%, respectively; the coefficients of determination (R(2)) were 0.99 and 0.98; the root mean square error of prediction of testing set samples were 0.375% and 0.236%, respectively. The results demonstrate that FT-NIR can be used to detect and quantify melamine adulteration in fishmeal.

This study adopted methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) to compare the levels and patterns of cytosine methylation at CCGG sites in maize genome. The tissues assayed Included seedlings and tassels of C-type cytoplasmic male sterility (C Huang Zao Si, C 48-2) and its maintainer lines. For each tissue, both C Huang Zao Si and C 48-2 were more methylated than their corresponding maintainers not only on MSAP ratios, but also on the full methylation levels. In different nuclear backgrounds, the two tissues were more methylated In Huang Zao Si than in 48-2, although the two lines shared the same cytoplasm. Full methylation of internal cytosine was the dominant type in the maize genome. In addition, four different classes of methylation patterns were identified in tassels between C-CMS lines and their maintainer lines; these were specific-methylation, demethylation, hypo-methylation, and hyper-methylation. The results obtained demonstrated the power of the MSAP technique for large-scale DNA methylation detection in the maize genome, and suggested the possible association between DNA methylation polymorphism and C-type cytoplasmic male sterility.

FISH signals of pSc200 could be observed at both telomeres/subtelomeres of all 14 chromosomes of the parental rye. In the first allopolyploid generation, there were ten rye chromosomes bearing FISH signals at both telomeres/subtelomeres and four rye chromosomes bearing FISH signals at only one telomere/subtelomere. However, in the second and the third allopolyploid generations, there were 12 rye chromosomes bearing FISH signals at both telomeres/subtelomeres and 2 rye chromosomes bearing FISH signals at only one telomere/subtelomere. Rye telomeric segments were transferred to the centromeric region of wheat chromosomes in some cells and small segments derived from non-telomeric regions of rye chromosome were transferred to the telomeric region of wheat chromosomes in some other cells. These observations indicated that the rye telomeric/subtelomeric region was unstable in newly synthesized wheat-rye allopolyploids and allopolyploidization was accompanied by rapid inter/intra-genomic exchange. The inter-genomic exchange may have occurred in somatic cells.

The unique medical property of this chicken was recorded in Chinese traditional medicine dictionary about 700 years ago. In this study, we analyzed the mtDNA D-loop sequence variation of 26 Bairong Silkies from Fujian Province, China, together with 100 reported Silkie mtDNAs from China and Japan, and studied their matrilineal components and genetic relationship. A total of 21 haplotypes were detected, which could be assigned to six haplogroups (A-E, G). Among them, haplogroups D and G were exclusively presented in Japanese Silkies and Chinese Silkies, respectively. Chinese Silkies had higher frequency of lineages belonging to haplogroups A, B, and E, and lower frequency of haplogroup C than Japanese Silkies. For the four Chinese Silkie populations, most of samples of Taihe, Chengdu, and Hubei Silkies were grouped in haplogroups A, B, and C, whereas most of Bairong Silkies were grouped in haplogroup E. Five haplotypes were shared by Japanese and Chinese Silkies. The genetic diversity of each Silkie population varied, but the overall diversity of Chinese Silkies was similar to that of Japanese Silkies. Taken together, our results confirmed the genetic connection between Chinese and Japanese Silkies, but also clearly showed that the matrilineal genetic structures of Chinese and Japanese Silkies had some differences.

This technique used an indirect streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase labeling system with polyclonal antiserum developed against purified DSHDV antigens. Specimens from the experimentally inoculated Pekin ducks with DSHDV and archived paraffin-embedded tissues from natural cases of Duck viral swollen head hemorrhagic disease (DVSHD) were examined by clinical and histological criteria. Positive staining was most widely observed in the cytoplasm of the following organs: immune, digestive, and urinary organs, heart, lung, and trachea, which corresponded to the intracellular distribution of reovirus. The DSHDV antigens were first detected at 4 hr postinoculation in the bursa of Fabricius of infected ducks. Therefore, this method was suitable for the early diagnosis of DVSHD. Immunoperoxidase staining was not present in tissues and organs of sham-inoculated ducks (negative control). The IPA developed in the current study is a convenient, sensitive, and specific means of detecting DSHDV and is applicable to routine diagnosis, retrospective studies, and prospective studies of DSHDV infection in ducks.

GENETIC DIVERSITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF MAIZE LANDRACES FROM CHINA'S SICHUAN BASIN BASED ON AGRONOMIC TRAITS, QUALITY TRAITS, COMBINING ABILITY AND SSR MARKERS	MAYDICA			English	Article						Maize; Landrace; Genetic diversity; Heterotic group	INBRED LINES; TRANSGENIC MAIZE; COLLECTION; GERMPLASM; MEXICO	Twenty-two maize landraces representing all the ecosystems in the Sichuan Basin were analyzed based on agronomic traits, quality traits, combining ability and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Of the 22 landraces, Dazhaibaogu, Dahuang and Yuzuibaogu exhibited the best agronomic performance, while Nuoyumi, Rongzhaiyumi and Dadudu had the highest oil, protein and starch content, respectively. Thirteen of the landraces with medium to late maturity ratings were used in a combining ability study with five testers. General combining ability (GCA) effects for grain yield per plant were significantly different among the 13 landraces: five (Hanyuanhongbaogu, Dabaimaya, Xuesi, Dahuang and Dazhaibaogu) had the highest GCA effects. Based on the specific combing ability (SCA) effects for grain yield per plant, the 13 landraces were divided into three preliminary heterotic groups. A total of 220 individuals from the 22 landraces were fingerprinted with 41 SSR markers to determine the genetic diversity. The number of polymorphic bands, percentage of polymorphic bands, genetic diversity, effective number of alleles and Shannon's information index of the 22 landraces were 211, 74.18%, 0.27, 1.47 and 0.40, respectively. The 22 landraces were classed into three groups based on SSR markers. The results indicated that clustering of landraces was associated with the ecological environment from which the landraces originated. In this study, Dazhaibaogu, Dahuang, Yuzuibaogu, Xuesi and Dabaimaya were the landraces determined to have the most promising characteristics for further use in a maize breeding program.

QTL IDENTIFICATION FOR ROW NUMBER PER EAR AND GRAIN NUMBER PER ROW IN MAIZE	MAYDICA			English	Article						Maize (Zen mays L.); Row number per ear; Grain number per row; Quantitative trait locus; Nitrogen	GENETIC-ANALYSIS; RIL POPULATION; MAJOR QTL; YIELD; COMPONENTS; RESISTANCE; TRAITS	Row number per ear (RNPE) and grain number per row (GNPR) were two very important agronomic traits in maize (Zen mays L.), related to yield. To understand their genetic basis, an F(9) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and two nitrogen (N) regimes were used to map and characterize the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with RNPE and GNPR. As a result, three QTLs for RNPE were simultaneously detected under both N conditions, on chromosomes 4 (two) and 9 (one). The three identified QTLs could explain 44.55 and 43.26% of phenotypic variation under high and low N regimes, respectively. Among which, the one linked with Umc2188 (bin4.08) on chromosome 4 had negative additive effect, while, the other two possessed positive additive effects. For the trait GNPR, total five QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1 (one), 2 (one), 6 (two) and 9 (one), of which the two near to Bnlg439 (bin1.03) and Umc1490 (bin6.07) were detected at one time under the two N environments. These QTLs for GNPR could account for 45.47 and 62.15% of phenotypic variation under high and low N conditions respectively, and all of them had negative additive effects except for the one near to Bnlg1583 (bin9.01) on chromosome 9. These results were beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of RNPE and GNPR and carrying out maker-assisted breeding project in maize.	[Liu, X.

A NON-DESTRUCTIVE METHOD FOR MEASURING MAIZE KERNEL MOISTURE IN A BREEDING PROGRAM	MAYDICA			English	Article						Maize or corn; Moisture meter; Moisture; Kernel drydown	EAR MOISTURE; CORN; FIELD; SELECTION; MATURITY; YELLOW	Fast kernel drydown is an important trait that corn (maize) (Zea mays L.) breeders need to select for in short-season growing regions. Hybrids with faster drydown rates will decrease costs associated with forced air kernel drying after harvest. The goal of our research was to develop a tool that could be used to non-destructively measure kernel moisture in the field, thereby allowing the selection of genotypes with faster kernel drydown rates. An Electrophysics moisture meter model MT808 was modified with two steel pins which penetrated the husk and kernels to measure kernel moisture content. Analysis of the influence of husk and cob (rachis) on meter readings and moisture measurements was also conducted. The results indicated that the modified MT808 can be used for measuring corn ear and kernel moisture. Meter readings and kernel moisture, measured after destructive sampling and oven drying, were highly correlated. Total ear moisture readings (readings taken by inserting the pins thru the husk and into the kernels) could be used to predict oven dried kernel moisture, using the calibration curve y = 1.11x (r(2) = 0.79). Genotypic differences in kernel moisture were measurable using this meter. Husks influenced moisture measurements more in the early stages of ear development; while cobs influenced moisture measurements when kernel moisture was between 20-60%. The use of this modified hand-held moisture meter can be used to improve the selection for kernel drydown in short-season corn as this meter records data faster and is lighter weight and easier to use in the field than previously used meters.

These three diseases are responsible for most disease-related reductions in yield and quality. To identify QTL chromosome regions for resistance to these three ERs and to investigate the relationship among these resistances, 87(eightyseven) initial QTL from 14 studies were used to project meta-QTL (MQTL) on a high-density genetic linkage map (IBM2 neighbors 2008). The results showed that 29 MQTL (each MQTL comprising two to six initial QTL) were projected on chromosomes 1 to 8. Six MQTL located on chromosomes 3 and 4 were recommended to use for improving ER resistance in a marker assisted selection (MAS) program. Meta-analysis also indicated that QTL from different ER types and resistance sources were clustered on the same chromosome regions, particularly on bins 3.04 and 2.08. Among eight resistance sources, CO387 contributed 18 of 29 MQTL.	[Xiang, K.; Zhang, Z. M.; Yuan, G. S.; Pan, G. T.] Sichuan Agr Univ, Maize Res Inst, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Reid, L.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the potential associations between MEF2A gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the carcass traits in 471 chicken samples from four populations. Three new SNPs (T46023C, A72626G, and T89232G) were detected in the chicken MEF2A gene. The T46023C genotypes were associated with live body weight (BW), carcass weight (CW), eviscerated weight, semi-eviscerated weight (SEW), and leg muscle weight (LMW) (P < 0.05); the A72626G genotypes were associated with BW, CW, LMW (P < 0.01) and breast muscle weight (BMW), leg muscle percentage (LMP) (P < 0.05); whereas the T89232G genotypes were associated with carcass percentage (CP) and semi-eviscerated percentage (SEP) (P < 0.05). The haplotypes constructed on the three SNPs were associated with BW, CW, LMW (P < 0.01), SEW, BMW, CP (P < 0.05). Significantly and suggestive dominant effects of diplotype H1H2 were observed for BW, CW, SEW, BMW and CP, whereas diplotype H5H5 had a negative effect on BW, CW, SEW, BMW and LMW. Our results suggest that the MEF2A gene may be a potential marker affecting the muscle trait of chickens.

DNA of Pseudoroegneria spicata (St), P. libanotica (St), P. stipifolia (St), R. ciliaris (StY), Lopophyllum elongatum (Ee), Agropyron cristatum (P) and Hordeum bogdanii (H) were used for probing, respectively. The results indicated that: 1) R. alashanica and R. magnicaespes contained one St genome, the other genome was unidentified, however, it was not an E, P, H or Y genome; 2) R. elytrigioides contained two St genomes and should on this basis be included in Pseudoroegneria; 3) R. grandis contained an St and an Stg genome. The Stg genome is suggested to be a modified form of the St genome of Pseudoroegneria and to be homoeologous with the Y genome. It might be an intermediate type between the St and Y genomes. Therefore, R. elytrigioides should be treated as Pseudoroegneria elytrigioides. Roegneria alashanica, R. magnicaespes and R. grandis does apparently not belong in the genus Roegneria but further studies are needed to establish their correct taxonomic position.

IUGR Does Not Predispose to Necrotizing Enterocolitis or Compromise Postnatal Intestinal Adaptation in Preterm Pigs	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; PARENTERAL-NUTRITION; ENTERAL NUTRITION; NEWBORN PIGS; MORTALITY; MORBIDITY; INFANTS; OUTCOMES	IUGR and preterm birth are leading causes of neonatal morbidity. We tested the hypothesis that IUGR predisposes to gut maladaption and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) using preterm pigs as models for preterm infants. First, full-term normal birth weight (NW) and IUGR (similar to 65% of NW) pigs were compared. IUGR reduced intestinal weight per length, proportion mucosa, villous area, and sucrase activity at 2 d after birth (p < 0.05) but did not change relative organ weights. Next, groups of preterm pigs were fed formula or colostrum, starting at birth or after 2-3 d of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Neonatal mortality (not related to NEC) was increased in IUGR versus NW preterm pigs (28 vs 10%, p < 0.01). NEC incidence was similar between IUGR and NW but higher after formula than colostrum feeding (46 vs 12%, p < 0.01) and higher after TPN than without TPN (61 vs 34% for formula pigs, p < 0.01). After feeding, relative intestinal mass and length were higher in IUGR versus NW pigs (+25-80%, p < 0.05) while brush border enzyme activities were similar. An enhanced gut trophic response to enteral feeding, may help to improve postnatal intestinal adaptation and NEC resistance in preterm IUGR newborns.

However, we know very little about soil carbon and nitrogen processes under the snowpack in these ecosystems, including the Tibetan Plateau. We conducted an experiment comparing three snow regimes (11 m x 1 m plots) of different snow depths and durations at an altitude of 4,100 m in the Minshan Range on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The three snow regimes included a shallow and short duration snowpack (SS; depth <10 cm), a moderate snow depth and medium duration snowpack (MS; depth <20 cm), as well as a deep and long duration snowpack (DS; depth > 30 cm). This study explores the effects of different snow conditions on soil temperature, and further describes the sequence and timing of dissolved nutrients and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) in soils under different snow regimes during the autumn-winter transition (i.e. November 7, 2008 - March 7, 2009). Three successive phases of temperature change were distinguished: I - initial decline - soil temperatures dropped steadily from 4 degrees C to about 0 degrees C at the same rate for all three snow regimes; II - moderate freezing - soil temperatures fluctuated between 0 degrees C and -7 degrees C under all three snow regimes; III - multiple freeze-thaw cycles took place in the SS and MS regimes, but permanent freezing occurred in the DS regime. Under moderate freezing, we found that soil temperature fluctuation was an essential factor for the transformation of soil C and N. Our results indicate that larger temperature fluctuations correlate with a greater increase in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content increased markedly only under the most drastic temperature fluctuations. In contrast, MBC content increased significantly only when soil temperatures were relatively steady. Under the permanent freezing, only a large number of freeze-thaw cycles caused a significant decline of NO(3)(-)-N and DOC concentrations. DON content declined markedly under permanent freezing and multiple freeze-thaw cycles. However, MBC content declined significantly only under permanent freezing. Ultimately, multiple freeze-thaw cycles resulted in the export of dissolved nutrients (organic and inorganic nitrogen) from the alpine ecosystem which had previously accumulated in the moderate freezing phase of the soil.

(alder) is an ecologically valuable tree genus. It is essential to study its genetic makeup in order to use alder trees to their full potential. Five specimens from four Alnus species (A. mandshurica, A. pendula, A. sibirica, and A. sieboldiana), found in northeastern Asia, were subjected to karyotype analysis. The analysis showed that these tree samples could be divided into three categories based on chromosome numbers or ploidy levels: viz., 2n = (4x) = 28, 2n = (8x) = 56 and 2n = (16x) = 112. The differences in chromosome number and karyotype parameters among Alnus species and even within the same species possibly resulted from natural polyploidization. Comparing the chromosome numbers of Alnus species in China with those in Japan showed that there appear to be only two categories in China, whereas there are up to five categories in Japan. The earliest fossil records of Alnus pollen were also discovered in Japan. We conclude that the center origin of Alnus spp. is Japan rather than China.

Traditional irrigation methods used in rice farming often result in great water loss. New water-saving methods are urgently needed to reduce water consumption. Three field and pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the furrow irrigation (FI) system to improve water use efficiency (WUE) and production of direct sowing rice in southern China. Compared to the conventional irrigation (CI) system (continuous flooding irrigation), for every square hectometer of rice field, the FI system reduced water use by 3130 m(3), or 48.1%, and increased grain production by 13.9% for an early cultivar. For a late cultivar, the FI system reduced water use by 2655 m(3), or 40.6%, and an increase of grain production by 12.1%. The improved WUE in the FI system is attributed to (1) a significant reduction of irrigation rate, seepage, evaporation, and evapotranspiration; (2) a significant reduction in the reduced materials, such as ferrous ion (Fe(2+)), and therefore an increase in the vitality of the root system, evident by the increases in the number of white roots by 32.62%, and decreases in the number of black roots by 20.04% and yellow roots by 12.58%; the use of the FI system may also reduce humidity of the rice field and enhance gas transport in the soil and light penetration, which led to reduced rice diseases and increased leaf vitality; and (3) increases in tiller and effective spikes by 11.53% and the weight per thousand grains by 1.0 g. These findings suggest that the shallow FI system is a promising means for rice farming in areas with increasing water shortages.

Guang yi is commonly grown in south-western China as forage for livestock but production during the late autumn-early spring period is limited. The objective of this study was to determine if over-sowing small grains or ryegrass into whipgrass swards could extend the production season for the pasture, especially in late autumn and early spring. The study was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in Ya'an, Sichuan Province, China. Triticale (Triticosecale spp.) cv. Zhongsi 828, rye (Secale cereale) cv. Dongmu 70 and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) cv. Changjiang No 2 were broadcast in early September into whipgrass swards, which had been cut and disced. In late autumn (Harvest 1), forage yields of all mixtures were 1.62 t/ha higher on average than that of whipgrass monoculture (yield 0.19 t/ha). In spring (Harvests 2-4), mixtures of whipgrass with annual ryegrass, triticale and rye produced 12.51, 10.67 and 10.16 t/ha, respectively, compared with 2.76 t/ha for whipgrass monoculture. The mixtures contained less than 40% whipgrass. Highest crude protein concentrations in autumn (186 g/kg) and spring (122-146 g/kg) were in pure whipgrass and the whipgrass-ryegrass mixture. In summer, virtually all available forage on all treatments was whipgrass, with yields in excess of 20 t/ha and crude protein concentration of 78 g/kg. This study suggests that ryegrass, triticale and rye can be successfully sown into whipgrass swards in autumn without the use of herbicides, to increase autumn-spring and total season forage production in the following year.

The sequence of strawberry PGIP gene was obtained using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and its expression in different tissues was studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. A cDNA fragment of FaPGIP gene was cloned and the sequence analysis shows that the fragment contains a full ORF of 999 bp encoding 332 amino acids. The FaPGIP gene from genomic DNA shows a single 168bp intron that is efficiently spliced out of the FaPGIP pre-mRNA transcript. The FaPGIP has a high degree of identity with previously isolated PGIP genes and the encoded polypeptide shows all the characteristic features of PGIP peptides. The 3 dimensional model of the protein contains 12 alpha-helices and 21 beta-sheets, and the center LRR structural domain is composed of 10 tandem LRR motifs. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed FaPGIP gene displaying high expression levels in fruit and leaf, middle expression in flower and root, and weak expression in stem. The expression level of FaPGIP gene is particular to tissues.

The substitution saturation analysis of trnL-F sequences in this study suggested that they are suitable for phylogenetic analysis. In the trnL-F sequences tree, 4 major clades were formed: (a) the St/E clade comprised all of the Pseudoroegneria species together with species in Roegneria, Elytrigia, Douglasdeweya and Lophopyrum; (b) A. cristatum, A. mongolicum, and A. pectinatum subsp. retrofractum formed the P/W clade; (c) the Ns clade included species in Psathyrostachys; and (d) the H clade consisted of Hordeum species. The results suggested that: (a) diploid Pseudoroegneria species were the maternal donors of St-containing polyploid species in Pseudoroegneria, Roegneria, Douglasdeweya, and Elytrigia, and the trnL-F sequences were highly similar among them; (b) the trnL-F sequences of Agropyron species and Australopyrum species were similar, and the P genome was closely related to the W genome; and (c) the trnL-F sequences of species with the H or Ns genomes diverged greatly from that of species with the St, E, P, or W genomes.

The percentage of peripheral blood ANAE(+) T cells, PCV2 antibody titer, immunoglobulins, and serum IFN-gamma, IL-2, and sIL-2R levels were determined. The results show that the percentage of peripheral blood ANAE+ T cells was notably higher in inoculated pigs 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) and significantly lower 21 dpi than in the control group. The anti-PCV2 titer in the inoculated group was significantly higher than that in the control group 14 dpi. The immunoglobulin profile of the 2 groups also differed. The IFN-gamma level in the inoculated group decreased significantly from 7 to 28 dpi, as compared with the control group. The results suggest that PCV2 challenge results in an immune system response.

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on the cell survival rate and the antioxidant defense system. MARC-145 cells were treated with ATRA after infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The cell survival rate, total antioxidant capability (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and glutathione (GSH) content were determined in samples collected from cells incubated with ATRA for 24 or 48 h. The results show that PRRSV infection induced a marked decrease in the cell survival rate, SOD activity, GSH-PX activity, GSH content, and T-AOC, and increased hydrogen radical and LDH activity. ATRA supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) increased the cell survival rate, T-AOC, SOD activity, GSH-PX activity, and GSH content, and decreased hydrogen radical production and LDH activity, indicating that ATRA obviously strengthened the cellular antioxidant defense system, improving radical scavenging activity and regulating the intracellular dynamic equilibrium between the oxidation and antioxidation systems. Enhanced antioxidant capacity may explain why the cells treated with ATRA had increased resistance to PRRSV infection. Lower cell survival rates after PRRSV infection might have been due to impaired antioxidant capacity. The present findings suggest that the redox state may play a crucial role in the cell survival rate, and that exogenously administered ATRA may be of value in the treatment of PRRSV infection.

Nitrogen removal process was studied under three aeration strategies/modes, referred to as MODE 1, 2, and 3. The results showed that MODE 2 (one operation period: instant fill of LPBWs, 3.0 h aeration, 1.5 h non-aeration, 1.5 h aeration, 1.0 h non-aeration and rapid drain of treated LPBWs) performed the best in nitrogen removal. Under MODE 2, the removal efficiencies were as high as 96.1 and 92.1% for NH(3)-N and TN, respectively. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND), as well as shortcut nitrification and denitrification are likely to be the two main mechanisms for the nitrogen removal in this study. Nitrifying bateria were not inhibited by heterotrophic bacteria with C/N ratios ranging from 18.1 to 21.4 and DO concentration of 2.0 mg/l. Alternation between aeration and non-aeration played an important role in NO(2)(-)-N accumulation.

The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Hordoindoline a (hina) gene and its relationship with hardness index among North American barley cultivars were investigated. The hina genes in 36 cultivars were sequenced for the SNP analyses, and 17 sets of SNP primers were designed to detect the SNP variations of hina locus in 92 North American barley cultivars. SNP detection indicated that there were four haplotypes in the hina genes of 92 barley cultivars, and haplotype 01 and 02 were shared by 68 and 14 cultivars, respectively, suggesting that there was a very limited diversity in hina genes among North American barley cultivars. Despite the wide range in hardness exists in 92 barley cultivars, however, unlike wheat, where a clear relationship has been demonstrated between a number of SNPs in the wheat hardness genes and quality (soft or hard wheat), there was no such relationship for barley. The genotypes used in this study demonstrated that there was a low level of polymorphism in hina gene in North American barley cultivars and these polymorphisms had no impact on grain hardness.

A reference diet (RF) and test diets (consisting of 70% RF diet and 30% of the feedstuff) were used with 0.5% chromic oxide as an external indicator. A total of 1440 shrimp (initial mean body weight 1.05 +/- 0.01 g) were randomly stocked into thirty-six 500-L fibreglass tanks with 40 shrimp per tank and three tanks per diet. Faeces were collected from triplicate groups of shrimp by a faecal collection vessel attached to the shrimp-rearing tank. The shrimp were fed to apparent satiation four times a day and the feeding experiment lasted for 6 weeks. Statistics indicate that apparent DM digestibilities for white shrimp (L. vannamei) were the highest for FM, ranged 52.83-71.23% for other animal products and 69.98-77.10% for plant products. The protein and lipid from plant and animal sources were well digested by white shrimp. Apparent protein and lipid digestibility were in the range 87.89-93.18% and 91.57-95.28%, respectively, in plant products, and 75.00-92.34% and 83.72-92.79%, respectively, for animal products. The white shrimp demonstrated a high capacity to utilize phosphorus in the ingredients. The apparent phosphorus digestibility ranges of animal feedstuffs and plant feedstuffs were 58.90-71.61% and 75.77-82.30% respectively. Amino acid availability reflected protein digestibility, except that in MBM, for which the availability of some amino acid was lower, possibly due to protein damage during processing. Digestibility information could promote the use of ingredient substitution in least-cost formulated diets for white shrimp.

Methods: Totally 21 rhesus monkeys were randomly divided into 4 groups: metacavir 120 mg/kg group, metacavir 40 mg/kg group, zidovudine(AZT) 50 mg/kg group, and blank control group. Animals were killed after the completion of dosing or further observed in a 4-week recovery phase. Changes of structure of mitochondria in liver, kidney, skeletal muscles, and cardiac muscles were observed under transmission electron microscope(TEM). Changes of the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial DNA were also determined. Results: In metacavir 120 mg/kg group, some mitochondrial injuries were found in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and liver, including that some cristae was broken and became sparse in density in the skeletal muscle, the morphology and size of mitochondria remained unchanged. Metacavir decreased the activities of respiratory chain complexes I and II and the mtDNA contents in three tissues in a dose-dependent manner; however, the extent of such decrease was lower than that in AZT 50 mg/kg group. The mitochondrial injuries in metacavir 40 mg/kg group were mild in each tissue and no obvious change in mitochondrial function was noted. On week 4 in the recovery phase, results showed that all these injuries were reversible after drug withdrawal. Conclusion: These results suggest that metacavir has not a high risk for potential mitochondrial-related effects in rhesus monkeys.

Among the 36 antibiotics tested, 50% of the analyzed isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefazolin, cefepime, cefuroxime, oxacillin, penicillin G, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Higher levels of resistance were detected for aztreonam, cefepime, oxacillin, penicillin G, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (87.8%, 64.3%, 88.6%, 86.9%, 75.9%, and 79.2% resistance, respectively). The lowest resistance rates were observed for amikacin (9.5%), cefoperazone (7.2%), imipenem (3.2%), and neomycin (9.5%). Four isolates were found to be resistant to 29 different antimicrobials. Riemerella anatipestifer drug resistance profiles changed over time, and the only consistent patterns observed were the resistance of R. anatipestifer to cefoperazone, piperacillin, spectinomycin, and aztreonam. In addition to determining the antibiotic-resistance profiles of R. anatipestifer isolates, we also examine the therapeutic efficacy of these antibiotics against lethal R. anatipestifer infection in ducks in vivo. According to these data, we have extrapolated an antibiotic treatment approach for veterinarians attending flocks of ducks. These data suggest that disk-diffusion analyses can be extrapolated to predict in vivo efficacy, thereby facilitating the identification of effective antibacterial treatments and potentially diminishing the irresponsible use of antibiotics.

However, little is known about its genetic and geographical patterns. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were applied to assess genetic diversity and geographical divergence among 63 E nutans accessions from west China. The cluster analysis separated the accessions into several groups with geographical origins. The molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) showed that the proportion of variance explained by within- and among-geographical group diversity was 43.2% and 56.8%, respectively. Based on pairwise genetic distances (Phi(ST)) between geographical groups, the relationships were congruent with the cluster of accessions. The distinct geographical divergence of E nutans was revealed between Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang. The ecogeographical conditions such as climate and mountain ranges and elevation behaved as the crucial factors for genetic divergence. Furthermore, the study also indicated that Qinghai-Tibet Plateau might be the diversity differentiation center of E nutans. The result will facilitate the breeding program and germplasm collection and conservation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The percentages of CD (4) (+) and CD (8) (+) T cells were decreased in three high-fluorine groups when compared with those of control group. Meanwhile, the CD (4) (+) /CD (8) (+) ratio were lower in high-fluorine group II at 28 days of age and in high-fluorine group III at 42 days of age than in control group. Also, the serum interleukin-2 (IL-2) contents were decreased in three high-fluorine groups when compared with those of control group. Histopathologically, the thymus became hypocellular in three high-fluorine groups. It was concluded that dietary fluorine excess (400 similar to 1,200 ppm) reduced the percentages of T-lymphocyte subsets and the serum IL-2 contents, and cellular immune function could be affected in chickens.

All its species, including those that are not used for cereals or forage, are potential sources of genes for crop and forage improvement so they all have high economic value. Taxonomic treatments, including those of the Triticeae, are the basis for identification. They are often designed to reflect phylogenetic relationships and provide a guide for germplasm utilization. Traditional taxonomic treatments of the Triticeae were based on comparative morphology and geography. Morphological characters are phenotypes of an organism, resulting from interactions between or among dominant genes and environmental factors. Morphology cannot reflect recessive inheritance. Similar environmental conditions may result in morphological convergence in distantly related taxa and different environmental conditions in morphological divergence of closely related taxa. Consequently, traditional morphological taxonomy may result in misclassification. Cytogenetic and/or molecular genomic analysis may reveal such mistakes. On the basis of recent genomic investigations of the Triticeae, we have recognized 30 genera in this tribe. The taxonomic changes and genomic constitution of these genera are presented in this paper.

Molecular cloning of the two very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) subtypes in geese and the effect of overfeeding on their MRNA levels. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 89: 441-448. The objectives of this study were to verify the existence Of two subtypes of the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) gene in geese, to investigate the effect of overfeeding on the plasma concentration of triglycerides (TG) and the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and the mRNA level of VLDLR in Sichuan White geese and Landes geese. The results indicate that there Lire two subtypes of the VLDLR gene in geese, and that they share a high similarity with those of other species. The expression of VLDLR I and VLDLR II was found in both tissues examined. After overfeeding, the expression level of VLDLR I in adipose tissue showed about a onefold increase (P<0.05) in both breeds. Overfeeding induced a significant decrease of VLDLR I in skeletal muscle of both breeds, and a significant decrease of VLDLR I I in Sichuan White geese (P<0.05), but an obvious increase of VLDLR II in Landes geese (P<0.05). In addition, overfeeding induced the increase of plasma VLDL, TG concentration and plasma LPL activity. It was concluded that VLDLR may participate in the metabolism of VLDL-TG by regulating the LPL-mediated TG hydrolysis in geese.

Carbon accumulation, nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency of Sophora davidii seedlings in response to nitrogen supply and water stress	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						C accumulation; N and P use efficiency; N supply; Sophora davidii; Water deficit	NUTRIENT-USE EFFICIENCY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; CONTINENTAL-SCALE; PLANT NITROGEN; PINUS-RADIATA; GROWTH; LIMITATION; ECOSYSTEM	A greenhouse experiment was conducted to explore whether additional nitrogen (N) supply could enhance carbon (C) accumulation, and phosphorus (P) use efficiency (NUEp) of Sophora davidii seedlings under dry conditions. Two-month-old seedlings were subjected to a completely randomized design with three water (80, 40 and 20% water field capacity (FC)) and three N supply (N0: 0, Nl: 92 and Nh: 184 mg N kg(-1) soil) regimes. Water stress decreased C, N and P accumulation, NUE(P), N and P uptake efficiency (NUtE(N) and NUtE(P)) regardless of N supply. The S. davidii seedlings exhibited strong responses to N supply, but the responses were not consistent with the various N supply levels. Nl increased C, N and P accumulation, and improved NUE(P), NUtE(N) and NUtE(P) in the same water treatment. In contrast, Nh did few or even depress effects on C, N and P accumulation, and NUEp, although NUtE(N) and NUtE(P) increased with Nil in the same water treatment. Even so, NUE(N) decreased with increase of N supply in the same water treatment. The results suggested that appropriate or low N supply should be recommended for S. davidii seedling establishment in dry environment by improving C accumulation and NUE(P). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, ZL; Zhu, CM; Luo, QH; Pan, KC; Cheng, AC				Chen, Zhengli; Zhu, Chunmei; Luo, Qihui; Pan, Kangcheng; Cheng, Anchun			Expression of estrogen receptor alpha, nerve growth factor, interleukin-2, and androgen receptor in the cerebellum of ovariectomized rats following soybean isoflavone treatment	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH			English	Article						soybean isoflavone; estrogen receptor alpha; nerve growth factor; interleukin-2; androgen receptor; cerebellum	BETA MESSENGER-RNA; SOY PHYTOESTROGENS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; FEMALE RATS; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; SYSTEM	BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and androgen receptor (AR) expression in the cerebellum decreases when estrogen levels decrease in vivo. Soybean isoflavone, a type of non-steroid estrogen with similar molecular structure and function to estradiol, exhibits estrogen-like characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of various doses of soybean isoflavone on expression of ERa, NGF, IL-2, and AR in the cerebellum of ovariectomized rat, and to determine whether there is a dose-dependent effect. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: Controlled trial at the cellular and molecular level. The study was performed at the Experimental Animal Engineering Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University from July 2006 to May 2008. MATERIALS: Soybean isoflavone, comprised of daidzin, genistein and isoflavone, was provided by Taiyuan Yuantai Biochemical Industry, China. The ERa, NGF, IL-2, and AR in situ hybridization kit, rabbit anti-rat ER alpha, NGF, IL-2, and AR monoclonal antibodies, and SABC kit were purchased from Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, China. METHODS: A total of 50 female, Sprague Dawley rats, aged 3 months, were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 10 animals in each group. With the exception of the sham-operation group (abdominal cavity opening alone), all rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy. At 14 days after surgery, rats in the high-, middle-, and low-dose soybean isoflavone groups were subcutaneously injected with 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 mg/kg soybean isoflavone, respectively, every 2 days for 6 consecutive weeks. Rats in the sham-operation and ovariectomized groups were subcutaneously injected with absolute alcohol (0.5 mL/kg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expression levels and distribution of ER alpha, NGF, IL-2, and AR in the cerebellum were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operation group, immunoreactive products and hybridization signals of ER alpha, NGF, IL-2, and AR were significantly decreased in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei of ovariectomized rats (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but increased following soybean isoflavone treatment. In particular, levels of the high-dose soybean isoflavone group were almost restored to levels of the sham-operation group (P > 0.05). The immunoreactive products were primarily located in the cytoplasm and neurites, and rarely in the cell membrane and nuclei. However, the hybridization signals were predominantly located in the nuclei, but rarely in the cytoplasm, cell membrane, or neurites. CONCLUSION: Soybean isoflavone upregulated ER alpha, NGF, IL-2, and AR protein and gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, and played an important role in sustaining and protecting structure and function of cerebellar neurons. Moreover, the similarity of expression patterns of these molecules indicated that they were mutually interactive during the regulation of soybean isoflavone to the cerebellum.

Strawberry seedlings were exposed to four temperatures (25 degrees C or control, 10 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 0 degrees C) and the compounds and enzyme activities were determined during six evaluation periods (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and H 2 0 2 concentrations fluctuated and increased overall at lower temperatures. The production rate of superoxide radical (O-2(-)) increased continuously with all treatments. Cold stress increased antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), when compared with the control. Ascorbate (AsA) content reduced, however dehydroascorbate (DHA) showed a significant increase, as did the ASA/DHA ratio. The results suggest that the ascorbate-glutathione cycle is regulated in response to low temperature, but this mechanism and consequently regulation ability peaks and declines with exposure to cold stress.

SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the presence of acidic protein gave rise to the formation of inclusion body, however, the absence of acidic protein greatly enhanced the solubility of the heterogenous protein expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the induction of 1 mmol . L(-1) IPTG at 37 degrees C. Difference spectra in amide I region were obtained by subtraction between the spectra of intact cells containing S and Sc, which corresponds to the absence and presence of C-terminal acidic proteins, respectively. The second derivative of the difference spectra measured 2 h after induction showed one principal component at similar to 1 630 cm(-1), while no significant peak appeared at the same peak position when the spectra before induction were compared. Combined with SDS-PAGE of recombinant protein, the authors presumed that the peak absorption at similar to 1 630 cm(-1) is most likey to be assigned to protein aggregate within inclusion body. Gaussian curve-fitting was done on the Fourier self-deconvolution spectra within amide I region of intact cells containing S and Sc. The experimental data revealed that the relative content of aggregate absorption at (1 629 +/- 1) cm(-1) gradually increased with induction time, which is consistent with the results of SDS-PAGE. Simultaneously, the formation of aggregate gave rise to the increase of alpha helix, as well as the decrease of beta turn and random coil in the case of Sc. It was not the case for S, however, where random coil experienced the increase in the relative average fractions, while beta-turn and beta sheet at (1 629 +/- 1) cm(-1) behaved in different ways. The above mentioned phenomenon indicated that beta-sheet and random coil are most likely to transform into aggregate and alpha helix with the introduction of C-terminal acidic protein.

We screened 770 maize inbred lines with 1,034 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and identified 449 high-quality markers with no germplasm-specific biasing effects. Pairwise comparisons across three distinct sets of germplasm, CIMMYT (394), China (282), and Brazil (94), showed that the elite lines from these diverse breeding pools have been developed with only limited utilization of genetic diversity existing in the center of origin. Temperate and tropical/subtropical germplasm clearly clustered into two separate groups. The temperate germplasm could be further divided into six groups consistent with known heterotic patterns. The greatest genetic divergence was observed between temperate and tropical/subtropical lines, followed by the divergence between yellow and white kernel lines, whereas the least divergence was observed between dent and flint lines. Long-term selection for hybrid performance has contributed to significant allele differentiation between heterotic groups at 20% of the SNP loci. There appeared to be substantial levels of genetic variation between different breeding pools as revealed by missing and unique alleles. Two SNPs developed from the same candidate gene were associated with the divergence between two opposite Chinese heterotic groups. Associated allele frequency change at two SNPs and their allele missing in Brazilian germplasm indicated a linkage disequilibrium block of 142 kb. These results confirm the power of SNP markers for diversity analysis and provide a feasible approach to unique allele discovery and use in maize breeding programs.

In this investigation, cokriging method was used to conduct the interpolation of Cu concentraiton in cropland soil in Shuangliu County, Sichuan Province, China. Based on the original 623 physicochmically measured soil samples, 560, 498, and 432 sub-samples were randomly selected as target variable and soil organic matter (SOM) of the whole original samples as auxiliary variable. Interpolation results using Cokriging under different sampling numbers were evaluated for their applicability in estimating the spatial distribution of soil Cu at county sacle. The results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) produced by Cokriging decreased from 0.9 to 7.77%, correlation coefficient between the predicted values and the measured increased from 1.76 to 9.76% in comparison with the ordinary Kriging under the corresponding sample sizes. The prediction accuracy using Cokriging was still higher than original 623 data using ordinary Kriging even as sample size reduced 10%, and their interpolation maps were highly in agreement. Therefore, Cokriging was proven to be a more accurate and economic method which could provide more information and benefit for the studies on spatial distribution of soil pollutants at county scale.

High phosphorus concentrations were observed in the seedling and flowering stages of two species, Pilea sinofasciata and Polygonum hydropiper, up to 16.23 and 8.59 g kg(-1), respectively, which were 3.4 and 7 times higher than in the non-mining ecotypes. Available phosphorus levels in the respective rhizosphere soils of these plants were 112.84 and 121.78 mg kg(-1), 12 and 4 times higher than in the non-rhizosphere soil. Phosphorus concentrations in shoots of the mining ecotypes of all 12 species were significantly negatively correlated with available phosphorus in the rhizosphere soils (p < 0.05), whereas a positive correlation was observed in the non-mining ecotypes. The biomass in shoot of the mining ecotype of P. hydropiper was nearly 2 times that in the non-mining ecotype. The results suggested that P. sinofasciata and R hydropiper were efficient candidates among the tested species for phosphorus accumulation in shoots, and that further studies should be conducted to investigate their potential to be adopted as phosphorus accumulators.

The substituent and temperature effects on the title reaction have been discussed from the aspects of thermodynamic properties, geometric parameters, and natural population analysis. The calculated results show that the substituent R has little effect on the reaction, while the changes caused by the substituents Y on the benzene ring (Y=MeO, Me, H, Cl, and NO2) in the corresponding activation free energies (Delta G(not equal)), bond lengths (Delta R-not equal), bond angles (Delta a(not equal)), and atomic charges (Delta q(not equal)) have linear correlations with Hammet constant (sigma): Delta P-not equal = rho sigma+C, (P=G, R, a and q, r>0.95). The electron-donating group decreases the activation free energies and bond lengths, but increases the bond angles and natural electric charges. By contraries, the electron-withdrawing group has the opposite effect.

The ARDRA analysis revealed considerable genomic diversity. In AFLP analysis, 20 of 33 Astragalus rhizobia formed three distinct clades, with others dispersed into different groups with the reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the rrs gene of six representative strains showed that the isolates were members of the genus Mesorhizobium. Three of the isolates formed a sister clade to Mesorhizobium loti and Mesorhizobium ciceri, whereas the other three formed a sister clade to a clade harboring the species Mesorhizobium huakuii, Mesorhizobium plurifarum, Mesorhizobium septentrionale and Mesorhizobium amorphae, indicating the existence of two new species. Phylogenetic analysis of glnA and glnII confirmed the rrs phylogenies for four strains, but the trees were incongruent. The nifH sequences of the strains formed a monophyletic clade and were typical of those of mesorhizobia forming symbioses with inverted repeat lacking clade legume species. The incongruent phylogenies of the genes studied suggest that horizontal gene transfer and recombination shape mesorhizobial populations in the gene center of the host plants.

In the present study, we first isolated the WAP2 allele (where the superscript "t" refers to the speciese source, in this case "tauschii") on chromosome 5D from Aegilops tauschii Coss., the D-genome donor species of common wheat. We found that WAP2 and the AP2 gene from Arabidopsis share a central core of the AP2 polypeptide, a highly basic 10-amino acid domain, and an AASSGF box, although there are many differences in the 37-amino acid serine-rich acidic domain and the remaining regions. In addition, W(t)AP2 was highly homologous to the homoeologous loci on 5A and 5B of wheat at both the nucleotide and amino acid level. However, there were some variations that are probably related to gene function. In the first AP2 domain, the amino acids VYL on the 5D and 5A loci were replaced with LLR on 5B. In the 37-amino acid serine-rich acidic domain, W(t)AP2 on 5D had an extra amino acid insertion. There was also a variation at the 329 amino acid position, which is thought to be related to the appearance of free-threshing wheat. At this position, the amino acid is isoleucine on 5A for the Q allele and valine for the q allele, whereas the amino acid is leucine on 5D and 5B. Furthermore, a Stowaway miniature terminal inverted repeat element (MITE) insertion was present in the ninth intron of WAP2 on 5B of all common wheats and partial tetraploid Triticum turgidum wheats. These results provide new clues for studies into the evolutionary biology of WAP2 and the origin of common wheat.

Karyotypes were mainly characterized by the difference in numbers and positions of submetacentric chromosomes and chromosomes with satellited pair, the index of the karyotypic asymmetry, and the ratio of the longest to the shortest chromosome. Pollen morphology were mainly characterized by the discrepancy in specific pollen size, P/E ratio, colpi width, distance between the apices of two ectocolpi, and exine ornamentation characters. The cluster results based on RAPD markers were consistent with morphology classification except for R. pinfaensis; (3) Based on the general data of karyotypic, palynological, and RAPD, R. ellipticus var. obcordatus should be treated as a species R. obcordatus, R. ellipticus and R. pinfaensis should be combined as R. ellipticus, and it was more reasonable to place the combinants and R. obcordatus into subsection Stimulantes rather than into subsection Pungentes.

However, there are few studies on hedgerows' effect on soil fertility of sloping lands. With an 8-year fixed field experiment, we investigated the effect of two different hedgerows on soil fertility through comparing with the control. Our results showed that along contour lines across the field, clay particles tended to accumulate above plant hedgerows but to be eroded downward below hedgerows. Except for potassium (K), all plant nutrients and soil organic matter showed the same distribution pattern as clay particles. K, however, was evenly distributed in the field without any noticeable influence from hedgerows. Since the beginning of our field experiment, soil phosphorus (P) kept accumulating, while soil organic matter and K were in depletion. Taken together, our results suggest that better nutrient management for the sloping lands should reduce P but increase farm manure and K. As far as the whole sloping field is concerned, special attention in nutrient management should be paid to the soil stripes below hedgerows, the portions suffering from more serious soil erosion.

Jian). A total of 1050 Jian carp (22.28 +/- 0.07 g) were randomly distributed into seven groups of three replicates each, feeding diets containing graded levels of MI (163.5, 232.7, 384.2, 535.8, 687.3, 838.8 and 990.3 mg kg-1 diet) for 60 days. Results indicated that the malondialdehyde content was the lowest for fish fed diets containing >= 384.2 mg MI kg-1, and the highest for fish fed the MI-unsupplemented basal diet (P < 0.05). The protein carbonyl content was decreased with increasing dietary MI levels up to 535.8 mg kg-1 diet, and no differences were found with a further increase in the MI concentration. The anti-superoxide anion capacity (ASA) and anti-hydroxyl radical capacity (AHR) were increased with increasing MI levels up to 535.8 mg kg-1 diet, and plateaued thereafter. The superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities showed the same tendency with the ASA capacity. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reducase activities were improved with increasing MI levels up to 838.8, 384.2 and 687.3 mg kg-1 diet, respectively, and remained nearly constant thereafter. These results suggested that MI could inhibit oxygen radical generation, increase enzymatic antioxidant capacity and prevent oxidative damage of carp. Dietary MI requirements for ASA and AHR activities of juvenile Jian carp were 567.94 and 517.22 mg MI kg-1 diet respectively.

The detailed meiotic studies on selected haploid maize (n = x = 10) were conducted. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a high frequency of meiotic abnormality occurred in both meiosis I and meiosis II. During the prophase I, univalents were common configurations, and there were bivalents or trivalents in some pollen mother cells, however, a few cells containing five bivalents were also observed. After prophase I, chromosomes did not congregate in a single metaphase plate but they were scattered in the cytoplasm. At anaphase I, the chromosome distribution was highly irregular with almost all possible combinations. In some cells, chromosomes were grouped into the three or four masses and several spindles appeared. At the tetrad stage of meiosis 11, cytokinesis splitting abnormality occurred, and a variety of diad, triad, tetrad, pentad, hexad, as well as decury microspores were easily observed. As a consequence of abnormalities of the two meiotic stages, various microspores and the pollen grains with different size were formed, and its pollen grains were almost completely sterile.

The genomic constitution of Leymus was assigned as NsXm, where Ns was presumed to be originated from Psathyrostachys, while Xm represented a genome of unknown origin. In addition, little is known about the evolutionary history of Leymus. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationship, genome donor, and evolutionary history of Leymus based on a single-copy nuclear Acc1 gene. Results: Two homoeologues of the Acc1 gene were isolated from nearly all the sampled Leymus species using allele-specific primer and were analyzed with those from 35 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) Leymus is closely related to Psathyrostachys, Agropyron, and Eremopyrum; (2) Psathyrostachys juncea is an ancestral Ns-genome donor of Leymus species; (3) the Xm genome in Leymus may be originated from an ancestral lineage of Agropyron and Eremopyrum triticeum; (4) the Acc1 sequences of Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are evolutionarily distinct; (5) North America Leymus species might originate from colonization via the Bering land bridge; (6) Leymus originated about 11-12MYA in Eurasia, and adaptive radiation might have occurred in Leymus during the period of 3.7-4.3 MYA and 1.7-2.1 MYA. Conclusion: Leymus species have allopolyploid origin. It is hypothesized that the adaptive radiation of Leymus species might have been triggered by the recent upliftings of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and subsequent climatic oscillations. Adaptive radiation may have promoted the rapid speciation, as well as the fixation of unique morphological characters in Leymus. Our results shed new light on our understanding of the origin of Xm genome, the polyploidization events and evolutionary history of Leymus that could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Leymus species.

Various approaches to compute TI by using different algorithms have been developed in previous literature. However, flat areas and pits in DEMs of real watershed sometimes impose an arbitrary and spatially constant drainage density which may cause conventional retrieval methods to be very computer-intensive, especially for regional or global climate simulations where rugged mountainous areas are mixed with flat terrains in the DEM. In this paper, we propose a new approach to overcome this shortcoming by introducing a quantile classification to sort the DEM into eight categories at first and then using a fast and simple algorithm to process the flat areas, fill Lip pits in the DEM, and make it undulating. Thereafter, the algorithm can be directly applied to assigning flow directions of each cell of the processed DEM rather than taking the complicated approach of Jenson and Domingue. This approach dramatically promotes the computing efficiency with a much easier and faster processing. In addition, the effects of different TI computing approaches on the TOPMODEL-concept-based hydrological simulations are investigated based on experimental simulation over a small-scale watershed gauged by the Youshuijie hydrological station and a large-scale watershed controlled by the Hanzhong hydrological station, respectively. The results show that the new approach is 13 times faster than the conventional one in TI retrieving, and no evident differences are found in rainfall-runoff simulations when using different algorithms in TI computations. These suggest that the proposed new approach for TI computation can be taken as an alternative and used in the TOPMODEL-concept-based hydrological simulations owning to its simplicity and high efficiency, especially for relevant regional and global studies.

Semi-purified diets with seven levels (4.0, 15.5, 25.6, 36.1, 45.9, 56.1 and 65.9 mg PA kg(-1)) of supplemental calcium d-pantothenate were fed to Jian carp (13.0 +/- 0.0 g). PA improved specific growth rate (SGR), protein productive value (PPV), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and lipid production value (LPV) (P < 0.05). Fish fed the control diet had significantly lower feed efficiency (FE) than that in any other group (P < 0.05). Body protein content increased with increasing PA levels (P < 0.05), but moisture, lipid and ash of fish carcasses were negatively related to the graded PA levels (P < 0.05). Intestine protein content (IPC), hepatopancreas protein content (HPC) and activity of alpha-amylase, lipase, trypsin, Na+,K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) were all positively affected by the dietary PA levels (P < 0.05), while intestine index (ISI) and hepatopancreas index (HSI) decreased with the increment of supplemental levels of PA (P < 0.05). These results suggested that PA could enhance fish growth and intestinal enzyme activities. The dietary PA requirement of juvenile Jian carp, Cyprinus carpio var. Jian (13.0-73.0 g), for optimal growth estimated by the broken-line analysis was 23.0 mg PA kg(-1) diet.

Eight amino acid test diets (350 g kg(-1) crude protein, CP), using fish meal, soybean-condensed protein and gelatin as intact protein sources supplemented with crystalline amino acids, were formulated to contain graded levels of methionine (0.6-22.0%) at a constant dietary cystine level of 3 g kg(-1). Each diet was randomly assigned to three aquaria. Growth performance and feed utilization were significantly influenced by the dietary methionine levels (P < 0.05). Maximum weight gain, feed intake occurred at 12 g kg(-1) dietary methionine (P < 0.05). Methionine supplementation improved hepatopancreas and intestine weight, hepatosomatic and intestine index, intestinal gamma-glutamyltransferase and creatine kinase activity, Lactobacillus count, Bacillus count, lysozyme activities, lectin potency, sim-immunoglobulin M content, addiment C3,C4 contents and serum total iron-binding capacity and declined Escherichia coli and Aeromonas counts. Quadratic regression analysis of weight gain against dietary methionine levels indicated that the optimal dietary methionine requirement for maximum growth of juvenile Jian carp is 12 g kg(-1) of the dry diet in the presence of 3 g kg(-1) cystine.

The purpose of this 42-day study was to investigate the effects of excess dietary sodium selenite on immune function by determining morphological changes and apoptosis of bursa of Fabricius. Three hundred 1-day-old Avian broilers were fed on a basic diet (0.2 ppm selenium) or the same diet amended to contain 1, 5, 10, and 15 ppm selenium supplied as sodium selenite (n = 60/group). Relative weight of bursa was significantly decreased in the 1, 5, 10, and 15 ppm groups at 28 days of age, when compared with that of 0.2 ppm group. Pathological lesions were progressed with the dietary Se level increased. The gross lesions of bursa involved obvious atrophy with decreased volume and pale color. Histopathologically, decreased number of lymphocytes and loosely packed lymphocytes appeared in the medulla and cortex in the follicles. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria injury and increased apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were observed. In comparison to that of control group, excess Se (5, 10, and 15 ppm) intake increased the percentage of Annexin V positive cells, as measured by flow cytometry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick end-labeling assay showed that there were increased frequencies of apoptotic cells in 10 and 15 ppm selenium groups. These data suggest that Se supplementation with sodium selenite should be carefully evaluated as excess selenium (more than 5 ppm) intake could cause profound immunologic inhibition.

Results show that the basic chromosome number in the genus Salvia is x=8. The chromosome configurations in S. miltiorrhiza (from Sichuan, Shandong, Zhejiang and Shanxi), S. miltiorrhiza f. alba, S. cynica, S. flava, S. yunnanensis and S. cavaleriei var. simplicifolia are formulated uniformly as 8II. In S. miltiorrhiza from Henan, the typical chromosome configuration observed at metaphase is 0.13 I + 7.80 II + 0.07 IV, whereas that in S. przewalskii is 0.33 I + 15.50 II + 0.16 IV and in S. brevilabra is 0.53 I + 15.73 II. Configurations of the bivalents in all materials investigated are different. According to the chromosomes pairing in metaphase I, except that S. przewalskii and S. brevilabra are tetraploids, the others are diplonts. Chromosomes bridges or lagging chromosomes are appeared at anaphase II in S. miltiorrhiza from Henan, S. przewalskii and S. brevilabra. The abnormal behaviors of the chromosomes in meiosis observed may have effects on the development of pollen grains in these taxa.

Effect of feeding allowance level on embryonic survival, IGF-1, insulin, GH, leptin and progesterone secretion in early pregnancy gilts	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION			English	Article						feeding allowance level; gilts; embryonic survival; IGF-I; leptin; progesterone; GH	GROWTH FACTOR-I; PLACENTAL-LACTOGEN; OOCYTE MATURATION; UTERINE CAPACITY; OVINE UTERUS; FOOD-INTAKE; EWES; GESTATION; HORMONE; PROTEIN	P>The present experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of feeding allowance level on embryonic survival, uterine development and reproductive hormone secretion in early gestation gilts. A total of 54 F1 crosses of Landrace x Large white gilts were randomly allocated to three treatment groups of high (H, 2 x maintenance), medium (M, 1.2 x maintenance) and low (L, 0.6 x maintenance) feeding level after mating. Blood samples and uterine flushings were collected on day 12, 25 and 35 of pregnancy, and embryonic survival rate was estimated. Concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF)-1, insulin, growth harmone (GH), leptin and progesterone in serum and uterine flushings were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Embryonic survival was affected by dietary treatment; total number of viable embryos and embryo survival of group M were higher than other groups in the early pregnancy (p < 0.05). Greater foetal weight in M gilts was achieved when gestation advanced to day 35 (p < 0.05), though there was no difference on day 25 of pregnancy among treatments. No appreciable differences were observed in the crown-rump length on day 25 and 35 of pregnancy among groups. Greater weight of uterus and products of conception were identified in M gilts compared with group H and L (p = 0.024 and p = 0.005, respectively) on day 25 of pregnancy. The hormone level was greatly affected by feeding allowance level. In serum, concentrations of IGF-1, leptin and insulin tended to be greater in H than in M and L during the early gestation, while concentrations of GH were greater in M and progesterone were the lowest in H. At the same time, feed allowance level affected the concentration of IGF-1, insulin, GH, leptin and progesterone in uterine flushings. These data demonstrated that feed allowance level after mating has important consequence on embryo survival, embryo development and uterine development, possibly mediated by nutrition level inducing changes in concentrations of reproductive hormones and/or intermediary metabolites in early pregnancy.

However, little is known about the efficient method used to study the purification of AHV-1 and the negative staining morphology of the purified virus particles. This lack of knowledge is one of the important factors that have affected the progress of research studies on AHV-1 molecular virology to such an extent that they are lagging far behind those on other members of the same family Herpesviridae. Therefore, an efficient method for purifying AHV-1 from cell-culture medium has been developed. Abundant AHV-1 particles, whose morphological features match those of herpesvirus, were obtained by using the following procedures: (1) conventional differential centrifugation for removal of debris after cell disruption, (2) tangential-flow ultrafiltration coupled with sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation for isolation of the virus, and (3) conventional differential ultracentrifugation for virus concentration. The purified AHV-1 particles were subjected to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infectivity and recovery tests, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotting assay, and agar gel diffusion test (AGDT). The results of examinations revealed that purified AHV-1 particles were free of visible contamination or degradation. The purified AHV-1 particles were biologically active and were successful in initiating infection upon inoculation into susceptible duck embryo fibroblast. The procedures are reliable technically and feasible for purification of large volumes of viruses. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ducks and rabbits were immunized, respectively, with expressed UL24 recombinant protein. The IgG antibodies against UL24 from ducks and rabbits were purified and used as the capture antibodies. The specificity of the optimized AC-ELISA was evaluated by use of DEV, duck hepatitis virus (DHV), duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), gosling plague virus (GPV), Riemerella anatipestifer (R.A.), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pasteurella multocida (P.M.) and Salmonella Enteritidis (S.E.). Only DEV specimens yielded a specific and strong signal. The limit of the sensitivity of this method for the detection of DEV was 46 ng/100 mu l. Compared with PCR and virus isolation, the rate of agreement for the detection of experimentally infected sera was 100%. A comparative test used on clinical specimens between the neutralization test and the AC-ELISA showed that the proportions of true positives and true negatives by the AC-ELISA were 0.90 and 0.67 respectively. These results indicated that the AC-ELISA approach is rapid, sensitive, and reliable for specific detection of DEV antigen. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The xyn2 and hybrid genes were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris using the strong methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and the secretion signal sequence from S. cerevisiae (alpha-factor). The transformants expressed the hybrid gene produced clearly increased both the thermostability and substrate-binding capacity compared to the corresponding strains expressed the native Xyn2 gene. The activity of the hybrid enzyme was highest at 65 degrees C that was 10 degrees C higher than the native Xyn2. The hybrid enzyme was stable at 60 degrees C and retained more than 85% of its activity after 30-min incubation at this temperature. The hybrid enzyme was highly specific toward xylan and analysis of the products from birchwood xylan degradation confirmed that the enzyme was an endo-xylanase with xylobiose and xylotriose as the main degradation products. These attributes should make it an attractive applicant for various applications. Our results also suggested that the N-terminal domain A2 is responsible for both the thermostability and substrate-binding capacity of T. maritima XynA.

Characterization of three wheat cultivars possessing new 1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocations	PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						Triticum aestivum; Secale cereale; new 1BL; 1RS translocation; centromere; disease resistance; genetic variation	IDENTIFICATION; L.	The wheat-rye 1BL.1RS translocation chromosomes have been used widely around the world in commercial wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production because of the presence of several disease resistance genes and a yield enhancement factor on the rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome. However, the recent reports of the loss of complete effectiveness of the disease resistance genes on the most commonly used 1BL.1RS chromosome have highlighted the need to seek and deploy additional sources of disease resistance genes. Three new sibling wheat cultivars, 'CN12', 'CN17' and 'CN18', were developed carrying 1RS arms derived from the rye inbred line L155. Genomic in situ hybridization and C-banding analysis revealed that all the three cultivars contained the rye chromosome 1RS arm fused to the wheat 1BL wheat chromosome arm. The three cultivars displayed high yields and high resistance to local powdery mildew and stripe rust pathotypes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated the different structure of 1BL.1RS chromosome between 'CN18' and the other two cultivars. The present study provides a new 1RS resource for wheat improvement.	[Tang, Z. X.; Fu, S. L.; Ren, Z. L.; Zhang, H. Q.; Yan, B.

The development of specific mucosal immune system against duck enteritis virus (DEV) infection for ducks has been hindered by a lack of knowledge concerning the purification of immunoglobulin A (IgA) of duck. In the present work, the method for purification of duck immunoglobulin A was developed. and the induction of intestinal mucosal immune responses against DEV was studied by orally infected ducklings with virulent DEV. The results showed that a continuous increased DEV DNA levels were observed in blood and various organs examined of orally infected ducklings throughout the infection, which was accompanied by the development of infection in ducklings from mild progressed to severe pathological lesions. Furthermore, a marked increased level of DEV-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in bile, serum and the intestinal tract, as well as the density of IgA(+) cells in intestine were detected between 1 and 12 days p.i., followed by a drastic reduction of the antibody levels and the density of IgA(+) cells at 15 days p.i. The results indicate that the DVE infection can stimulate both IgA-dominated antibody immune responses in the intestinal tract, and IgG-dominated antibody systemic immunity in the serum of ducklings orally inoculated with virulent DEV. The severe lesions of the villus epithelial cells and the lymphoid organs can suppress the intestinal mucosal immune responses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The parents had non-lesion normal phenotypes. Shading treatment and histochemical analyses showed that the lesions were caused by light-dependent cell death and were not associated with pathogens. Studies over two cropping seasons showed that some lines with more highly expressed lesion-mimic phenotypes exhibited significantly lower grain yields than those with the normal phenotype, but there were no significant effects in the lines with weakly expressed lesion-mimic phenotypes. Among yield traits, one-thousand grain weight was the most affected by lesion-mimic phenotypes. Genetic analysis indicated that this was a novel type of lesion mimic, which was caused by interaction of recessive genes derived from each parent. The lm1 (lesion mimic 1) locus from Zaosui 30 was flanked by microsatellite markers Xwmc674 and Xbarc133/Xbarc147 on chromosome 3BS, at genetic distances of 1.2 and 3.8 cM, respectively, whereas lm2 from Yanzhan 1 was mapped between microsatellite markers Xgwm513 and Xksum154 on chromosome 4BL, at genetic distances of 1.5 and 3 cM, respectively. The linked microsatellite makers identified in this study might be useful for evaluating whether potential parents with normal phenotype are carriers of lesion-mimic alleles.

The bound state energy spectra and the unnormalized radial wave functions have been approximately obtained by using the supersymmetric shape invariance approach and the function analysis method. The numerical experiments show that our approximate analytical results are in better agreement with those obtained by using numerical integration approach for small values of the screening parameter delta than the other analytical results obtained by using the conventional approximation to the centrifugal term.

These sequences contained 887 bp, among which 92 SNPs including 29 indel loci were detected, giving an average SNP frequency of one SNP per 9.64 bases. According to these sequences, 5 SNP markers were successfully designed, which were used to mine the variations of purothionin genes of 102 einkorn wheat accessions. Based on the 5 detected SNP loci, 102 einkorn wheat accessions could be divided into 21 haplotypes, among which 11 haplotypes contained a single sample. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the purothionin genes from einkorn wheats were more closely related to those from D genome than B genome. Seven out of the 43 gene sequences were assumed to be pseudogenes by the definition of containing in-frame stop codons and small insertions/deletions leading to frameshift. In the remaining 36 amino acid sequences, the 8 Cys and Tyr-13 loci in the mature thionin domain which played important roles in the biological activities were all conserved, whereas there were some varieties occurred in some other important amino acid residues such as Lys and Arg.

Four solvents were used to prepare crude extracts, petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol, among which ethanol was the most effective one. The results suggested that ethanol extracts of B. sessilicatpa had eminent acaricidal and ovicidal activities. Concentrated extracts were prepared using petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, or distilled water as solvent. Mite mortality rates in the concentrated extracts by petroleum ether, chloroform, or distilled water were significantly lower than those by ethyl acetate. The LC(50) values of eggs and female mites were 0.7639 and 1.1033 mg mL(-1), respectively. After liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography, the concentrated extracts were separated into 14 groups of fractions and further tests for their acaricidal and ovicidal activities were conducted. Fraction 2 was found to possess higher acaricidal and ovicidal activities. The mortality of eggs and adult mites were 85.83 and 63.07%, respectively. Moreover, fraction 2 showed moderate oviposition inhibition effect (0.8795) against P. citri when the used dose was higher than 2.5 mg mL(-1).

Following AHV-1 infection, DEF showed morphological changes such as cell rounding, improved refractivity and detachment from the culture surface. However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately known. Related studies were performed and the results showed that syncytium formation could be observed as the other type of CPE in AHV-1 infection. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of infected DEF were each used to visualize the shape and distribution of chromatin within nuclei and nuclear fragmentation was observed. Chromatin condensation and margination, as well as formation of apoptotic bodies were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA ladder formation was detected in AHV-1 infected cells and apoptosis of the infected DEF was also detected by flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. Therefore, it was suggested that AHV-1 virulent strain can induce syncytium and apoptosis in DEF. Syncytium formation and apoptosis observed in this study may contribute to the elucidation of AHV-1 pathogenesis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo. Results: The detection limit of the assay was 2.8 x 10(1) standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation. Conclusion: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and reproducibility of the GPV fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with a high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of GPV etiology-related applications.

The fabricated CdTe-GSH QDs have an ultra small hydrodynamic diameter (3 similar to 4 nm) and possess high quantum yields (47.3%). In vitro hemolysis testing showed that the hemolysis rates (HR) of CdTe/ZnS-MA and CdTe-GSH were less than 5% (concentration being 0.05 mmol/L), which were lower than CdTe-MA and CdTe/CdS-MA QDs, meeting the requirements for biomedical materials. The toxicity of QD in vivo was tested by injected QD in mice through tail vein. Fluorescence microscopy showed that a high dosage (0.4 mmol/10 g) of CdTe-GSH and CdTe/ZnS-MA QD was distributed mainly in the heart, liver, spleen and kidney tissues and caused varying degrees of tissue lesions.

Treatments consisted of the following: i) a corn-soybean meal basal diet containing 36.75 mg/kg total Zn, ii) basal diet+60 mg/kg added Zn as ZnSO(4). iii) basal diet+120 mg/kg added Zn as ZnSO(4). Each diet was fed to six pens of four pigs per pen (Exp. 1) or six pens of three pigs per pen (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, the dietary zinc level had no effect on average daily growth (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI). or feed conversion ratio (FCR). Concentrations of tissue and serum zinc were not affected. Peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation (PBLP) was not affected by dietary treatments. Supplementation of 120 mg/kg Zn decreased (p<0.05) the antibody response to bovine serum albumin (BSA) on d 7 compared with pigs fed the basal diet, but not on d 14. In Exp. 2, LPS challenge had no effect on ADG, ADFI and FCR in the entire trial (from d 0 to 21). LPS challenge significantly decreased ADG and ADFI (p<0.01) from d 7 to 14, but FCR was not affected. LPS challenge increased PBLP (p<0.05) and serum concentration of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (p<0.01), whereas the antibody response to BSA and serum concentration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were not affected. Supplementation of Zn did not affect ADFI and FCR from d 7 to 14. but there was a trend for ADG to be enhanced with Zn supplementation (p<0.10). Supplementation of Zn tended to increase PBLP (p<0.10). Dietary treatment had no effect on the antibody response to BSA or concentrations of serum IL-1 and IL-2. Results indicate that the level of Zn recommended by NRC (1998) for weanling pigs was sufficient for optimal growth performance and immune responses. Zn requirements may be higher for pigs experiencing an acute phase response than for healthy pigs.

Here, an open reading frame of a US3-like gene of DEV was identified from a DEV genomic library. Its existence was confirmed by cloning from DEV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) and DNA sequencing. The US3-like gene was then subcloned into a prokaryotic protein expression vector and expressed as a six-histidine-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified and inoculated into rabbits for antiserum production. A primary antibody specific to the gene was successfully generated and used to detect the US3-like protein in DEV-infected duck cells. In vivo expression of the US3-like protein in DEV-infected DEFs was demonstrated with indirect immunofluorescence assay and regular fluorescence microscopy, whereas uninfected DEFs did not show any specific fluorescent staining. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscopy were used to study the time course and subcellular localization of the protein expression. The protein was found to be expressed as early as 2 hr postinfection, and its expression was increased by time at 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr postinfection. The protein was found to be localized mostly around the perinuclear area and in the cytosol, and also in the nucleus at later time points. In addition, a US3 protein phylogenetic tree was constructed and showed that the evolutionary relationship of DEV is close to the genus Mardivirus. In short, the DEV US3-like gene and its in vivo protein expression were found for the first time, and DEV classification and the gene's functions were suggested.

The aim of this study is to investigate the genomic distribution of Sabrina-like LTR pDbH12, which was first isolated from Dasypyrum breviaristatum (V(b) genome), on Triticeae species in relation to the genomic evolution and chromosome identification. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) analysis showed that pDbH12 is present on Dasypyrum ( V genome) and Hordeum ( H genome) species with the hybridized signals covering the entire chromosomes. However, clone pDbH12 did not hybridize to the genomes of Secale, Triticum, Lophopyrum, Pseduoroengeria, Aegilops, Agropyron desertorum and Elymus. Thinopyrum intermedium displayed fourteen chromosomes that hybridized with pDbH12. Sequential FISH identified these chromosomes as belonging to the J(s) genome. Results from sequence characterized amplified region ( SCAR) marker and dot blot both support the FISH results, and the integrative results suggest that amplification of Sabrina-like LTR retrotransposons is an important factor which involved in the speciation process. Clone pDbH12 could serve as a cytogenetic marker for tracing chromatin from V or V(b), H and J(s) genomes in wheat-alien introgression lines.	[Liu, C.; Yang, Z. J.; Jia, J. Q.; Li, G. R.; Zhou, J.

However, following the breakdown of disease resistance genes in 1RS, its importance for wheat improvement decreased. We have developed a new 1BL.1RS line, R14, by means of crossing rye inbred line L155, selected from Petkus rye to several wheat cultivars. One new gene each, for stripe rust and powdery mildew resistance, located on 1RS of the line R14, are tentatively named YrCn17 and PmCn17. YrCn17 and PmCn17 confer resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes that are virulent on Yr9, and Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici pathotypes virulent on Pm8. These two new resistances, YrCn17 and PmCn17, are now available for wheat improvement programs. The present study indicates that rye cultivars may carry yet untapped variations as potential sources of resistance.

In the present paper, research advances on the utilization of synthetic hexaploid wheat for wheat genetic improvement in China are reviewed. Over 200 synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) accessions from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) were introduced into China since 1995. Four cultivars derived from these, Chuanmai 38, Chuanmai 42, Chuanmai 43 and Chuanmai 47, have been released in China. Of these, Chuanmai 42, with large kernels and resistance to stripe rust, had the highest average yield (> 6 t/ha) among all cultivars over two years in Sichuan provincial yield trials, outyielding the commercial check cultivar Chuanmai 107 by 22.7%. Meanwhile, by either artificial chromosome doubling via colchicine treatment or spontaneous chromosome doubling via a union of unreduced gametes (2n) from T turgidum-Ae. tauschii hybrids, new SHW lines were produced in China. Mitotic-like meiosis might be the cytological mechanism of spontaneous chromosome doubling. SHW lines with genes for spontaneous chromosome doubling may be useful for producing new SHW-alien amphidiploids and double haploid in wheat genetic improvement.

Until now, there has been a lack of direct experimental evidence for microsatellite evolution following allopolyploidization. In the present study, F(1) hybrids and newly synthesized allopolyploids were derived from Triticum aestivum Chinese Spring x Secale cereale Jinzhou-heimai. One hundred and sixty-three wheat simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to investigate the variation of wheat microsatellites after allopolyploidization and variation of the PCR products of 29 of the SSR markers was observed. Of these 29 SSR markers, 15 were unable to produce products from amphiploids. The other 14 SSR markers did produce products from parental wheat, F(1) hybrids and amphiploids. However, the length of the products amplified from amphiploids was different from the length of the products amplified from parental wheat and F(1) hybrids. Sequencing indicated that the length variation of the 14 microsatellites stemmed mainly from variation in the number of repeat units. The alteration of repeat units occurred in both perfect and compound repeats. In some compound SSR loci, one motif was observed to expand whereas another to contract. Almost all the microsatellite evolution observed in this study could be explained by the slipped-strand mispairing model. The results of this study seem to indicate that stress caused by allopolyploidization might be one of the factors that induce microsatellite evolution. In addition, the findings of present study provided an instance of how simple sequence repeats evolved after allopolyploidization.

A rice mutant with a late heading date and no photoperiodic sensitivity in long or short day conditions was obtained from rice T-DNA insertion mutants in Zhonghua11 (ZH11). Through isolation and analysis of the flanking sequence of the T-NDA insertion site, the target sequence of insertion was obtained and found to locate in AP003296, the sequence accession number of rice chromosome 1 of RGP (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp). The putative amino acid sequences of this target gene are homologous to the Arabidopsis protein ELF3 encoded by an early flowering gene. The rice target gene orthologous to Arabidopsis ELF3 is named OsEF3; this encodes a putative nematode responsive protein-like protein. OsEF3 has pleiotropic effects in rice that differ from the effects of Arabidopsis ELF3, which only affects biological rhythms. OsEF3 regulates heading date by influencing the BVG stage and does not affect photoperiodic sensitivity, which suggests that the OsEF3 gene may be involved in an autonomous pathway in rice. OsEF3 may affect root development and kilo-grain weight by delaying cell division or cell elongation.	[Fu, C.; Yang, X.

We inoculated the ducklings with Salmonella Enteritidis via the nasal route and performed a real-time PCR assay for determining the concentration of Salmonella Enteritidis DNA and studied the histopathology of various tissues postinoculation. The results show that the Salmonella Enteritidis load in systemic organs has a close correlation with the progression of disease. Further, rapid dissemination and active replication of Salmonella Enteritidis in multiple systemic organs accelerated the progression of disease.	[Deng, S. X.; Cheng, A. C.; Wang, M.

In the present study, suppression subtractive hybridization and reverse dot-blot were employed to identify such genes, using the ovary as a model. Furthermore, expression profiling of estrogen receptor 1, estrogen receptor 2, follicle stimulating hormone receptor, prolactin receptor, ferritin H chain, and ovary differentially expressed unknown gene 08 in ovaries from geese was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA from the ovaries of laying and prelaying Zi geese was pooled and the mRNA was isolated. The cDNA that was reverse-transcribed from the ovarian mRNA of the prelaying geese was subtracted from the cDNA isolated from the laying geese. Four hundred sixty-five clones containing putative differentially expressed gene fragments were further identified by reverse dot-blot. Ninety-seven clones were subjected to sequencing and further analysis. Sequence analysis showed that the expression of 18 known (including a mitochondrial gene) and 8 unknown gene fragments was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. Seventeen of the known genes encode proteins that belong to groups involved with binding, catalytic activity, enzyme regulatory activity, signal transducer activity, structural molecule, and transporter activity. The results of the quantitative real-time PCR showed that the expression of estrogen receptor 1, estrogen receptor 2, follicle stimulating hormone receptor, prolactin receptor, ferritin H chain, and ovary differentially expressed unknown gene 08 was higher in the ovaries of the laying geese than in those of the prelaying geese (P < 0.05). These differentially expressed genes may be relevant to the progression of prelaying geese to the egg-laying stage. Further study is required to elucidate the molecular mechanism that controls egg-laying in geese, to improve the productivity of laying geese.	[Guo, J. R.; Yang, H. M.; Zhou, R. J.; Li, S.

The molecular weight of the recombinant protein was estimated by SIDS-PAGE to be 24 kDa. The expressed protein was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and enzyme activity assay verified the protein as a xylanase. Like with the T. reesei Xyn2, the optimal activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was at 50 degrees C. However, the recombinant xylanase had an improved thermostability and more than 70% of its activity remained after 30 min incubation at 60 degrees C. In addition, the recombinant xylanase was active over the range of pH 3.5-7.5 with maximum activity at pH 5.0. The enzyme was highly specific towards xylans but exhibited very low activities towards cellulosic substrates. Using Birchwood xylan, the determined apparent K-m and k(cat) values were 0.11 mg/ml and 106 s(-1), respectively. These properties should make the enzyme an attractive candidate for various industrial applications. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The results of sequencing and homologous comparison indicated that the cloned gene was from SCMV strain MDB, with 920 bp in length, including an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 219 amino acids and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). This gene was constructed into the expression vector p35SCPrBar in the antisense orientation, under the control of CaMV35S promoter, the plasmid p35SCPrBar was introduced into embryogenic calli induced from the immature embryos of maize inbred line 18-599(red) that is highly susceptible to SCMV-MDB via particle bombardment, the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting hybridization demonstrated that the SCMV CP gene had been integrated into maize genome.

J	Luo, CW; Wang, G; Wang, CC; Wei, JJ				Luo, Chuanwen; Wang, Gang; Wang, Chuncheng; Wei, Junjie			A new interpretation of chaos	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article							SYSTEM	The concepts of uniform index and expectation uniform index are two mathematical descriptions of the uniformity and the mean uniformity of a finite set in a polyhedron. The concepts of instantaneous chaometry (ICM) and k step chaometry (k SCM) are introduced in order to apply the method in statistics for studying the nonlinear difference equations. It is found that k step chaometry is an indirect estimation of the expectation uniform index. The simulation illustrate that the expectation uniform index for the Lorenz System is increasing linearly, but increasing nonlinearly for the Chen's System with parameter b. In other words, the orbits for each system become more and more uniform with parameter b increasing. Finally, a conjecture is also brought forward, which implies that chaos can be interpreted by its orbit's mean uniformity described by the expectation uniform index and indirectly estimated by k SCM. The k SCM of the heart rate showes the feeble and old process of the heart. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Anti-NGVEV polyclonal serum was obtained from the rabbits immunized with purified NGVEV antigen, which was extracted by caprylic-ammonium sulphate method and purified through High-Q columns anion exchange chromatography. Three-day-old NGVEV-free goslings were orally inoculated with NGVEV-CN strain suspension as infection group and phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) as control group, respectively. The tissues were collected at sequential time points between 0.5 and 720 h post inoculation (PI), and prepared for IHC staining and ultra-structural observation. The positive immunoreactivity could be readily detected in the lymphoid and gastrointestinal organs of infected goslings as early as 48 h PI, in the liver, kidney, pancreas and myocardium from 72 h, and in the cerebrum and cerebellum from 96 h, while it was hardly detected in the respiratory organs at any time. The positive staining reaction could be detected in NGVEV-infected goslings until 600 h PI, and no positive staining cell could be observed in the controls. The highest levels of viral antigen were found in the bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus, proventriculus, gizzard and intestine tract, moreover, the liver, kidney, spleen, myocardium and pancreas were intensively and widely stained. The target cells had a ubiquitous distribution, especially included the epithelial cells, endothelial cells, superficial and crypt mucosal cells, glandular cells, fibrocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, which served as the principal sites for antigen localization. The ultra-structural observation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) further indicated that NGVEV particles could be widely detected in the lymphoid and digestive organs of infected goslings from 72 h PI onwards. This work may be useful not only for offering a possibility of routine diagnosis of NGVE, but also for better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A 2.2 kb DNA fragment, encoding for N-terminal domain glycoprotein S of TGEV, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX-S was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, the expression and translation of the pVAX-S delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-S) was detected in vitro and in vivo respectively. BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-S) at different dosages, the bacterium was safe to mice at dosage of 2 x 10(9) CFU and eventually eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization. Mice immunized with different dosages of SL7207 (pVAX-S) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses as measured by indirect ELISA assay. Moreover, the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine was highly dependent on the dosage of the attenuated bacteria used for oral administration, 10(9) CFU dosage group showed higher antibody response than 10(8) CFU and 10(7) CFU dosages groups during week 4-8 post-immunization. The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV DNA vaccine. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Jian) with in average initial weight of 10.71 +/- 0.05 g were fed semi-purified diets containing seven graded levels of pyridoxine (0.20, 1.71, 3.23 4.96, 6.31, 8.58 and 12.39 mg pyridoxine kg(-1) diet). Results indicated that with increasing dietary pyridoxine levels Lip to 4.96 mg kg(-1) diet, percent weight gain (PWG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were improved, and no differences were found with further increase of pyridoxine levels. Feed intake also followed the similar pattern to that observed with PWG and SGR when dietary pyridoxine levels were <= 6.32 mg kg(-1) diet. But feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio were not affected by pyridoxine levels. Crude protein of carcass, productive protein value and plasma ammonia concentration were improved with increasing dietary pyridoxine levels Lip to 4.96 mg kg(-1) diet. Amylase activities in the intestine were improved with increasing dietary pyridoxine levels Lip to 4.96 mg kg(-1) diet, but protease and lipase activities in the intestine were not affected by pyridoxine levels. Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities in proximal intestine, mid intestine (M1) and distal intestine (DI) were lowest when fed the diet containing 1.71 mg pyridoxine kg(-1) diet. The alkaline phosphatase activities in MI and DI followed the same pattern. The dietary pyridoxine requirement of juvenile Jian carp based on PWG estimated by broken line model was 6.07 mg pyridoxine kg(-1) diet.

Fish enterocytes were cultured with different medium containing 0, 2.5. 3.5, 4.5. 6.0 7.0 mu g mL(-1) vitamin E for 96 h. The results showed that cells proliferation and differentiation were not significantly enhanced, but anti-superoxide anion activity, anti-hydroxy radical activity, reduced glutathione concentration. the ratio between reduced and total glutathione ill the cells were significantly enhanced, and the malondialdehyde concentration in the Culture medium was significantly depressed with the vitamin E treatment. In the whole, the present results firstly indicated that glutamine could promote fish enterocytes growth, but vitamin E Could not. Vitamin E could promote fish enterocytes antioxidant capacity and cellular structural integrity. These data would be instructive for glutamine and vitamin E supplement in aquaculture diets.

These cells were primary cultured in 4 pieces of 24-well cell culture plate. After having been grown for 48 h in culture media with hGLP-2, the ileal enterocyte cells of 28-d-old weaned piglets exhibited the typical characteristics of simple columnar epithelium. Compared with the control groups, the quantities of treated cells significantly increased (p<0.05) and their corresponding absorption values in 540 nm (MTT OD) also significantly increased (p<0.01). Likewise, lactic acid concentration, total protein content and protein retention significantly increased (p<0.05). Na(+), K(+)-ATP enzyme activity was more active (p<0.05). although the activity of alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase in culture media significantly decreased (p<0.01). To summarize, the results indicated that GLP-2 in vitro is capable of promoting the proliferation of intestinal enterocyte cells of 28-d weaned piglets, restraining their apoptosis and maintaining the integrity of their morphology.

Chi-square results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in genotype frequency among breeds in Fragment 1 and extremely significant differences (P < 0.01) in Fragments 2-4. We found a significant association between Fragment 2 genotype and muscle fiber number, Arg and Thr (P < 0.05); between Fragment 3 genotype and living weight, carcass weight, breast muscle weight, abdominal fat weight, and abdominal fat percentage (P < 0.05); between Fragment 4 genotype and Thr, Phe, and inosinic acid (P < 0.05). It was concluded that H-FABP was the major gene influencing slaughter performance and meat quality or was linked with the major gene in these strains and that the C783T mutation could be used as a candidate molecular genetic marker for breeding selection. The combination M1C2-B2B2-D1D1 is an ideal model for breeding in these strains because it can improve slaughter and meat quality traits.

A tidal river along a near-shore city should be evaluated and regulated from a multidisciplinary point of view, focused especially on ecology, in order to maintain and enhance the ecological structure and function of the river. Firstly, eco-hydrodynamic control can be used, based on simulated modeling of tidal water circulation, to trace the distribution of pollutants and to predict circulation of tidal water. Using findings from this modeling effort, some water control facilities, such as additional channel connection and water gates, can be established. Appropriate operation strategy is to use tidal energy to promote effective water exchange in the water bodies and thereby improve water quality in the tidal river. Secondly, ecological engineering methods should be integrated with hydraulic measures to further improve the environment. Appropriate plant communities for this ecological engineering can be selected. Based on the simulated results of eco-hydrodynamic model, the optimum locations for adding reclaimed land can be determined. These ecological engineering methods are as follows: (1) it is necessary to calculate the ecological water requirements for the tidal river.

In the present study, the responses of root apices of pea (Pisum sativum) to Al exposure in mist culture with border cells stripped off or not were compared. Inhibition of root elongation, induction of callose synthesis, and accumulation of Al were more pronounced in root apices stripped from border cells. Aluminum application led to higher Al concentrations in border cells than in root apices. The same trend was found for Al contents in cell walls of border cells compared to root apices. The analysis of cell-wall pectin indicated that the concentrations of total sugars, uronic acids, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (KDO) were higher in border cells than in root apices, especially when exposed to Al. Together, these results suggest that root border cells enhance the Al resistance of root apices by immobilizing Al in their cell-wall pectin, thus protecting the root apex.

The present study was designed to assess the effect of different calcium concentrations and electric field intensities on the production of tetraploid embryos with higher developmental potential by electrofusion. Two-cell mouse embryos were electrofused in fusion solution containing different concentrations of calcium ion (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 mM). The rates of blastomere fusion, and subsequent cleavage and development of tetraploids to the blastocyst stage were highest when two-cell embryos were electrically stimulated in a fusion medium containing 1.0 mM calcium. Therefore, we tested electric field intensities (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 kV/cm) for electrofusion of two-cell embryos and subsequent development to the blastocyst stage in 1.0 mM calcium. The highest rates of fusion and blastocyst formation were observed when the electric field strength was 0.8 kV/cm. The present results showed that mouse two-cell embryos stimulated with 0.8 kV/cm in a fusion medium containing 1.0 mM calcium had the highest rates of fusion and development to the blastocyst stage.

In this study, the expressions of genes pBD-1, 2 and 3 were determined using real-time PCR for Chinese Tibetan pigs and crossbred pigs of 7 days old in various tissues. The results showed that expressions of pBD-1 and 3 of Tibetan pigs in Most tissues were higher than those of crossbred pigs, but pBD-2 was lower. The higher expression of pBD-1 and 3 might be the direct mechanism by which the Tibetan pigs have higher immunity and disease resistance than crossbred pigs, while the lower expression of pBD-2 may indicate a potential for upregulation upon bacterial infection, but the contribution and mechanism to Tibetan pigs' immunity and disease resistance may differ among pBD-1, 2 and 3 and need a further research.

Dwarf bamboo density had little effect on the dynamics pattern of both N and P concentrations, stocks, resorption efficiency, and resorption proficiency, but strongly affected their absolute values and leaf-level use efficiency. Higher density stands stored more nutrients but had lower concentrations. There was a clear difference in the resorption of limiting nutrient (N) and non-limiting nutrient (P) among the stands. Phosphorus resorption efficiency, N resorption proficiency, and P resorption proficiency increased with increase of stem density, but no significant variation of N resorption efficiency was found among the stands. Moreover, the higher density stands used both N and P more efficiently with higher N productivity and higher P mean residence time, respectively. Higher P productivity was found in the lower density stands, but there was no clear variation in the N mean residence time among stands. These suggested that the higher density stands may have more efficient strategies for utilizing nutrients, especially those which are limiting.

To expand the availability of effective resistance to CYR31 and CYR32, stripe rust resistance was transferred from intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium) to common wheat (Triticum aestivum). The susceptible wheat cultivar CM107 was crossed with amphiploid TAI7047, derived from the wide cross Taiyuan768/Thinopyrum intermedium//76(64). Two wheat lines originating from the cross, YU24 and YU25, were resistant to CYR31 and CYR32. Pedigree analysis showed that the resistance to stripe rust in YU24 and YU25 originated from intermediate wheatgrass. Genetic analyses indicated that the resistance to stripe rust is controlled by a single dominant gene. Allelic tests determined that the resistance gene(s) in YU24 and YU25 are identical. The new gene has temporarily been designated as YrYU25. SSR and RAPD analyses showed that YrYU25 was introduced by cryptic translocation into common wheat.

In total, 49 components could be identified. The results showed that eight chemotypes could be identified as follows: PK(perillaketone), DLP (D-limonene and piperitone), PT (piperitenone), MS (myristicin), AL (apiol), EM (elemicin), DEK (dehydroelsholtzia ketone) and PA (perilla aldehyde). Of them, chemotype DLP, AL and DEK were reported for the first time; DLP and AL were found only in the accessions from Sichuan province, China. In our study, the EOs of P06-1Z and P06-28 were investigated at several stages during growing. Taking into account the variability of the two accessions during the year, the seasonal influence on the main constituents could not change the status of the different chemotypes distinguished or enhance the veracity of the differentiation of eight chemotypes. The results also suggested that it may not always be possible to establish a correlation between the traditional morphological taxonomy and chemotypes.

In this study, we isolated four differentially expressed cDNA fragments from leaves of a drought-tolerant inbred line by suppression subtractive hybridization and reverse Northern hybridization, and validated their differential expression patterns among six inbred lines with different drought tolerance in response to drought stress by quantitative real-time PCR. Sequence similarity analysis indicated that two of four differentially expressed cDNA showed homology to gene DegP encoding trypsin-like serine protease, and gene PGAM-i encoding cofactor-independent phosphoglyceromutase, respectively. Expressions of the genes corresponding to four cDNA fragments was decreased at 6 h after drought stress treatment in most of the six inbred lines, and then returned to the control level with further stress in three of the tolerant inbred lines. The expression of the gene PGAM-i and the genes corresponding to fragments E4 and F4 were increased to a high level in tolerant inbred line 81565. In the two drought-sensitive inbred lines (Dan340 and ES40), the expression of these genes was still down-regulated. The probable mechanisms of these genes in response to drought stress were discussed. These results indicated that the drought-tolerant inbred lines up-regulated the expression of the drought-tolerant candidate genes, in contrast, drought-sensitive inbred lines down-regulated the expression of the genes.

Evaluation of oregano essential oil (Origanum heracleoticum L.) on growth, antioxidant effect and resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus); Origanum heracleoticum L. extract; Growth performance; Antioxidant activity; Disease resistance	ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; PLANT-EXTRACTS; CARVACROL; THYMOL; COMPONENTS	Carvacrol and thymol are the two main active components of oregano essential oil (OEO). In this study, the effect of carvacrol and thymol was evaluated separately, in combination and in their natural composition as natural OEO. A total of five treatments, i.e., negative control group, carvacrol, thymol, a combination of carvacrol and thymol and Orego-Stim (R) (OS, commercial product containing natural OEO From Origanum heracleoticum L) were added to the diets of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) to investigate the effects of the respective treatments on the growth performance and antioxidant activity. After eight weeks of feeding, fishes were infected with Aeromonas hydrophila and mortality was recorded. Results of this study showed that channel catfish fed with natural OEO (OS), containing a combination of carvacrol, thymol and other minor constituents, significantly enhanced growth performance, which was the highest amongst all treatments (P < 0.05). The addition of OS also effectively enhanced hepatosomatic index (HSI), viscerosomatic index (VSI) and condition factor compared to the control diet (P < 0.05) and distinctly promoted the sedimentation of muscle protein. CS also remarkably enhanced the antioxidant activity of channel catfish. Both the combination of carvacrol and thymol and OS reduced fish mortality following A. hydrophila infection, but the lowest mortality was observed in the group fed with OS. It can be concluded that OS, which contains natural OEO extracted from O. heracleoticum L, can act as a growth promoter, increase antioxidant activity, enhance muscle protein sedimentation and also improve disease resistance to pathogens when added to channel catfish feed.

Octadecanoic acid-tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diyl ester was isolated from an active fraction of the chloroform extract and its toxicity against S. scabiei larvae was tested in vitro. A complementary log-log model was used to analyse the toxicity data. Activity was found in the third fraction, with 100% corrected mortality after 4.5 h of exposure at a concentration of 200 mg ml(-1). This fraction was repeatedly re-crystallised in acetone to yield a white amorphous powder, identified as octadecanoic acid-tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diyl ester, with a median lethal concentration (LC(50)) Of 0-1 mg ml(-1) at 24 h post-treatment. The median lethal time (LT(50)) for this compound was 15.3 h at a concentration of 7.5 mg ml(-1). Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While the subcellular localization of many alphaherpesvirus UL51 proteins has been well characterized, little is known about where duck enteritis virus (DEV) UL51 protein (pUL51) is targeted to. Thus, in this study, we investigated the subcellular localization and distribution of DEV pUL51 by computer aided analysis, as well as indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and transmission immunoelectron microscopy (TIEM) approaches in DEV-infected cells. Results: The DEV UL51 gene product was identified as an approximate 34 kDa protein in DEV-infected cells analyzed by western blotting. Computer aided analysis suggested that DEV pUL51 is not targeted to the mitochondrial, extra-cellular or nucleus, but be targeted to the cytoplasmic in host cells, more specifically, palmitoylation of the pUL51 through the N-terminal cysteine at position 9 makes membrane association and Golgi localization possible. Using IIF analysis, we found that DEV pUL51 was first detected in a juxtanuclear region of DEV-infected cells at 9 h postinfection (p.i.), and then was detected widely distributed in the cytoplasm and especially was stronger in the juxtanuclear region from 12 to 60 h p.i. TIEM analysis revealed that DEV pUL51 was mainly associated with cytoplasmic virions and also with some membranous structure near the pUL51-specific immuno-labeling intracellular virion in the cytoplasmic vesicles; moreover, the pUL51 efficiently accumulated in the Golgi apparatus at first, and then was sent to the plasma membrane from the Golgi by some unknown mechanism. Conclusion: In this work, we described the basic characteristics of pUL51 subcellular localization and distribution for the first time. From these results, we concluded that palmitoylation at the N-terminal cysteine, which is conserved in all alphaherpesvirus UL51 homologs, is required for its membrane association and Golgi localization, and the pUL51 mainly localized to the juxtanuclear region of DEV-infected cells, as well seemed to be incorporated into mature virions as a component of the tegument. The research will provide useful clues for DEV pUL51 functional analysis, and will be usefull for further understanding the localization properties of alphaherpesvirus UL51 homologs.

The DEV UL51 gene product was identified using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a 6-His-UL51 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli as a 34-kDa protein. Western blotting and RT-(real time) PCR analysis of DEV-infected cells showed that the protein was produced at the late stage of infection and that its production was highly dependent on viral DNA synthesis, suggesting that the gene should be classified as gamma 2 class. Analysis of extracellular virions revealed that the protein was a component of extracellular mature DEV virions. Indirect immunofluorescence studies localized most of the protein to the juxtanuclear region. These results will provide a basis for further functional analysis of the gene.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether co-administration of a plasmid containing a chicken granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene and a plasmid containing the S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) could enhance the immune response and protection efficacy in chickens against challenge by virulent IBV. Plasmids carrying the S1 gene of IBV (pVAX-S1) and the chicken GM-CSF gene (pVAX-chGM-CSF) were constructed. Seven-day-old chickens were injected intramuscularly with pVAX-S1, pVAX-chGM-CSF, or both and boosted 2 weeks later. Chickens were challenged with virulent IBV at 3 weeks after the booster immunization and observed for 2 weeks. The results showed that co-administration of pVAX-chGM-CSF led to a significant enhancement of humoral and cellular responses over that of vaccination with pVAX-S1 alone. In addition, vaccination with pVAX-chGM-CSF and pVAX-S1 provided 86.7% protection (13/15) against IBV challenge. In contrast, only 73.3% of the chickens were protected against IBV challenge by pVAX-S1 vaccination alone. These results strongly indicate that chGM-CSF can be used as a molecular adjuvant to enhance the protective immunity induced by an IBV-specific DNA vaccine.

The DNA microarray, composed of 18 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons printed on glass slides and arranged in 3 subarrays, was developed. These target DNA included I or multiple fragments of the outer membrane lipoprotein, apx toxin, capsular polysaccharide, and disulfide bound formation protein E (dsbE)-like genes of A. pleuropneumoniae. These arrayed target DNA retained their expceted hybridization properties. The hybridization signal intensities ranged from the least-intense to the most-intense, 4626 to 9789 arbitrary fluorescence units, respectively. Cy3-probes of A. pleuropneumoniae strains labeled with multiplex PCR were hybridized to the DNA microarray. A total of 51 different A. pleuropneumoniae strains representing serotype 1 to 12 reference strains and clinical isolates were detected and typed by the DNA microarray, Twelve reference serotypes produced 11 distinct target DNA hybridization patterns, and hybridization patterns of serotypes 1 (n = 7), 3 (n = 5), and 7 (n = 6) field isolates were identical to hybridization patterns of reference serotypes 1, 3, and 7, respectively. Non-serotyped isolates 4, 6, and 11 (out of 21) from diseased pigs had identical hybridization patterns to reference serotypes 3, 7, and 1, respectively. The results show that the DNA microarray system described in the present study is a valuable tool for identifying and typing reference strains and isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae, and enables relatively rapid identification of non-serotyped isolates.

Histopathologically, in these two high F groups the number of splenic nodules and the lymphocyte population with splenic nodules and periarterial lymphatic sheaths in white pulp were obviously decreased along with the widened splenic sinus and erratically arranged lymphocytes in red pulp. Moreover, lymphocytes in G(0)/G(1) phase were significantly increased, whereas lymphocytes in S phase and G(2)+M phase and the proliferation index (PI) were markedly decreased in the high F groups II and III. The results confirmed that high dietary F in the range of 800 similar to 1200 mg/kg inhibited the proliferation of splenocytes and suppressed spleen development in young chickens.

Emissions' impacts were quantified using eMergy synthesis and other methods (dilution method, disability adjusted life years (DALY) method and ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) method). The results show that its sustainability is very low and declining in this period, emissions obviously reduce the sustainability although their impacts are generally decreasing, and the main reasons lie in its low nonrenewable resources and energies' efficiencies. Finally, the related suggestions were put forward for improving its comprehensive performance. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CHARACTERISING THE PATHOGENICITY DIVERSITY OF USTILAGINOIDEA VIRENS IN HYBRID RICE IN CHINA	JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Ustilaginoidea virens; rice false smut; rice hybrids; plant-pathogen interaction; disease assessment		Fifty nine isolates of Ustilaginoidea virens, the cause of false smut of rice (Oryza sativa L.), were obtained from 46 rice hybrids in 14 counties in Sichuan, China during a survey conducted in 2006. Their pathogenicity was tested by inoculation on 3 rice hybrids, Gangyou182, Gangyou94-11 and Yixiangyou2292, 6-9 days before heading in 2007. False smut was assessed 3 weeks after inoculation using a disease index (DI) based on symptom frequency on the panicles. The sporulation capacity of these isolates was also measured. The results showed that: (i) DIs were significantly different (P<0.01) both among pathogen isolates and rice hybrids, ranging from 0 to 98.52; Q there was a significant interaction between isolates and hybrids (P<0.01); (60 significant differences in sporulation among the 59 isolates were found (P<0.01), but no relationship between sporulation and virulence on the 3 hybrids; (iv) variation in sporulation was observed among isolates originating from different counties and from the same county (P<0.05); (v) there were significant differences (P<0.01) between isolate groups from different host origin, female parents and male parents. Our results indicated a linkage between the pathogenicity of U. virens isolates and the resistance of rice hybrids. The 59 isolates could be classified into 6 groups based on their virulence to the tested rice hybrids. While variation in sporulation did not indicate host genotype-pathogen isolate interaction, pathogenicity data suggest specialisation, which is dependent on the site of origin of the isolates, the original host (rice hybrids) and the parentage of the original host.

Melanocortin receptor (MCR) plays an important role in central melanocortin system (CMS) and muscle cells. The purpose of the present study was to analyze association of the MC3R and the MC4R genes with chicken carcass and meat quality traits. Using eight meat-type chicken populations constructed with 5 pure lines (developed from Chinese local breeds) and 3 crossbreeds (S01 x D99, S01 x S05, S 01 X S10), the association of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP: MC3R-A1424G, MC4R-G923T and MC4R-C944T) of MC3R and MC4R gene with carcass and meat quality traits was studied. The results showed as follows: (I) the MC3R-A1424 G genotypes were significantly associated with most carcass, traits except for semi-eviscerated percentage and leg muscle percentage (LMP), the MC4R-G923T genotypes were significantly associated with live weight, carcass weight, leg muscle weight (LMW) and LMP, and the MC4R-C944T genotypes were not significantly associated with most carcass traits except for LMW and LMP; (2) to meat quality, the MC3R-A1424G genotypes significantly affected muscle crude protein (GP) value, and the allele A had positive additive effects on slaughter traits. The MC4R-G923T and the MC4R-C944T sites significantly affected muscle GP value and glutamic acid (Glu) value, (3) the haplotypes based on the 2 SNP of MC4R gene were also significantly associated with meat quality traits, but had no significant associations with carcass traits. The research built the base for further analysis on relation between genetic variation of MC3R and MC4R genes and the carcass and meat quality traits. and molecular marker's application in breeding.

The panicles of red rice Rdh produced colorless caryopses after darkness treatment; and these colorless caryopses displayed bright-red after vanillin treatment, but did not display red color after light inducing for 15 days, suggesting that red rice Rdh could produce leucoanthocyanidin, but could not produce polyproanthocyanidins in darkness. Histological study revealed that the aleurone layers of Rdh colorless caryopses displayed bright-red after vanillin assay, but the pericarp and seed coat layers did not display color change, which indicated that the aleurone layers could accumulate precursors of polyproanthocyanidins in darkness, but the pericarp and seed coat could not. Additionally, color of Rdh caryopses changed from green in immaturity to red in maturity, and the green caryopses changed color from green to red gradually indoor for 7 days after harvest, suggesting that leucoanthocyanidins could synthesize polyproanthocyanidins. It was concluded that light was necessary for red pigment biosynthesis in red rice Rdh, leucoanthocyanidins biosyntheses in the aleurone layers did not need light, leucoanthocyanidins biosynthesis in pericarp and seed coat needed light inducing, the effect of leucoanthocyanidin biosynthesis in Rdh to light had tissue specificity.

The yeast Pichia pastoris can neither utilize nor degrade xylan, but it possesses many attributes that render it an attractive host for the expression and production of industrial enzymes. Results: The Xyn2 gene, which encodes the main Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 endo-beta-1, 4-xylanase was cloned into the pPICZ alpha A vector and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The selected P. pastoris strains produced as 4,350 nkat/ml beta-xylanase under the control of the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter. The secreted recombinant Xyn2 was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 21 kDa. The activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was highest at 60 degrees C and it was active over a broad range of pH (3.0-8.0) with maximal activity at pH 6.0. The enzyme was quite stable at 50 degrees C and retained more than 94% of its activity after 30 mins incubation at this temperature. Using Birchwood xylan, the determined apparent K-m and k(cat) values were 2.1 mg/ml and 219.2 S-1, respectively. The enzyme was highly specific towards xylan and analysis of xylan hydrolysis products confirmed as expected that the enzyme functions as endo-xylanase with xylotriose as the main hydrolysis products. The produced xylanase was practically free of cellulolytic activity. Conclusion: The P. pastoris expression system allows a high level expression of xylanases. Xylanase was the main protein species in the culture supernatant, and the functional tests indicated that even the non-purified enzyme shows highly specific xylanase activity that is free of cellulolytic side acitivities. Therefore, P pastoris is a very useful expression system when the goal is highly specific and large scale production of glycosyl hydrolases.

Brown fish meal was used as the sole protein source in the present study. Six isoenergetic experimental diets containing 14.4 MJ kg(-1) of digestible energy and 220-495 g crude protein kg(-1) diets were fed to triplicate groups of 50 fish with a mean initial weight of 16.67 +/- 0.01 g for 45 days. Per cent weight gain (PWG) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) improved with an increase in the dietary protein levels up to 330 g kg(-1) diet. The condition factor, relative gut length, intestinal folds height, hepatopancreas and intestine protein content improved with an increase in the protein levels up to 330-385 g kg(-1) diet. Trypsin, creatinkinase, Na+, K+-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase activities generally followed the same tendency as that of growth parameters. Amylase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activities were negatively correlated with increasing protein levels from 220 to 330 g kg(-1) diet, and no differences were found thereafter. Lipase activity was unaffected by protein levels. Lactobacillus amount was increased with protein levels up to 275 g kg(-1) diet, while Aeromonas amount followed the opposite pattern. Escherichia coli amount was not influenced by dietary protein levels. Glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) activities in the hepatopancreas and plasma ammonia concentration (PAC) were not influenced by protein levels between 220 and 275 g kg(-1) diet, but significantly increased with increasing protein levels from 275 to 440 g kg(-1) diet, and remained similar thereafter. Glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities significantly increased with protein levels > 275 g kg(-1) diet. Based on the broken-line model, the dietary protein requirement for PWG of Jian carp (16.7-55.0 g) was estimated to be 341 g kg(-1) diet with a digestible energy of 14.4 MJ kg(-1) diet.

The results demonstrated that SPH could absorb on the IMAC-Fe3+ column, while the capability of the binding iron was different in SPH (10-30 kDa), SPH (3-10 kCia), and SPH (1-3 kDa). The highest binding amount on the column occurred with SPH (10-30 kDa). With the IMAC method, the iron-chelating peptides were shown to be formed at pH lower than 5.5, and they were not affected by NaCL with the concentration between 0.1 mol/L and 1 mol/L, while the iron-chelating peptides could be partially disrupted by 0.02 mol/L Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. Furthermore, the iron-chelating peptides were identified with reversed phase (RP)-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, and MALDI-TOF MS/MS. The binding characteristics of the SPH on IMAC-Fe3+ and the sequences of the iron-chelating peptides revealed that binding sites between SPH and iron might be the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp residues.

Here we describe a fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) method developed for fast measurement of AHV-1 DNA based on TaqMan MGB technology. Results: The detection limit of the assay was 1 x 101 standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 2 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation. Conclusion: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity and reproducibility of the AHV-1 fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of AHV-1 etiologically related application.

It is mainly distributed in the southwest from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the hot and dry Three-River Valley with hot monsoon climate and the southeast in the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and Taiwan along the coast. The regions where it occurs have annual rainfall > 500 mm and average annual temperature greater than 19A degrees C. It occurs on a wide range of soil regimes in these regions. In China the jatropha usually blossoms and bears fruits only once a year, but there are also instances of two or more flowerings per year. In some small but high yielding pilot areas, dry fruit output is reported to be 9,000-12,000 kg per ha, whereas in large plantings the output averages only about 1,800 kg per ha. In order to contribute to sustainable production of jatropha, further studies focused on different ecotypes, improvement of seed quality, plantation techniques, flowering and fruiting characteristics, and harvest and post-harvest handling of seeds are required. More research on biomedicinal potential of various parts of the plant and more information on the actual and potential markets is needed to realize the full potential of jatropha.

These sequences contained 1,595 nucleotides, including 1,270 conserved sites, 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 16 indels. The average frequency of SNPs and indels was one out of 76.1 and 99.9 bases, respectively. Five SNPs and no indels were found in the translated sequences. Fourteen haplotypes were defined, and the accessions in each haplotype ranged from 1 to 18. There were nine haplotypes in Triticum monococcum ssp. aegilopoides, eight in T. monococcum ssp. monococcum, and two in T. urartu. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pina genes from different species or subspecies could be clearly differentiated based on the open reading frame. Genes from T. urartu grouped together, whereas genes from T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides and T. monococcum ssp. monococcum were shared by three and two clusters, respectively. Both the haplotype and phylogenetic analyses indicated that T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides was more diverse. These results would contribute to the understanding of functional aspects and efficient utilization of pina genes.

The dynamic tri-axial tests included frozen soil samples subjected to fifteen test events with five different temperatures. five different water contents and five different confining pressures. Experimental expressions of the frozen soil parameters are obtained. including the maximum dynamic elastic modulus, the dynamic elastic modulus ratio, and the reference linear strain amplitude, based on the test data and an equivalent linearization model. The effects of temperature, water content and confining pressure on the dynamic elastic modulus ratio and the backbone curves of the frozen soil are discussed. The results provide basic experimental data for establishing dynamic constitutive law of the frozen soil and meaningful information for further studies on dynamic response of railway embankment in the permafrost regions caused by passing train.

Two novel crystal protein genes were found by using the PCR-RFLP method. Moreover, the full-length sequences of two novel genes were obtained by a single oligonucleotide nested (SON)-PCR upstream and downstream strategy. Sequence analysis revealed that one gene encoded a polypeptide of 673 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 76.3 kDa, 38% identical to Cry10Aa, and the other encoded a polypeptide of 687 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 77.1 kDa, 74% identical to Cry30Aa. These two novel crystal protein genes were designated as cry54Aa1 and cry30Fa1 by Bt Insecticidal Crystal Proteins Nomenclature Committee, respectively. The Cry54Aa1 and Cry30Fa1 proteins retained five conserved regions commonly found in the existing Cry proteins. Cry54Aa1 protein exhibited insecticidal activities against Laphygma exigua (Lepidoptera), Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera), and Aedes aegypti (Diptera) when its encoding gene was expressed in an Escherichia coli host strain.

J	Li, WT; Peng, YY; Wei, YM; Baum, BR; Zheng, YL				Li, Wei-Tao; Peng, Yuan-Ying; Wei, Yu-Ming; Baum, Bernard R.; Zheng, You-Liang			Relationships among Avena species as revealed by consensus chloroplast simple sequence repeat (ccSSR) markers	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION			English	Article						Avena; ccSSR; Chloroplast; Genetic relationship; Maternal inheritance	RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; BARLEY HORDEUM-VULGARE; C-GENOME; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; TRITICUM-DICOCCOIDES; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; NUCLEOLAR ACTIVITY; OAT CULTIVARS; DNA DIVERSITY	Consensus chloroplast simple sequence repeat (ccSSR) makers were used to assess the genetic variation and genetic relationships of 80 accessions from 25 taxa of the genus Avena. Fifteen out of 16 ccSSR markers (93.75%) were polymorphic. A total of 51 alleles were detected at the 16 ccSSR loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 1 to 6, with an average of 3.2 alleles. Among these ccSSR loci, the highest polymorphism information content (PIC) value was 0.754, while the lowest PIC value was 0. The mean genetic similarity index among the 80 Avena accessions was 0.545, ranging from 0.188 to 1.000. To assess the usefulness of ccSSRs in separating and distinguishing between haplome (genome) groups, we used ordination by canonical discriminant analysis and classificatory discriminant analysis. Although discriminant analysis separated the haplome groups unequivocally, it was up to 69% predictive of correctly classifying an individual plant whose haplome(s) is unknown in the case where it belonged to the A haplome group, 75% where it belonged in the AC group, and almost 80% where it belonged in the ACD group. The analysis of genetic similarity showed that diploid species with the A haplome were more diverse than other species, and that the species with the As haplome were more divergent than other diploid species with the A haplome. Among the species with the C haplome, A. clauda was more diverse than A. eriantha and A. ventricosa. In the cluster analysis, we found that the Avena accessions with the same genomes and/or belonging to the same species had the tendency to cluster together. As for the maternal donors of polyploid species based on this maternally inherited marker, A. strigosa served as the maternal donor of some Avena polyploidy species such as A. sativa, A. sterilis and A. occidentalis from Morocco. A. fatua is genetically distinct from other hexaploid Avena species, and A. damascena might be the A genome donor of A. fatua. Avena lusitanica served as the maternal parents during the polyploid formation of the AACC tetraploids and some AACCDD hexaploids. These results suggested that different diploid species were the putative A haplome donors of the tetraploid and hexaploid species. The C genome species A. eriantha and A. ventricosa are largely differentiated from the Avena species containing the A, or B, or D haplomes, whereas A. clauda from different accessions were found to be scattered within different groups.

Successive mutants showed enhanced cellulase production, clear hydrolysis zone and rapid growth on Avicel-containing plate. Particularly, the mutant NU-6 showed approximately two-fold increases in activity of both FPA and CMCase in shake flask culture when grown on basal medium containing peptone (1%) and wheat bran (1%). The enzyme production was further optimized using eight different media. When a mixture of lactose and yeast cream was used as cellulase inducer, the mutant NU-6 yielded the highest enzyme and cell production with a FPase activity of 6.2 U ml(-1), a CMCase activity of 54.2 U ml(-1), a beta-glucosidase activity of 0.39 U ml(-1), and a fungal biomass of 12.6 mg ml(-1). It deserved noting that the mutant NU-6 also secreted large amounts of xylanases (291.3 U ml(-1)). These results suggested that NU-6 should be an attractive producer for both cellulose and xylanase production.

Pigs have a greater metabolic similarity and tissue size than rodents as a model of humans for that purpose. We conducted 2 experiments: 1) we cloned 5 novel porcine selenoprotein genes; and 2) we compared the effects of dietary selenium (Se) on mRNA levels of 12 selenoproteins, activities of 4 antioxidant enzymes, and Se concentrations in testis, thyroid, and pituitary with those in liver of pigs. In Experiment 1, porcine Gpx2, Sephs2, Sep 15, Sepn1, and Sepp1 were cloned and demonstrated 84-94% of coding sequence homology to human genes. In Experiment 2, weanling male pigs (n = 30) were fed a Se-deficient (0.02 mg Se/kg) diet added with 0, 0.3, or 3.0 mg Se/kg as Se-enriched yeast for 8 wk. Although dietary Se resulted in dose-dependent increases (P < 0.05) in Se concentrations and GPX activities in all 4 tissues, it did not affect the mRNA levels of any selenoprotein gene in thyroid or pituitary. Testis mRNA levels of Txnrd1 and Sep 15 were decreased (P < 0.05) by increasing dietary Se from 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg. Comparatively, expressions of Gpx2, Gpx4, DO, and Sep15 were high in pituitary and Diol, Sepp1, Sephs2, and Gpx1 were high in liver. In conclusion, the mRNA abundances of the 12 selenoprotein genes in thyroid and pituitary of young pigs were resistant to dietary Se deficiency or excess. J. Nutr. 139: 1061-1066, 2009.

First, the presence of CD9 in bovine matured oocytes was examined by immunofluorescence with the anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, and the results showed that CD9 was expressed on the plasma membrane of matured oocytes. Sperm binding and fusion with oocytes was then examined by in vitro fertilization. When the zona pellucida-free matured oocytes were fertilized, both sperm binding to ooplasma and sperm penetrating into oocytes were significantly (P<0.01) reduced in anti-CD9 antibody-treated oocytes (6.3 +/- 0.7 per oocyte and 41.6%, respectively) compared with untreated control oocytes (19.0 +/- 0.7 per oocyte and 81.3%, respectively), indicating that the anti-CD9 mAb potentially inhibits sperm-oocyte binding and fusion. These results demonstrated that the CD9 present on bovine matured oocytes is involved in sperm-oocyte interaction during fertilization.

The bound state energy equation and the unnormalized radial wave functions have been approximately obtained by using the supersymmetric shape invariance approach and the function analysis method. It is found that the present approximate analytical results are in better agreement with those obtained by using the numerical integration approach for small values of alpha than the approximate results obtained by using the conventional approximation to the centrifugal term.

The plate-count results indicated that the D(10) value was 384.6 Gy with a neutron radiation dose rate of 7.4Gy/min. The rudimental catalase activity of the spores declined obviously with the increase in the radiation dose. Meanwhile, under the scanning electron microscope, no visible influence of the neutron radiation on the spore configuration was detected even if the dose was increased to 4 kGy. The content and distribution of DNA double-strand breaks induced by neutron radiation at different doses were measured and quantified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Further analysis of the DNA release percentage (PR), the DNA breakage level(L), and the average molecular weight, indicated that DNA fragments were obviously distributed around the 5 kb regions at different radiation doses, which suggests that some points in the DNA molecule were sensitive ton neutron radiation. Both PR and L varied regularly to some extent with the increase in radiation dose. Thus neutron radiation has a high sterilization power, and can induce falling enzyme activity and DNA breakage in Bacillus subtilis spores.

Production of intergeneric hybrid between dwarfing polish wheat (Triticum polonicum L.) and Aegilops tauschii Cosson. with reference to wheat origin	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							PETROPAVLOVSKYI; DOMESTICATION; AMPHIPLOIDS; SQUARROSA; AESTIVUM; SITE	Dwarfing polish wheat is a dwarfing accession of Triticum polonicum L. from Xinjiang of China. In the present study, the artificial hybridization between dwarfing polish wheat and two accessions of Aegilops tauschii Cosson. (AS60 and AS65) was carried out, and the F(1) hybrids were obtained successfully without using embryo rescue techniques for the first time. The crossabilities of hybrids T. polonicum x Ae. tauschii (AS60) and T. polonicum x Ae. tauschii (AS65) were 1.67% and 0.60% respectively. Only the hybrids of T. polonicum x Ae. tauschii (AS60) germinated well, and 24 F(1) hybrid plants were obtained. All the F(1) hybrid plants grew vigorously, and the morphological traits were similar to bread wheat. The F(1) plants had some obvious traits inherited from T. polonicum and Ae. tauschii and were completely sterile. Chromosome pairing in the hybrid was characterized by a large number of univalents, with an average of 20.56 and 0.22 bivalents per PMC, and no ring bivalents and multivalents were observed. Furthermore, the potential value of the F1 hybrids between T. polonicum and Ae. tauschii for studying wheat origin and breeding are discussed.

Phylogenetic relationships among the species of Elymus sensu lato in Triticeae (Poaceae) based on nuclear rDNA ITS sequences	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							MEIOTIC PAIRING BEHAVIOR; GENOME ANALYSIS; HYSTRIX MOENCH; HYBRIDIZATION; BRASSICACEAE; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; ROEGNERIA; KENGYILIA; PATULA	The genus Elymus L. sensu lato includes Roegneria, Elymus, Hystrix, Sitanion and Kengyilia, and they are very important group in the tribe Triticeae. However, the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status of them are still in dispute. The ITS sequences were obtained and analyzed for their phylogenetic relationships by using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods. The main results were as follows: (1) Most species in Roegneria, Elymus and Sitanion were clustered in the St clade with diploid St genome species, and it was difficult to distinguish the species in Roegneria and Elymus; (2) The polyploid species with St genomes in the St clade were divided into three groups, which suggests that there exists differentiation of St genome in polyploids; (3) Most species of Kengyilia have only P-type of clone and clustered with diploid Agropyron species, which may suggest that Kengyilia is a valid genus; (4) Hy. patula, the type species of Hystrix was clustered with species of Elymus, while Hy. duthiei ssp. duthiei, Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata, Hy. coreana and Hy. komarovii were grouped with diploid Psathyrostachys species. It indicated that Hy. patula is distinct related to other Hystrix species, and it is reasonable to treat Hystrix patula as Elymus hystrix and other species in Hystrix should be transferred to Leymus; (5) The "clones bias" in ITS sequences are widespread in the allopolyploid species.

Evolution analysis of the matrix (M) protein genes of 17 H9N2 chicken influenza viruses isolated in northern China during 1998-2008	VIRUS GENES			English	Article						Matrix protein gene; H9N2 subtype; Influenza A virus; Phylogenetic analysis	ION-CHANNEL ACTIVITY; A VIRUSES; SOUTHERN CHINA; HONG-KONG; POULTRY	Matrix (M) protein genes of 17 H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from chickens in northern China during the last 10 years were completely sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Homology of nucleotide sequences in the M gene of 17 isolates was 92.7-99.9%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 11 of the tested M genes belong to the A/chicken/HongKong/Y280/97 (Y280)-like lineage, while the other six belong to the A/Quail/HongKong/G1/97 (G1)-like lineage. This is also the first time that a G1-like M gene of a H9N2 virus was detected in chicken flocks in northern China. These newly appearing changes in M genes may be due to reassortment events of AIVs, or they may have come from the H9N2 strains of southern China which surged in northern China after translocation. An analysis of the viral amino acid sequence of M2 protein has revealed substitution of S31N in two isolates, which is the molecular characterization of amantadine resistance in AIVs. Results of this study suggest that long-term monitoring should be continued to track the transmission and evolution of H9N2 AIVs in chickens in China.

Jian) to study the effects of myo-inositol (MI) on the growth, digestive enzyme and intestinal microbial population. Diets with seven levels of inositol (163.5, 232.7, 384.2, 535.8, 687.3, 838.8 and 990.3 mg MI kg(-1) diet) were fed to Jian carp (initial weight 22.28 +/- 0.07 g). Per cent weight gain (PWG) was improved with increasing inositol levels up to 535.8 mg MI kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05), and plateaued (P > 0.05). The protein production value, lipid production value and ash production value were increased with increasing dietary inositol levels up to 384.2, 838.8 and 838.8 mg MI kg(-1) diet respectively (P < 0.05). Although intestinal protein content and trypsin activity were not affected by inositol levels (P > 0.05), chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase activities in intestine were the lowest for fish fed the MI-unsupplemented diet (P < 0.05). Alkaline phosphatase, Na+, K+-ATPase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatinkinase activities in the intestine were increased with an increase in the inositol levels up to 384.2-687.3 mg MI kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Intestinal Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli decreased with an increase in the levels of dietary inositol up to 232.7 and 687.3 mg MI kg(-1) diet respectively (P < 0.05), while Lactobacillus in the intestine increased with an increase in inositol levels up to 990.3 mg MI kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). In conclusion, inositol improved growth, digestive capacity and intestinal microbial population of juvenile Jian carp, and the dietary inositol requirement for PWG of juvenile Jian carp is 518.0 mg MI kg(-1) diet.

Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with insulin and glucose. Compared with the control group, 100 and 150nmoll(-1) insulin increased TG accumulation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACC alpha) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, and the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), FAS and ACC alpha genes. Insulin at 200nmoll(-1) had an inhibiting effect on TG accumulation and the activity of ACC and FAS, but increased the gene expression of SREBP-1, FAS and ACC alpha. We also found that high glucose (30mmoll(-1)) increased the TG level, ACC and FAS activity, and the mRNA levels of SREBP-1 and FAS. However, there was no effect of high glucose on ACCa mRNA level. In addition, the interaction between insulin and glucose was observed to induce TG accumulation, ACC and FAS activity, and gene expression of SREBP-1, FAS and ACC alpha, and increase SREBP-1 nuclear protein level and binding of nuclear SREBP-1 and the SRE response element of the ACC gene. The result also indicated that the glucose-induced TG accumulation decreased after 96 h when the hepatocytes were cultured with 30mmoll(-1) glucose. In conclusion, insulin and glucose may affect hepatic lipogenesis by regulating lipogenic gene expression and lipogenic enzyme activity in goose hepatocytes, and SREBP-1 might play an important role in the synergetic activation of lipogenic genes. We propose that the utilization of accumulated TG in hepatocytes is the reason for the reversible phenomenon in goose hepatocellular steatosis.

Sequence analysis indicated that the nucleotide sequences of the Bs-Ag2 from adult, L2 and L3 of B. schroederi were completely identical. A homology search performed by BLAST revealed that Bs-Ag2 shared the highest amino acid sequence identity with As16 protein from Ascaris suum (94%). The recombinant Bs-Ag2 proteins can be successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The rBs-Ag2 was used to evaluate their ability to induce immune protective responses in BALB/c mice against L3-challenge infection in a mouse-B. schroederi model. There was a 63.66% reduction (P<0.001) of recovery, of larvae compared with that in the control group. Specific anti-Bs-Ag2 antibodies from immune protected mice had significantly higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (P<0.0001). Our data supported the use of Bs-Ag2 as a potential candidate for vaccination against B. schroederi infection. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Anyuepaideng-Secale africanum Stapf.) and BF-1 (T. turgidum ssp. carthlicum-S. africanum), were evaluated by chromosomal banding and in situ hybridization. The individual S. africanum chromosomes were identified in the BF-1 background by sequential C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and were distinguishable from those of S. cereale, because they exhibited less terminal heterochromatin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the tandem repeat pSc250 as a probe indicated that only 6R(a) of S. africanum contained a significant hybrid signal, whereas S. cereale displayed strong hybridization at the telomeres or subtelomeres in all seven pairs of chromosomes. Extensive wheat-S. africanum non-Robertsonian translocations were observed in both AF-1 and BF-1 plants, suggesting a frequent occurrence of chromosomal recombination between wheat and S. africanum. Moreover, introgression lines selected from the progeny of wheat/AF-1 crosses were resistant when field tested with widely virulent strains of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. Three highly resistant lines were selected. GISH and C-banding revealed that resistant line L9-15 carried a pair of 1BL.1RS translocated chromosomes. This new type of S. africanum derived wheat-Secale translocation line with resistance to Yr9-virulent strains will broaden the genetic diversity of 1BL.1RS for wheat breeding.

An effective solution to control the virus is utilizing resistant genes to improve the resistance of susceptible materials, whereas the basic work is to analyze the genetic basis of resistance. In this study, maize inbred lines Huangzao4 (resistant) and Mo17 (susceptible) were used to establish an F(9) immortal recombinant inbred line (RIL) population containing 239 RILs. Based on this segregation population, a genetic map was constructed with 100 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers selected from 370 markers, and it covers 1421.5 cM of genetic distance on ten chromosomes, with an average interval length of 14.2 cM. Analysis of the genetic map and resistance by mapping software indicated that a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) was between bin6.00 and bin6.01 on chromosome 6, linked with marker Bnlg1600 (0.1 cM of interval). This QTL could account for 50.0% of phenotypic variation, and could decrease 27.9% of disease index.

J	Gu, YF; Zhang, XP; Tu, SH; Lindstrom, K				Gu, Yunfu; Zhang, Xiaoping; Tu, Shihua; Lindstrom, Kristina			Soil microbial biomass, crop yields, and bacterial community structure as affected by long-term fertilizer treatments under wheat-rice cropping	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Long-term experiment; Microbial community; Biomass; Genetic fingerprint; Wheat; Rice	GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; CHINA; AGROECOSYSTEMS; POPULATIONS; AMENDMENTS; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN), soil microbial community structure, and crop yields were studied in a long-term (1982-2004) fertilization experiment carried out in Suining, Sichuan province of PR China. Eight treatments included three chemical fertilizer (CF) treatments (N, NP, NPK), three CF + farmyard manure (M) treatments (NM, NPM, NPKM), M alone and no fertilizer (CK) as control. The results showed that the soil microbial biomass was higher in soil treated with CFM than in soil treated with CF alone, and that NPKM gave the highest rice and wheat yields. The SMBC and SMBN were higher after rice than those after wheat cropping. SMBC correlated closely with soil organic matter. Average yields of wheat and rice for 22 years were higher and more stable in the fertilized plots than in control plots. Bacterial community structure was analyzed by PCR-DGGE targeting eubacterial 16S rRNA genes. A higher diversity of the soil bacterial community was found in soil amended with CFM than in other fertilizer treatments. Some specific band emerged in the soil amended with M. The highest diversity of bacterial communities was found in the NPKM treated soil. The bacterial community structures differed in rice and wheat plots. Sequencing of PCR products separated in DGGE showed that some of the common and dominant bands were closely related to Aquicella lusitana and to Acidobacteria. This study demonstrated that mixed application of N, P, and K with additional M amendment increased soil microbial biomass, diversified the bacterial communities and maintained the crop production in the Calcareous Purplish Paddy soil.

EM. THELL.; ALLELIC VARIATION; AESTIVUM L.; SSP DICOCCUM; COMMON WHEAT	The genetic variations of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits in 1051 accessions of 13 Triticum subspecies were investigated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. A total of 37 alleles were detected, resulting in 117 different allele combinations, among which 20, 68 and 29 combinations were observed in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats, respectively. Abundance and frequency of allele and combinations in tetraploid wheats were higher than these in hexaploid wheats. Allele Glu-A1c was the most frequent subunit at Glu-A1 locus in tetraploid and hexaploid wheats. Consequently, the results also suggested that the higher variations occurred at Glu-B1 locus compared to Glu-A1 and Glu-D1. Therefore, carthlicum wheat possessing the allele 1Ay could be presumed a special evolutional approach distinguished from other tetraploid species. Furthermore, this provides a convenient approach of induction of the 1Ay to common wheat through direct cross with carthlicum wheat. Alleles Glu-B1c and Glu-B1i generally absent in tetraploid wheats were also found in tetraploid wheats. Our results implied that tetraploid and hexaploid wheats were distinguished in dendrogram, whereas carthlicum and spelta wheats and however displayed the unique performance. In addition, founder effect, no-randomness of diploidization, mutation and artificial selection could cause allele distribution of HMW-GS in Triticum. All alleles of HMW-GS in Triticum could be further utilized through hybrid in the quality improvement of common wheat.

This experiment contained 2 trials with the first trial of effect of dietary cysteamine supplementation on growth performance in finishing pigs for 47 d. A total of 16 PIC pigs (60.02 +/- 1.01 kg: eight gilts and eight barrows) were randomly assigned to one of two dietary groups, with four pens per group (per pen: one gilt, one barrow). In the second trial, a total of eight PIC barrows (60.04 +/- 1.02 kg) were randomly assigned to one of the two dietary groups. with four pens/group (one pig/pen) for 37 d and then the eight barrows were housed individually in metabolism crates (four barrows in control group and four barrows in CS group) for 10 d. The pigs of the first and second trials were fed a basal diet containing 0 (control) or 70 mg CS/kg diet. A total of eight barrows of the second trial received a 7-d nitrogen balance trial. (15)N-Glycine (10 mg/kg BW) was gastrically infused after d 5 of the nitrogen balance trial. Feces and urine were collected daily to determine the N output. Results indicated that CS supplementation increased (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG), feed intake (ADFI), nitrogen retention, nitrogen retention efficiency, and efficiency of digestible N utilization. In addition. CS supplementation resulted in a decreased (P<0.05) protein breakdown rate. Net protein gain in nitrogen was increased (P<0.05) by 63.5%. However, protein synthesis rate, nitrogen flux, and endogenous urinary nitrogen were not affected (P>0.05). It is concluded that dietary CS supplementation may improve growth performance in finishing pigs. Protein deposition is increased after dietary CS supplementation. This increase is caused by a decrease in protein breakdown. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We also propose an alternative description of Mendel's second law of independent assortment, which refers to the free combination of different pairing centers. This interpretation is based on the modified concept that true 'homologous chromosomes' should carry the pairing center rather than centromere: the length of homology or the importance of the homologous segment on the chromosome is the crucial factor in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis.

Although considerable improvements have been achieved in the vitrification of porcine embryos, there has been no offspring born from the vitrified oocytes in this species. Porcine oocytes characteristically contain large amounts of cytoplasmic lipids that are major obstacles limiting efficient cryopreservation. These droplets together with structures such as mitochondria, membranes, cortical granules and basic components of the spindle and cytoskeleton (microtubules and microfilaments) often incur serious damage during cooling and warming. According to recent reports, the proper combinations of permeable and non-permeable cryoprotectants and vitrification with high cooling and warming rates may increase the survival of porcine oocytes. The cryotolerance of porcine oocytes may also be enhanced by removal of the chilling-sensitive lipid droplets, supplementation of cytoskeleton relaxants in vitrification solutions, or high hydrostatic pressure pretreatment of oocytes before cryopreservation. The improvement in cryopreservation methodology for porcine oocytes will no doubt augment other technologies such as pig cloning and the establishment of a gene bank for transgenic pigs.

Three distinct kinds of flowers were observed in this species: (1) about 54% of the flowers had pistils that were of equal length or shorter than the stamens (PESS); (2) in 23.5% of the flowers, the pistils were longer than the stamens (PLS), and; (3) in 22.5% of the flowers, the styles were positioned axially away from the anthers (SAA). No significant difference in fruit setting rate was observed between PLS and SAA flowers, but PESS flowers set less fruits than the other two. A breeding experiment indicated that the species was self-incompatible, and revealed that the presence of PLS and SAA could increase outcrossing and fruit set. A field experiment showed that open-pollinated flowers of E. sagittatum produced significantly less fruits than an artificial xenogamy experiment. This may be because most of the flowers in natural populations have pistils and anthers of the same length (PESS). The principal visitors and effective pollinators are Bombus sp1 and Bombus sp2. Attractant experiments indicated that the fruit set of flowers whose spurs were removed was significantly lower than that of flowers whose stamens were removed, suggesting that the spurs of the flowers could strongly increase the pollinator visitation and fruit set. The results therefore showed that floral morphology could significantly affect fruit set in E. sagittatum.

The complex family structure of gamma-gliadins complicates the determination of their function. Moreover, gamma-gliadins contain several sets of celiac disease epitopes. However, no systematic research has been conducted yet. Results: A total of 170 gamma-gliadin genes were isolated from common wheat and its closely related species, among which 138 sequences are putatively functional. The ORF lengths of these sequences range from 678 to 1089 bp, and the repetitive region is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of gamma-gliadins. The repeat motif P(Q/L/S/T/I/V/R/A)F(S/Y/V/Q/I/C/L)P(R/L/S/T/H/C/Y)Q(1-2)(P(S/L/T/A/F/H)QQ)(1-2)is repeated from 7 to 22 times. Sequence polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium analyses show that gamma-gliadins are highly diverse. Phylogenic analyses indicate that there is no obvious discrimination between Sitopsis and Ae. tauschii at the Gli-I loci, compared with diploid wheat. According to the number and placement of cysteine residues, we defined nine cysteine patterns and 17 subgroups. Alternatively, we classified gamma-gliadins into two types based on the length of repetitive domain. Amino acid composition analyses indicate that there is a wide range of essential amino acids in gamma-gliadins, and those gamma-gliadins from subgroup SG-10 and SG-12 and gamma-gliadins with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional. A screening of toxic epitopes shows that gamma-gliadins with a pattern of C9 and gamma-gliadins with a short repetitive domain almost lack any epitopes. Conclusion: gamma-Gliadin sequences in wheat and closely related Aegilops species are diverse. Each group/subgroup contributes differently to nutritional quality and epitope content. It is suggested that the genes with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional and valuable. Therefore, it is possible to breed wheat varieties, the gamma-gliadins of which are less, even non-toxic and more nutritional.

G. Don] is a plant species known for its production of TIAs (terpenoid indole alkaloids), many of which are pharmaceutically important. Ajmalicine and serpentine are prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, whereas the bisindoles vinblastine, vincristine and 3',4'-anhydrovinblastine are used for their antineoplastic activity in the treatment of many cancers. However, TIAs are produced in small yields in C. roseus, which make them expensive. Cell and metabolic engineering has focused on increasing flux through the TIA pathway by various means, including optimization of medium composition, elicitation, construction of noval culture systems and introduction of genes encoding specific metabolic enzymes into the C. roseus genome. The present review will attempt to present the state-of-the-art of research in this area and provide an update on the cell and metabolic engineering of TIAs in C. roseus. We hope that this will contribute to a better understanding of the ways in which TIA production can be achieved in different C. roseus culture systems.

Next, 4-5 nm gold nanoparticles, prepared by classical Frens procedure, were coated on the surface of the amination Fe3O4 by self-assembly technology. The prepared Fe3O4@Au nanocomposite particles were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis, infrared spectrum (FT-IR), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) in order to elucidate the morphology, optics and magnetic properties of the nanocomposites. Their uniform distribution of particle size, which is about 15 nm, and good magnetic responsiveness were observed. In view of the fact that Fe3O4 owns superparamagnetism and that nano-gold can readily combine with biological molecules, glucose oxidase (GO (x) ) was chosen as a model to penetrate the condition of immobilizing enzyme, and enzymatic properties of resultant immobilized enzyme were studied as well. By systematic optimization, we established that at 28A degrees C, and pH (5.5) and when mole ratio of Fe3O4:HAuCl4 was 0.5:1, the immobilization provided the best results. Finally, we are glad to find that the immobilized enzyme exhibits excellent thermostability in addition to its better stability than free enzyme. Thus, herein described immobilized enzyme could be used repeatedly with the assistance of an external magnetic field.

Mitochondrial injury and increased numbers of apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were observed in spleens of the high F groups 11 and Ill. As measured by flow cytometry, the percentage of apoptotic splenocytes was significantly increased (p<0.01) in the high F groups 11 and Ill when compared with that of control group. Immunohistochemistry tests showed increased frequencies of positive cells in Bax detection, and decreased Bcl-2 protein in the high F groups 11 and Ill. The results indicate that excess dietary F in the range of 800-1200 mg/kg caused histological lesions and cellular apoptosis of the spleen in chickens.

In many reports, investigations of microbial diversity from environmental samples were based on the agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) patterns of ERIC-PCR amplified products. This is not a sound practice, since bands with identical positions can contain different sequences; thus, this practice could possibly exaggerate the similarities or diversities among samples. To mitigate this issue, we employed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy to explore DNA bands with the same size, between ERIC-PCR profiles of samples. DPS software was used with Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') to analyze ERIC-PCR fingerprint profiles. H' revealed that the microbial community diversity at DGGE was higher than with AGE. The results of this study suggest that the ERIC-PCR assays with DGGE can provide a better assessment of electrophoresis pattern with regards to the structure of an intestinal microbial community.

The objective of the current research was to identify the polymorphisms in chicken ADFP gene and their associations with carcass traits. We screened all coding sequence and part of introns (totally 2155 bp) of the ADFP gene by using single strand conformation polymorphism method in individuals front Sanhuang chicken, Mountainous Black-bone chicken and a commercial crossbred chicken (totally 427 birds). Three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found in intron 4 (SNP1), intron 5 (SNP2) and exon 8 (SNP3), respectively. The association analyses showed that genotypes of SNP I were significantly associated with abdominal fat weight and percentage of abdominal fat (P < 0.05). genotypes of SNP2 were significantly associated with breast muscle weight and percentage of abdominal fat (P < 0.05), and the main haplotype/haplotypes, combination (their frequencies were higher than 5%) were marginally significantly associated with breast muscle weight. abdominal fat weight. and percentage of abdominal fat (0.05 < P < 0.1). Haplotype H2 (A-C-A) was an advantageous haplotype for breast muscle weight and H5 (T-C-G) was an advantageous haplotype for weight and percentage of abdominal fat. Conversely, H3H3 (A-T-G/A-T-G) was a disadvantage haplotype combination for accumulation of abdominal fat. These results suggested that polymorphisms of ADFP gene were associated with carcass traits, especially with fatness traits. ADFP is a potential major gene or in close linkage disequilibrium with the QTL affecting fatness traits in chickens.

Influence of uniconazole and plant density on nitrogen content and grain quality in winter wheat in South China	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						grain protein; N distribution; protein composition; processing quality; uniconazole; density; winter wheat	PROTEIN-COMPOSITION; YIELD COMPONENTS; SIMULATION; FERTILIZER; CULTURE; GROWTH; WATER; RAPE	Superior protein quality and consistent processing quality is needed for winter wheat marketing in South China. It has been shown that uniconazole concentration and plant density are certainly related to crop growth.-An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of uniconazole concentration and plant density on nitrogen content and grain quality in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Trials were managed to provide three levels of density (90 x 10(4), 180 x 10(4), and 270 x 10(4) per ha) over plots receiving four levels of uniconazole concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) which were applied to seeds before sowing. The results revealed that the contents of N accumulated in ear, stem, and leaf were higher in uniconazole concentrations than that in control, and the effect of uniconazole on main stem was bigger than that on tillers. The grain protein was significantly (LSD, P < 0.05) higher in uniconazole concentrations than that in control. Uniconazole at 20 mg/kg was the most favorable for improving grain protein and protein fractions. Application of uniconazole concentrations also significantly (LSD, P < 0.05) increased WGC (wet gluten content) and SDS (sedimentation volumes), prolonged DDT (dough development time) and DST (dough stable time), and improved WA (water absorption), increased VV (valorimeter value), and subsequently improved the processing quality of wheat grains. These results suggest that a combination of uniconazole concentration and plant density should be applied in South China.

The OTC enhanced the mean air temperature by 2.9 degrees C throughout the growing season. In contrast, only a slight difference (0.4 degrees C) in the mean soil temperature was observed in the OTC compared with the control plots (CP). Spiraea mongolica, Potentilla fruticosa, Conicera hispida (deciduous shrubs) and Daphne retusa (evergreen shrub) showed earlier bud break, flowering and fruit coloring as well as longer flower longevity in the OTC than in the CP. All deciduous shrubs in the OTC had a longer leaf lifespan. Daphne retusa had higher leaf survival rates in the OTC. No significant differences in the total number of flowers and fruits were noticed for most species between the two treatments. Warming stimulated the shoot and leaf growth for most species. The specific leaf area tended to increase for many species in the OTC. However, the leaf nitrogen concentration tended to decrease in P. fruticosa and S. mongolica. The results obtained in the present study indicate that warming conditions can have strong impacts on alpine shrubs in a timberline ecotone.

Characterization and chromosomal location of Pm40 in common wheat: a new gene for resistance to powdery mildew derived from Elytrigia intermedium	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; BREAD WHEAT; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; TRANSLOCATION; MAP; LINES; LOCI	Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a very destructive wheat (Triticum aestivum) disease. Resistance was transferred from Elytrigia intermedium to common wheat by crossing and backcrossing, and line GRY19, that was subsequently selected, possessed a single dominant gene for seedling resistance. Five polymorphic microsatellite markers, Xgwm297, Xwmc335, Xwmc364, Xwmc426 and Xwmc476, on chromosome arm 7BS, were mapped relative to the powdery mildew resistance locus in an F(2) population of Mianyang 11/GRY19. The loci order Xwmc426-Xwmc335-Pm40-Xgwm297-Xwmc364-Xwmc476, with 5.9, 0.2, 0.7, 1.2 and 2.9 cM genetic distances, was consistent with published maps. The resistance gene transferred from Elytrigia intermedium into wheat line GRY19 was novel, and was designated Pm40. The close flanking markers will enable marker assisted transfer of this gene into wheat breeding populations.	[Luo, P. G.; Luo, H. Y.; Zhang, H. Y.; Zhang, M.; Ren, Z.

Breeding and cultivation of Al tolerance wheat can partially protect wheat escaping from Al toxicity. The scarcity of the tolerant sources impedes the wheat breeding. In order to find new Al tolerance sources, we screened 173 bread wheat landraces from Tibet of China using hydroponic screening. It was indicated that: (1) There were diversities on the root regenerate length (RRL). The RRL of a large of landraces were longer than 7.00 cm in pH 7 (58.38%) and pH 4.5 (66.47%), but shorter than 5.00 cm in pH 4.5 + 50 mu M Al(3+) (80.93%). The low pH showed either promotion or restraining effects depend on landraces, but Al toxicity under low pH only showed restraining effects on the root elongation. (2) There were also diversities on root tolerance index of low pH (RTI1) or root aluminum tolerance index (RTI2) among cultivars. The RTI1 varied from a narrow range but with relatively high value (0.8722-1.2953) in comparison with that of RTI2 (0.3829-1.0058), and the RTI1 of approximately 60% landraces was higher than 1.0000, the RTI2 of only 19.07% landraces was higher than 0.7000, suggesting that Al toxicity acted as an important factor for the reduction of the root elongation under acidic soils. (3) The RTI1 of many wheats was higher than 1.0000, and As2256 and As2295 were the most tolerant for low pH, with RTI1 1.2953 and 1.2925, respectively. (4) Based on RTI2, seven wheats showed similar or higher tolerance to Al toxicity than Chinese Spring (CS), a known tolerance wheat. Much better tolerance existed in landraces of As 1543 and As 1242, which can be used as the new parents for Al tolerant breeding.

In order to select an optimal H2O2 concentration to induce oxidative stress in enterocytes, cultures were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 (0-100 mu M) for 16 h. The results showed that exposure to H2O2 increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and malondialdehyde levels in a dose-dependent manner in the culture medium, suggesting increase toxicity of H2O2. Thus, 100 mu M was an appropriate concentration for inducing oxidative stress. We then examined the cytoprotective effects of glutamine under conditions of oxidative stress. Cells were treated with glutamine (0-20 mM) in the presence of H2O2 (100 mu M) for 16 h. The control cells were kept in the glutamine-free MEM only. Results showed that glutamine completely blocked H2O2-stimulated release of lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, glutamine reduced H2O2-induced increase in malondialdehyde level and protein carbonyls content to the level seen in the control culture. In addition, glutamine treatment completely prevented the decrease in Na+-K+-ATPase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase activities as well as reduced glutathione concentration and the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione induced by H2O2. No significant difference was observed between cells incubated with glutamine in the presence of H2O2 and control cells in values for most of the markers mentioned above. Complete protection was obtained at a concentration of glutamine as small as 4 mM. The present results indicate that glutamine is effective in protecting against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in carp intestinal epithelial cells. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in different soil organic matter (SOM) pools (light and heavy fractions), the role of light- and heavy-fraction C in SOC sequestration, and culturable microbial counts in the surface (0-20 cm) of a fluvo-aquic soil after 18 years of fertilization treatments under a wheat-maize cropping system in the North China Plain. The experiment included seven treatments: (1) OM, organic manure; (2) 1/2OMN, half organic manure with mineral fertilizer NPK; (3) NPK, mineral fertilizer NPK; (4) NP, mineral fertilizer NP; (5) PK, mineral fertilizer PK; (6) NK, mineral fertilizer NK; and (7) CK, unfertilized control. Carbon and N contents of the light and heavy fractions were highest in the CM treatment, while the CK treatment showed the lowest value. Application of half organic manure with mineral fertilizer NPK (treatment 2) significantly increased C and N contents of the light and heavy fractions in soil in comparison with application of mineral fertilizer alone (treatments 3, 4, 5, and 6). For the mineral fertilizer treatments, a balanced application of NPK (treatment 3) showed higher C and N contents of the light and heavy fractions than an unbalanced use of fertilizers (treatments 4, 5, and 6). Heavy-fraction C dominated total SOC storage in all treatments. The total SOC increase under fertilization treatments is attributed to an increase in C content of both the light and the heavy fraction. However, the SOC increase for the manure treatments was mainly due to an increase in the C content of the heavy fraction, whereas that for mineral fertilizer treatments was mainly due to an increase in the C content of the light fraction. The total soil culturable microbial counts (including bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes) was observed to be highest for the OM treatment, while the control plot showed the lowest value. Application of half organic manure with mineral fertilizer NPK was found to produce a higher culturable microbial counts than application of mineral fertilizers alone, and the NPK treatment gave a higher culturable microbial counts than other mineral fertilizer treatments (NP, PK or NK). Light-fraction C is probably the better predictor of microbial abundance, as it correlated more strongly with culturable microbial counts than total SOC did.

We screened CAPN3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 307 meat-type quality chicken from 5 commercial pure lines (S01, S02, S03, S05, and D99) and 4 native breeds from Guangdong Province (Huiyang Huxu chicken and Qingyuan Ma chicken) and Sichuan Province (Caoke chicken and Shandi Black-bone chicken), China. Results: Two SNPs (11818T > A and 12814T > G) were detected by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method and were verified by DNA sequencing. Association analysis showed that the 12814T > G genotypes were significantly associated with body weight (BW), carcass weight (CW), breast muscle weight (BMW), and leg muscle weight (LMW). Haplotypes constructed on the two SNPs (H1, TG; H2, TT; H3, AG; and H4, AT) were associated with BW, CW (P < 0.05), eviscerated percentage (EP), semi-eviscerated percentage (SEP), breast muscle percentage (BMP), and leg muscle percentage (LMP) (P < 0.01). Diplotype H1H2 was dominant for BW, CW, and LMP, and H2H2 was dominant for EP, SEP, and BMP. Conclusion: We speculated that the CAPN3 gene was a major gene affecting chicken muscle growth and carcass traits or it was linked with the major gene(s). Diplotypes H1H2 and H2H2 might be advantageous for carcass traits.

Previous studies by others have shown that administration of EGF into the ileum lumen enhances intestinal development. Objective: The objective was to examine the feasibility of expressing and delivering EGF via Lactococcus lactis to early-weaned mice to enhance intestinal development at this critical transition stage. Design: EGF-expressing L. lactis (EGF-LL) was generated with a recombinant approach. Early-weaned mice were orally gavaged with the recombinant bacteria. Body weight, mean villous height, and crypt depth in the intestine were measured to examine the influence of EGF-LL on the intestinal development of early-weaned mice in vivo. Results: Populations of EGF-LL were shown to survive throughout the intestinal tract, and the recombinant EGF protein was also detected in intestinal contents. Weight gain was significantly greater in mice that received EGF-LL than in control mice fed phosphate-buffered saline or L. lactis transformed with the empty vector backbone but was comparable with that of the positive control mice that received recombinant human EGF. EGF-LL increased mean villous height and crypt depth in the intestine. Immunohistochemistry also confirmed that enterocyte proliferation was enhanced in mice that received EGF-LL, as evidenced by the greater number of cells stained with proliferative cell nuclear antigen in the intestine. Conclusions: This study showed that EGF-LL had beneficial effects on the intestinal growth of newly weaned mice. The combination of growth factor delivery and a probiotic approach may offer possibilities for formulating dietary supplements for children during their weaning transition stage.

In vitro hemolysis tested, the hemolysis rate of GSH-capped QDs was lower 45% than MA-capped QDs, and QD-LP was less than 5%, which meet the requirements of biomedical materials. The toxicity in vivo was tested with tissue section by fluorescence microscope. It showed that different surface-modified QDs had different toxicity in mice. QDs were distributed mainly in the lung, kidney and thymus tissues, but QD-LP mainly existed in the brain tissues.

We report here the developmental potential of farmed blue fox oocytes after vitrification with a two-step OPS method. Oocytes were collected and pre-cultured for 0, 24, 48, 72 hours respectively before cryopreservation. Vitrification of oocytes was achieved by a 30 sec treatment in 10% ethylene glycol (EG) or 10% EG + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 25 degrees C followed by a 25 sec equilibration in EFS30 (30% (v/v) EG +21% (w/v) Ficoll +0.35M sucrose) or EDFS30 (15% (v/v) EG +15% (v/v) DMSO +21% (w/v) Ficoll +0.35M sucrose), before plunging into liquid nitrogen. The survival of oocytes after vitrification was assessed morphologically immediately after warming, and cultured for in vitro maturation. For comparison, control oocytes were cultured for in vitro maturation for 96 hours. The best result was obtained when oocytes were pre-cultured for 72 hours, first exposed to 10% EG + 10% DMSO and vitrified in EDFS30. The survival percentage of oocytes under these conditions was not significantly different (P > 0.05) from that of the control.

Three field experiments were conducted during different times through the year, in normal, freezing and thawing periods, respectively, and the influence of the season, train speed and train type, is described in this paper. The results show that: (1) the vertical component is the greatest among the three components of the measured vibration near the rail track, and as the distance to the railway track increases, the dominant vibration depends on the season. (2) Compared with the vibration in the normal period, the vertical and longitudinal vibrations increase while the lateral vibration decreases in the freezing period. However, in the thawing period, the vertical and longitudinal vibrations decrease, and the lateral vibration increases. (3) As train speeds increase, the subgrade vibration increases. (4) The vibration induced by a freight train is greater than by a passenger train. These observations provide a better understanding of the vibration and dynamic stability of the subgrade and may be useful in developing criteria for railway and building construction in cold regions.

However, the evolution and origin of waxy maize still remain unknown. We analyzed the origin and evolution of waxy maize by sampling DNA sequences from four taxa with eight populations: waxy maize and other maize cultivars from Southwest China or America (Zea mays L. ssp. mays), parviglumis (Z. mays L. ssp. parviglumis Iltis et Doebley), three more distant species within this genus (Z. luxurians (Durieu et Ascherson) Bird, Zea perennis (Hitchcock) Reeves et Mangelsdorf, and Zea diploperennis Iltis, Doebley et Guzman), and a representative of sister genus (Tripsacum dactyloides L.). We sequenced 20 sequences and downloaded 26 sequences from NCBI for the glb1 locus, which encodes a nonessential seed storage protein. Within the Zea genus samples, the waxy maize has the minimum sequence diversity, which contains 31.1% of the level of diversity of parviglumis and 58.5% of the level of diversity of normal maize from Southwest China. Sequence variation within glb1 locus is consistent with neutral evolution in all four taxa according to Tajima'D test. From the NJ tree for glb1 sequences waxy maize formed two main groups which are intermixed with normal maize sequences. These results suggest that the Chinese waxy maize originate from a single gene mutation from normal maize. Combined with the history of maize dispersal in China we can even think that Chinese waxy maize was divergenced from Chinese flint maize.

Transportation increased serum concentrations of calcium (Ca) (P<0.05), phosphorus (P) (P<0.01), glucose (P<0.01) and cortisol (P<0.01). Supplementation of MgAsp increased concentration of serum Mg (P=0.057). Transportation decreased L* value (P<0.05) of biceps femoris (BF) at 45 min and 24 h, and b* value of longissimus thoracis (LT) at 45 min (P=0.073) after slaughter, and increased pH value of BF at 45 min (P<0.05) and LT at 45 min (P=0.098) after slaughter. However, transportation increased Wamer-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) value of BF (P<0.05) at aging 72 h and IT (P<0.01) at aging 24 h and 72 h. Supplementation of MgAsp reduced L* value (P<0.05) of LT at 45 min, and BF at 45 min and at 24 h after slaughter, increased a* value (P<0.05)of BF at 45 min and had attend to decline WBSF values of BF and IT at aging 24 h compared with the treatments fed the control diet. Transportation improved mRNA level of calpastatin of muscle (P<0.05). Meanwhile, supplementation of MgAsp increased mRNA level of p-calpain of muscle (P=0.079). These results suggested that transportation stress increased postmortem color and pH value of pork and decreased tenderness of pork, and supplemental MgAsp improved color of pork and had a trend to decline WBSF, but did not influence drip loss and pH value of pork.

Fragments of MD1, MD2, and MD3 were found to be differentially expressed under drought stress. While the expression of MD1 and MD2 was down-regulated, the expression of MD3 was up-regulated. Sequence analysis of the three fragments revealed that MD1 shared 97% nucleotide sequence identity with maize chloroplast matK, a gene encoding RNA maturase involved in group II intron splicing of RNA transcript; MD2 had 99% identity with PP2C, a gene encoding serine/threonine phosphorylase 2C in resurrection grass Sporobolus stapfianus; and MD3 exhibited 99% sequence identity with a rice gene encoding metacaspase, an arginine/lysine-specific cysteine protease. Based on MD2 fragment sequence, a full-length complementary DNA of 1,731 bp was isolated. An open reading frame of 1,167 bp was found and predicted to encode a protein of 388 amino acids, containing the catalytic domain and conserved residues of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2C. This open reading frame was identified as a new member of the PP2C gene family in maize and designated as ZmPP2Ca. The differential expression of ZmPP2Ca and enzyme activity of PP2C were also investigated in three drought-tolerant and two sensitive maize inbred lines under drought stress and well-watered (control) conditions by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and a non-radioactive labeled method, respectively. Down-regulation of the ZmPP2Ca transcript was observed in all three drought tolerant lines, whereas transcript levels were up-regulated in the two sensitive lines under drought stress. In light of the importance of protein kinases in signal transduction pathways, it is proposed that ZmPP2Ca may play a role in the signal transduction of maize in response to drought stress.

A serovar-specific real-time, fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) assay was used to detect genomic DNA of S. enteritidis in the blood and the internal organs at different time points respectively. The results showed that the spleen was positive at 12 h post inoculation (PI) and the blood was at 14 h PI. The organism was detected in the liver and heart at 16 h PI, the pancreas and kidney were positive at 20 h PI, and the final organ to show a positive results was the gallbladder at 22 h PI. The copy number of S. enteritidis DNA in each tissue reached a peak at 24 h-36 h PI, with the liver and spleen containing the highest concentration of S. enteritidis. The blood, heart, kidney, pancreas, and gallbladder had low concentrations. S. enteritidis populations began to decrease and were not detectable at 3 d PI, but were still present up to 2 wk for the spleen without causing apparent symptoms. To make the results meaningful, a side-by-side bacteriology method (IFA) was performed. The results of IFA were similar to the FQ-PCR assay. This research provided a significant data for understanding the life cycle of S. enteritidis in the internal organs, and may help to understand the pathogenesis of S.entertidis in the future.

The presence of expressed 1Ay subunits in diploid and tetraploid wheat genotypes makes it possible to investigate molecular information of active 1Ay genes. Results: We identified 1Ay subunits with different electrophoretic mobility from 141 accessions of diploid and tetraploid wheats, and obtained the complete ORFs and 5' flanking sequences of 1Ay genes including 6 active and 3 inactive ones. Furthermore, the 5' flanking sequences were characterized from 23 wild diploid species of Triticeae. All 6 active 1Ay possess a typical HMW-GS primary structure and some novel characteristics. The conserved cysteine residue within the repetitive domain of y-type subunits was replaced by phenylalanine residue in subunits of 1Ay (Tu-e1), 1Ay (Tu-e2), 1Ay (Ta-e2) and 1Ay (Td-e). Particularly, 1Ay (Ta-e3) has an unusual large molecular weight of 2202 bp and was one of the known largest y-type HMW-GSs. The translations of 1Ay (Tu-s), 1Ay (Ta-s) and 1Ay (Td-s) were disrupted by premature stop codons in their coding regions. The 5' flanking sequences of active and inactive 1Ay genes differ in a few base substitutions and insertions or deletions. The 85 bp deletions have been found in promoter regions of all 1Ay genes and the corresponding positions of 6 species from Aegilops and Hordeum. Conclusion: The possession of larger molecular weight and fewer conserved cysteine residues are unique structural features of 1Ay genes; it would be interested to express them in bread wheat and further to examine their impact to processing quality of wheat. The 1Ay genes from T. urartu are closer to the genes from T. turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum, than those from T. monococcum aegilopoides. The 85 bp deletion and some variations in the 5' flanking region, have not interrupted expression of 1Ay genes, whereas the defects in the coding regions could be responsible to the silence of the 1Ay genes. Some mutational events in more distant distal promoter regions are also possible causes for the inactivation of 1Ay genes.

Immunohistochemical method using the strept avidin-biotin-complex (SABC) was employed. All antisera between seven portions of the channel catfish were compared statistically using statistical package for the social science (SPSS). Five types of DNES cells were determined: neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-IR) cells were demonstrated in both anterior and middle intestine; serotonin (5-HT) immunoreactive cells were detected throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract; vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) positive cells were at the highest frequency in pylorus; glucagon-immunoreactive (GLU-IR) cells were moderate in number in the fundus and anterior, middle intestine, and no immunoreactivity was determined in the other portions; somatostatin (SOM) positive cells were more abundant in the anterior and middle intestine. The regional distribution and relative frequency of immunoreactive cells in the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, are essentially similar to those of other fish. However, some characteristics are observed in this species, which further proved that the diversity of the physiological function of DNES cells was based on their morphology.

Rdh caryopsis transverse sections were stained by metachromatic stain TBO. It showed that there were a great deal of polyphenols in the pericarp and seed-coat tissues, and a little of them was in the cell wall of aleurone layers. The ovaries of Rdh and colorless rice were dealt with vanillin. It showed that all fertilized ovaries of Rdh were bright red regardless what degree the caryopsis maturity was, and all the ovaries of it before fertilization were not red after vanillin treatment. It suggested that every Rdh caryopsis had proanthocyanidins or its precursors, and fertilization was the premise of proanthocyanidins or its precursor synthesis. But colorless rice could not accumulate proanthocyanidins or its precursors. The pericarp, seed-coat and aleurone layer tissues of Rdh and colorless rice were anatomized and were dealt with vanillin. It was showed that three layers of Rdh were all bright red after treatment, revealing that they all had proanthocyanidins or its precursors, but colorless rice could not. It was suggested that polymerized proanthocyanindins were synthesized and accumulated in the pericarp of Rdh, and monomer-proanthocyanidins or leucoanthocyanidins were synthesized and accumulated in the seed-coat and the aleurone layer tissues.

Although these dense anthropogenic mosaics of croplands, settlements, and other used lands cover more than 2 million square kilometers across China, the nature of these changes and their environmental impacts remain poorly understood because their spatial scale is generally too small to measure accurately using conventional land-change methods. Here, we investigate the regional consequences of fine-scale landscape changes across China's village regions from 1945 to 2002 using high-resolution, field-validated ecological mapping of a regionally stratified sample of village landscapes at five sites across China, with uncertainties estimated using model-based resampling and Monte Carlo methods. From 1945 to 2002, built surface areas increased by about 7% (90% credible interval = 2-17%) across China's village regions, an increase equivalent to about three times the total urban area of China in 2000. Although this striking result is explained by a near doubling of already large village populations and by lower housing density per capita in rural areas, two unexpected changes were also observed: a 9% net increase (-4% to +21%) in regional cover by closed canopy trees and an 11% net decline (-30% to +3%) in annual crops. These major regional changes were driven primarily by intensive fine-scale land-transformation processes including tree planting and regrowth around new buildings, cropland abandonment, and by the adoption of perennial crops and improved forestry practices. Moreover, the fragmentation, heterogeneity, and complexity of village landscapes increased over time. By coupling regional sampling and upscaling with observations in the field, this study revealed that fine-scale land-change processes in anthropogenic landscapes have the potential for globally significant environmental consequences that are not anticipated, measured, or explained by conventional coarser resolution approaches to global and regional change measurement or modeling.

High genetic variations at the RGAP loci were observed in T. dicoccoides populations. A total of 254 discernible bands were obtained among 115 accessions, and 192 bands (75.6%) were polymorphic. Each genotype had a unique banding profile, and the genetic similarity coefficient ranged from 0.094 to 0.862. In T. dicoccoides, the proportion of polymorphic loci (P), the genetic diversity (He) and Shannon's information index were 0.756, 0.362 and 0.541, respectively. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P) per population averaged 0.732 (range: 0.515-0.932); genetic diversity (He) averaged 0.271 (range: 0.212-0.338); and Shannon's information index averaged 0.404 (range: 0.310-0.493). The coefficients of genetic distance (D) among populations averaged 0.107 (range: 0.043-0.178), and the results of Mantel test (r = 0.168, P = 0.091) showed that the estimates of genetic distance were geographically independent. Neighbor-joining cluster analysis suggested that the genetic relationships of T. dicoccoides populations were associated with their ecogeographic distribution. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and the coefficient of gene differentiation (G(ST)) values revealed that most of the variations were presented within populations, although significant differences among populations and regions were also detected. The values of P and Shannon's information index were negatively correlated with the two factors: Tdd (day-night temperature difference) and Ev (mean annual evaporation), whereas they were positively correlated with one water factor: Rn (mean annual rainfall). The correlation matrix between He in the RGAPs and geographic variables contained 20 significant (P < 0.05) correlations. The present study established that T. dicoccoides in Israel had a considerable amount of genetic variations at RGAP loci at least partly correlated with ecological factors.

A total of 92 EST-SSR alleles were detected, and the number of alleles ranged from 1 to 7 with an average of 3.68 per locus. Allele numbers and the polymorphic information content (PIC) value of EST-SSR loci on the B genome were higher than those on the A genome. The genetic similarity coefficient (GS) varied from 0.189 to 0.966, and all genotypes were clustered into four major groups. The population Mt. Gerizim had the highest genetic variations, whereas the population Beit-Oren had the lowest genetic variations. Most of genetic variance existed within populations was observed based on the coefficient of gene differentiation (F(ST)=0.355). The value of genetic distance (D) between the populations varied from 0.112 to 0.672 with an average of 0.406, and the results of Mantel test (r=0.104, p=0.809) showed that the estimates of genetic distance were geographically independent. The values of Nei's gene diversity (He) and Shannon's information index (I) correlated negatively with the temperature factor: mean January temperature (Tj), whereas they correlated positively with another factor: mean number of Sharav days (Sh). The correlation matrix between He in the EST-SSRs and climatic variables contained 37 significant (p < 0.05) correlations. The present study established that T. dicoccoides in Israel had a considerable amount of genetic variations at EST-SSR loci at least partly correlated with ecological factors. These results suggested that EST-SSR diversity is adaptive by natural selection and influenced by both internal and external factors and their interactions.

Genetic diversity of Chinese domestic goat based on the mitochondrial DNA sequence variation	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS			English	Article						Domestic goats; genetic diversity; mtDNA; Yangtze River delta white goat	MTDNA D-LOOP; MULTIPLE MATERNAL ORIGINS; CAPRA-HIRCUS; PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE; CATTLE; BREEDS	The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity of domestic goat in China. For this purpose, we determined the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region in 72 individuals of the Yangtze River delta white goat, and reanalysed 723 published samples from 31 breeds/populations across China. All goat haplotypes were classified into four haplogroups (A-D) previously described. The phylogenetic pattern that emerged from the mtDNA control region sequence was confirmed by the analysis of the entire cytochrome b sequence of eight goats representative of the four haplogroups. It appeared that in Chinese domestic goat, haplogroups A and B were dominant and distributed in nearly all breeds/populations, while haplogroups C and D were only found in seven breeds/populations. Four breeds/populations contained all four haplogroups. When grouping the breeds/populations into five geographic groups based on their geographic distributions and ecological conditions, the southern pasturing area had the highest diversity whereas the northern farming area had the lowest diversity. 84.29% and 11.37% of the genetic variation were distributed within breeds and among breeds within the ecologically geographical areas, respectively; only 4% of genetic variation was observed among the five geographic areas. We speculate that the traditional seasonal pastoralism, the annual long-distance migrations that occurred in the past, and the commercial trade would account for the observed pattern by having favoured gene flows.

Primary goose hepatocytes were isolated and treated with the LXR alpha agonist T0901317. Triglyceride (TG) accumulation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC alpha) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activities, and gene expression levels of LXR alpha, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1), FAS, ACC alpha and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were measured in primary hepatocytes. We found a dose-dependent up-regulation of TG accumulation, ACC, and FAS activities and the mRNA levels of LXR alpha, SREBP-1, FAS, ACC alpha, and LPL genes in the presence of To-901317. We also found that binding of nuclear SREBP-1 to ACC alpha SRE sequence was induced by To-901317 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, LXR alpha is involved in the induction of the lipogenic pathway through activation of SREBP-1 and its target genes in goose primary hepatocytes.

Hybrids between Triticum aestivum cv. 'J-11' and Psathyrostachys huashanica were treated with colchicine, to produce a new intergeneric amphiploid (PHW-SA). The morphological characteristics of PHW-SA resembled the parent 'J-11'. PHW-SA plants have purple internodes and pubescence in the basal spikelet, inherited from the P. huashanica parent. Somatic chromosome numbers varied from 2n = 51 to 2n = 56, with 70.59% of plants having 56 chromosomes. At metaphase I, PHW-SA (2n = 56) plants showed an average of 1.15 univalents, 27.34 bivalents, 0.03 trivalents and 0.02 tetravalents per cell; complete chromosome pairing occurred in 50% of the pollen mother cells. A survey of disease resistances revealed that the stripe rust resistance from P. huashanica was expressed, but powdery mildew resistance was suppressed. The fertility of PHW-SA was 60%.	[Kang, H.

The kinetics of attenuated DEV vaccine was examined in tissues of ducklings vaccinated by the mucosal or systemic route at 20 days of age and sampled regularly up to 60 days post-vaccination (p.v.). Significant numbers of virus genomes in the lymphoid and other parenchymatous organs were first detected at 60 min p.v., and subsequently rose to peak levels during 90 min to 1 day p.v. independent of the route of vaccine administration. The peak level of vaccine virus in the individual parenchymatous organs of subcutaneously immunized ducklings was significantly higher than that of orally or nasally immunized ducklings. The route of vaccine administration had significant effect on the initial tissue distribution of vaccine virus in respiratory and digestive tracts. Vaccine viruses spread to digestive tract and trachea tissues by mucosal route, i.e. oral and nasal administration, early than that by subcutaneous route, The rapid early increase of vaccine virus levels in ail samples examined followed by a steady decline from 90 min to 6 days p.v. The real-time PCR analysis of a variety of tissues is significant for further investigation of the mechanism of vaccinal protection, and the optimization of vaccination regimes.

Many kinds of methods have been developed for detecting the quality of hay and the method of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been widely used with consideration of its fast, effective and nondestructive characteristics during detecting process. In the present paper, the feasibility and effectiveness of application of NIRS to detecting hay quality were expounded. Meanwhile, the advance in the study of using NIRS to detect chemical compositions, extent of incursion by epiphyte, amount of toxicant excreted by endogenetic epiphyte and some minim components that can not be detected by using chemical methods were also introduced detailedly. Based on the review of the progresses in using NIRS to detect the quality of hay, it can be concluded that using NIRS to detect hay quality can avoid the disadvantages of time wasting, complication and high cost when using traditional chemical method. And for better utilization of NIRS in practice, some more studies still need to be implemented to further perfect and improve the utilization of NIRS for detecting forage quality, and more accurate modes and systematic analysis software need to be established in times to come.

The codon usage bias of UL24 genes of DEV and 27 reference herpesviruses were analyzed. The results showed that codon of UL24 gene of DEV was strong bias toward the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon position. A high level of diversity in codon usage bias existed, and the effective number of codons used in a gene plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in UL24 gene of herpesviruses was constrained by the G + C content. The phylogentic analysis suggested that DEV was evolutionarily closer to Alphaherpesvirinae and that there was no significant deviation in codon usage in different virus strains. There were 20 codons showing distinct usage differences between DEV and Escherichia coli, 23 between DEV and Homo sapiens, but only 16 codons between DEV and yeast. Therefore the yeast expression system may be more suitable for the expression of DEV genes.

Growing resistant cultivars is the most economic and environmental friendly way to control the disease. There are many resistance genes to stripe rust located on wheat chromosome 2B. Here, we propose a strategy to construct the recombinant wheat chromosome 2B with multiple resistances to stripe rust by making crosses between wheat lines or cultivars carrying Yr genes and using marker-assisted selection, based on the reported information about resistance spectrum, chromosomal location, and linked markers of the genes. Pyramiding the resistance genes on 2B would afford a valuable strategy to control the disease by cultivating varieties with durable resistance. The possibility, efficiency, and prospect of the suggested strategy are reviewed in the paper. (C) 2008 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The dynamic changes associated with apoptosis occurring in the internal tissues were evaluated at different time points postinoculation (PI) by performing hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, followed by light microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that DSHDV infection could induce apoptosis in host cells, including those of the bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus, spleen, liver, intestinal tract, kidney, and esophagus. The apoptotic index (AI) values increased with time from 2 to 72 h PI, and the highest values were recorded at 72 h PI. Further, cell death due to classic necrosis was observed in the dying or deceased ducks after 72 h PI. In conclusion, host cell apoptosis can be induced by DSHDV and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of duck viral swollen head hemorrhagic disease (DVSHD).

To adjust and fine-tune the heading time of hexaploid wheat to particular geographical regions and specific environment within these, there is an urgent need to evaluate and use alternative alleles for heading time. Aegilops tauschii, the donor species of D-genome of hexaploid wheat, has a wide geographic distribution. The present study revealed a wide variation for heading time among 56 Ae. tauschii accessions. All the accessions with short heading dates belonged to the ssp. tauschii, whereas most of ssp. strangulata accessions showed very long heading date. The heading date was also related to distribution of this species. The monotelosomic and monosomic analysis of a synthetic hexaploid wheat showed that chromosome 2D derived from ssp. tauschii accession AS60 had a major effect on promoting heading time with a reduction of more than 5 days. It is postulated that this Ae. tauschii genotype possess the allele Ppd-D(t)1 responsible for the insensitivity to photoperiod. This allele is probably different from Ppd-D1 existing in hexaploid wheat. The new allele Ppd-D(t)1 derived from Ae. tauschii might be used as a source for hexaploid wheat breeding on photoperiod response.

Also, it was proposed that CI-2 might play an important role in the inhibition of proteolytic enzymes from pests or pathogens as CI-2 can strongly inhibit chymotrypsin and subtilisin. In this study, a total of 93 CI-2 gene sequences were isolated from wild and cultivated barley. 48 SNPs and 4 indels were detected across the entire sequences. The frequency of SNPs in the non-coding region (1 out of 9 bases) was slightly higher than that in the coding region (1 out of 10.7 bases). In all, 33.3% of the candidate cSNPs resulted in amino acid changes. As a total, the 24 cSNPs resulted in 15 amino acid changes. Ten distinguishable haplotypes were detected, among which 3 haplotypes were shared in the most barley accessions, whereas the rest of the haplotypes appeared at a lower frequency. In addition, three haplotypes (haplotype 4, 8, and 9) were unique for single accessions. These results suggested that low diversity at the CI-2 locus was detected among the cultivated and wild barley.

However, dozens of accessions with the same names of White Dent and Golden Queen are preserved in China National Genebank (CNG). The present study investigated the genetic diversity of these two important groups of maize landraces, as well as the relationships within and among them. Thirty-four landrace accessions with the name of White Dent and 10 with Golden Queen preserved in CNG were fingerprinted with 52 simple sequence repeats with tailed primer M13. Summary statistics including average number of alleles per locus, gene diversity/expected heterozygosity, and observed heterozygosity were carried out using PowerMarker ver. 3.25 software. The test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) of all the 44 maize landrace accessions were also performed by PowerMarker. We observed a significant differentiation in terms of the average number of alleles between White Dent and Golden Queen (6.44 alleles per locus in White Dent, 4.48 in Golden Queen), while both groups of maize landraces had a relatively high but similar gene diversity (0.61 of White Dent, 0.63 of Golden Queen). The fixation index (F(ST)) was only 0.0044, while the percentage of loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within these two groups of White Dent and Golden Queen was 32.69 and 3.92%, respectively. The rather high genetic diversity and average number of alleles per locus confirmed that both groups of landraces had a rather broad germplasm base. The extremely low fixation index showed that there was little genetic variation between White Dent and Golden Queen and the molecular variation within these two groups was remarkably high, indicating no genetic drift between White Dent and Golden Queen and suggesting different improvement approaches to these two important groups of landraces. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test revealed that the group of White Dent was deviated from HWE, whereas Golden Queen was under HWE.

AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES IN CHINA			English	Article						maize; quantitative trait loci; photoperiod response		Photoperiod sensitivity in maize plays an essential role in utilizing tropic and sub-tropic germplasm to temperate areas. This study aims to identify and map the QTLs responsible for the characteristics measuring photoperiod sensitivity, days from planting to silking (SD), photoperiod response coefficient of silking (PRC), and anthesis-silking interval (ASI). Using the population derived from Zheng 58, photoperiod-insensitive parent, and Ya 8701, photoperiod-sensitive parent, a linkage map was constructed with 93 single sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Phenotyping of 296 F-2:3 families of the population in replicated-field test was conducted in both long-day (Beijing, China) and short-day (Sichuan, China) conditions. Ten QTLs were identified to be associated with the SD and ASI on chromosomes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 in the long-day conditions, and 11 QTLs were detected to be related to the SD and ASI on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 in the short-day conditions, respectively. A QTL associated with the PRC as a major effect in the long-day conditions located in the same position as the QTL related to the SD and ASI in the map, and was on chromosome 10 linked with marker bnlg1655. Using these QTLs in the marker-assisted selection, the photoperiod sensibility could be reduced by selection of the alleles responsible for the SD, PRC, and ASI in breeding programs.

Eighteen pigs were allotted into three groups (six pigs per group), and pigs in treatment 1, 2 and 3 were immunized with physiological saline, 1 mg or 4 mg myostatin per pig, respectively. Six pigs were killed by electrical stunning followed by exsanguination at BW of 100 kg. The results indicated that the titer of myostatin antibody was increased in treated groups compared to the control group on day 42 (P < 0.01) and d 84 (P < 0.01). The carcass lean percentage was significantly increased in the treatment groups compared to the control group (P < 0.01), and intramuscular fat was significantly decreased in the 4 mg group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The muscle creatine kinase activity of pigs treated with 1 mg and 4 mg myostatin was lower than the control group. The immunization of myostatin signofocantly decreased the myostatin gene expression levels in muscle. It was concluded that optimal active immunization against myostatin could increase the content of myostatin antibody, suppress the activity of creatine kinase and the expression of myostatin gene, and therefore improve the carcass lean percentage for pigs.

In order to describe a systematic study of cry gene resources from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains of different ecological regions in Sichuan Basin, a total of 791 Bt strains have been screened from 2650 soil samples. The analysis of the cry genes was based on the method of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). cry1, cry2, cry3, cry4/10, cry9, cry30, and cry40-type genes were found in this basin. Strains containing cry1 genes were the most abundant in our collection (66%), and twenty-one different cry1-type gene combinations were found. Bt strains harboring cry2 genes were the second most abundant (39.5%), and the strains containing cry3, cry9, cry4/10, cry30, and cry40 genes were found in 2.5, 3.5, 4.2, 4.2, and < 1%, respectively. Furthermore, several novel haplotypes cry genes were found, and the full-length sequences of three novel cry genes were obtained, which were designated as cry52Ba1, cry54Aa1, cry30Fa1 by the B. thuringiensis Pesticide Crystal Protein Nomenclature Committee, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) assay of 80 strains which did not produce any PCR products indicated that these strains may harbour potentially novel Cry proteins. All these researches mentioned above revealed that the diversity and particularity of cry gene resources from B. thuringiensis strains in Sichuan Basin.

Groups of 24 ducklings were inoculated either intravenously via the vena cruralis, or intraperitoneally with pooled serum containing either 1.6 x 107 or 1.6 x 104 DHBV genomes. One control duck from each group was inoculated with an equal volume of normal duck serum. A sensitive and reproducible real-time polymerase chain reaction assay based on TaqMan technology was developed for the detection and quantitation of DHBV DNA in the serum and liver. DHBAg was observed in the hepatocytes by immunohistochemistry. Histological changes in the liver tissue were also observed. The results demonstrate that ducklings at each time point and in all groups developed detectable viraemia. In each group, DHBV DNA in the liver was at a lower level than in serum and the peak DNA titre was found in serum earlier than in the liver. In the low-dose groups it was always at a lower level than in the high-dose groups. The DHBV replication levels appeared to be directly related to the number of DHBAg-positive hepatocytes. The variation trends of DHBAg-positive hepatocytes were similar in the high-dose groups. Histological changes were associated with liver viral DNA levels. We suggest that this dose and route of inoculation can be used as a model to study acute DHBV infections.

NGVEV antigens could be detected in the gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid organs as early as 24 h p.i. The lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, Harderian gland and spleen), the digestive organs (proventriculus, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, rectum and liver), kidney, myocardium and brain of NGVEV-infected goslings showed extensive evidence of presence of viral antigens. Lymphocytes, macrophages, mesenchymes, endothelial cells, epithelia, superficial and crypt mucosal cells, glandular cells, and fibrocytes served as the principal site for NGVEV localization. The number of positive cells and intensity of fluorescence increased until 15 days p.i. Ultrastructural observation showed that NGVEV particles could be seen from 3 days p.i. onwards.

A new wheat cultivar, Chuannong17 (CN17), carrying the wheat-rye 1BL/1RS translocated chromosome, exhibited "stay green" phenotypes. To determine the genetic behavior and physiological effect, MY11, CN17, Bc(1)F(1), and F(2) populations of MY11/CN17 were grown in the normal wheat growing seasons in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. Analysis of photosynthetic parameters showed that the coordinate increase of net photosynthetic rate (P(n)), stomatal conductance (G(s)) and nag leaf area duration from anthesis to maturation (D(2)) would be the physiological basis of the high yield potential of the 1BL/1RS translocation (CN17). The analysis for morphological indices proposed that the smaller leaf length (L(1)), flag leafwidth (L(w)) and angle between stein and nag leaf (A) would be responsible for the morphological basis of the high yield potential. Analysis of the relationship between the yield and physiological indices Suggested that the coordinate increase Of Source, the partitioning of assimilate from source to sink, and the sink strength was the material basis of the high yield potential. These results afforded some persuasive evidence to support the idea that wheat cultivar CN17 also shows a coordinate relationship between physiology and morphology and is indeed functionally a "stay green" cultivar. The results show that exploitation of a foreign chromosome or chromosome arm such as 1RS to develop "stay green" genotype cultivars in wheat breeding has the potential to increase yield.	[Luo, P.

By employing the Lyapunov-functional method, several new sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the global exponential robust stability of equilibrium point for the reaction diffusion CGNN with delays. These sufficient conditions depend on the reaction-diffusion terms, which is a preeminent feature that distinguishes the present research from the previous research on delayed neural networks with reaction-diffusion. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. Copyright (C) 2009 J. Pan and S. Zhong.

The cDNA of RPS19 was cloned successfully for the first time from the Giant Panda using RT-PCR technology. It was also sequenced, analyzed preliminarily, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The length of cDNA fragment cloned is 469 bp, and it contains an open-reading frame of 438 bp encoding 145 amino acids. Alignment analysis indicates that the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence share a high homology with those of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus by 95.89%, 92.47%, and 93.61%, and 100.00%, 99.31%, and 99.31%, respectively. Topology prediction shows that there is one cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, four protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, one casein kinase II phosphorylation site, one tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, three N-myristoylation sites, one amidation site, and one ribosomal protein S19e signature in the RPS19 protein of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The RPS19 gene was overexpressed in E. coli and expression confirmed by western blotting. The results indicated that the RPS19 gene can be readily expressed in E. coli, and the N-terminally GST-tagged protein was a 42 kDa polypeptide, in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight. The protein obtained could be purified and its function studied.

(L.) Candargy and D. breviaristatum (Lindb. F.) Frederisksen. Twelve of 32 sequences contained the in-frame stop condons were predicted to be pseudogenes, suggesting the high variation of gliadin genes in Dasypyrum genome. There are five D. breviaristatum alpha-gliadin sequences present additional cysteine residues. Four peptides which have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in celiac disease (CD) patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8 were searched to all Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin gene sequences, and we found that the distribution of the epitopes varied between Dasypyrum genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin genes indicated that the sequences from D. breviaristatum displayed higher variation than those from D. villosum, and the genomic differentiation occurred between the two Dasypyrum species. Moreover, the promoter region of the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin genes consisted of four different lengths, indicative of the retrotransposons involving the evolution of the gliadin gene promoters. Based on the specific sequences of the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin promoter region, we produced sequence-characterized amplified region ( SCAR) markers, and localized the Dasypyrum alpha-gliadin genes on chromosome 6 VS. The SCAR markers can be used to target the introgression of Dasypyrum	[Li, Guang-Rong; Liu, Cheng; Zeng, Zi-Xian; Jia, Ju-Qing; Zhang, Tao; Zhou, Jian-Ping; Ren, Zheng-Long; Yang, Zu-Jun] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ren, Zheng-Long] Sichuan Agr Univ, Key Lab Plant Genet & Breeding, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Yang, ZJ (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	yangzujun@uestc.edu.cn	Zhang, Tao/C-5212-2014; Zhang, Tao/L-9336-2013	Zhang, Tao/0000-0002-7897-0205				32	10	12	1	6	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0014-2336			EUPHYTICA	Euphytica	JAN	2009	165	1					155	163		10.1007/s10681-008-9780-8		9	Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture	Agriculture; Plant Sciences	389IU	WOS:000262086900016

Beauv., sequenced line Bd 21) was studied from germination to seed production to assess its potential as a phenotypic model for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cereal crops. Brachypodium and wheat shoot and root development and anatomy were highly similar. Main stem leaves and tillers (side shoots) emerged at the same time in both grasses in four temperature and light environments. Both developed primary and nodal axile roots at similar leaf stages with the same number and arrangement of vascular xylem tracheary elements (XTEs). Brachypodium, unlike wheat, had an elongated a mesocotyl above the seed and developed only one fine primary axile root from the base of the embryo, while wheat generally has three to five. Roots of both grasses could develop first, second and third order branches that emerged from phloem poles. Both developed up to two nodal axile roots from the coleoptile node at leaf 3, more than eight nodal axile roots from stem nodes after leaf 4, and most (97%) of the deepest roots at flowering were branches. In long days Brachypodium flowered 30 days after emergence, and root systems ceased descent 42 cm from the soil surface, such that mature roots can be studied readily in much smaller soil volumes than wheat. Brachypodium has the overwhelming advantage of a small size, fast life cycle and small genome, and is an excellent model to study cereal root system genetics and function, as well as genes for resource partitioning in whole plants.

The Hy. patula C-banding pattern was similar to those of Elymus species, whereas C-banding patterns of the other Hystrix species were similar to those of Leymus species. The results suggest high genetic diversity within Hystrix, and support treating Hy. patula as E. hystrix L., and transferring Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei ssp. duthiei and Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata to the genus Leymus. On comparing C-banding patterns of Elymus species with their diploid ancestors (Pseudoroegneria and Hordeum), there are indications that certain chromosomal re-arrangements had previously occurred in the St and H genomes. Furthermore, a comparison of the C-banding patterns of the Hystrix and Leymus species with the potential diploid progenitors (Psathyrostachys and Thinopyrum) suggests that Hy. coreana and some Leymus species are closely related to the Ns genome of Psathyrostachys, whereas Hy. duthiei ssp. duthiei, Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata and some of the Leymus species have a close relationship with the E genome. The results suggest a multiple origin of the polyploid genera Hystrix and Leymus.

UL35 protein (VP26) is a major capsid protein encoded by the UL35 gene, which is located in the unique long (UL) region of the DPV genome. To investigate the specific roles of VP26, the UL35 gene was amplified from the DPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into pET-32a(+). Methods: The resultant prokaryotic expression vector, pET32a(+)/UL35, includes an amino-terminal His6 as a fusion partner. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells were transformed with the construct and protein expression was subsequently induced by the addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture medium. Protein lysates were submitted to SDS-PAGE to evaluate recombinant protein expression. Results: The band that corresponded to the predicted protein size (33 kDa) was observed on the SDSPAGE gel. The recombinant His6-tagged VP26 fusion protein was expressed at a high level in an insoluble form (inclusion bodies) and constituted about 24% of the total cellular protein. Then, the fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity using single-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin, yielding about 620 mg per liter culture. After purification, New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with purified His6-tagged VP26 in order to raise polyclonal antibody against this recombinant protein. Using the resultant sera, Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was recognized by the polyclonal antibody. Conclusion: Thus, the polyclonal antibody prepared here may serve as a valuable tool to study the functional involvement of VP26 in the DPV life cycle. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Methods: A comparative analysis of the codon usage bias of the 28 herpesviruses was performed by using the CodonW 1.4 program and CUSP (create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). Results: The results showed obvious differences of the synonymous codon usage bias in the 28 herpesviruses indicated by the Codon Adaptation Index, effective number of codons (ENc), and the value of G + C content at the 3rd codon position. The codon usage pattern of the DPV UL35 gene was phylogenetically conserved and similar to that of the UL35-like genes of the avian alpha-herpesvirus, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the 3rd codon position. A cluster analysis of codon usage pattern of the DPV UL35 gene with other reference herpesviruses demonstrated that the codon usage bias of the UL35 genes of the 28 herpesviruses had a very close relation with their gene function. The ENc-plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in the DPV UL35 gene and the 27 reference herpesviruses were constrained by G + C content, while gene length exerted relatively weaker influences. In addition, comparisons of the codon preferences in the UL35 gene of DPV with those of Escherichia coli, yeast and humans revealed that there were 33 codons showing distinct usage differences between the DPV and yeast, and 38 between the DPV and humans, but only 31 between the DPV and E. coli. Therefore, the E. coli system may be more suitable for the expression of the DPV UL35 gene. Conclusion: Together, these results may improve our understanding of the evolution, pathogenesis and functional studies of DPV, as well as contribute significantly to the area of herpesvirus research and possibly studies with other viruses.

We expressed the UL24 gene in Escherichia coli BL21 from a recombinant plasmid pET32a/DEV-UL24 and used the resulting protein to raise antiserum. This antiserum recognized a 38-kDa protein in lysates from infected cells. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the UL24 partial protein was highly expressed after induction by 0.4 m M IPTG at 30 degrees for 6 h. The results of purification revealed that expression protein was more purified using the method of electrophoresis than that of chromatography, but the yield was lower. In immunogenicity analysis, the protein could significantly elicit a specific antibody response in immunized ducklings when compared with the control groups, and the titers against expression protein reached the peak 1: 5,120 (OD(450nm) = 2.5) on day 28 after immunization, while with mean titers of 1: 10,240 (OD(450nm) = 3.37) in DEV commercial attenuated vaccine strain immunized duckling groups. It showed that expression protein is immunogenic in laboratory ducklings.

INFLUENCE OF GLYCININ AND B-CONGLYCININ OF SOYBEAN ON THE PROLIFERATION AND IMMUNE FUNCTION OF SUCKLING PIGLETS PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS IN IN VITRO CULTURE	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						immune function; peripheral blood mononuclear cells; piglet; proliferation; soybean	EARLY-WEANED PIGS; PROTEIN INGESTION; MEAL; IDENTIFICATION; MECHANISMS; PRODUCTS; CALVES	This experiment studied the effect of different level of purified glycinin and beta-conglycinin on proliferation and immune function of peripheral blood monomuclear cells (PBMC) of suckling pigs in vitro. The results indicated that the amount of cells in the group of glycinin and beta-conglycinin increased gradually. The cell 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazolumromide (MTT) absorption at 570 nm wavelength was significantly affected by glycinin and beta-conglycinin concentration (P<0..01). beta-conglycinin had a significant positive correlation with interleukin -2, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and immune globulin A. In summary, glycinin and beta-conglycinin could promote PBMC of suckling pigs to transform and proliferate in vitro culture, beta-conglycinin could promote PBMC of suclking pigs to produce cytokine with IL-2, INF gamma, IL-6 and raise the level of immunoglobulin. The results showed that the antigen of beta-conglycinin was stronger than that of glycinin.

Isolation and chromosomal distribution of a novel Ty1-copia-like sequence from Secale, which enables identification of wheat-Secale africanum introgression lines	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article						FISH; molecular marker; Secale africanum; Ty1-copia; retrotransposon	GENOMIC ORGANIZATION; DNA-SEQUENCES; RETROTRANSPOSONS; CEREALE; DERIVATIVES; RESISTANCE; CHROMATIN; EVOLUTION; SEGMENTS; MARKERS	A repetitive sequence of 411 bp, named pSaO5(411), was identified in the Secale africanum genome (R(a)) by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis of wheat and wheat-S. africanum amphiploids. GenBank BLAST search revealed that the sequence of pSaO5(411) was highly homologous to a part of a Ty1-copia retrotransposon. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses indicated that pSaO5(411) was significantly hybridized to S. africanum chromosomes of a wheat-S. africanum amphiploid, and it was dispersed along the Secale chromosome arms except the terminal regions. Basing on the sequence of pSaO5(411), a pair of sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers were designed, and the resultant SCAR marker was able to target both cultivated rye and the wild Secale species, which also enabled to identify effectively the S. africanum chromatin introduced into the wheat genome.

Differential expression of candidate genes for lignin biosynthesis under drought stress in maize leaves	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article						caffeate O-methyltransferase; cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; drought tolerance; maize	CINNAMYL ALCOHOL-DEHYDROGENASE; ACID-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; WATER-DEFICIT; TROPICAL MAIZE; TOLERANCE; CYTOCHROME-P450; IDENTIFICATION; LIGNIFICATION; IMPROVEMENT; PROTEINS	In order to provide information for the development of molecular selection markers for drought tolerance improvement, the methods of prometric analysis, quantitative real-time PCR and field evaluation were employed for the identification of the differential expression of candidate genes under drought stress in maize. At seventeen, twenty-four and forty-eight hours of polyethylene glycol-simulated drought stress at the seventh leaf stage, leaf samples were collected from two drought-tolerant inbred lines for prometric analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. Fifty-eight proteins out of more than 500 were found in response to drought stress. Three drought-induced spots 2506, 3507 and 4506 showed sequence similarity with cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, cytochrome protein 96A8 and S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthase, respectively. The expression of two key enzymes to lignin biosynthesis was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR among three drought-tolerant and one drought-sensitive inbred lines under drought stress and well-watered control conditions. After a decrease at the beginning of drought stress, the expression of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and caffeate O-methyltransferase recovered at twenty-four hours of the drought stress in the three drought-tolerant lines, but not in the drought-sensitive lines. Leaf lignin content, anthesis-silking interval and grain weight per plant were investigated with six inbred lines of varying drought tolerance under drought stress and well-watered control. Drought tolerance coefficients of these three characters were calculated and the correlation coefficients among these drought tolerance coefficients were estimated. Significant difference in leaf lignin content was found among the inbred lines and in response to drought stress. Close correlations were observed between the drought tolerant coefficients for leaf lignin content and grain weight per plant, and between the drought tolerant coefficients for leaf lignin content and anthesis-silking interval. These results indicate that leaf lignin content is a useful index for evaluation of drought tolerance in maize. Molecular selection markers can be developed on the basis of differential expression of the candidate genes and applied to maize improvement for drought tolerance.

The antimicrobial activity of essential oils/compounds was measured by determining the inhibition of bacterial growth. Thirty-three of 66 oils/compounds exhibited >= 80% inhibition. Seven with the highest potency were further studied. The oils/compounds had MIC(95) values between 167 and 425 mu g ml(-1). Most of them were tolerant to low pH (2.0) and exhibited minor or no inhibition of Lactobacillus isolates from the chicken intestine. When mixed with chicken ileal digesta, the oils/compounds retained their efficacy against C. perfringens, but had little effect on the total number of lactobacilli and anaerobic bacteria in the digesta. Some essential oils/compounds demonstrated good potential in controlling C. perfringens. This study has identified candidates of essential oils/compounds for in vivo studies for the control of necrotic enteritis in chickens.	[Si, W.; Gong, J.; Yu, H.; Tsao, R.; Chambers, J.

However, up to now there is no report regarding the MC1R gene and the potential association of its mutations with coat colors in yak (Poephagus grunniens). In this study, we sequenced the encoding region of the MC1R gene in three yak breeds with completely white (Tianzhu breed) or black coat color (Jiulong and Maiwa breeds). The predicted coding region of the yak MC1R gene resulted of 954 bp, the same to that of the wild-type cattle sequence, with >99% identity. None of the mutation events reported in cattle was found. Comparing the yak obtained sequences, five nucleotide substitutions were detected, which defined three haplotypes (E-Y1, E-Y2, and E-Y3). Of the five mutations, two, characterizing the E-Y1 haplotype, were nonsynonymous substitutions (c.340C>A and c.871G>A) causing amino acid changes located in the first extracellular loop (p.Q114K) and in the seventh transmembrane region (p.A291T). In silico prediction might indicate a functional effect of the latter substitution. However, all three haplotypes were presented in the three yak breeds with relatively consistent frequency distribution, despite of their distinguished coat colors, which suggested that there was no across-breed association between haplotypes or genotypes and black/white phenotypes, at least in the investigated breeds. Other genes may be involved in affecting coat color in the analyzed yaks. Copyright (C) 2009 Shi-Yi Chen et al.

With single land-use sampling, total surface runoff pollution effect cannot be evaluated unless every land usage spot is monitored. Through a new sampling strategy known as mixed stormwater sampling for a street community at discharge outlet adjacent to river, this study assessed the total urban surface runoff pollution effect caused by a variety of land uses and the pollutants washed off from the rain pipe system in the Futian River watershed in Shenzhen City of China. The water quality monitoring indices were COD (chemical oxygen demand), TSS (total suspend solid), TP (total phosphorus), TN (total nitrogen) and BOD (biochemical oxygen demand). The sums of total pollution loads discharged into the river for the four indices of COD, TSS, TN, and TP over all seven rainfall events were very different. The mathematical model for simulating total pollution loads was established from discharge outlet mixed stormwater sampling of total pollution loads on the basis of four parameters: rainfall intensity, total land area, impervious land area, and pervious land area. In order to treat surface runoff pollution, the values of MFF30 (mass first flush ratio) and FF30 (first 30% of runoff volume) can be considered as split-flow control criteria to obtain more effective and economical design of structural BMPs (best management practices) facilities.

G. sinensis is available in form of log-cultivated and sawdust-cultivated fruit bodies, solid-fermented products (SFP) and liquid-fermentation mycelia. Based on these four forms derived by Ganoderma sinensis, methanolic and hot water extracts were prepared and then their antioxidant properties were investigated. Moreover, antioxidant components in both two extracts, including ascorbic acid, tocopherols, beta-carotene and total phenols, were analyzed. Both two extracts from the four forms of G sinensis showed high antioxidant activities of 69.69-99% at 20 mg/ml (mg extract /ml) and low EC(50) values of 0.95-10.00 mg/ml (mg extract/ml). EC(50) values in reducing power of both two extracts from the four forms of G. sinensis were in the range of 0.16-9.23 mg/ml. At 20 mg/ml, both two extracts from the four forms scavenged 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) by 93.83%, except for hot water extracts from SFP being scavenging ability of 71.98%. Both two extracts could scavenge hydroxyl radicals, while the scavenging activity of hot water extracts from mycelia increased to 97.94% at 20 mg/ml. Total phenols in both two extracts from four forms were the major naturally occurring antioxidant components at the range of 19.76-60.36 mg/g. Due to low EC(50) values of the G. sinensis, it could be developed as a new dietary supplement and functional food.

In the present study, two unexpressed 1By genes from Triticum aesitvum L.ssp.yunnanese AS332 and T. aesitvum ssp.tibetanum AS908 were respectively cloned and characterized. The results indicated that both of the silenced 1By genes in AS332 and AS908 were 1By9. In contrast to previously reported mechanisms for silenced genes 1Ax and 1Ay, which was due to the insertion of transposon elements or the presence of premature stop codon via base substitution of C -> T transition in trinucleotides CAA or CAG, the silence of 1By9 genes was caused by premature stop codons via the deletion of base A in trinucleotide CAA, which lead to frameshift mutation and indirectly produced several premature stop codons (TAG) downstream of the coding sequence.

We found the assay to be effective in detecting the virus in China, where it is being used in studies on the epidemiology of the disease. We applied this simple and rapid diagnostic method to the detection of DHV isolates grown in chick and duck embryos and in tissues obtained from infected birds. The assay also proved useful for the differentiation of DVH from the duck plague virus (DPV), Muscovy parvovirus (MPV), gosling parvovirus (GPV), avian influenza virus (AIV/H5N1), Pasteurella multocida (PA/5:A), Riemerella anatipestifer (RA/serotype 1), and Salmonella enteritidis (SE). The limit of the sensitivity of this method for the detection of DHV-1 RNA was 3 pg/10 mu l. As compared to ELISA and virus isolation, the rate of agreement for the detection of experimentally infected livers was 100%; moreover, the RT-PCR method was also capable of detecting DHV-1 RNA from the livers that had been infected and stored at -20 degrees C for 22 years; in contrast, ELISA and virus isolation method could only detect DHV-1 from the livers that had been infected and stored at -20 degrees C for 13 and 11 years, respectively. The rate of positivity in 185 clinically suspected diseased livers subjected to detection by RT-PCR, ELISA, and virus isolation was 89.2%, 69.2%, and 55.7%, respectively, These results indicated that the RT-PCR approach is rapid, sensitive, and reliable for the detection and differentiation of DHV-1 from the other clinical samples and suspected isolates.

The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was verified to encode 190-amino-acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 21 kDa. The cDNA was cloned into pET30 alpha expression vector and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. The enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as xylanase. The isoelectric point and highest activity were 7.5 and 1,600 U/mg, respectively. Like with the T. reesei Xyn2, the highest activity of the recombinant Xyn2 was at 50 degrees C. However, the recombinant enzyme had an improved thermostability and more than 65% of its activity retained after 30 min incubation at 60 degrees C. In addition, the recombinant Xyn2 was active over the range of pH 3.5-7.5 with maximum activity at pH 5.0. Using birchwood xylan, the determined apparent K-m and k(cat) values were 0.15 mg/ml and 119.7 s(-1), respectively. The enzyme was highly specific towards xylans and exhibited very low activity towards cellulosic substrates. Analysis of the products from birchwood xylan degradation confirmed that the enzyme was an endo-xylanase with xylobiose and xylose as the main degradation products. These properties should make the enzyme a suitable applicant in various industrial applications. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Two hundred and forty seven maize landraces from the Southwest Maize Region (SWR) of China preserved in China National Genebank. which are members of a core collection established previously, were assayed to reveal the level of genetic diversity and population structure of the landraces in SWR, by using 53 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A total of 599 alleles (11.30 per locus) and a relatively high level of genetic diversity (0.60) were detected in these 247 landrace accessions, indicating abundant genetic variations of the maize landraces from this region and valuable germplasm which can be used in maize improvement. Revealed by the phylogenetic analysis, the 247 landraces from SWR were divided into three distinct clusters. The results were further confirmed by model-based clustering method and Bayesian approach. Chi-square test revealed that the groups resulting from these statistical analyses agreed quite well with geographical sources of the accessions in SWR.	[Liu, Z. Z.; Guo, R. H.; Wang, R. H.; Shi, Y.

Most accessions have the chromosome number 2n=2x=16. However, three species (S. evansiana, S. przewalskii and S. brevilabra) are tetraploid with a chromosome number of 2n=4x=32. A B-chromosome was observed in S. tricuspis. The basic chromosome number x=8 was inferred for all accessions studied. The chromosome number of all the species was determined for the first time, except for S. evansiana, S. przewalskii, S. flava and S. miltiorrhiza. The chromosomes in this genus are mostly small (0.46-2.94 mu m). The small size of the chromosomes, together with their unclear centromeres, has hampered a detailed karyotype analysis.

The experiment included seven treatments: (1) OM: application of organic manure; (2) 1/2OMN: application of half organic manure plus chemical fertilizer NPK; (3) NPK: balanced application of chemical fertilizer NPK; (4) NP: application of chemical fertilizer NP; (5) PK: application of chemical fertilizer PK; (6) NK: application of chemical fertilizer NK; and (7) CK: unfertilized control. Application of organic manure (OM and 1/2OMN) was more effective for increasing C(T), C(WS), C(MB), C(L), C mineralization, and CMI, as compared with application of chemical fertilizer alone. For the chemical fertilizer treatments, balanced application of NPK (treatment 3) showed higher C(T), C(WS), C(MB), C(L), C mineralization, and CMI than the unbalanced use of fertilizers (treatments 4, 5, and 6). The C storage in the OM and 1/2OMN treatments were increased by 58.0% and 26.6%, respectively, over the NPK treatment, which had 5.9-25.4% more C storage than unbalanced use of fertilizers. The contents of C(WS), C(MB), and C(L) in organic manure treatments (treatments 1 and 2) were increased by 139.7-260.5%, 136.7-225.7%, and 150.0-240.5%, respectively, as compared to the CK treatment. The CMI was found to be a useful index to assess the changes of soil quality induced by soil management practices due to its significant correlation with soil bulk density and C fractions. The OM and 1/2OMN treatments were not a feasible option for farmers, but a feasible option for sequestering soil carbon, especially for the OM treatment. The NPK treatment was important for increasing crop yields, organic material inputs, and soil C fractions, so it could increase the sustainability of cropping system in the North China Plain.

The enzyme showed affinity to con A-sepharose. Although it appeared to be 78 kDa on non-reducing SDS-PAGE and gel-substrate-activity SDS-PAGE, it completely degraded into 31 kDa and 26 kDa sub-units, as well as some small polypeptides on reducing SIDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature of cathepsin L2 for hydrolysis of Z-Phe-Arg-MCA were pH 4.5-5.5 and 45 degrees C, respectively. It was stable at pH 5.5 and below 40 degrees C, but almost inactivated at pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C. Substrate specificity analysis indicated that it could hydrolyse Z-Phe-Arg-MCA but not Z-Arg-Arg-MCA or L-Arg-MCA. Cathepsin L2 was efficiently activated by Cys, DTT and beta-ME, but was completely inhibited by E-64. P2O74- and Cl- have inhibitory effects on its activity. Cathepsin L2 showed a high K-m value of 9.5 mu mol/l, but extremely low K-cat and K-cat/K-m, values of 0.8 s(-1) and 84.2 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively. Except for under optimum conditions (pH 5.0, 35 degrees C), silver carp cathepsin L2 could also hydrolyse myosin heavy chain at softening temperatures ranging from 50 to 60 degrees C and at surimi pH of 6.5.

The results showed that multi-epitope DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided LIP to 80.0% rate of immune protection. The novel immunogenic chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine revealed in this Study provided a new candidate target for IBV vaccine developement. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Isolation and Characterization of a Novel HMW-GS Glu-Dx Allele from Tibet Bread Wheat Landrace	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Glu-D1-1; HMW-GS; sequence analysis	GLUTENIN SUBUNIT GENE; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; ELYTRIGIA-ELONGATA; STORAGE PROTEINS; D-GENOME; QUALITY; IDENTIFICATION; CHROMOSOME-1A	A novel HMW-GS of Dx5** with slightly faster migration rate than that of Dx5, was found in a Tibet bread wheat landrace using SDS-PAGE. Moreover, Dx5** is the subunit with the fastest migration rate in Glu-Dx locus. The gene for this subunit was isolated and its sequence was obtained in the present study. This gene was very similar to Dx5 both in nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence. At the nucleotide sequence level, Dx5** different from Dx5 by the deletion of a 27 by fragment and two nucleotide replacements at position 353(G/C) and 692(C/G), respectively. At the amino acid sequence level, Dx5** different from Dx5 by the deletion of a hexaploid (LGQGQQ) and a tripeptide (GQQ) repetitive motif and two amino acid replacements at position 118(C/S) and 231 (A/G), respectively. These results suggested that the Dx5** was a derivation of Dx5 and was formed by replication slippage. Moreover, the specific cysteine (C) located at the beginning of the repetitive domain of Dx5, which proved to be critical for the end-use quality of wheat flours, was replaced by serine (S) in Dx5**.

The substrate reactions with diethylpyridinecarbamate showed slow-binding inhibition kinetics (K(1) = 0.24 +/- 0.03 mM). Bromoacetate, as another histidine modifier, was also applied in order to study inhibition kinetics. The bromoacetate directly induced the exposures of hydrophobic surfaces following by complete inactivation via ligand binding. For further insights, we predicted the 3D structure of tyrosinase and simulated the docking between tyrosinase and diethylpyridinecarbamate. The docking simulation was shown to the significant binding energy scores (-3.77 kcal/mol by AutoDock4 and -25.26 kcal/mol by Dock6). The computational prediction was informative to elucidate the role of free histidine residues at the active site, which are related to substrate accesibility during tyrosinase catalysis.

Based on the results, the content of oil percentage ranged from 9.10-24.87%, of palmitic acid from 4.08-7.58%, of stearic acid from 1.42-2.53%, of oleic acid from 8.04-32.96% and of linoleic acid from 59.90-86.70%. Differences in oil content and fatty acids among genotypes were significant. Oleic acid was significantly correlated with linoleic acid. All correlation coefficients between oil content and fatty acids were nonsignificant. Most of the correlation coefficients between agronomic traits and fatty acids were insignificant. Some photosynthetic parameters, such as photosynthetic and transpiration rate, were significantly correlated with oil content and some fatty acids. This indicated that safflower breeding with high photosynthetic efficiency would be an effective way for improving the yield and quality of safflower seed oil.	[Guan, L. L.; Wu, W.; Zheng, Y.

Kinetics of Manganese Absorption in Ligated Small Intestinal Segments of Broilers	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						manganese absorption; divalent metal transporter 1; small intestinal loop; broiler	RAT SMALL-INTESTINE; IRON OVERLOAD; BRUSH-BORDER; IN-VITRO; TRANSPORTER; ZINC; MEMBRANE; LOCALIZATION; HOMEOSTASIS; PERMEATION	Two experiments were conducted with 28-day-old male commercial broilers to study mechanisms of Mn absorption and the effect of Mn treatment on divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA levels in ligated segments from different intestinal regions of broilers. The results from experiment 1 showed that the amount of Mn absorption was asymptotic with respect to time within 40 min after perfusion of the duodenal, jejunal, and ileal segments of broilers with 2.18 mmol/L of Mn as MnSO(4). In experiment 2, a kinetic study of Mn absorption was performed with duodenal, jejunal, and ileal loops perfused with solutions containing 0, 0.13, 0.27, 0.54, 1.09, 2.18, 4.37, or 8.74 mmol/L of Mn as MnSO4. Manganese concentrations in perfusates were determined at 5 min after perfusion. In the control group and in the group treated with 2.18 mmol/L Mn as MnSO4, DMT1 mRNA levels of ligated intestinal regions at 30 min after perfusion were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The kinetic curves of Mn absorption showed that Mn absorption was a carrier-mediated process in the duodenum and jejunum. The maximum absorption rate (J(max)) in duodenal segments was greater (P < 0.05) than that in the jejunum (94.08 vs. 81.17 nmol/cm per min). There was no significant difference (P = 0.85) in the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) values between the duodenum and jejunum (3.41 vs. 3.60 mmol/L). In the ileum of Mn-deficient broilers, the most probable mechanism of Mn absorption was a nonsaturable diffusion process, and the diffusive constant (P; means +/- SE) was 2.42 x 10(-2) +/- 5.22 x 10(-4) cm(2)/min. The DMT1 mRNA levels in the duodenum and jejunum of broilers were greater (P < 0.001) than the level in the ileum. The DMT1 mRNA level in the small intestine of broilers in the Mn treatment group decreased significantly (P < 0.001) compared with that of the control. The different mechanisms of Mn absorption found in different intestinal segments suggest that the ileum is the main site of Mn absorption in the small intestine of broilers.	[Bai, S.

Maximizing the Selection Response by Optimal Quantitative Trait Loci Selection and Control of Inbreeding in a Population with Different Lifetimes between Sires and Dams	ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Selection; Optimization; Quantitative Trait Loci; Inbreeding Restriction	MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION; CATTLE BREEDING SCHEMES; IDENTIFIED MAJOR GENE; OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS; OPTIMIZING SELECTION; DYNAMIC SELECTION; PREDEFINED RATE; INFORMATION; IMPROVEMENT; LINKAGE	A rule was developed to constrain the annual rate of inbreeding to a predefined value in a population with different lifetimes between sires and dams, and to maximize the selection response over generations. This rule considers that the animals in a population should be divided into sex-age classes based on the theory of gene flow, and restricts the increase of average inbreeding coefficient for new offspring by limiting the increase of the mean additive genetic relationship for parents selected. The optimization problem of this rule was formulated as a quadratic programming problem. Inputs for the rule were the BLUP estimated breeding values, the additive genetic relationship matrix of all animals, and the long-term contributions of sex-age classes. Outputs were optimal number and contributions of selected animals. In addition, this rule was combined with the optimization of emphasis given to QTL, and further increased the genetic gain over the planning horizon. Stochastic simulations of closed nucleus schemes for pigs were used to investigate the potential advantages obtained from this rule by combining the standard QTL selection, optimal QTL selection and conventional BLUP selection. Results showed that the predefined rates of inbreeding were actually achieved by this rule in three selection strategies. The rule obtained up to 9.23% extra genetic gain over truncation selection at the same rates of inbreeding. The combination of the extended rule and the optimization of emphasis given to QTL allowed substantial increases in selection response at a fixed annual rate of inbreeding, and solved substantially the conflict between short-term and long-term selection response in QTL-assisted selection schemes.

Empirical verification of heterogeneous DNA fragments generated from wheat genome-specific SSR primers. Can. J. Plant Sci. 88: 1065-1071. Due to the high polymorphisms between synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) and common wheat, SHW has been widely used in genetic studies. The transferability of simple sequence repeats (SSR) among common wheat and its donor species, Triticum turgidum and Aegilops fauschii, and their SHW suggested the possibility that some SSRs, specific for a single locus in common wheat, might appear in two or more loci in SHWs. This is an important genetic issue when using synthetic hexaploid wheat population and SSR for mapping. However, it is largely ignored and never empirically well verified. The present study addressed this issue by using the well-studied SSR marker Xgwm261 as an example. The Xgwm261 produced a 192 bp fragment specific to chromosome 2D in common wheat Chinese Spring, but generated a 176 bp fragment in the D genome of Ae. tauschii AS60. Chromosomal location and DNA sequence data revealed that the 176 bp fragment also donated by 213 chromosome of durum wheat Langdon. These results indicated that although a single 176 bp fragment was appeared in synthetic hexaploid wheat Syn-SAU-5 between Langdon and AS60, the fragment contained two different loci, one from chromosome 2D of AS60 and the other from 213 of Langdon which were confirmed by the segregating analysis of SSR Xgwm261 in 185 plants from a F(2) Population between Syn-SAU-5 and Chinese Spring. If Xgwm261 in Syn-SAU-5 was considered as a single locus in genetic analysis, distorted segregation or incorrect conclusions would be yielded. A proposed strategy to avoid this problem is to include SHW's parental T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii in SSR analysis as control for polymorphism detection.

The monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors from the different sources shared very high homology (99.54%). The different alpha-amylase inhibitors, which were determined by the 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of their gene sequences, were investigated. A total of 15 haplotypes were defined by sequence alignment, among which 9 haplotypes were found with only one single sequence sample. Haplotype H02 was found to be the main haplotype occurring in 83 WMAI sequence samples, followed by haplotype H11. The median-joining network for the 15 haplotypes of monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor gene sequences from hexaploid wheats was star like, and at least two subclusters emerged. Furthermore evidence of homologous recombination was found between the haplotypes. The relationship between nucleotide substitutions and the amino acid changes in WMAI of hexaploid wheats was summarized. It was clear that only five polymorphic sites in the nucleotide sequence of WMAI resulted in amino acid variations, and that should be the reason for different structure and function of inhibitors. However, little evidence could be found that there were WMAI genes in the A genome of hexaploid wheat, whereas it could conclude from our results that the A genome diploid wheat had WMAI genes. The overall information on the monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors from wheat and Aegilops strongly support the view that these inhibitors have evolved from a common ancestral gene through duplication and mutation.

Allelic analysis of stripe rust resistance genes on wheat chromosome 2BS	GENOME			English	Article						microsatellite (SSR); stripe rust; wheat; gene mapping	F-SP TRITICI; PUCCINIA-STRIIFORMIS; YELLOW RUST; BREAD WHEAT; LOCATION; IDENTIFICATION; MARKERS; LOCI	Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiormis Westend f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Stripe rust resistance genes Yr27, Yr31. YrSp, YrV23, and YrCN19 on chromosome 2BS confer resistance to some or all Chinese P. striiormis f. sp. tritici races CYR31, CYR32, SY11-4, and SY11-14 in the greenhouse. To screen microsatellite (SSR) markers linked with YrCN19, F(1), F(2), and F(3) populations derived from cross Ch377/CN19 were screened with race CYR32 and 35 SSR primer pairs. Linkage analysis indicated that the single dominant gene YrCN19 in cultivar CN19 was linked with SSR markers Xgwm410, Xgwm374, Xwmc477, and Xgwm382 on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 0.3, 7.9, 12.3, and 21.2 cM, respectively. Crosses of CN19 with wheat lines carrying other genes on chromosome 2B showed that all were located at different loci. YrCN19 is thus different from the other reported Yr genes in chromosomal location and resistance response and was therefore named Yr41. Prospects and strategies of using Yr41 and other Yr genes in wheat improvement for stripe rust resistance are discussed.	[Hu, X. Y.; Ren, Z. L.; Zhang, H.

Development of a real-time PCR method for Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in faeces and its application to quantify intestinal population of obese and lean pigs	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes; lean pigs; obese pigs; real-time PCR	MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES; BACTERIA; ASSAYS; ECOLOGY; GENES	Aims: To investigate whether the relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes divisions in pigs is different between obese and lean animals. Methods and Results: Group-specific primers were designed to target the 16S rRNA genes of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes present in the gut. After the validation of their specificity, these primers were used in the real-time PCR quantification of all Bacteria, Firmicutes division, Bacteroidetes division and Bacteroides spp. in the faecal samples of obese and lean pigs from Banna mini-pig inbred line. The obese pigs had a similar to 61% fewer percentage (based on all Bacteria) of Bacteroidetes division (P = 0.033) and a similar to 56% fewer proportion of Bacteroides spp. (P = 0.047) than the lean pigs. The proportions of both Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides had a negative correlation (P < 0.01) with the body weight. Conclusion: The results suggested that the fat storage might affect the proportion of Bacteroidetes division in the gut. Significance and Impact of the Study: The real-time PCR assays developed for Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes will be useful for investigating the composition of gut microbiota.

Currently, there is no systematic report which investigates the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, and matrilineal genetic structure of these domestic breeds and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Results: In this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) control region segments in 278 domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) from 19 indigenous breeds/populations and 70 wild mallard samples and analyzed them together with the 101 control region sequences from published sources. Fifty-two samples were then sequenced for a cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene fragment to solidify the pattern emerged from the control region sequences. All domestic duck and wild mallard haplotypes were essentially indistinguishable and were clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. There was no geographic differentiation and breed/population-specific distribution of duck lineages. Conclusion: Our results showed that unlike other domesticated farm animals in China such as chicken, cattle, goat, and yak with multiple matrilineal components, the matrilineal pool of Chinese ducks was homogenous.

A complementary log-log (CLL) model was used to analyze the data of the toxicity tests. The results showed that at all test time points, the petroleum ether extract demonstrated the highest activity against the larvae of S. scabiei var. cuniculi, while the activities of the chloroform extract and the acetic ether extract were similar. The activities of both the petroleum ether extract and the chloroform extract against the larvae showed the relation of time and concentration dependent. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of the petroleum ether extract (1.3 mu L/mL) was about three times that of the chloroform extract (4.1 mu L/mL) at 24 h post-treatment. At the concentrations of 500.0 mu L/mL, the median lethal time (LT50) of the petroleum ether extract and the chloroform extract was 8.4 and 9.6 h, respectively.

Here real-time PCR analysis indicated that Meishan pigs had a 34% reduction in percentage Bacteroidetes (P = 0.008) and a significantly lower proportion of Bacteroides (P = 0.013) than Landrace pigs. The percentage of Bacteroidetes or Bacteroides had a negative correlation with body fat (R-2 was 0.63 for Bacteroidetes and 0.57 for Bacteroides, P < 0.05). There was a trend that the percentage of Firmicutes in Meishan pigs was higher in numerical value than in Landrace pigs, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.290) between the two breeds. These suggested that body fat correlated with the percentage of Bacteroidetes division of the gut microbiota in the common pig breeds, and the differences of gut microbial ecology in obese versus lean animals may be analogous.

A total of 990 juvenile Jian carps (initial weight 7.89 +/- 0.04 g) were randomly allocated six groups of each three replicates, feeding isonitrogenous (320 g kg(-1) crude protein) and isolipidic (50 g kg(-1) crude fat) diets containing graded levels of coated L-lysine, with dietary lysine content ranging from 22 to 69 g kg(-1) of protein, respectively, for 80 days. Final weight, protein deposition and protein production value were significantly improved in response to the increasing levels of dietary lysine up to 59 g kg(-1) of protein and remained nearly constant thereafter. Whole-body protein content followed a similar pattern as growth parameters in relation to dietary lysine level. Hepatopancreas and intestine protein content, hepatopancreas index (HSI) and intestine index (ISI) were positively affected by dietary lysine level. The dietary lysine requirement of juvenile Jian carp estimated by broken line analysis based on weight gain was 59 g kg(-1) of protein.

The phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) supported two major clades, one including 21 Leymus species and three Psathyrostachys species, the other with nine Leymus species and four diploid species. The ITS RNA secondary structure of the Leymus species was compared with that of their putative diploid donor. It is suggested that (1) the species from the same areas or neighboring geographic regions are closely related to each other; (2) L. coreanus, L. duthiei, L. duthiei var. longearistatus, and L. komarovii are closely related to other Leymus species, and it is reasonable to transfer these species from the genus Hystrix to Leymus; (3) the ITS sequences of Leymus are evolutionarily distinct; (4) the different Leymus species and different distribution of a species derived their Ns genome from different Psathyrostachys species; and (5) there is a close relationship among Leymus, Pseudoroegneria, Lophopyrum, and Thinopyrum, but it is difficult to presume that the St, E(e), and E(b) genome may be the Xm genome donor of the Leymus species.

Langdon (LDN) and its 10 disomic substitution (LDN DS) lines with Aegilops tauschii accession AS60 without embryo rescue. Selfed seedset rates for hybrids of LDN with AS60 were 36.87% and 49.45% in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Similar or higher selfed seedset rates were observed in the hybrids of ID (1A), ID (I B), 3D (3A), 4D (4B), 7D (7A), and 2D (2B) with AS60, while lower in hybrids of 3D (3B) + 3BL, 5D (5A) + 5AL, 5D (5B) + 5B and 6D (6B) + 6BS with AS60 compared with the hybrids of LDN with AS60. Observation of male gametogenesis showed that meiotic restitution, both first-division restitution (FDR) and single-division meiosis (SDM) resulted in the formation of functional unreduced gametes, which in turn produced seeds. Both euhaploid and aneuhaploid gametes were produced in F, hybrids. This suggested a strategy to simultaneously transfer and locate major genes from the ancestral species T. turgidum or Ae. tauschii. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the aneuhaploid rates between the F, hybrids of LDN and LDN DS lines with AS60, suggesting that meiotic pairing between the two D chromosomes in the hybrids of LDN DS lines with AS60 did not promote the formation of aneuhaploid gametes.

Seventeen chicken-specific microsatellite markers were analyzed for polymorphism. Multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis were used to detect alleles and allele frequencies. All the 17 microsatellite markers were polymorphic. In all, 109 alleles were detected from these polymorphic loci, with a range of 4 to 10 alleles and an average of 6.41 alleles per locus. The frequencies of the 109 alleles ranged from 0.0090 to 0.7559. The average value of polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.644, ranging from 0.357 to 0.859. The average observed heterozygosity of 17 markers was 0.335, and the average expected heterozygosity was 0.681, ranging from 0.370 to 0.876. Ten microsatellite loci were found to be correlated with four egg quality traits and two onsets of lay traits (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Within marker MCW0036, allele 164 had a positive correlation, while allele 174 bad a negative correlation with shell proportion. In MCW0254, allele 114 had positive effect on albumen proportion trait, while alleles 108 and 110 had negative effect. Therefore, genotype 164/164 in MCW0036 and genotype 114/114 in MCW0254 are two potential candidate loci for egg quality traits in Chinese Silkies. Furthermore, genotypes 224/224 and 220/220 in MCW0036 are probably candidate loci for onset of lay traits in these birds. These findings would provide a valuable theoretical basis for marker-assisted selection for the improvement of production performances in Silkies.

A pair of specific primers was designed against the conserved region in the 3D gene that encodes the RNA dependent RNA polymerase with a single conserved TaqMan (TM) probe. The detection limit of this assay was 10 viral genomic copies per reaction and it was highly specific to DHV-1. The rRT-PCR assay was used to determine the distribution and concentration of DHV-1 virulent strain in duck embryos as well as the DHV-1 attenuated vaccine strain in chicken embryos. The results revealed that the copy numbers of DHV-1 reached a peak in duck embryos and chicken embryos at 28-40 h, 44-56 h postinoculation respectively. The comparative tests for ducklings infected artificially and clinical samples between neutralization test and rRT-PCR showed that the positive results of infected samples were the same, while the rRT-PCR method was more sensitive than neutralization test for detection of clinical samples. The rapid, sensitive and specific rRT-PCR assay will be a powerful tool for detection of suspected cases of DHV-1, distribution pattern of DHV-1 in vivo and molecular epidemiological screening.

In this study, an optimized genotyping method using endosperm DNA sampled from single maize seeds was developed, which can be used to replace leaf DNA-based genotyping for both genetic studies and breeding applications. A similar approach is likely to be suitable for all plants with relatively large seeds. Part of the endosperm was excised from imbibed maize seeds and DNA extracted in 96-tube plates using individuals from eight F(2) populations and seven inbreds. The quality of the resultant DNA was functionally comparable to DNA extracted from leaf tissue. Extraction from 30 mg of endosperm yields 3-10 mu g DNA, which is sufficient for analysis of 200-400 agarose-gel PCR-based markers, with the potential for several million chip-based SNP marker analyses. By comparing endosperm DNA and leaf DNA for individuals from an F(2) population, genotyping errors caused by pericarp contamination and hetero-fertilization were found to average 3.8 and 0.6%, respectively. Endosperm sampling did not affect germination rates under controlled conditions, although under normal field conditions the germination rate, seedling establishment, and growth vigor were significantly lower than that of non-sampled controls for some genotypes. However, careful field management can compensate for these effects. Seed DNA-based genotyping lowered costs by 24.6% compared to leaf DNA-based genotyping due to reduced field plantings and labor costs. A substantial advantage of this approach is that it can be used to select desirable genotypes before planting. As such it provides an opportunity for dramatic improvements in the efficiency and selective gain of breeding systems based on optimum combinations of marker-assisted selection and phenotypic selection within and between generations.

The principal components analysis of SPSS was applied to the study of characteristic elements in S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species. Three principal components which accounted for 79. 3% of total variance were extracted from the original data. The first factor accounted for 49. 6% of the total variance, which means that iron, manganese, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead are the characteristic elements in S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species. The results of cluster analysis show that the samples could cluster reasonably into two groups. The samples of S. miltiorrhiza from different regions were classified into one group except S. miltiorrhiza from Zhejiang and S. miltiorrhiza f. alba. The other Salvia species were classified into another group except S. cavaleriei. The S. miltiorrhiza and other Salvia species can be distinguished by this method, whose accuracy of classification is 90%. The cluster analysis based on the contents of trace element in S. miltiorrhiza and its relative species provided a quick, accurate and simple method for authentication of herb Salvia miltiorrhiza.

The results indicated that the DEV dUTPase gene encodes a protein of 477 amino acids, which includes five conserved motifs with a 3-1-2-4-5 arrangement. The codon adaptation index (CAI), effective number of codons (ENC), and GC(3S) values indicated synonymous codon usage bias in the dUTPase gene of herpesviruses, and this synonymous bias was correlated with host evolution. The codon usage patterns of the DEV dUTPase gene were phylogenetically conserved and similar to that of the dUTPase genes of the avian alphaherpesvirus. Although codon usage in each microorganism was different, there were no strain-specific differences among them. Sixty-one codons in the predicted polypeptide, with a strong bias towards A and T at the third codon position, were used. Comparison of the codon usage in the dUTPase gene of different organisms revealed that there were 19 codons showing distinct codon usage differences between the DEV and Escherichia coli dUTPase genes; 16 between the DEV and yeast dUTPase genes; and 15 between the DEV and human dUTPase genes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences between the DEV and yeast dUTPase genes (r = 0.536, P < 0.01). The extent of codon usage bias in the DEV dUTPase gene was highly correlated with the gene expression level, therefore the results may provide useful information for gene classification and functional studies.

We conducted serovar-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SE to detect the genomic DNA of SE in the blood and immune organs, including the bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen, and Harderian gland, from ducklings after oral challenge at different time points. The results showed that SE was consistently detected in all the samples. The Harderian gland and spleen tested positive at 8 hr postinoculation (PI). The organism was detected in the blood, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus at 10 hr PI. The copy number of SE DNA in each tissue reached a peak at 24-36 hr PI. The spleen, blood, and Harderian gland contained high concentrations of SE, whereas the thymus and bursa of Fabricius had low concentrations. SE populations began to decrease and were not detectable at 2 days PI, but they were still present up to 9 days PI in the spleen, without producing any apparent symptoms. To validate these results, the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) technique was used, and the IFA results were similar to those of the fluorescent quantitative-PCR. In conclusion, the results provided insight into the SE life cycle in the immune organs; furthermore, the Harderian gland and spleen were determined to be the primary sites of invasion among the immune organs of normal ducklings after oral SE challenge. This study will help in understanding the pathogenesis of SE infection in vivo and may help in the development of a live Salmonella vaccine in the future.

Loss of plasma membrane integrity became serious by increasing Pb concentration in the medium, 200 mu M Ph + 200 mu M EDTA has alleviated the root cell death. The biomass was significantly affected by high concentration of Pb, and root growth was also affected by EDTA-Pb compared with ionic Pb. Lead accumulation was higher in the samples treated with ionic lead than that of the control. The concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by fluorescence microscopy, which indicates that the Pb stress increased the content of ROS significantly, whereas the EDTA-Pb decreased the burst of H2O2. High Pb concentrations increase the activity of SOD and LOX. The Cu concentration in root increased significantly under Pb and EDTA-Pb treatment, and 200 mu M Pb markedly increased the Fe content in roots. Under ionic Pb condition, the contents of Mg, Ca and K in shoots decreased, whereas they were significantly increased in case of EDTA-Pb. These results suggested that accumulating ecotype of S. alfredii roots were inefficient in uptake of higher concentration of EDTA-chelated Pb for long treatment duration, and that lead toxicity could be alleviated by EDTA.

In the first experiment, 372 wide hybridization combinations were done by crossing 196 T. turgidum lines belonging to seven subspecies with 13 Ae. tauschii accessions. Without embryo rescue and hormone treatment, from the 66220 florets pollinated, 3713 seeds were obtained, with a mean crossability percentages of 5.61% which ranged from 0 to 75%. A lot of hybrid seeds could germinate and produce plants. Out of 372 combinations, 73.12% showed a very low crossability less than 5%, 23.39% showed the crossability of 5-30%, 2.69% showed the crossability of 30-50%, 0.81%, showed high crossability more than 50%, respectively. Among the seven T. turgidum subspecies, there were significant differences in crossability. The ssp. dicoccoides and dicoccon showed the highest crossability, while polonicum the lowest. All the crossability percentages more than 30% were obtained from the crossing of ssp. dicoccoides or dicoccon with Ae. tauschii. In the second experiment, the genetics of crossability was investigated using T turgidum ssp. durum cultivar Langdon and the D-genome disomic substitution lines of Langdon. Compared with the control Langdon, lines 7D(7A) and 4D(4B) showed higher crossability, which suggested that chromosomes 7A and 4B of tetraploid wheat cv. Langdon carried dominant alleles inhibiting crossability with Ae. tauschii. The relationships of present results with previously reported crossability genes of wheat are discussed.	[Zhang, L.

Comparative analysis of the homoeologous pairing effects of phKL gene in common wheat x Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						common wheat; Psathyrostachys huashanica; homoeologous pairing; Ph gene; phKL gene; interspecific hybridization	HYBRIDS; LEVEL; RYE	In the natural Populations of common wheat landrace Kaixianluohanmai, there was a phKL gene which promotes homoeologous pairing of wheat-alien hybrids. In the present study, the effects of phKL gene on crossability and homoeologous pairing of Triticum aestivum x Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo hybrids were comparatively analyzed. The crossability of the hybrid between Sichuan wheat landrace Kaixianluohanmai and P. huashanica was highest in all the hybrid combinations with 3.18%. The hybrids T aestivum (Kaixianklohanmai) x P. huashanica showed a pairing configuration of 21.70 univalents + 2.68 rod bivalents + 0.34 ring bivalents + 0.06 trivalents + 0.02 quadrivalents and 3.54 chiasma per PMC at MI. However, the chiasma in hybrids of CS, CSph1b, CSph2a and CSph2b with P. huashanica was 0.56, 1.90, 0.87 and 0.60, respectively. Compared with the hybrids of CS, CSphlb, CSph2a and CSph2b with P. huashanica, a significant increase in the chiasma of homoeologous pairing was observed in the hybrids of T aestivum (Kaixianluohanmai) x P. huashanica. The effects were shown in the increment of rod bivalents, ring bivalents and trivalents and reduction of univalents. The results indicated that phKL showed a higher effect on promoting homoeologous pairing than ph1 and ph2 in T. aestivum x P. huashanica. The wheat landrace Kaixianluohanmai with phKL gene is probably a more desirable material for alien gene transferring than Ph2-deficiency lines.	[Kang, H. Y.; Zhang, H.

Production of a new wheat cultivar with a different 1B.1R translocation with resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						1BL.1RS translocation; centromere; new wheat cultivar; variation of 1RS	RYE CHROMOSOME TRANSLOCATIONS; SECALE-CEREALE L.; AGRONOMIC PERFORMANCE; 1RS.1BL TRANSLOCATION; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; WINTER-WHEAT; COMMON WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION; MARKERS; 1BL.1RS	Wheat-rye 1BL.1RS translocations have been widely used in wheat breeding programs. A 1BL.1RS translocation wheat line, 91S-23, was developed from it 1R monosomic addition of the rye (Secale cereale) inbred line L155 into wheat (Triticum aestivium) MY 11. A new commercial wheat cultivar, CN 18, which also contained the 1BL.1RS translocation, was derived from the cross MY11 x 91 S-23. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ bybridization (FISH) indicated that the rye centromere wits eliminated from the 1BL.1RS chromosomes of CN18 but not from 91 S-23. Based on the 1RS source and the centromeric structure of the translocation chromosome, CN18 qualifies as a new wheat cultivar possessing a 1BL.1RS translocation. CN18 displayed high yield performance and resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust, whereas 91S-23 wits susceptible to these diseases. The present Study provides it new 1RS resource for wheat improvement.	[Tang, Z. X.; Fu, S. L.; Ren, Z. L.; Zhang, H. Q.; Yan, B. J.; Zhang, H.

The significance of Ae. tauschii HMW-GS genes on bread-making properties of bread wheat has been well documented. Among them, Ae. tauschii HMW-GS Dx5(t)+Dy12(t) was thought as the pair with potentially Value in endowing synthetic hexaploid wheat with good end-use qualities. In this paper, we isolated and sequenced genes Dx5(t) and Dy12(t) from Ae. tauschii accession As63. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that Dy12(t) from Ae. tauschii is more similar to Dy10 rather than Dy12 of bread wheat. The sequence of Dx5(t) in Ae. tauschii accession As63 showed higher similarity to that of Dx5 in bread wheat than others. However, it is notable that Dx5(t) lacked the additional cysteine residue in DO, which is responsible for good bread-making quality in common wheat. Moreover, compared to DO, DO, has ail extra hexpeptide repetitive motif unit (SGQGQQ) as well as five amino acid substitutions.	[Yan, Z. H.; Guo, Z. F.; Liu, D. C.; Dai, S. F.; Wei, Y. M.; Zheng, Y.

The type species of Hystrix, H. patula, clustered with species of Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum, Elymus, Th. bessarabicum and Lo. elongatum, while H. duthiei ssp. duthiei, H. duthiei ssp. longearistata, H. coreana and H. komarovii were grouped with Psathyrostachys and Leymus species. The results indicate that: (i) H. patula is distantly related to other species of Hystrix, but is closely related to Elymus species; (ii) H. duthiei ssp. duthiei, H. duthiei ssp. longearistata, H. coreana and H. komarovii have a close affinity with Psathyrostachys and Leymus species, and H. komarovii might contain the NsXm genome of Leymus; and (iii) the St, H and Ns genomes in Hystrix originate from Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum and Psathyrostachys, respectively, while the Xm in Hystrix and Leymus has a complex relationship with the E or St genomes. According to the genomic system of classification in Tiritceae, it is reasonable to treat Hystrix patula as Elymus hystrix L, and the other species of Hystrix as species of a section of Leymus, Leymus Sect.

The kinetics of the Salmonella Enteritidis genomic DNA loads, the immunohistochemical localization of the bacterial antigens, and the histopathological examination in various tissues were investigated. The results showed that the time course of the appearance of the Salmonella Enteritidis bacterial antigens and the lesions in various tissues was coincident with the bacterial load of the organism in various infected tissues. This suggests that Salmonella Enteritidis loads in systemic organs are closely correlated with the progression of the infection.	[Deng, S. X.; Cheng, A. C.; Wang, M. S.; Yan, B.; Yin, N. C.; Cao, S.

The alcalase enzymatic hydrolysates of beta-conglycinin were fractionated by ultrafiltration, and two main fractions, SP1 (10 kDa) and SP2 (10-20 kDa), were obtained. The effects of these two fractions on the growth, development of epithelial cells, and formation of intercellular tight junctions were tested on an in vitro Caco-2 cell culture system. The inhibitory effects of SP1 and SP2 on the penetration of Salmonella typhimurium into Caco-2 epithelial cells were also examined. The results showed that the addition of >0.05 g/L of SP2 improved epithelial cell growth and that a concentration of 0.5 g/L of SP2 increased intercellular tight junction formation, which resulted in increased of transepithelial monolayer resistance (TER) values. Moreover, a lower S. typhimurium count compared to control was obtained when Caco-2 cells were grown in 0.05 and 0.5 g/L of SP2. These results show that beta-conglycinin hydrolysates play an important role in resisting S. typhimurium penetration into intestinal epithelial cells and that high molecular mass peptides (10-20 kDa) were more effective overall than low molecular mass peptides.

The main results were: (i) Pseudoroegneria gracillima, P. stipifolia, P. cognata and P. strigosa (2x) were in one clade, while P. libanotica, P. tauri and P. spicata (2x) were in the other clade, indicating there are the differentiations of St genome among diploid Pseudoroegneria species; (ii) P. geniculata ssp. scythica, P. geniculata ssp. pruinifera, Elytriga caespitosa and Et. caespitosa ssp. nodosa formed the E(e)St clade with 6-bp indel in ITS1 regions; and (iii) Douglasdeweya wangii, D. deweyi, Agropyron cristatum and A. puberulum comprised the P clade. It is unreasonable to treat P. geniculata ssp. scythica and P. geniculata ssp. pruinifera as the subspecies of P. geniculata, and they should be transferred to a new genus Trichopyrum, which consists of species with E(e) St genomes. It is also suggested that one of the diploid donor of D. wangii and D. deweyi is derived from Agropyron species, and it is reasonable to treat tetraploid species with StP genomes into Douglasdeweya.

All of the CSph2b x P. huashanica hybrid seeds germinate well. Backcross derivatives were successfully obtained. F(1) hybrids were verified as intergeneric hybrids on the basis of morphological observation, cytological and molecular analyses. The results obviously showed the phenotypes of the hybrid plants were intermediate between bread wheat and P. huashanica. Chromosome pairing at MI of PMCs in the F(1) hybrid plants was low, and the meiotic configuration was 26.80 I + 0.60 II (rod). Cytological analysis of the hybrid plants revealed the ineffectiveness of the ph2b gene on chromosome association between the parents.

Despite its economic importance, there is a lack of information on the genetic diversity within and among populations. In order to assess DNA molecular genetic variations and formulate appropriate strategies for conservation and utilization of wild orchardgrass genetic resources available in China, mainly amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) DNA profiling method was used to detect the genetic diversity and relatedness among 32 wild orchardgrass accessions collected in China and two in the USA. Using nine primer combinations, 400 DNA fragments were amplified, among which 322 (80.50%) were polymorphic. Genetic similarity coefficients (GSC) for 34 accessions ranged from 0.69 to 0.93, with an average of 0.81. Further examination of the different components of genetic variation by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that larger proportions of variability existed within ploidy levels (87.98%) and geographical regions (85.65%). Cluster analysis using the UPGMA approach seperated the studied accessions into six major clusters. On the basis of principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) on the genetic characteristics, the studied accessions could be grouped into three main clusters. All tetraploid (2n=4x=28) accessions originating from different regions were grouped into the same cluster whereas the diploid (2n=2x=14) accessions were grouped into other two clusters associated with their geographical distributions. The results revealed by AFLP markers were concordant with the morphological variability, agronomic traits and karyotype. The results also showed that comprehensive germplasm collection in major geographic regions and exploitation of the existing variation are required to widen the genetic base and sample the full extent of the available variation in breeding strategies for orchardgrass.

These LMW prolamine gene sequences from C. delileana had the similar typical primary structures to the known LMW glutenin subunit genes in wheat and its related species. The 5' flanking region of the LMW-GSK1 contained two cis-elements EM (5'-TGTAAAGT-3') and GLM (5'-GGCGAGTCAT-3'). The deduced amino-acid sequence of the LMW-GSK1 consisted of a conserved signal peptide with 20 residues, a N-terminal region with 15 residues, a repetitive domain with 80 residues and a C-terminal region with 182 residues. Several in-frame stop codons were found in the coding sequences of LMW-GSK2 and LMW-GSK4, indicating that the LMW-GSK2 and LMW-GSK4 could be the putative pseudogenes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that LMW-GSK1, LMW-GSK2 and LMW-GSK4 were closely related to the LMW-GS genes from A, D and R genomes, while LMW-GSK3 could be clustered together with X03103 from H genome. It was the first time that the coding genes of LMW prolamines on K genome of C. delileana were characterized.

Study on association of single nucleotide polymorphism of CAPN1 gene with muscle fibre and carcass traits in quality chicken populations	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS			English	Article						breast muscle fibre; CAPN1 gene; carcass traits; chicken; polymorphism	MEAT TENDERNESS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PROTEASE; CALPAIN; BROILER; CALPASTATIN; TISSUE; CATTLE	This study was aimed at investigating the effect of the calpain 1 (CAPN1) gene on carcass and meat quality traits in eight meat-type chicken populations, including five pure lines (developed from Chinese local breeds) and three cross-breeds. Primer pairs for the Coding Sequence (CDS) region in CAPN1 were designed from the chicken genomic sequence database. Polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; C2546T, G3535A and C7198A) were detected among individuals in each population. The associations of their haplotypes (H1 = CGA, H2 = CGC, H3 = CAA, H4 = CAC, H5 = TGA and H7 = TAA) with chicken breast muscle fibre and carcass traits were analysed. Results showed that the haplotypes were associated with live weight (LW), carcass weight (CW), breast muscle weight (BMW) and leg muscle weight (LMW) (p < 0.05), and were also related to eviscerated percentage (%EP) and breast muscle fibre density (p < 0.01). H1H3 haplotype was dominant for LW, CW and BMW; H1H5 haplotype was dominant for EP; H3H4 haplotype was dominant for LMW and H1H1 haplotype was dominant for BFD. It was concluded that the CAPN1 gene may be a major gene affecting meat quality traits of chicken or it is linked with the major gene. H1H3, H1H5 and H3H4 were the most advantageous haplotypes for carcass traits whereas H1H1 was the positive haplotype for breast muscle fibre trait.

Obese and lean-type pig breeds show obvious differences in adipose deposition; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotypic variation remains unclear. We used pathway-focused oligo microarray studies to examine the expression changes of 140 genes associated with meat quality and carcass traits in backfat at five growth stages (1-5 months) of Landrace (a leaner, Western breed) and Taihu pigs (a fatty, indigenous, Chinese breed). Variance analysis (ANOVA) revealed that differences in the expression of 25 genes in Landrace pigs were significant (FDR adjusted permutation, P < 0.05) among 5 growth stages. Gene class test (GCT) indicated that a gene-group was very significant between 2 pig breeds across 5 growth stages (P (ErmineJ)< 0.01), which consisted of 23 genes encoding enzymes and regulatory proteins associated with lipid and steroid metabolism. These findings suggest that the distinct differences in fat deposition ability between Landrace and Taihu pigs may closely correlate with the expression changes of these genes. Clustering analysis revealed a very high level of significance (FDR adjusted, P < 0.01) for 2 gene expression patterns in Landrace pigs and a high level of significance (FDR adjusted, P < 0.05) for 2 gene expression patterns in Taihu pigs. Also, expression patterns of genes were more diversified in Taihu pigs than those in Landrace pigs, which suggests that the regulatory mechanism of micro-effect polygenes in adipocytes may be more complex in Taihu pigs than in Landrace pigs. Based on a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were reconstructed from time-series data for each pig breed. These two GRNs initially revealed the distinct differences in physiological and biochemical aspects of adipose metabolism between the two pig breeds; from these results, some potential key genes could be identified. Quantitative, real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray data for five modulated genes, and a good correlation between the two measures of expression was observed for both 2 pig breeds at different growth stages (R=0.874 +/- 0.071). These results highlight some possible candidate genes for porcine fat characteristics and provide some data on which to base further study of the molecular basis of adipose metabolism.

A total of 24 finishing pigs (60.05 +/- .24 kg; 12 gilts and 12 barrows) were assigned randomly to one of the three dietary groups, with four pens/group (per pen: one gilt, one barrow). The pigs were fed a basal diet containing 0 (control), 70, or 140 mg/kg cysteamine feed additive (containing 28% cysteamine hydrochloride) for 47 days. The results indicated that CS supplementation (70 mg/kg) increased the average daily gain (ADG) and serum IGF-I level, upregulated mRNA levels of GHR and IGF-I (liver, stomach, muscle), IGF-IR (stomach, duodenum, muscle), and IGFBP-3 (liver) but downregulated IGFBP-3 (stomach, duodenum, muscle). CS supplementation (70 mg/kg) did not affect mRNA levels of GHR and IGF-I (duodenum), IGF-IR (liver), and IR (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle). CS supplementation (140 mg/kg) downregulated GHR (duodenum), IGF-1, and IGF-IR mRNA (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle) but upregulated IGFBP-3 and IR mRNA (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle) and did not affect ADG and serum IGF-I concentration. Collectively, the results suggest that dietary CS supplementation modulates the growth rate, serum IGF-I concentrations, and the gene expression of GHR, IGF-1, IGR-IR, IGFBP-3, and IR in a dose-dependent manner. CS supplementation has tissue-specific regulation of GHR, IGF-1, IGF-IR, and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels. Moreover, the results also imply the possible physiologic role of the GH-IGF axis in mediating the dietary CS supplementation-supported growth of finishing pigs.

POACEAE; MICROSATELLITE VARIABILITY; MARGINAL POPULATIONS; ALASKANUS COMPLEX; RAPD VARIATION; PLANTS; DIFFERENTIATION; TRACHYCAULUS; CONSERVATION; POLYMORPHISM	Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure in eight populations of Elymus sibiricus L. from the southeast of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. Of the 100 primers screened, 13 produced highly reproducible ISSR bands. Using these primers, 193 discernible DNA fragments were generated with 149 (77.2%) being polymorphic, indicating considerable genetic variation at the species level. In contrast, there were relatively low levels of polymorphism at the population level with the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) ranging from 44.04 to 54.92%. The mean gene diversity (HE) was estimated to be 0.181 within populations (range 0.1640-200), and 0.274 at the species level. A high level of genetic differentiation among populations was detected based on Nei's genetic diversity analysis (33.1%), Shannon's index analysis (34.5%), Bayesian method (33.2%) and AMOVA analysis (42.5%). No significant statistical differences (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P=0.08) in ISSR variation were found between the sample collection regions. However, among populations (42.5% of the variance) and within populations (57.5% of the variance), there were significant differences (P<0.001). Populations shared high levels of genetic identity. This pattern of genetic variation was different from that for most of inbreeding Triticeae species reported. In addition, a geographical pattern of population differentiation, where the populations from south and north of sampling sites were clearly separated from each other, was revealed by both the cluster and principal coordinates analyses. Generally, the result of this study indicates that E sibiricus contains high molecular variation in its populations. The implications of these results for the conservation of the species are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on amino acid sequences, the primary structure of the 75K gamma-secalin subunits was demonstrated, which was composed of four main structural regions: (a) a conservative 19 amino acids signal peptide, (b) a steady short N-terminal region of 12 amino acids containing a cysteine residue, (c) a repetitive domain, which began with the conservative tetrapeptides PQ(3) and was rich in glutamine and proline. PFPQ(1-2)(PQQ)(1-2) was the core repeat motif in the repetitive region. Besides amino acid substitutions, this region showed variations in length due to the insertion and deletion events. In the repetitive region of EF432549 (Secale strictum), there were two octapeptides (PFPQQPQQ and PVPQQSQQ) insertions. On the contrary, deletion events of two residues (QT) took place in EF432546 (Secale sylvestre). Accounting for the amino acid replacement, an extra cysteine residue appeared in the repetitive region of EF432546, which did not exist in other genes, and (d) a conserved 143 amino acids C-terminal domain including eight cysteine residues. The implications of the results for quality improvement are discussed.

Malachobatus	CHROMOSOME-NUMBERS; CYTOLOGY	Rubus is a taxonomically difficult group and cytological data are expected hopefully to gain insight into the relationships of the genus. In this study the chromosome numbers and karyotypes of 18 taxa from sect. Idaeobatus and 10 taxa from sect. Malachobatus were investigated. Among them, the chromosome numbers of 10 taxa and karyotypes of 26 taxa were reported for the first time and mixoploidy was observed new in the genus. The chromosomes are small in size with a length of less than 3 mu m and metacentric (about 90%) or submetacentric. All taxa have karyotypes of "1A" except R. cockburnianus, R. innominatus and R. ellipticus var. Obcordatus, which have karyotypes of "2A". No aneuploids were found in all the 28 taxa studied. Plants of sect. Idaeobatus have diploids with 2n=2x= 14, except R. idaeopsis (2n=3x=21) and R. parvifolius (A mixoploid of 2n=2x=14 and 2n=4x=28). However, plants of sect. Malachobatus have tetraploids with 2n=4x=28, except for R. buergeri with 2n=8x=56. In addition, conspicuous karyotype differences existed within the 18 taxa belonging to I I of 7 subsections in sect. Idaeobatus, and the differences between some species within subsections are greater than that between subsections, while uniform karyotypes within subsections and variable karyotypes between subsections were observed in six of 13 subsections in sect. Malachobatus represented by 10 taxa. Systematic values of the cytological data were discussed for some cases when applicable to the two sections.

The fusion phytase phyA(m)-phyCs gene was successfully overexpressed in P. pastoris as an active and extracellular phytase. The yield of total extracellular fusion phytase activity is (25.4 +/- 0.53) U/ml at the flask scale and (159.1 +/- 2.92) U/ml for high cell-density fermentation, respectively. Purified fusion phytase exhibits an optimal temperature at 55 C and an optimal pH at 5.5 similar to 6.0 and its relative activity remains at a relatively high level of above 70% in the range of pH 2.0 to 7.0. About 51% to 63% of its original activity remains after incubation at 75 degrees C to 95 degrees C for 10 min. Due to heavy glycosylation, the expressed fusion phytase shows a broad and diffuse band in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). After deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H (EndoH(f)), the enzyme has an apparent molecular size of 95 kDa. The characterization of the fusion phytase was compared with those of phyCs and phyA(m).

IVF mouse embryos were vitrified by the open-pulled straw (OPS) method. After warming, embryos were morphologically evaluated and assessed by their development to blastocysts, hatched blastocysts or term. The results showed that a high proportion (93.3-100.0%) of vitrified embryos at all developmental stages were morphologically normal after recovery. The developmental rate of vitrified 1-cell embryos to blastocyst (40.0%) or hatched blastocyst (32.7%) or term (9.3%) was significantly lower than that from other stages (P < 0.05). Vitrified embryos from 2-cell to early blastocyst stage showed similar blastocyst (71.8-89.5%) and hatched blastocyst rates (61.1-69.6%) and could develop to term without a significant loss of survival compared with those of fresh embryos (P > 0.05). Vitrified 2-cell embryos showed the highest survival rate in vivo (50.6%, 88/174), compared with that from other stages (9.3-30.5%, P < 0.05). The data demonstrate that the OPS method is suitable for the cryopreservation of IVF mouse embryos from 2-cell stage to early blastocyst stage without a significant loss of survival. Embryos at the 2-cell stage had the best tolerance for cryopreservation in the present study.

Many viruses encode virus-specific dUTPase, which plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the viral DNA both by reducing the dUTP levels and by providing the substrate for the thymidylate synthase. A 1344-bp gene of duck enteritis virus (DEV) homologous to herpesviral dUTPase was first reported in this paper. The gene encodes a protein of 477 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 49.7 kDa. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that DEV dUTPase was quite similar to other identified herpesviral dUTPase and functioned as a homotrimer. The five conserved motifs of DEV dUTPase with 3-1-2-4-5 arrangement have been recognized, and the phylogenetic analysis showed that DEV dUTPase was genetically close to the avian herpesvirus. Furthermore, RNA dot blot, western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the enzyme was expressed at early and late stages after infection. Immunofluorescence also confirmed that DEV dUTPase localized in the cytoplasm of DEV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts as early as 4 hr postinfection (hpi). Later, the enzyme transferred from cytoplasm to nucleus at 8 hpi, and then reached its expression peak at 12 hpi, both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The results suggested that the DEV dUTPase gene might be an early viral gene in DEV vitro infection and contribute to ensuring the fidelity of genome replication.

The results show that the viral levels of DEV in systemic organs have a close correlation with the progression of disease. The rapid dissemination and active replication of virulent DEV in multiple systemic organs at the early phase of acute infection accelerate the progression of disease. The levels of viral DNA increase sharply soon after developed clinical signs of disease, and the extent of increase and the magnitude of DEV DNA load in various tissues of ducklings after the exhibition of clinical signs may be a critical determinant of the outcome of DEV infection. The relatively high levels of DEV in bursa and small intestine tissues of dead ducklings most likely reflect the abundance of target epithelial and lymphoid cells in these tissues, which therefore play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute DVE and manifest as severe tissue lesions on the bursa and small intestine.

The results indicate that species of Kengyilia had close affinities to species of Douglasdeweya and Agropyron. The species in Kengyilia was identified as two subgroups with regard to geographic distribution, indicating that species from the same distribution had a closer phylogenetic relationship. The genus Kengyilia was found as a ligament-group between Roegneria and Agropyron. The ITS sequence is a useful tool for studying the phylogeny of closely related species.

Nine SSR markers amplified rye-specific fragments whose sizes ranged from 471 bp to 1089 bp. These fragments contain regulatory elements and (or) promoters. Some of these fragments were amplified from all 24 progenies, while others were amplified from a subset of the progenies. The disappearance of rye-specific fragments from some progenies was caused by sequence elimination or DNA modification. Marker Xgwm320 amplified a new fragment (403 bp), a rye-specific tandem repeat, from some of the progenies. Twenty-eight SSR markers displayed microsatellite variation in progenies derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'Jinzhou-heimai', but none of the 150 SSR markers displayed microsatellite variation in the progenies derived from the other three combinations. FISH signals of pSc200 were eliminated from one telomere/subtelomere of 4 chromosomes of 'Kustro' during allopolyploidization and expanded in amphiploids derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'AR106BONE'. Thus, allopolyploidization in wheat-rye can be accompanied by rapid variation of tandem repeats, regulatory elements, and promoter regions. The alterations of repetitive sequence pSc200 indicate coordination between the constituent genomes of the newly formed amphiploids. Different genetic backgrounds of parents appear to affect genome changes during allopolyploidization.

To clarify the taxonomic status of this genus, the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) of the rRNA gene was investigated for the first time on 6 isolates obtained from rabbits and swine from China. The length of ITS-2 was 361bp in these isolates, and the base composition was biased, averaging 60.9 % A+T. A total of 4.16 % (15/361) nucleotide positions were variable. There were no deletions or insertions in nucleotide sequences. Homology analyses indicated that the identity levels of nucleotide of ITS-2 among the 6 isolates ranged from 96.9 % to 99.7 %. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Sarcoptes scabiei (De Geer) isolates from China and other locations belonged to a single, heterogenous species.

In vitro parameters of neutral detergent fibre digestibility (NDFD), volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ammonia nitrogen (NH(3)-N) were used as evaluation parameters. Each MF consisted of alfalfa meal, bio-chemical treated maize stover and grain mix. The relative proportions of alfalfa meal:bio-chemical treated maize stover:grain mix (dry matter (DM) basis) was 10:50:40 (MF1), 20:40:40 (MF2), 30:30:40 (MF3), 10:45:45 (MF4), 20:35:45 (MF5), 30:25:45 (MF6), 10:40:50 (MF7), 20:30:50 (MF8), 30:20:50 (MF9), 10:35:55 (MF10), 20:25:55 (MF11), 30:15:55 (MF12), 10:30:60 (MF13), 20:20:60 (MF14) and 30:10:60 (MF15). Values of each observed parameter were differed significantly among the tested feeds (p<0.05). Greater NDFD, AA, PA, BA and NH(3)-N were observed for the MF9, MF14, MF2, MF11 and MF7 respectively, which indicated the associative effects between feeds constituents (e.g. concentrate, bio-chemical treated maize straw and alfalfa powder). The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of MF7 was the highest in the 15 mixed feeds, which indicated that the incubation effectiveness of MF7 was the best among the 15 mixed feeds when its roughage to concentrate ratio was 500 to 500 g/kg with roughage constituents of 400 g/kg bio-chemical treated maize stover and 100 g/kg alfalfa meal. It was concluded that fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is a useful tool for comprehensively considering the in vitro parameters of mixed feeds to rank the nutritive quality in terms of nutrient supply potential.

Sixty male Canadian Landrace x Chinese Taihu piglets were assigned to an intramuscular injection of 0 (control), 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg. All pigs were fed with the same diet (crude protein: 239.8 g/kg, digestible energy: 14.28 MJ/kg) at ad libitum intake. Protein turnover was determined on the 22nd day with a three-pool model by using a single-dosage, end-product analysis method with (15) N-glycine as a tracer. Injection of the pGHRH gene plasmid increased the piglets' growth rate, altered feed intake and decreased feed conversion ratio. It increased plasma growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and somatostatin but reduced serum urea and triglyceride. it reduced the urinary nitrogen excretion and led to higher nitrogen retention as well as the efficiencies of nitrogen retention and digestible N utilization. It increased the rates of protein synthesis, protein breakdown and net protein gain. Excretion of endogenous urinary nitrogen was reduced and nitrogen reutilization rate was improved. Conclusions: Injection of the pGHRH gene plasmid in skeletal muscle stimulated GHRH, GH and IGF-I excretion in piglets. Protein deposition was increased by an increase in protein synthesis and a smaller increase in protein breakdown, which was accompanied by reducing amino acid oxidation and increasing nitrogen reutilization.

To identify the characteristic soil layers in an urban environment, 224 soil layers of 36 in-situ pedons were examined and described in urban and suburban Nanjing, and 27 variables were extracted for multivariate analysis. Three groups and six subdivisions were identified by TwoStep cluster analysis combined with hierarchical cluster analysis based on factor scores. Soil forming factors and soil forming processes could be interpreted from the principal component analysis (PCA) of variables, cluster analysis of soil layers, and discriminant analysis of soil layer groups and their subdivisions. Parent materials, moisture regimes, organic matter accumulation, and especially nutrient accumulation were the main causes of characteristic soil layer formations. The numerical approaches used in this study were useful tools for characteristic soil layer identification of urban soils.

Different degrees of expression variations were observed in the plant after haploidization. The main results are as follows: (1) after haploidization, the ratio of the sensitive loci was 2.47% of the total loci designed on chip. Those loci were randomly distributed on the 12 pairs of rice chromosomes and the activated loci were more than the silenced ones. (2) Gene clusters on chromosome were observed for 33 sequences. (3) GoPipe function classification for 575 sensitive loci revealed an involvement in the biological process, cell component and molecular function. (4) RT-PCR generally validated the result from microarray with a coincidence rate of 83.78%.

In this study, novel nebulizer-compatible solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for pulmonary drug delivery of insulin were developed by reverse micelle-double emulsion method. The influences of the amount of sodium cholate (SC) and soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) on the deposition properties of the nanoparticles were investigated. Under optimal conditions, the entrapment delivery (ED), respirable fraction (RF) and nebulization efficiency (NE) of SLNs could reach 96.53, 82.11 and 63.28%, respectively, and Ins-SLNs remained stable during nebulization. Fasting plasma glucose level was reduced to 39.41% and insulin level was increased to approximately 170 mu IU/ml 4 h after pulmonary administration of 20 IU/kg Ins-SLNs. A pharmacological bioavailability of 24.33% and a relative bioavailability of 22.33% were obtained using subcutaneous injection as a reference. Incorporating fluorescent-labelled insulin into SLNs, we found that the SLNs were effectively and homogeneously distributed in the lung alveoli. These findings suggested that SLNs could be used as a potential carrier for pulmonary delivery of insulin by improving both in vitro and in vivo stability as well as prolonging hypoglycemic effect, which inevitably resulted in enhanced bioavailability.

METHODS: Five methods of extracting bacterial DNA, including Tris-EDTA buffer, chelex-100, ultrapure water, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10% Triton-100 with and without sonication, were compared with the commercial fecal DNA extraction kit method, which is considered as the gold standard for DNA extraction. The comparison was based on the yield and purity of DNA and the indexes of the structure and property of micro-organisms that were reflected by ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: The yield and purity of DNA obtained by the chelex method was similar to that obtained with the fecal DNA kit. The ERIC-PCR results obtained for the DNA extracted by the chelex method and those obtained for DNA extracted with the fecal DNA kit were basically the same. CONCLUSION: The chelex method is recommended for ERIC-PCR experiments in view of its simplicity and cost-effectiveness; and it is suitable for extracting total DNA from intestinal micro-organ isms, particularly for handling a large number of samples.

A total of 60 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), which were all infected with gastrointestinal nematodes, were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (selamectin, ivermectin and mebendazole) and one control group. Fecal samples for determining nematode egg counts were collected pre- and post-treatment. All treatments resulted in decrease in the number of eggs per gram (EPG) in the post-treatment sample compared with the pre-treatment sample. Reductions of mean egg counts from day -3 levels were 99.4% for selamectin, 99.2% for ivermectin and 99.4% for mebendazole on trial day 11, respectively. However, no significant difference was found among treatment groups. According to the data demonstrating a similar efficacy in selamectin-, ivermectin- and mebendazole-treated rhesus macaques, it was effective and convenient to apply either selamectin and ivermectin or mebendazole in rotation on the local conditions.

Surgical transfer of blue fox embryos was investigated as a means to increase the population fox and also as a possible means to conserve endangered canine species. The animals were chosen on the basis of synchrony in natural oestrus. During the reproductive season of blue fox, 59 embryos were flushed from 6 farmed donors 9-11 days after the first insemination, and 53 embryos were transferred surgically into the uteri of the 6 paired recipients with natural synchronized oestrous. Two of the recipients littered 46-49 days after embryo transfer; one gave birth to 7 pups and the other I pup.

At the same time, the nano-TiO(2) was utilized with the baker's yeast biomass as a composite adsorbent to adsorb the Cu ions in the artificial aqueous solution. The investigation showed that the composite adsorbent had a fine adsorption efficiency. The TiO(2) in the composite adsorbent could cooperate well with baker's yeast to improve the adsorbing capability of Cu(2+) under the following experimental conditions as well: a quantity of composite adsorbent of 5 g.L(-1), pH >= 4.0, an adsorption time of 40 min and an initial concentration of Cu ions of 10 mg.L(-1). In addition, the results of measurements, obtained with a scanning electron microscope, an infrared spectrophotometer and a Zeta potential analyzer, revealed that the baker's yeast and nano-TiO(2) produced the composite adsorbent through coordination and hydrogen bonds in particular, etc. The stability of the composite adsorbent and the amount of titania loaded were largely dependent on the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution.

The DLR detected at 20 days to 62 days after transplanting under alkaline stress showed continuous normal or near normal distributions in F(3) lines, which was the quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. The DSR showed a continuous distribution with 3 or 4 peaks and was the quantitative trait controlled by main and multiple genes when rice was grown for 62 days after transplanting under alkaline stress. Thirteen QTLs associated with DLR were detected at 20 days to 62 days after transplanting under alkaline stress. Among these, qDLR9-2 located in RM5786-RM160 on chromosome 9 was detected at 34 days, 41 days, 48 days, 55 days, and 62 days, respectively; qDLR4 located in RM3524-RM3866 on chromosome 4 was detected at 34 days, 41 days, and 48 days, respectively; qDLR7-1 located in RM3859-RM320 on chromosome 7 was detected at 20 days and 27 days; and qDLR6-2 in RM1340-RM5957 on chromosome 6 was detected at 55 days and 62 days, respectively. The alleles of both qDLR9-2 and qDLR4 were derived from alkaline sensitive parent "Gaochan106". The alleles of both qDLR7-1 and qDLR6-2 were from alkaline tolerant parent Changbai 9. These gene actions showed dominance and over dominance primarily. Six QTLs associated with DSR were detected at 62 days after transplanting under alkaline stress. Among these, qDSR6-2 and qDSR8 were located in RM1340-RM5957 on chromosome 6 and in RM3752-RM404 on chromosome 8, respectively, which were associated with DSR and accounted for 20.32% and 18.86% of the observed phenotypic variation, respectively; qDSR11-2 and qDSR11-3 were located in RM536-RM479 and RM2596-RM286 on chromosome 11, respectively, which were associated with DSR explaining 25.85% and 15.41% of the observed phenotypic variation, respectively. The marker flanking distances of these QTLs were quite far except that of qDSR6-2, which should be researched further.

Characterization of protein fractions and amino acids in ensiled alfalfa treated with different chemical additives	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						protein fractions; amino acids; alfalfa silage; chemical additives	EVALUATING CATTLE DIETS; FORMIC-ACID; SILAGE ADDITIVES; NET CARBOHYDRATE; DRY-MATTER; NITROGEN; PROTEOLYSIS; FORAGE; RUMEN; DEGRADATION	Formic acid, formaldehyde, tannic acid or mixtures of two were studied on their effects on ensiled alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) amino acids and N fractions by the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). The alfalfa forage was a second cut and was wilted to a mean over-dry dry matter (DM) content of 330 g/kg. All silages were prepared as mini-silos using 100 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes (50 g) on a small laboratory- scale, with the additives added in 20 ml aliquots/kg herbage fresh weight (FW). After 35 d of ensiling, most of forage true protein was converted to fraction A and all of the added additives reduced fraction A content in the ensiled forages (P<0.05). The content of fraction B(1) in all of the additive-treated silages was higher (P<0.05) than that in control silage. Large proportions of true protein in the tannic acid/formaldehyde- and formic acid/formaldehyde-treated silages were fractions B(2) and B(3), respectively. No difference was observed on fraction C content between the control silage and silages treated with additives except for the formaldehyde or tannic acid-treated silages. Amino acids were well preserved in additive-treated silages compared with the control silage. Concentration of total amino acid was higher in formic acid-treated silages than that in the control and the other additive-treated silages (P<0.05). The pattern of changes in individual amino acid in all of the silages indicated that branched chain amino acids and methionine were relatively well preserved during fermentation but the basic and acidic amino acids were not.

METHODS: The apoptosis of duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) induced by NGVEV was investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and fluorescence microscope after the cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). RESULTS: By staining cells with a combination of fluorescein annexin V-FITC and PI, it is possible to distinguish and quantitatively analyze non-apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC negative/PI negative), early apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC positive/PI negative), late apoptotic/necrotic cells (Annexin V-FITC positive/PI positive) and dead cells (Annexin V-FITC negative/PI positive) through flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with the incubation time and reached a maximum at 120 h after infection, while the percentage of non-apoptotic cells decreased. CONCLUSION: NGVEV can induce the infected DEF cells to undergo apoptosis and the apoptosis occurs prior to necrosis. (C) 2008 WJG. All rights reserved.

Obese and lean type pig breeds show obvious differences in muscle growth and adipose deposition; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotypic variation remains unknown. We used pathway-focused oligo microarray studies to examine the expression changes of 140 genes associated with muscle growth and adipose deposition in longissimus dorsi muscle at six growth stages (birth, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months) of Landrace (a leaner, Western breed) and Taihu pigs (a fatty, indigenous, Chinese breed). Variance analysis (ANOVA) revealed that differences in the expression of 18 genes in Landrace pigs and three genes in Taihu pigs were very significant (FDR-adjusted permutation, P < 0.01) and differences for 22 genes in Landrace pigs and seven genes in Taihu pigs were significant (FDR-adjusted permutation, P < 0.05) among six growth stages. Clustering analysis revealed a high level of significance (FDR-adjusted, P < 0.01) for four gene expression patterns, in which genes that strongly up-regulated were mainly associated with the positive regulation of myofiber formation and fatty acid biogenesis and genes that strongly down-regulated were mainly associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and positive regulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation. Based on a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were reconstructed from time-series data for each pig breed. These two GRNs initially revealed the distinct differences in physiological and biochemical aspects of muscle growth and adipose deposition between the two pig breeds; from these results, some potential key genes could be identified. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray data for five modulated genes, and a good correlation between the two measures of expression was observed for both two pig breeds at different growth stages (r = 0.876 +/- 0.095). These results highlight some possible candidate genes for porcine meat quality and carcass traits and provide some data on which gene(s) should be further studied for elucidating the molecular mechanism of muscle growth and fat deposition.

Fifty-four male Landes geese and 57 male Sichuan white geese were hatched on the same day under the same feeding conditions. After overfeeding for 14 days, (1) extrahepatic adipose tissues grew greatly in the Sichuan white geese, while more lipid accumulated in liver tissue in the Landes geese. (2) Sichuan white geese had a higher plasma concentration of triacylglycerols (TG), lipoproteins and insulin than the Landes geese. However, the Landes geese exhibited higher increase of plasma concentrations of TG, lipoproteins and insulin, with greater decrease of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) activity and DGAT2 mRNA level and a smller decrease of plasma glucose concentration. In addition, the mRNA level of MTP and LPL in liver was down- and up- regulated by overfeeding, respectively. (3) The correlations between the activity of LPL and the proportions of subcutaneous adipose tissue, abdominal adipose tissue, and liver weight, and the plasma concentration of VLDL were different in the two breeds. (4) The proportion of fatty liver weight was positively correlated to plasma concentrations of VLDL and TG in the overfed Sichuan white geese. Such a relationship did not exist in the Landes geese. (5) The activity of DGAT2 and its mRNA abundance in liver had significant negative correlations with the TG content in liver lipid and plasma insulin level in the Landes geese, while in the Sichuan white geese they had negative correlation (p>0.05) with TG concentration in liver lipid and had significant positive correlation with VLDL and TG concentrations in plasma.

They have long been grouped into the Bashan breed, although they have a unique breeding history and phenotypic characteristics, as well as a restricted geographic distribution. Morphologically, they can be divided into two groups based on the basic coat color (black and russet). In order to dissect the matrilineal components of Tongjiang cattle and to compare the body size traits of the two morphological groups, we measured five body size traits among 59 Tongjiang cattle samples and further sequenced the mtDNA D-loop sequence of 54 individuals. Among the 54 mtDNAs, 37 (68.5%) were Bos taurus types and 17 (31.5%) were Bos indicus types. Four known B. taurus haplogroups (T1-T4) and one B. indicus haplogroup (I1) were detected in these samples. Two body size traits differed significantly (P < 0.05) between the black group and the russet group, although the two groups possessed similar matrilineal genetic structure. This is the first report to identify all four B. taurus haplogroups in one local Chinese cattle population. Our results suggest that the contribution of different matrilineal lineages to Chinese cattle might be more complex than we originally thought.

The floret of the mutant, consisting of 6 stamens and 1 pistil, looks the same as that of the wild type except that the filaments are long and thin and the anthers are withered in white transparence. It is confirmed that xs1 is a no-pollen type of male-sterile mutant, for no pollen grains can be stained with I-2-KI solution and the anther locules are always hollow. Anther transverse sections indicate that the mutant microspores are abnormally condensed and agglomerated to form a deeply stained cluster at the late microspore stage, which results in cessation of the vacuolation process of microspores, and, therefore, the mutant forms no functional pollens for reproduction. Genetic analysis of 4 F-2 populations and 3 BC1F1 populations revealed that the mutation is controlled by a single recessive gene, termed VR1 (Vacuolation retardation 1). Screening of 432 F-2 mutant individuals derived from the cross of xs1 x G603 with simple sequence repeat markers revealed that VR1 is located between the molecular markers RM17411 and RM5030, at distances of 0.7 and 1.5 cM, respectively, on chromosome 4. VR1 is a new male fertility controlling gene located on chromosome 4 in rice.

Twelve primers amplified a total of 165 genomic DNA fragments across a total of 148 individuals of which 156 were polymorphic (94.55%). 75.76% of the bands were unique to each species, while the average genetic distance (GD) between one population of H. japonica and twelve populations of H. compressa was 0.44, which suggest that there was distinct differentiation between these two species. In H. compressa, twelve primers produced 145 bands across 145 individuals. High genetic diversity was observed at species level. The percentage of polymorphic loci (P) was 86.21% and Shannon's information index of diversity (I) was 0.357. In contrast, there were relatively low levels of genetic diversity within population (P=32.93%, I=0.174). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that a considerable proportion of genetic variation (48.02%) resided among populations. The coefficient of gene differentiation (G(ST)=48.6%) also suggested that there was strong genetic differentiation among H. compressa populations in southern China. An indirect estimate of the number of migrants per generation (N-m=0.264) indicated that gene flow was low among populations of this species. Relative high clonal diversity was found, and all local genotypes were found.

AtHIS3 cDNA encodes a protein of 238 amino acids, while AtLEU2 cDNA encodes a protein of 363 amino acids. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of AtHis3p and AtLeu2p, A. tenuissima is closely related to the plant pathogenic fungus Phaeosphaeria nodorum. This study provides two genetic markers for studies of functions of genes regulating development, morphology, and virulence of A. tenuissima.

DNA, and enabled us to visualize the individual rye chromosomes and create a universal reference karyotype of the S. cereale chromosome 1R to 7R. The GISH-banding approach used in the present study was able to discriminate S. cereale chromosomes or segments in the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) background, including the Triticale, wheat-rye addition and translocation lines. Moreover, the GISH-banding pattern of S. cereale subsp. Afghanicum chromosomes was consistent with that of Chinese native rye cv. Jingzhou rye; whereas the GISH-banding pattern of Secale vavilovii was different from that of S. cereale, indicating that GISH-banding can be used to study evolutionary polymorphism in species or subspecies of Secale. In addition, the production and application of GISH-banding to the study of adenine-thymine-riched heterochromatin is discussed.

However, compared to conventional vaccines, DNA vaccines usually induce poor antibody responses. To develop a more potent IBV DNA vaccine formulations, a monocistronic vector encoding the nucleocapsid protein of IBV and a bicistronic vector separately encoding the nucleocapsid protein and immune-stimulatory interleukin-2 were constructed. When the DNA vaccines were administered to the quadriceps muscle of chickens, the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated. There was a significant difference in ELISA antibody levels elicited by either monocistronic or bicistronic DNA vaccines. The percentage of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) subgroups of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes in chickens immunized with bicistronic DNA vaccine were higher than those in chickens immunized with monocistronic DNA vaccine. When chickens were challenged with a virulent strain of IBV, the protective efficacy could be enhanced significantly after immunization with bicistronic DNA vaccine. These results demonstrated that bicistronic DNA vaccine is an effective approach to increase IBV DNA vaccine immunogenicity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the temporal scaling behaviors in all the four series exhibit two different power laws. In shorter temporal scaling, all the series indicate the similar persistence corresponding to the annual cycle. However, in longer temporal scaling, the trends are different for the four series, which reflect the different inherent dynamic nature of various pollutant series. The fluctuations of Hurst exponent (H), DFA exponent (alpha) and power spectral density index (beta) with increasing threshold magnitude are analyzed. Our results suggest that there are different self-organized critical states in these air pollutants. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the basis of regeneration frequency and average shoot numbers, optimal shoot regeneration was obtained on leaf sections of R communis Bartlett when cultured on Murashige and Skoog complete medium containing 6.0 mg/l BA (6-benzyladenine) and 0.1 mg/l NAA (alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid), while Quoirin and Lepoivre complete medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/l TDZ [thidiazuron (N-phenyl-N-1-1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylurea)] and 0.1 mg/l NAA was found best for R pyrifolia Shenbuzhi, and Nitsch and Nitsch complete medium containing 3.0 mg/l TDZ and 0.1 mg/l NAA or 0.2 mg/l IAA was suitable for P. bretschneideri Zaosu or R ussuriensis Manyuanxiang, respectively. After cutting the leaves into three sections perpendicular to the midrib and culturing under the equivalent conditions, regeneration occurred more frequently on basal sections than middle sections, and no shoots formed on apical sections. A ratio of NH4+-N/NO3-N of 1:2 similar to 1:7 was found beneficial for shoot regeneration. 75.0-87.5% of prolife-4 rating shoots formed roots after 4 weeks of transfer to 1/4 strength of Murashige and Skoog complete medium supplemented with 2.5 mg/l IBA (indole-3-butryric acid) and 30.0 g/l sucrose. Regenerated plants were successfully established under greenhouse conditions.

Length variation of i-type low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit genes in diploid wheats	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							ALLELIC VARIATION; DOUGH PROPERTIES; FAMILY-STRUCTURE; DURUM-WHEAT; LMW; IDENTIFICATION; PROTEINS; GLU-3; LOCI; DNA	Allelic variation of the low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) is associated with the significant differences of dough quality in bread and durum wheat, and has been widely evaluated at protein level in wheat and its relatives. In this study, a PCR primer set, targeting the high variable repetitive domains, was employed to assay the length variation of i-type LMW-GS genes in the A-genomes of diploid wheats, the diploid progenitors of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. A total of 71 accessions of diploid wheats, belonging to two wild and one cultivated species, were investigated. The higher variations of repetitive length in i-type LMW-GS genes were found in diploid wheats with Nei's genetic variation index (H) of 0.834. The two wild species, T. boeoticum and T. urartu, were found to possess the similar degree of variability, with the Nei's genetic variation index of 0.806 and 0.783, respectively. Less variation was detected in T. monococcum (H = 0.680), a cultivated species domesticated from T. boeoticum. The sufficient variation found in this study could be used as valuable source for the enrichment of genetic variations and the alteration of flour-processing properties of the cultivated wheat. To our knowledge, it was the first time that an analysis of length variation targeting a particular group of genes of LMW-GS complex multigene families was conducted.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the structure and diversity of dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat from Israel and to elucidate the relationship between the emmer wheat genes and ecological factors using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Another objective of this study was to find out whether there were any correlations between SNPs in functional protein-coding genes and the environment. Results: The influence of ecological factors on the genetic structure of dimeric a-amylase inhibitor genes was evaluated by specific SNP markers. A total of 244 dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes were obtained from 13 accessions in 10 populations. Seventy-five polymorphic positions and 74 haplotypes were defined by sequence analysis. Sixteen out of the 75 SNP markers were designed to detect SNP variations in wild emmer wheat accessions from different populations in Israel. The proportion of polymorphic loci P (5%), the expected heterozygosity He, and Shannon's information index in the 16 populations were 0.887, 0.404, and 0.589, respectively. The populations of wild emmer wheat showed great diversity in gene loci both between and within populations. Based on the SNP marker data, the genetic distance of pair-wise comparisons of the 16 populations displayed a sharp genetic differentiation over long geographic distances. The values of P, He, and Shannon's information index were negatively correlated with three climatic moisture factors, whereas the same values were positively correlated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients' analysis with some of the other ecological factors. Conclusion: The populations of wild emmer wheat showed a wide range of diversity in dimeric a-amylase inhibitors, both between and within populations. We suggested that SNP markers are useful for the estimation of genetic diversity of functional genes in wild emmer wheat. These results show significant correlations between SNPs in the a-amylase inhibitor genes and ecological factors affecting diversity. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs, and the SNPs could be classified into several categories as ecogeographical predictors. It was suggested that the SNPs in the alpha-amylase inhibitor genes have been subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary influence on gene differentiation at specific loci.

An assay based on the serovar-specific DNA sequence of SE from GenBank, a serovar-specific real-time, fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction, was developed for the detection of SE. We used this assay to detect genomic DNA of SE in the blood and gastrointestinal tract, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, rectum, esophagus, stomach muscularis, and stomach glandularis, from ducks after oral challenge at different time points. The results showed that SE was consistently detected in all segments of the gastrointestinal tract. The jejunum and ileum were positive 8 hr postinoculation ( PI). The organism was detected in blood 12 hr PI, while the final organ to show a positive result was the stomach at 24 hr PI. The copy number of SE DNA in each tissue reached a peak at 24 36 hr PI, with the jejunum, ileum, and cecum containing high concentrations of SE, whereas the blood, duodenum, rectum, stomach, and esophagus had low concentrations. SE populations began to decrease and were not detectable at 2 days PI, but were still present up to 9 days PI in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum without causing apparent symptoms. By 3 days PI the cecum had significantly higher numbers of SE than any of the other areas ( P<0.01), and this appeared to reflect its function as a repository for SE. In conclusion, the results provided significant data for understanding the life cycle of SE in the gastrointestinal tract and showed that the jejunum, ileum, and cecum were the primary sites of invasion in normal ducks after oral challenge. This study will help to understand the mechanisms of action of SE infection in vivo.

The investigation demonstrated that typical NGVEV particles were round, with a diameter ranging from 75 nm to 90 nm and that they were present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the infected DEFs. The mature virions contained nucleocapsids and nucleic acids. The virion penetrated the DEF, replicated, and matured in the nucleus, and they were finally released into the extracellular space via budding and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. With the appearance of progeny NGVEV, certain virus-related structures that were densely electron stained, which were circular, U-shaped, or irregular in appearance, could be observed in the cytoplasm of the infected DEFs. In this research, we first detected three types of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies during the NGVEV infection, which always contained a number of NGVEV particles. Furthermore, we detected that NGVEV could induce apoptosis in DEFs, which had not been reported previously. The morphologic changes of apoptosis included shrinking of the apoptotic cells, chromatin condensation and margination, appearance of vacuoles on the cytoplasmic membrane, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. The mitochondria were ultracondensed and aggregated into compact clusters during apoptosis.

Despite a great deal of research on the physiology, reproductive biology, and diet of pandas in the wild and in captivity, there is little information on wild panda mortality. Here we integrate previously unavailable data on the mortality of wild pandas. We report on three recent phases of panda mortality: deaths due to bamboo flowering in the 1970s and 1980s, surprisingly extensive poaching in the 1980s and 1990s, and a parasitic infection over the past few years. Our analyses suggest that the current most significant threat to wild panda survival is disease due to extraintestinal migration (visceral larval migrans) by an ascarid nematode. We demonstrate that the probability of death of wild pandas being caused by this disease increased significantly between 1971 and 2005 and discuss the possible factors leading to the emergence of this disease.

The method entails extraction of acrylamide with 75% (v/v) methanol in water, concentration, and cleanup with an Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The chromatographic separations were performed on an HC-75H(+) column with 5 mM sulfuric acid as the mobile phase, and acrylamide was well resolved from co-extractives in the shape of a protonated cation. The final extract was analyzed by LC-DAD for quantification and the limit of detection was estimated to be 30 mu g/kg based on the signal-to-noise ratio of 3 recorded at 200 nm. The method was applied for the determination of acrylamide in spiked food samples without native acrylamide yielding recoveries between 92.5% and 104.0%. Finally, commercial samples of potato chips, cookies, and some Chinese fried foods were analyzed to assess applicability of the method to acrylamide, giving results similar with those reported in the literature.

An ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced rice mutant, fragile plant 2 (fp2), showed morphological changes and reduced mechanical strength. Genetic analysis indicated that the brittle of fp2 was controlled by a recessive gene. The fp2 gene was mapped on chromosome 10. Anatomical analyses showed that the fp2 mutation caused the reduction of cell length and cell wall thickness, increasing of cell width, and the alteration of cell wall structure as well as the vessel elements. The consequence was a global alteration in plant morphology. Chemical analyses indicated that the contents of cellulose and lignin decreased, and hemicelluloses and silicon increased in fp2. These results were different from the other mutants reported in rice. Thus, fp2 might affect the deposition and patterning of microfibrils, the biosynthesis and deposition of cell wall components, which influences the formation of primary and secondary cell walls, the thickness of cell walls, cell elongation and expansion, plant morphology and plant strength in rice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against MKK4 on myostatin-induced downregulation of differentiation marker gene expression. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the level of MKK4 expression was efficiently reduced by MKK4-specific siRNA. Western blot assays showed that knockdown of MKK4 attenuated the myostatin-induced downregulation of MyoD and myogenin expression.

We identified 20 CDPK genes from bread wheat and performed a comprehensive study on their structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics. Full-length cDNA sequences of 14 CDPKs were obtained using various approaches. Wheat CDPKs were found to be similar to their counterparts in rice in genomic structure, GC content, subcellular localization, and subgroup classification. Divergence time estimation of wheat CDPK gene pairs and wheat-rice orthologs suggested that most duplicated genes already existed in the common ancestor of wheat and rice. The number of CDPKs in diploid wheat genome was estimated to be at least 26, a number close to that in rice, Arabidopsis, and poplar. However, polymorphism among EST sequences uncovered transcripts of all three homoeologous alleles for 13 out of 20 CDPKs. Thus, the hexaploid wheat should have 2-3 fold more CDPK genes expressing in their cells than the diploid species. Wheat CDPK genes were found to respond to various biotic and abiotic stimuli, including cold, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), salt, drought, powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici, Bgt), as well as phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA). Each CDPK gene often responded to multiple treatments, suggesting that wheat CDPKs are converging points for multiple signal transduction pathways. The current work represents the first comprehensive study of CDPK genes in bread wheat and provides a foundation for further functional study of this important gene family in Triticeae.

Relationship between activities of key enzymes involved in starch synthesis and accumulation in maize inbred lines during grain filling	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						zea mays; starch accumulation; grain filling; enzymes of starch synthesis	BRANCHING ENZYME; CARBOHYDRATE-METABOLISM; ENDOSPERM; WHEAT; GRANULES; SEEDS; WAXY	Time course of starch production and the key enzyme activities in the grains of four maize inbred lines (two high-starch and two low-starch lines) were studied. Accumulation of grain starch and its components in four maize inbred lines rose continuously after pollination and increased as a sigmoid curve during grain filling. The accumulation rates showed single-peak curves. The accumulation rates of starch and its components reached their peaks on 25-32 days after pollination (DAP), respectively. Activities of adenosine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPPase) and starch synthase in the grains of four lines followed single-peak curves with the peaks on 24-31 DAR The highest activity of the starch-branching enzyme (Q-enzyme) in the grains of both high-starch lines appeared on 23 DAP, but that of both low-starch inbred lines showed double-peak curves, the peaks being at 15-20 DAP and 30-35 DAR There was significant positive correlation between AGPPase, soluble starch synthase (SSS), and starch granule-bound synthase (GBSS) activities. The results indicated the Q-enzyme had different expression patterns in the high- and the low-starch maize inbred lines, and that AGPPase, SSS, and GBSS activities were significantly and positively correlated with amylose, amylopectin, and starch accumulation rates in all lines.

SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						anther culture; callus induction; embryogenesis; Eriobotrya japonica L.; haploid; plant regeneration	ANDROGENESIS; HAPLOIDS; EMBRYOS; STRESS; DATURA; VITRO; SEX	The object of this study was to induce embryogenesis and establish plant regeneration system for anther culture in loquat (Eriobotrya japonica L.). Cold pretreatment was a key factor, and supplement of 2,4-D in the media was absolutely necessary for induction of calluses from cultured loquat anthers. The best response of anthers to in vitro culture was obtained when a 48-h cold pretreatment was employed to flower buds at 4 degrees C in darkness. Genotype was a decisive factor for embryo differentiation. When anther-derived calluses of three loquat cultivars, i.e., cv. 'Longquan1', 'Dawuxing' and 'Zaozhong6', were transferred to embryo differentiation medium, embryos were induced only for cv. 'Dawuxing' on MS medium containing 3% sucrose, 0.23 mu M ZT in combination with 0.05 mu M NAA + 0.05 mu M IBA or 0.11 mu M NAA + 0.10 mu M IBA, and the differentiation rates were 3.33% and 10.00%, respectively. The results of histological studies showed that embryos developed through typical globular, heart, torpedo and cotyledon stages after 4 weeks of culture. The treatment designed to mature the embryos on medium containing 3% of sucrose at 4 degrees C under darkness for 4 weeks was effective for subsequent embryo germination and plant conversion, which gave rise to 72.5% plant recovery. Cytological studies showed that 26 plantlets were haploids (n = 17) and the remaining 4 plantlets were diploids for the 30 regenerants tested. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

METHODS: Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to analyze the intestinal microbial community diversity and dynamic change including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and rectum from healthy ducklings and 7-day-old ducklings after oral infection with S. enteritidis at different time points. RESULTS: The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy ducklings was steady and the ERIC-PCR band numbers of the control healthy ducklings were the least with rectum and were the most with caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated ducklings did not obviously change until 24 h after inoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 h to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 d p.i. The prominent bacteria changed because of S. enteritidis infection and the DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected ducklings with SE. CONCLUSION: This study has provided significant data to clarify the intestinal microbial community diversity and dynamic change of healthy and S. enteritidis orally infected ducklings, and valuable insight into the pathogenesis of S. enteritidis infection in both human and animals.

The result shows that NGVEV can induce infected cells undergoing apoptosis and changing regularly. A series of characteristic apoptotic morphological changes including shrinkage of the cells, chromatin condensation and margination, as well as formation of apoptotic bodies, were observed by TEM. The typical ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis. And using flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, the dead, viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells could be analyzed quantitatively.

METHODS: The rabbits were immunized with purified bacillus to obtain S. enteritidis-specific antibody, which were then extracted by the caprylic-ammonium sulphate method, purified through High-Q columns. An indirect immuno-fluorescent staining method (IFA) was established to detect the S. enteritidis antigen in paraffin slices. Detected S. enteritidis in each organ tissue of ducklings experimentally infected with S. enteritidis. RESULTS: The gland of Garder, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, brain, ileum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius from S. enteritidis experimentally infected ducklings were positive or strongly positive, and the S. enteritidis antigen mainly distributed in the infected cell cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: IFA is an intuitionist, sensitive and specific method in detecting S. enteritidis antigen in paraffin wax slices, and it is a good method in diagnosis and antigen location of S. enteritidis. We also conclude that the gland of Garder, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, ileum, jejunum are target organs in S. enteritidis infections of duck, and S. enteritidis is an intracellular parasitic bacterium.

METHODS: Assays based on the serovar-specific DNA sequence of S. enteritidis from GenBank, and a serovar-specific real-time, fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) were developed for the detection of S. enteritidis. We used this assay to detect genomic DNA of S. enteritidis in the blood and the internal organs, including heart, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, and gallbladder, from mice after oral challenge at different time points respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that the spleen was positive at 12 h post inoculation (PI), and the blood was at 14 h PI. The organism was detected in the liver and heart at 16 h PI, the pancreas was positive at 20 h PI, and the final organs to show positive results were the kidney and gallbladder at 22 h PI. The copy number of S. enteritidis DNA in each tissue reached a peak at 24-36 h PI, with the liver and spleen containing high concentrations of S. enteritidis, whereas the blood, heart, kidney, pancreas, and gallbladder had low concentrations. 5 enteritidis populations began to decrease and were not detectable at 3 d PI, but were still present up to 12 d PI in the gallbladder, 2 wk for the liver, and 3 wk for the spleen without causing apparent symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results provided significant data for understanding the life cycle of S. enteritidis in the internal organs, and showed that the liver and spleen may be the primary sites for setting itself up as a commensa over a long time after oral challenge. Interestingly, it may be the first time reported that the gallbladder is a site of carriage for S. enteritidis over a 12 d period. This study will help to understand the mechanisms of action of S. enteritidis infection in vivo. (C) 2008 WJG. All rights reserved.

J	Peng, YY; Wei, YM; Baum, BR; Zheng, YL				Peng, Yuan-Ying; Wei, Yu-Ming; Baum, Bernard R.; Zheng, You-Liang			Molecular diversity of the 5S rRNA gene and genomic relationships in the genus Avena (Poaceae : Aveneae)	GENOME			English	Article							IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; BARLEY HORDEUM-VULGARE; C-BANDED KARYOTYPES; RDNA UNITS; SEQUENCE VARIATION; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; NONTRANSCRIBED SPACER; SPECIES RELATIONSHIPS; NUCLEOLAR ACTIVITY; WHEAT PROGENITORS	The molecular diversity of the rDNA sequences (5S rDNA units) in 71 accessions from 26 taxa of Avena was evaluated. The analyses, based on 553 sequenced clones, indicated that there were 6 unit classes, named according to the haplomes (genomes) they putatively represent, namely the long A1, long B1, long M1, short C1, short D1, and short M1 unit classes. The long and short M1 unit classes were found in the tetraploid A. macrostachya, the only perennial species. The long M1 unit class was closely related to the short C1 unit class, while the short M1 unit class was closely related to the long A1 and long B1 unit classes. However, the short D1 unit class was more divergent from the other unit classes. There was only one unit class per haplome in Avena, whereas haplomes in the Triticeae often have two. Most of the sequences captured belonged to the long A1 unit class. Sequences identified as the long B1 unit class were found in the tetraploids A.aabyssinica and A. vaviloviana and the diploids A. atlantica and A. longiglumis. The short C1 unit class was found in the diploid species carrying the C genome, i.e., A. clauda, A. eriantha, and A. ventricosa, and also in the diploid A. longiglumis, the tetraploids A. insularis and A. maroccana, and all the hexaploid species. The short D1 unit class was found in all the hexaploid species and two clones of A. clauda. It is noteworthy that in previous studies the B genome was found only in tetraploid species and the D genome only in hexaploid species. Unexpectedly, we found that various diploid Avena species contained the B1 and D1 units. The long B1 unit class was found in 3 accessions of the diploid A. atlantica (CN25849, CN25864, and CN25887) collected in Morocco and in 2 accessions of A. longiglumis (CIav9087 and CIav9089) collected in Algeria and Libya, respectively, whereas only 1 clone of A. clauda (CN21378) had the short D1 unit. Thus there might be a clue as to where to search for diploids carrying the B and D genomes. Avena longiglumis was found to be the most diverse species, possibly harboring the A, B, and C haplomes. The long M1 and short M1 are the unit classes typical of A. macrostachya. These results could explain the roles of A. clauda, A. longiglumis, and A. atlantica in the evolution of the genus Avena. Furthermore, one clone of the tetraploid A. murphyi was found to have sequences belonging to the short D1 unit class, which could indicate that A. murphyi might have been the progenitor of hexaploid oats and not, as postulated earlier, A. insularis. The evolution of Avena did not follow the molecular clock. The path inferred is that the C genome is more ancient than the A and B genomes and closer to the genome of A. macrostachya, the only existing perennial, which is presumed to be the most ancestral species in the genus.

A total of 15, crossbred weanling pigs (initial body weight 10.15 +/- 0.39 kg) were assigned to one of three treatments. Pigs were injected with LPS and fed ad libitum (LPS-challenge), or injected with endotoxin-free physiological salt solution (PSS) and fed ad libitum (control), or injected with PSS and fed the same amount of feed as LPS-challenged pigs (pair-feed). All pigs received a 4-d nitrogen balance trial. On d I and 3 of the trial, LPS-challenged pigs were injected intramuscularly with 200 mu g/kg BW of LPS dissolved in 1 ml PSS. Pigs in other treatments were injected with 1 ml PSS. (15)N-Glycine (5 mg/kg BW) was gastrically infused after the second injection. Feces and urine were collected daily to determine the N output throughout the duration of the trial. Lymphocyte blastogenesis (LB) and serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) were also detected to illustrate the LPS-induced immune responses. Results indicated that the injection of LPS significantly (P<0.01) elevated the LB and resulted in lower average daily gain (ADG), feed intake (ADFI) and efficiency of feed utilization than control pigs. Pair-fed pigs had higher performance than LPS-challenged pig but poorer than control pigs. Injection of LPS also resulted in significantly (P<0.01) lower nitrogen intake and efficiency of utilization than controls, and more fecal N excretion than Pair-fed pigs (3.19 +/- 0.85 vs. 2.19 +/- 0.67 g/d, P<0.05). The whole-body nitrogen flux (4.34 +/- 0.19 vs. 11.35 +/- 0.12 g N/kg BW(0.75)/d) and N accretion (5.57 +/- 0.59 vs. 10.17 +/- 1.12 g Pr/kg BW(0.75)/d) were acutely (P<0.01) reduced as the feed intake decreased, but there was no significant difference between LPS-challenged and pair-fed pigs. Injection of LPS markedly (P<0.05) increased the protein degradation (16.76 +/- 1.09 vs. 14.53 +/- 1.24 g N/kg BW(0.75)/d). It is concluded that LPS-induced immune challenge depresses growth performance and feed utilization efficiency by enhancing protein degradation rate and decreasing protein utilization for body protein retention.

The community composition of AMF in intensively managed agricultural soil in the Sichuan Province of southwest China currently is unknown. In one set of samples, AMF were trapped in pot cultures from 40 fields growing legumes in the Panxi region, southeast Sichuan. In a second set of samples, the MPN method with four-fold dilutions and maize as host was used to estimate infective propagules in soil from another 50 agricultural sites throughout the province. Soil types were heterogeneous and were classified as purple, yellow, paddy and red. Crops at each site were either maize, wheat or sweet orange. From this set of soil, AMF spores were also extracted and identified. Including all ninety soils, thirty glomeromycotan species in Glomus (20 species), Acaulospora (four species), Scutellospora (three species), Ambispora (one species), Archaeospora (one species) and Paraglomus (one species) were identified. Yellow, red and purple soils yielded similar numbers of AMF species, while AMF species diversity was clearly lower in paddy soil. In trap culture soils, the most frequent species were Glomus aggregatum or Glomus intraradices, Glomus claroideum and Glomus etunicatum. The species Acaulospora capsicula, Acaulospora delicata, G. aggregatum (or intraradices), G. claroideum, Glomus epigaeum, G. etunicatum, Glomus luteum, Glomus monosporum, Glomus mosseae and Glomus proliferum were successfully cultured as single-species pot cultures in Plantago lanceolata. The three most frequent species in field soils were G. mosseae, Glomus caledonium and Glomus constrictum. MPN values varied between 17 and 3334 propagules 100 g soil(-1) among the fifty field sites sampled. Regression analysis, including host&soil, log(P) and pH as explanatory variables explained 59% of the variation in log(MPN). The highest MPN estimates were found in purple soil cropped with maize and citrus, 324 and 278 propagules 100 g soil(-1), respectively. The lowest MPN value, 54 propagules 100 g soil(-1), was measured in wheat in purple and yellow soil. Despite intensive agricultural management that can include often repeated tillage, our examination of 90 agricultural sites revealed that soils of the Sichuan region have moderate to high numbers of infective AMF propagules as well as a high AMF species diversity. This opens possibilities for further studies and utilization of AMF in agriculture and horticulture in the Sichuan province, People's Republic of China.

The genetic diversity of 41 endophytic actinobacteria isolated from 13 native medicinal plants growing in diverse ecoclimatic zones in Sichuan, China, was investigated by using PCR-RFLP of the ribosomal 16S rRNA gene and the intergenic spacer (IGS) region between the 165 rRNA and 235 rRNA genes, BOX fingerprinting and full sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. The results revealed 29 and 40 genotypes from 165 and 16S-23S rRNA IGS genes PCR-RFLP data, respectively, which indicated considerable genetic diversity among the isolates. Analysis of 165 rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the strains were most closely related to representatives of the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora among actinobacteria. Native medicinal plants are thus important resources for endophytic actinobacteria.

Thirty-six crossbred finishing pigs (mean BW 90 kg) were assigned randomly to 0, 1000, or 2000 mg supplemental Mg from MgAsp per kg of diet for five days before slaughter. Then six pigs from each dietary treatment were subjected either to no transportation stress (NTS) or 2h of transportation stress (TS). Transportation stress resulted in higher concentrations (p<0.01) of serum calcium, glucose and cortisol, lower pH (p<0.01), higher Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) (p<0.05) and higher calpastatin mRNA abundance (p=0.05) of longissimus muscle (LM) compared with NTS treatments. Supplementation of MgAsp in TS treatments increased serum Mg concentration (p<0.05) at 2000 mg of Mg/kg, reduced drip loss (p<0.05) and improved pork quality colour (p<0.05) at 2000 mg of Mg/kg, and decreased 1-day and 3-day WBSF (p<0.05) at 1000 mg of Mg/kg compared with TS treatments fed the control diet. It is concluded that supplementation of MgAsp improves water-holding capacity and pork colour, and alleviates the negative effects of transportation stress on meat tenderness.

The kinetics of viral DNA loads and immunohistochemical localization of virulent duck enteritis virus, as well as histopathological examination in various tissues of ducks following oral infection, were investigated. The time course for the appearance of viral antigen and tissue lesions in various tissues was coincident with the levels of duck enteritis virus at the various sites, suggesting that the levels of duck enteritis virus in systemic organs have a close correlation with the progression of disease. The abundance of target epithelial and lymphoid cells may contribute to the high levels of virus infection and replication in lymphoid and intestinal tissues.

Twenty-one primer pairs were used to produce 480 bands, of which 405 (84.38%) were polymorphic. The genetic similarity coefficients (GS) varied from 0.5863 to 0.9686 among the 60 collections, with an average of 0.7891. The genetic diversity of orchardgrass from China and the United States of America were found to be higher than that found in other countries. The dendrogram and principal component analysis realized from these markers clustered the materials into four main groups. The cluster analysis showed that orchardgrass from Australia was different from other collections in genetic diversity. Accessions from the same continent were classified into the same group, indicating that the genetic diversity of orchardgrass and the entire genetic basis of cultivars used in a continent is narrow. Furthermore, cluster analyses suggested that there is correlation between karyotype and morphological characterizations according to the analysis of the five subclusters that clustered from the first group. The information given by SRAP markers was concordant with the morphological variability and karyotype. This showed SRAP marker system could be used efficiently in the study of genetic variability and the evolutionary history of orchardgrasses. Based on the analysis of genetic diversity and relationships, the appropriate strategies for collection and conservation of germplasm resources can be developed and this in turn would help breeding of orchardgrass.

In this study, we performed GISH (genome in situ hybridization) and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) on wheat-rye chromosome translocation lines and their parents to detect the identity in genomic structure of different translocation lines. The results showed that the genome primary structure variations were not obviously detected in different translocation lines except the same 1RS chromosome translocation. Methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) analyses on genomic DNA showed that the ratios of fully-methylated sites were significantly increased in translocation lines (CN12, 20.15%; CN17, 20.91%; CN18, 22.42%), but the ratios of hemimethylated sites were significantly lowered (CN12, 21.41%; CN17, 23.43%; CN18, 22.42%), whereas 16.37% were fully-methylated and 25.44% were hemimethylated in case of their wheat parent. Twenty-nine classes of methylation patterns were identified in a comparative assay of cytosine methylation patterns between wheat-rye translocation lines and their wheat parent, including 13 hypermethylation patterns (33.74%), 9 demethylation patterns (22.76%) and 7 uncertain patterns (4.07%). In further sequence analysis, the alterations of methylation pattern affected both repetitive DNA sequences, such as retrotransposons and tandem repetitive sequences, and low-copy DNA.

Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to search for genome specific DNA sequences of S. africanum in lines, R111, "mianyang11" (MY11) and wheat-rye 1RS/1BL translocations R25 and R57. A high copy rye-specific DNA segment pSaD15(940) of the S. africanum genome was obtained. The sequence of pSaD15 did not show any significant homology to other reported sequences in databases and it is therefore a new repetitive sequence of Secale. PCR primers were designed for pSaD15(940), which amplify a clear 887 bp fragment in S. africanum but not in any wheat. The primers also amplified an 887 bp fragment in other accessions of rye, Chinese Spring-Imperial rye chromosome additions and a diverse range of material carrying different rye chromosomes or chromosomal segments. In situ hybridization showed that probe pSaD15(940) was specifically hybridized throughout all rye chromosomes arms except for the terminal regions. The advantage of the rye-specific probe developed herein compared to those of previous reports is that it has been shown to be widely applicable to other Secale species. The probe will be useful as a molecular marker for the introgression of S. africanum and other rye chromosome segments into the wheat genome.

COOKED-KERNEL ELONGATION; GENOMIC REGIONS; FRAGRANCE; IDENTIFICATION; INHERITANCE; MARKERS; SCENT	We investigated inheritance and carried out gene fine mapping of aroma in crosses between the aromatic elite hybrid rice Oryza sativa indica variety Chuanxiang-29B (Ch-29B) and the non-aromatic rice O. sativa indica variety R2 and O. sativa japonica Lemont (Le). The F-1 grains and leaves were non-aromatic while the F-2 non-aroma to aroma segregation pattern was 3:1. The F-3 segregation ratio was consistent with the expected 1: 2: 1 for a single recessive aroma gene in Ch-29B. Linkage analysis between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the aroma locus for the aromatic F-2 plants mapped the Ch-29B aroma gene to a chromosome 8 region flanked by SSR markers RM23120 at 0.52 cM and RM3459 at 1.23 cM, a replicate F-2 population confirming these results. Three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones cover chromosome 8 markers RM23120 and RM3459. Our molecular mapping data from the two populations indicated that the aroma locus occurs in a 142.85 kb interval on BAC clones AP005301 or AP005537, implying that it might be the same gene reported by Bradbury et al (2005a; Plant Biotec J. 3:363-370). The flanking markers Aro7, RM23120 and RM3459 identified by us could greatly accelerate the efficiency and precision of aromatic rice breeding programs.

Effects of herbal extract supplementation on growth performance and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I system in finishing pigs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						pigs; gain; herbal extracts; malonylodialdehyde; insulin-like growth factor system; gene expression		The Study's main objective was to investigate the effects of a specific blend of herbal extracts (HEs) on growth performance, antioxidant status, and components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in finishing pigs. A total of 16 PIC (Pig Improvement Company) pigs (60.1 +/- 1.2 kg; eight gilts and eight barrows) were randomly assigned to one of the two dietary groups, with flour pens/group (per pen: one gilt, one barrow). The pigs were fed with a basal diet containing 0 (control) or 250 mg HEs/kg diet for 47 days. The results indicated that herbal extract supplementation led to an increase (P<0.05) on the average daily gain and serum IGF-I level. and a decrease (P<0.05) on serum malondialdehyde and feed conversion ratio. However, feed intake was not affected (P>0.05). IGF-I, insulin receptor mRNA levels (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) mRNA (stomach, duodenum, Muscle) were high (P<0.05), while the level of IGF-IR mRNA was low (P<0.05) in the liver tissue compared with the control pigs. The results suggest that herbal extract Supplementation has an antioxidant capacity, enhance the growth performance and exhibits tissue-specific regulation of IGF-IR mRNA level. In addition, the results also suggest the possible physiological role of the IGF system in controlling the HEs-supported growth of finishing pigs.	[Liu, G. M.; Wei, Y.; Wang, Z. S.; Wu, D.; Zhou, A.

At metaphase I of 50 pollen mother cells, the 56 chromosomes of the new wheat SHW-L2 showed a mean pairing configuration of 2.82 univalents, 6.18 rod bivalents, 19.39 ring bivalents, 0.5 trivalents, and 0.14 quadrivalents. Cytological analyses suggested that SHW-L2 had additional 7 pairs of chromosomes from the A and D genome besides the 42 chromosomes of common wheat. The special chromosome constitution of SHW-L2 may be derived from the chromosome doubling by the colchicine treatment of seedlings and then spontaneous doubling of gametes.

To identify the QTL of PHS tolerance, we constructed two SSR-based genetic maps of 2DS in 2004 and 2005. One putative QTL associated with PHS tolerance, designated Qphs.sau-2D, was identified within the marker intervals Xgwm261-Xgwm484 in 2004 and in the next year, nearly in the same position, between markers wmc112 and Xgwn1484. Confidence intervals based oil the LOD-drop-off method ranged from 9 cM to 15.4 cM and almost completely overlapped with marker interval Xgwm261-Xgwm484. Flanking markers near this QTL could be assigned to the C-2DS1-0.33 chromosome bin, suggesting that the gene(s) controlling PHS tolerance is located in that chromosome region. The phenotypic variation explained by this QTL was about 25.73-27.50%. Genotyping of 48 F(6) PHS tolerant plants derived from the cross between PHS tolerant wheat cultivar 'RSP' and PHS susceptible bread wheat cultivar 'MY11' showed that the allele of Qphs.sau-2D found in the 'RSP' genome may prove useful for the improvement of PHS tolerance.

This study adopted methylation-sensitive Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to compare the levels of DNA cytosine methylation at CCGG sites in tassel, bracteal leaf, and ear leaf from maize inbred lines, 18 White and 18 Red, respectively, and also examined specific methylation patterns of the three tissues. Significant differences in cytosine methylation level among the three tissues and the same changing tendency in two inbred lines were detected. Both MSAP (methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism) ratio and full methylation level were the highest in bracteal leaf, and the lowest in tassel. Meanwhile, different methylation levels were observed in the same tissue from the inbred lines, 18 White and 18 Red. Full methylation of internal cytosine was the dominant type in the maize genome. The differential methylation patterns in the three tissues were observed. In addition, sequencing of nine differentially methylated fragments and the subsequent blast search revealed that the cytosine methylated 5' -CCGG-3' sequences were distributed in repeating sequences, in the coding and noncoding regions. Southern hybridization was used to verify the methylation polymorphism. These results clearly demonstrated the power of the MSAP technique for large-scale DNA methylation detection in the maize genome, and the complexity of DNA methylation change during plant growth and development. The different methylation levels may be related to specific gene expression in various tissues.

If size effects on reproductive success vary depending on the environmental conditions, however, the size dependency may differ among populations. We tried to detect site-specific variation in size-dependent sex allocation of a monocarpic hermaphrodite with reference to light availability. Multiple flowers and fruits were sampled from the individuals of Cardiocrinum cordatum, a monocarpic understory herb, and pollen, ovule and seed production were measured with reference to the plant size in two populations. Furthermore, frequency and foraging behavior of pollinator visitation was observed. Ovule production per flower increased with plant size in both populations, while pollen production per flower increased with size only in the population under sparse canopy. Therefore, proportional allocation to male function decreased with plant size in the population under closed canopy, but did not change in the population under sparse canopy. Pollinators usually visited only one flower per plant, indicating the negligible geitonogamous pollination in this species. Although seed production under closed canopy was lower than that under sparse canopy, seed-set rate per flower and seed mass per fruit were independent of plant size in either of the populations. Size-dependent sex allocation in this species was site-specific, suggesting that not only resource storage before reproduction (i.e., plant size) but also resource availability of environment throughout the reproductive process (i.e., light availability) affect reproductive performance in this species.

METHODS: Based on the species-specific DNA sequence of S. enteritidis from GenBank, a species-specific realtime, fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was developed for the detection of S. enteritidis. We used this assay to detect genomic DNA of 5, enteritidis in the gastrointestinal tract, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, esophagus and stomach, from mice after oral infection. RESULTS: S. enteritidis was consistently detected in all segments of the gastrointestinal tract. The jejunum and ileum were positive at 8 h post inoculation, and the final organ to show a positive result was the stomach at 18 h post inoculation. The copy number of S. enteritidis DNA in each tissue reached a peak at 24-36 h post inoculation, with the jejunum, ileum and cecum containing high concentrations of S. enteritidis, whereas the duodenum, colon, rectum, stomach and esophagus had low concentrations. S. enteritidis began to decrease and vanished at 2 d post inoculation, but it was still present up to 5 d post inoculation in the jejunum, ileum and cecum, without causing apparent symptoms. By 5 d post inoculation, the cecum had significantly higher numbers of S. enteritidis than any of the other areas (P < 0.01), and this appeared to reflect its function as a repository for S. enteritidis. CONCLUSION: The results provided significant data for clarifying the pathogenic mechanism of S. enteritidis in the gastrointestinal tract, and showed that the jejunum, ileum and cecum are the primary sites of invasion in normal mice after oral infection. This study will help to further understanding of the mechanisms of action of S. enteritidis. (C) 2007 WJG. All rights reserved.

Hepatopancreas weight and protein content, intestinal weight, length and protein content, intestinal folds height, activity of intestinal protease, lipase, alkaline phosphatase (AKP), Na+, K+-ATPase were positively affected by CL. Moreover, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) in muscle, and plasma ammonia, tended to be lower for CL, which means that the improvement of digestive organ development and function may be the possible reason why CL was better than UCL.

One of the objectives of this study was to screen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of chicken H-FABP gene among 252 individuals that included 4 Chinese domestic chicken breeds (Fengkai Xinghua (T04), Huiyang Huxu (H), Qingyuan Ma (Q), Guangxi Xiayan (Sl)), 2 breeds developed by the Institute of Animal Science, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Lingnan Huang (DC), dwarf chicken (E4)) and one introduced broiler (Abor Acre (AA)). Another objective of this study was to analyze the associations between polymorphisms of the H-FABP gene and fat deposition traits in chickens. PCR-SSCP was used to analyze SNPs in H-FABP and 4 SNPs T260C, G675A, C783T and G2778A) were detected. Associations between polymorphic loci and intramuscular fat (IMF), abdominal fat weight (AFW) and abdominal fat percentage (AFP) were analyzed by ANCOVA method. The results showed that the T260C genotypes were significantly associated with IMF (p = 0.0233) and AFP (p = 0.0001); the G675A genotypes were significantly associated with AFW, AFP (p < 0.01) and IMF (p < 6.05); at the C783T locus, AFW and AFP differed highly between genotypes. However, the G2778A loci did not show any significant effect on fat deposition traits in this study. In addition, we found that there were some differences between AFP and definite haplotypes through a nonparametric statistical method, so the haplotypes based on the SNPs except G2778A loci were also significantly associated with IMF, AFW (g) (p < 0.05) and AFP (%) (p < 0.001). Significantly and suggestively dominant effects of H4H4 haplotype were observed for IMF and the H2H3 was dominant for AFW (g) and AFP (%). The results also revealed that H5H7 haplotype had a negative effect on IMF, while the H5H6 had a positive effect on AFW (g) and AFP (%).

J	Wang, JR; Wei, YM; Yan, ZH; Zheng, YL				Wang, Ji-Rui; Wei, Yu-Ming; Yan, Ze-Hong; Zheng, You-Liang			Sequence variations and haplotype identification of wheat dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes in einkorn wheats	BIOCHEMICAL GENETICS			English	Article						diploid wheat; phylogenetic analysis; haplotype; single nucleotide polymorphism	TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L; A-GENOME DONOR; DIPLOID WHEAT; POLYMORPHISM; MONOCOCCUM; BOEOTICUM; URARTU; CHROMOSOME-3B; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION	This study characterizes 80 dimeric a-amylase inhibitor genes from 68 accessions of the einkorn wheats Triticum urartu, T. boeoticum, and T. monococcum. The mature protein coding sequences of WDAI genes were analyzed. Nucleotide sequence variations in these regions resulted from base substitution and/or indel mutations. Most of the WDAI gene sequences from T boeoticum and all sequences from T. monococcum had one nucleotide insertion in the coding region, such that these alpha-amylase inhibitor sequences could not encode the correct mature proteins. We identified 21 distinct haplotypes from the diploid wheat WDAI gene sequences. A main haplotype was found in 15 gene samples from the A(u) genome and 35 gene samples from the A(m) genome. The T. monococcum and T. boeoticum accessions shared the same main haplotype, with 25 samples from T. monococcum and 10 from T. boeoticum. The WDAI gene sequences from the Au and A(m) genomes could be obviously clustered into two clades, but the sequences from the Am genome of T boeoticum and T monococcum could not be clearly distinguished. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the WDAI gene sequences from the A(m) genome had accumulated fewer variations and evolved at a slower rate than the sequences from the A(u) genome. Although some accessions from only one or two areas had unique mutations at the same position, the diversity of WDAI gene sequences in diploid wheat showed little relationship to the origin of the accessions.

The influences of basal media, carbon sources, plant growth regulators (PGRs) with different concentrations and combinations on embryogenesis capacity of explants were studied. The highest frequency of somatic embryos production and germination was obtained on Schenk and Hildebrandt medium (SH) supplemented with 1.0 mg dm(-3) kinetin and 0.2, 0.5 mg dm(-3) indole-3-acetic acid. Granulated sugar was the optimal carbon source. The embryo-derived plantlets with well-developed roots and shoots were transferred successfully to the greenhouse with a maximum survival rate of 55 %. Histological observation revealed that the somatic embryos were similar to those of zygotic embryos.

The subjects for this experiment were 15 pigs divided into three groups (5 pigs per group). The treated groups were immunized with CCK8 conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA). The control group was immunized with same dosage of HSA. The average daily gain of pig fed with 250 mu g CCK was significantly increased (P < 0.05), compared with the control group (0 mu g CCK). The content of CCK8, insulin, and leptin in serum was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased and the titer of CCK8 antibody was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in treated groups compared to the control group. The levels of CCK gene and CCK receptor gene expression in jejunum, pituitary, and pancreas of the treated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of the control group. It is concluded that optimal active immunization against CCK8 could increase the content of CCK antibody and suppress CCK gene and CCK receptor gene expressions and in result improve feed intake and growth performance of pigs.

Serosurvey of ex situ giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) in China with implications for species conservation	JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE			English	Article						China; giant panda; infectious disease; red panda; serology	CANINE-DISTEMPER VIRUS; SEROLOGIC SURVEY; AGENTS	Conservation strategies for the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) include the development of a self-sustaining ex Situ Population. This Study examined the potential significance of infectious pathogens in giant pandas ex situ. Serologic antibody titers against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), canine coronavirus (CCV), canine herpesvirus, canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Leptospira interrogans were measured in 44 samples taken from 19 giant pandas between 1998 and 2003 at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan, China. Seroassays also included samples obtained in 2003 from eight red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) housed at the same institution. All individuals had been vaccinated with a Chinese canine vaccine that included modified live CDV, CPV, CAV, CCV, and CPIV. Positive antibody titers were Found only against CDV, CPV, and T. gondii. Sera were negative for antibodies against the other six pathogens. Results indicate that the quality of the vaccine may not be reliable and that it should not be considered protective or safe in giant pandas and red pandas. Positive antibody titers against T. gondii were found in seven of the 19 giant pandas. The clinical, Subclinical, or epidemiologic significance of infection with these pathogens via natural exposure or from modified live vaccines in giant pandas is unknown. Research in this area is imperative to sustaining a viable population of giant pandas aid other endangered species.	[Loeffler, I.

Floral sex allocation in a hermaphrodite herb with 1-day flowers, Hosta rectifolia (Liliaceae)	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY			English	Article						Hosta rectifolia; ovule number; pollen number; pollen to ovule ratio; sex allocation	NARTHECIUM-ASIATICUM LILIACEAE; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; RESOURCE LIMITATION; PHENOTYPIC GENDER; SIZE; INFLORESCENCES; PLANT; FRUIT; RANUNCULACEAE; ENVIRONMENT	The size-dependent sex allocation theory predicts that a female-based sex allocation is accelerated with increasing resource status in insect-pollinated hermaphrodite plants. However, variations in the mating environment among flowers, which are caused by pollinator movements and temporal fluctuation in the floral sex ratio, may cause diverse patterns in sex allocation among flowers within inflorescences. We examined the floral sex allocation among plants and among flowers within inflorescences in a perennial hermaphrodite species with 1-day flowers, Hosta rectifolia Nakai. Flowering progresses sequentially from basal to distal positions within an inflorescence with little flowering overlap among flowers. At the plant level, both pollen and ovule production per flower increased with plant size. Within inflorescences, both ovule and pollen production per flower declined from basal to distal positions, indicating decreasing resource availability per flower. The probability of fruit-set success under natural conditions also decreased from basal to distal positioned flowers within inflorescences. However, the pollen to ovule ratio of individual flowers remained constant, regardless of floral position and plant size. Constant sex allocation at the flower level is consistent with the prediction of the mating environment theory; every positioned flower seemed to have a similar potential of pollination success because there was no geitonogamous pollination.

The virus lacked haemagglutinating activity at 25, 37 and 4 degrees C, respectively, and gave negative results in the HAT after two passages in experimentally infected rabbits, but gave positive results in Agar Diffusion Reaction (ADR) and Counter Immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). Using electron microscopy, negatively stained particles of the RHDV isolate showed that the virions was approximately 35 nm in diameter. The capsid protein VP60 gene of whn-1 strain was cloned into pMD18-T vector by RT-PCR assays and sequenced. The obtained VP60 gene sequence has been submitted to GenBank with the accession number: DQ069280. The whole VP60 gene of whn-1 was 1740 nt in size and encodes 579 aa. Alignment with other 16 strains of RHDV in the world, including such "RHDVa" strains as France 99-05, France-Reu-00, Germany-Triptis and Chin-aTP, in addition to RCV and EBHSV, showed that the homology of RHDV strains were 90.0-98.0% for nucleotide sequence, 94.3-99.0% for amino acid sequence, respectively. The results indicated that the sequences of VP60 gene of different RHDV isolates, including non-haemagglutinating whn-1 strain and low-haemagglutinating Rainham strain, were relatively highly homologous, and the major variant amino acid were located within region C (301-328 aa) and region E(344-434 aa), which were specific to "RHDVa" strains. Moreover, the molecular characterisation of VP60 protein of RHDV whn-1 strain, such as Hydrophilicity plot, Flexible regions, Antigenic index, etc., were compared with reference RHDV strains of Spanish-AST/89, France-99-5 and UK-Rainham in this article. From the experiment, it's concluded that, the "whn-1" strain is probably an antigenic variant of "RHDVa", and the 3 amino acids of Phe (304), Ala (305), Ser (309), and 5 amino acids of Gly (359), Asn (365), Ala (369), Ala (370), Asn (386), located in P2 region in the VP60 protein, probably played an important role in the haemagglutination activity.

Both water-soluble and lipid-soluble compounds were included, i.e. danshensu, salvianolic acid B and tanshinone IIA. Protocatechuic aldehyde and diazepam were used as internal standards. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed-phase C,8 column by gradient elution using acetonitrile and 0.025% (v/v) phosphoric acid solution as mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Salvianolic acid B, danshensu and internal standards were detected at 281 nm, while the detection of tanshinone IIA was carried out at 272 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r(2) > 0.999) within test ranges. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification for danshensu, salvianolic acid B and tanshinone IIA in plasma were 0.065, 0.043, 0.022, 0.131, 0.085 and 0.044 mu g/mL, respectively. This is the first report on the determination and pharmacokinetic study of danshensu, salvianolic acid B and tanshinone IIA in rat plasma and the results indicated that this method was reliable for the determination of the major active components of danshen in rat plasma.

We found that myostatin could activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in both proliferating and differentiating C2C12 cells. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) knockdown, the myostatin-induced JNK activation was significantly reduced, indicating that ActRIIB was required for JNK activation by myostatin. Transfection of C2C12 cells with TAK1-specific siRNA reduced myostatin-induced JNK activation. In addition, JNK could not be activated by myostatin when the expression of MKK4 was suppressed with MKK4-specific siRNA, suggesting that TAK1-MKK4 cascade was involved in myostatin-induced JNK activation. We also found that blocking JNK signaling pathway by pretreatment with JNK specific inhibitor SP600125, attenuated myostatin-induced upregulation of p21 and downregulation of the differentiation marker gene expression. Furthermore, it was also observed that the presence of SP600125 almost annulled the growth inhibitory role of myostatin.

Characterization of alpha-gliadin genes from diploid wheats and the comparative analysis with those from polyploid wheats	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							GLUTENIN SUBUNIT GENES; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCES; DISULFIDE BONDS; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; CHROMOSOME ASSIGNMENT; FAMILY-STRUCTURE; PROTEINS; LOCATION; LOCI; DNA	To carry out comparative analysis of the alpha-gliadin genes on A genomes of diploid and polyploid wheats, 8 full-length alpha-gliadin genes, including 3 functional genes and 5 pseudogenes, were obtained from diploid wheats, among which 2, 2 and 4 alpha-gliadin genes were isolated from T. urartu, T. monococcum, and T. boeoticum, respectively. The results indicated that higher number of alpha-gliadin pseudogenes have been present in diploid wheats before the formation of polyploid wheats. Amino acid sequence comparative analysis among 26 alpha-gliadin genes, including 16 functional genes and 10 pseudogenes, from diploid and polyploid wheats was conducted. The results indicated that all alpha-gliadins contained four coeliac toxic peptide sequences (i.e., PSQQ, QQQP, QQPY, and QPYP). The polyglutamine domains are highly variable, and the second polyglutamine stretch is usually disrupted by the lysine or arginine residue at the fourth position. The unique domain I is the most conserved domain. There are four and two conserved cysteine residues in the unique domains I and II, respectively. Comparative analysis indicated that the functional alpha-gliadin genes from A genome are highly conserved, whereas the identity of pseudogenes in diploid wheats are higher than those in hexaploid wheats. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the analyzed functional alpha-gliadin genes could be clustered into two major groups, among which one group could be further divided into 5 subgroups. The origin of alpha-gliadin pseudogene and functional genes were also discussed.

PNA is a 2-amine-9-(2,3-dideoxy-2,3-dihydro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-6-methoxy-9H-purine. Methods: The Sichuan Mallard ducklings in the hepatitis B virus model were treated with PNA, a new antiviral agent. DHBV DNA from the blood serum and liver tissues were measured at 0, 5, and 10 d during the treatment and at 3 d withdrawal by real-time PCR. The duck hepatitis B surface antigen (DHBsAg) in the liver cells was observed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Pathological changes in the liver tissues were also observed. Control group I was administered with distilled water and control group II was administered with 3-thiacytidine. Treatment group I was administered with PNA at a dose of 40 mg/kg and treatment group II was administered perorally (po) with PNA at a dose of 80 mg/kg. Treatment group III was administered with PNA at a dose of 20 mg/kg and treatment group IV was intravenously administered with PNA at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Each group contained 15 ducklings. Results: PNA can significantly lower the DHBV replication levels in serum and liver. Compared with control group II, there were no significant differences in inhibiting efficacy in treatment groups I and III (P > 0.05) and there were significant differences in inhibiting efficacy in treatment groups II and IV (P < 0.05). Interestingly, significant differences were observed at 3 d withdrawal. The DHBV replication levels in each group slightly increased at 3 d withdrawal, but rebounded slightly in the PNA treatment groups than in control group II (P < 0.05). The DHBV replication levels in the treatment groups were lower than in control group I. The DHBV replication levels in sera had a positive relationship with that in the liver, but the DHBV replication levels in the liver was lower than that in sera. Pathological changes in the treatment groups were obviously improved and the changes were associated with liver viral DNA levels. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that PNA is a strong inhibitor of DHBV replication in the DHBV-infected duck model.

This study was conducted to characterize the genetic basis of DRTs in soybean (Glycine max) using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Methods A population of 96 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cultivated (ssp. max) x wild (ssp. soja) cross was used for mapping and QTL analysis. Nine DRTs were examined in 2004 and 2005. A linkage map was constructed with 282 markers by the Kosambi function, and the QTL was detected by composite interval mapping. Key Results The early flowering and determinate habit derived from the max parent were each controlled by one major QTL, corresponding to the major genes for maturity (e1) and determinate habit (dt1), respectively. There were only one or two significant QTLs for twinning habit, pod dehiscence, seed weight and hard seededness, which each accounted for approx. 20-50% of the total variance. A comparison with the QTLs detected previously indicated that in pod dehiscence and hard seededness, at least one major QTL was common across different crosses, whereas no such consistent QTL existed for seed weight. Conclusions Most of the DRTs in soybeans were conditioned by one or two major QTLs and a number of genotype-dependent minor QTLs. The common major QTLs identified in pod dehiscence and hard seededness may have been key loci in the domestication of soybean. The evolutionary changes toward larger seed may have occurred through the accumulation of minor changes at many QTLs. Since the major QTLs for DRTs were scattered across only six of the 20 linkage groups, and since the QTLs were not clustered, introgression of useful genes from wild to cultivated soybeans can be carried out without large obstacles.

In the experiment, 24 male LandrancexYorksliire weanling pigs were allotted to three groups of 8 animals each. Pigs were fed individually. According to a single factorial arrangement, pigs received diets with 5% of either fresh (group I and group 3) or oxidized fish oil (peroxide value was 786.50 meq O-2/kg before inclusion in the diet, group 2). At the beginning of the experiment, pigs in group 3 received an intraperitoneal injection of diquat at 12 mg/kg of body weight. The trial lasted for 26 d. A metabolism test was carried out during the last 4 days of the second week. The results showed that feeding diets containing oxidized fish oil or injection with diquat depressed the growth performance and nutrient digestibilities of weanling pigs, decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased concentration of malondialdehyde in plasma and liver. Intraperitoneal injection of diquat would induce more serious oxidative stress than oral intake of oxidized fish oil in the diet. In conclusion, administration of oxidized fish oil or diquat could induce oxidative stress in weanling pigs, and oxidative stress could depress growth performance and impact anti-oxidative ability of young pigs.

By the analyses of DNA release percentage (PR), DNA breakage level (L), average molecular weight of breakage DNA and DNA fragment distribution, the results showed that DNA fragments were obviously distributed into two regions in the different irradiation condition. This suggestes that there are some sensitive points to neutron radiation in the Bacillus substilis var. niger molecule. The DNA release percentage, DNA breakage level and the content of DNA fragments in different region varied regularly in some extent with change of the neutron radiation dose or dose rate.

Here we report a new triticale, named Fenzhi- 1, derived from the wide cross MY I I (Triticum aestivum) x Jingzhou (Secale cereale) after the in vitro rye pollen has been irradiated by He-Ne laser. Morphologically, Fenzhi-l is characterized by branched-spikes. Genetically, Fenzhi- I displays stable fertility and immunity to wheat powdery mildew and stripe rust. In situ hybridization (FISH) and seed storage protein clectrophoresis revealed that Fenzhi- I is a new primary hexaploid triticale (AABBRR). The present study not only provides a new method to synthesize an artificial species, but also shows that Fenzhi- I could be a valuable source for wheat improvement.

We have investigated whether glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) affects the in vitro maturation ( IVM) of porcine oocytes and their subsequent ability to sustain preimplantation embryo development. GDNF and both its coreceptors, GDNF family receptor alpha-1 ( GFR alpha-1) and the rearranged during transformation ( RET) receptor, were expressed in oocytes and their surrounding cumulus cells derived from small and large follicles. When included in IVM medium, GDNF significantly enhanced cumulus cell expansion of both small and large cumulus-oocyte complexes and increased the percentage of small follicle-derived oocytes maturing to the metaphase II stage, although nuclear maturation of large oocytes was not significantly affected. Examination of cyclin B1 protein expression as a measure of cytoplasmic maturation revealed that in the presence of GDNF, cyclin B1 levels were significantly increased in large follicle-derived oocytes, as well as in oocytes from small follicles to a level comparable to the untreated large group. After activation, a significantly higher percentage of both small and large oocytes that were matured in the presence of GDNF developed to the blastocyst stage compared with untreated controls. Indeed, GDNF enhanced the blastocyst rate of small oocytes to levels comparable to those obtained for large oocytes matured without GDNF. The effect of GDNF was specific; this was evident because its enhancement of nuclear maturation and embryo developmental potential was blocked by an antibody against GFR alpha-1. Our study provides the first functional evidence that GDNF affects oocyte maturation and preimplantation embryo developmental competence in a follicular stage-dependent manner. This finding may provide insights for improving the formulation of IVM culture systems, especially for oocytes from small follicles.

QTLs were characterized in a population of 200 F-2:4 lines, derived from selfing the F-2 plants, and were evaluated with two replications in two environments. QTL mapping analysis of plant height was performed by using QTLMapper 2.0 software. Three main-effect QTLs and seven pairs of distinctly epistatic loci included a total of fourteen QTLs were located on seven chromosomes. QTL main effects of additive, dominance, and additive x additive, additive x dominance, and dominance x dominance interactions were estimated. Interaction effects between QTL main effects and QTL x environments (QE) were also predicted. Less than 30% of single effects for identified QTLs were significant at 5% level. The information about epistatic QTLs and QE interaction will facilitate marker assisted selection for plant height breeding programs in maize.	[Zhang, Z. M.; Rong, T. Z.; Pan, G.

Results from electrophoresis indicated that the recessive waxy gene was wx, derived from the dominant non-waxy gene Wx by mutation at its 3' end. The sequence of the mutated 3' end was amplified by the TAIL-PCR technique. Sequence alignment showed that the mutation of the wx gene was caused by transposition of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene rf2. Two pairs of specific primers were designed on the basis of the sequence difference between the dominant gene Wx and its mutated recessive allele wx and used as intragenic selection markers to identify individual plants of genotypes WxWx, Wxwx, and wxwx by PCR amplification from the segregating population of the F-2 generation crossed between waxy and non-waxy inbred lines. Iodine solution staining and starch component assay showed that all the 35 F-2 plants identified as genotype WxWx produced non-waxy kernels of the F-3 generation and that all 33 F-2 plants identified as genotype wxwx produced waxy kernels of the F-3 generation. This result can be used to improve the selection efficiency of waxy maize breeding and for selection of other single genes and major polygenes.

To understand the structural complexity of storage protein loci, we sequenced and analyzed orthologous regions containing both gliadin and LMW-glutenin genes from the A and B genomes of a tetraploid wheat species, Triticum turgidum ssp. durum. Despite their physical proximity to one another, the gliadin genes and LMW-glutenin genes are organized quite differently. The gliadin genes are found to be more clustered than the LMW-glutenin genes which are separated from each other by much larger distances. The separation of the LMW-glutenin genes is the result of both the insertion of large blocks of repetitive DNA owing to the rapid amplification of retrotransposons and the presence of genetic loci interspersed between them. Sequence comparisons of the orthologous regions reveal that gene movement could be one of the major factors contributing to the violation of microcolinearity between the homoeologous A and B genomes in wheat. The rapid sequence rearrangements and differential insertion of repetitive DNA has caused the gene islands to be not conserved in compared regions. In addition, we demonstrated that the i-type LMW-glutenin originated from a deletion of 33-bps in the 5' coding region of the m-type gene. Our results show that multiple rounds of segmental duplication of prolamin genes have driven the amplification of the omega-gliadin genes in the region; such segmental duplication could greatly increase the repetitive DNA content in the genome depending on the amount of repetitive DNA present in the original duplicate region.

(2n = 14, DD) without embryo rescue and hormone treatment. The F-1 plants had an average seed set of 25%. Approximately 96% of the F-2 seeds were able to germinate normally and about 67% of the F-2 plants were spontaneous amphidiploid (2n = 42, AABBDD). Cytological analysis of male gametogenesis of the F-1 plants showed that meiotic restitution is responsible for the high fertility. A mitosis-like meiosis led to meiotic restitution at either of the two meiotic divisions resulting in unreduced gametes. Test crosses of the T. t. turgidum-Ae. tauschii amphidiploid with Ae. variabilis and rye suggested that the mitosis-like meiosis is controlled by one or more nuclear genes that continue to function in derived lines. This discovery indicates a potential application of such genes in producing double haploids.

A total of 429 bands were amplified, and 355 bands (about 82.7%) were polymorphic. Five to forty-one polymorphic bands could be amplified by each primer, with an average of 16.1 polymorphic bands per primer. The results showed that the polymorphism of the safflower germplasm was higher at the DNA level. All the 48 accessions could be distinguished by ISSR markers and were divided into 9 groups based on ISSR GS by using UPGMA method. The genetic relationships among the accessions from different continents were closer. Comparatively, the genetic diversity of the accessions originated from Asia was higher, from Europe assembled. The results also showed that the genetic variation of accessions from Indian and Middle Eastern safflower diversity centers were relatively higher. ISSR is an effective and promising marker system for detecting genetic diversity among safflower and give some useful information on its phylogenic relationships.

The sequence of N-terminal domain showed high homology in both x- and y-type subunits. Sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain of y-type subunits suggested that they shared similar primary structure with each other, not only in the length variation of the N-terminal domain but also they have less variation in amino acids in this domain than those of x-type subunits. Analysis of the x-type HMW-GSs genes revealed that there were three conservative HMW-GSs gene groups with distinct fragments at the beginning of the N-terminal domains of ORFs, defined by the presence or absence of 24 bp fragment, and the presence of 15 bp fragment, respectively. The frequency of mutations in the x-type and y-type HMW-GSs genes was 1.89 and 1.25 out of 10 bases, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the y-type HMW-GSs did not contain enough variation for evolutionary analyses. It is obvious that the HMW-GSs encoded by genes of A, B and D genomes in common wheat formed three clusters. The x-type HMW-GSs from Aegilops bicornis, Aegilops comosa, Aegilops cylindrica, Aegilops umbellulata and Aegilops uniaristata were more closely related to the subunits from the D genome rather than those from the B genome.

Erysiphe graminis f.sp.tritici) and Puccinia striiformis Westend., respectively, are two important fungal diseases of wheat in many regions in the world that cause significant annual yield losses. In the present study, a dominant powdery mildew and a dominant stripe rust resistance gene in wheat line 101-3 which derived from the progenies of the wide cross between common wheat and Dasypyrum villosum Candary L., was located on chromosome 6B and 1B, respectively, by monosomic analyses. The two genes are different from known resistance genes on chromosome 6B for powdery mildew and 1B for stripe rusts, suggesting that the two genes might be novel resistance genes for powdery mildew and stripe rust, respectively. It is uncertain whether the two genes are allelic or lined with other resistance genes located on chromosome 6B for powdery mildew and 1B for stripe rust. Further allelism tests are necessary to determine the relationships between the resistance gene and other genes located on chromosome 6B for powdery mildew and 1B for stripe rust through molecular markers.

These sequences had 375 nucleotides in length, among which there were 255 conserved sites, 50 singleton variable sites (the nucleotide polymorphism only observed in a single accession) and 70 polymorphic sites (the polymorphisms found in two or more accessions). The frequency of SNPs in the B (a.k.a. S) genomes coding alpha-amylase inhibitor genes was 1.7 out of 10 bases. A total of 59 haplotypes were defined, among which 4 main haplotypes occurring in more than 10 genes and 36 haplotypes with single gene were found, indicating that the dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors might derive from a very limited number of ancestral genes. The phylogenetic median-joining network of the 59 haplotypes was highly star like with 5 haplotype groups, and at least 2 sub clusters emerged. Evolutionary distances of the 159 genes were calculated, and subjected to the construction of neighbour-joining trees that showed that the alpha-amylase inhibitor genes were divided into 5 groups, and each group had at least 2 subgroups. The neighbour-joining tree of the species indicated that the genes from common wheat and Triticum dicoccoides were closely related to those from Aegilops speltoides, and it was further supported by the median-joining networks analysis of the 59 haplotypes. These results revealed the important information on genome shaping events and processes occurring at dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes loci and contributed to our understanding of functional aspects of the dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes, as well as phylogenetic relationships between species.

One hundred twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats (280 to 320 g) were randomly assigned to sham, focal cerebral ischemia and focal Cerebral ischemia treated with HBO groups. Brain water content, neurological function, rnorphology and molecular biological markers were assessed. HBO (100% O-2, 2.5 atmosphere absolute for 2 h) was initiated at 1 h after focal cerebral ischernia. Rats were killed at 24 h to harvest tissues for Western blot or for histology. In HBO-treated animals, an enhanced ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax and a reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in the hippocampus after focal cerebral ischernia were observed. These results indicate that HBO provides brain protection that is probably associated with the inhibition of HIF-1 alpha and the elevation of Bcl-2. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fifty Pekin ducks were inoculated subcutaneously with a virulent strain of DEV. The morphology of lymphoid organs of these infected ducks was observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Cell death by classical necrosis was observed in lymphocytes of the DEV-infected thymus, BF, and spleen. Lymphocyte apoptosis also was observed at the same time, and it was further confirmed by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling and agarose gel electrophoresis. We conclude that apoptosis and necrosis of lymphocytes induced by DEV infection resulted in the depletion of lymphocytes and that apoptosis of lymphocytes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of duck viral enteritis.

The sequences fell into two known groups, here assigned to two unit classes, viz. long, R1 and short R1 (designations to reflect on R haplome of rye). The different taxa could not be fully differentiated based on the 5S DNA units. We searched for 5S DNA sequences from known unit classes most closely similar to the long R1 and the short R1. One set with the long R1 unit class contained sequences of the long P1 unit class from Agropyron (P haplome) and from Kengyilia (StYP haplome), long J1 from Thinopyrum (J haplome), whereas the set with the short R1 included the long S1 from Pseudoroegneria (St haplome) and Kengyilia (StYP haplome), the short J1 from Thinopyrum (J haplome) and the short V1 from Dasypyrum (V haplome). Each of the two sets was analyzed separately by maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis from which we were able to infer that the 5S DNA units of Secale differentiated in a non-clock fashion and followed the HKY substitution model in the gene tree with the long R1 unit class and the HKY + G in the gene tree with the short R1 unit class. A complementary Bayesian analysis yielded identical tree topologies to the ML ones for each of the two sequence sets. In the tree with the long R1 units the long Pl. and long J1 unit classes were closest to the long R1 unit class, whereas in the tree with the short R1 units the long S1 and short J1 unit classes were closest to the short R1 unit class, indicating pos.sibly a close relationship between the St, J and R haplomes.

The seven strains in this group showed similar protein patterns and were different from defined Mesorhizobium species in SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins. The representative strain CCBAU 61158(T) formed a novel Mesorhizobium lineage in phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, atpD, g1n11 and nifH genes. However, its nodC gene sequence was more similar to that of Rhizobium gallicum R602sp(T) than to those of Mesorhizobium species. DNA-DNA relatedness between CCBAU 61158(T) and reference strains of defined Mesorhizobium species was lower than 34.1 %. These results indicated that this Mesorhizobium group was a unique genomic species. The subtropical distribution, host origin, PCR-RFLP patterns of 16S rRNA genes, fatty acid profile and a series of phenotypic characteristics could be used as distinctive features of this group, This group is therefore proposed as a novel species, Mesorhizobium albiziae sp. nov., with CCBAU 61158(T) (= LMG 23507(T) =USDA 4964(T)) as the type strain.

Identification of AvaI polymorphisms in the third intron of GH gene and their associations with abdominal fat in chickens	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						chicken; growth hormone gene; polymorphism; carcass trait; abdominal fat	GROWTH-HORMONE GENE; DNA POLYMORPHISMS; SELECTION; SOMATOTROPIN; CATTLE	Growth hormone (GH) plays a diverse role in animals together with other hormones of somatotropic axis. In the current research, chicken GH (cGH) as a candidate gene affecting carcass traits was investigated in the chickens from 2 local chicken breeds [Mountainous Black-Bone (Wugu) and Caoke chicken] in the Sichuan province, 1 pure line of a quality chicken (Sanhuang chicken) from the Guangdong province, and commercial crossbreds. The RFLP method was used to identify polymorphisms of the cGH gene. Three restriction enzyme polymorphic sites were detected in the cGH gene. Sequence alignment from GenBank revealed 2 mutations in the third intron of the cGH gene, which were identified by the AvaI enzyme. Two novel AvaI polymorphic sites were genotypied in 240 chickens from the above-mentioned chicken populations. One EcoRV polymorphic site, the previously reported polymorphism, was also detected in these popu-lations. Significant differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies among all the chicken populations were observed. In AvaI polymorphic sites, allele A2 and B1 had higher frequencies than allele A1 and B2, respectively. In EcoRV polymorphic sites, the frequency of allele N2 was higher than that of allele N1. Associations of polymorphisms of the cGH gene with carcass traits were analyzed by using a GLM procedure. Significant associations were found between AvaI genotypes or combined genotypes and abdominal fat weight and abdominal fat percentage(P = 0.05). The allele A2 and B1 had a beneficial effect on increasing the live BW, breast muscle weight, and breast muscle percentage while decreasing the abdominal fat weight, abdominal fat percentage, and s. c. fat thickness. No significant associations were observed between EcoRV genotypes and carcass traits. In conclusion, the cGH gene may be a potential marker affecting the abdominal fat trait of chickens.

Comparison of the regression analysis technique and the substitution method for the determination of true phosphorus digestibility and faecal endogenous phosphorus losses associated with feed ingredients for growing pigs	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Digestive Physiology in Pigs	MAY 25-27, 2006	Vejle, DENMARK			phosphorus digestibility; faccal endogenous loss; feed; growing pigs	OUTPUTS; DIETS	Two digestibility experiments were carried out to comparatively measure true phosphorus (P) digestibility and the faecal endogenous P loss associated with soybean meat (SBM) and wheat middling meal (WM) for growing pigs by the simple linear regression analysis technique and the substitution method. Eight barrows, with an average initial body weight 21 kg, were randomly divided into two groups of four pigs with each group being fed four test diets according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Eight maize starch-based diets containing four levels (on dry matter basis) of P (0.20, 0.24, 0.3 6 and 0.42%) and P (0. 181, 0.26, 0.36, and 0.43 %) were formulated from SBM and WM as a sole source of P, respectively. Chromic oxide (0.30%) was used as a digestibility marker. Each experimental period comprised 8 d with a 4-d adaptation and a 4-d collection of faecal samples. Levels of the assay ingredient substitutions had no effects (P > 0.05) on true P digestibility and the endogenous P loss associated with SBM and WM measured by the substitution method. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between the regression technique and the substitution method in measuring the true P digestibility (SBM: 49.4 +/- 3.51 vs. 50.6 +/- 2.4; WM: 63.7 +/- 5.0 vs. 63.2 +/- 5.4%) as well as the faecal endogenous P loss (SBM: 0.62 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.11 WM: 0.65 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.17 g/kg dry matter intake) for the growing pig. Thus, true P digestibility and the faecal endogenous P loss in feed ingredients for pigs may be measured by using the regression analysis technique and the substitution method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In order to investigate the relationship of structure and function of extracellular protease, the effects of protein modification reagents on the S. maltophilia extracellular protease activity have been studied. The chemical modification of extracellular protease of S. maltophilia was studied with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), N-acetylimidazole (N-AI), chloramine-T (Ch-T), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) as the modification reagents. The results indicated that the protease was not affected by N-AI, PMSF and PCMB, but Ch-T, NBS and 2-ME could reduce the activity significantly. It implied that Ser, Tyr and sulfhydryl residues were not activity dependent groups, while Met, Trp and disulfide linkage groups played an important role in the activity of extracellular protease. Meanwhile, EDTA, Mg2+, Ca2+, Hg2+ and Cu2+ could reduce the activity obviously, which showed that the enzyme was a metalloproteinase.

The enrichment of leucocytes and the adsorption of genomic DNA can be achieved with the same carboxyl-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. The DNA bound to the bead surfaces can be used directly as PCR templates. By coupling cell separation and DNA purification, the whole operation can be accomplished in a few minutes. Our simplified protocols proved to be rapid, low cost, and biologically and chemically non-hazardous, and are therefore promising for microfabrication of a DNA-preparation chip and routine laboratory use.

However, the relationship between P accumulation and urban development process is largely unknown. This study investigated the influence of urban development on the P accumulation in urban and suburban soils, using Nanjing (China) as a case. Based on its urban development history, Nanjing was divided into suburban and urban area, and the urban area was subdivided into urban north and urban south. Soil total P (TP) and available P (AP) of 578 samples from 68 pedons at different locations were measured. Thickness-weighted mean P content of each pedon (Pw), P content of the surface soil layer (Ps), the highest P content of each pedon (ph), and the lowest P content (PI) of each pedon were selected as statistical indices. Compared with the background value, urban and suburban soils were enriched in P. The highest TP content was up to 11.14 g Pkg(-1), and the highest AP content was up to 360 mg Pkg-1. However, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons of P, P, Ph, P, showed that urban south with longest residential history had the highest TPw, TPS Tp(h), and AP(w), AP, contents, and urbanizing suburban had the lowest TPw and APw, AP, contents. For both APs and Ap(h), there was no significant difference between suburban and urban area. However, significant differences between urban south and urban north were observed. The results demonstrated that urban development process, including population quantity and level of urban infrastructure, could influence soil P accumulation and distribution in urban environment. A more detailed assessment is required to avoid the potential secondary eutrophication caused by excess P release from those anthropogenic high-P soils.

In experiment I, the effects of various vitrification solutions (VS) on embryo survival were examined. After thawing, the expanded blastocyst rates (97.59 and 95.05%) and hatching rates (80.48 and 78.95%) achieved in the EDFS30 [15% ethylene glycol (EG), 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Ficoll, and sucrose] and EFS40 [40% EG, Ficoll, and sucrose] groups were no different from those (96.15% and 83.33%) of the control group. However, the rates in the EFS30 [30% EG, Ficoll, and sucrose] (87.80 and 55.43%) and EDFS40 [20% EG, 20% DMSO, Ficoll, and sucrose] (95.69 and 70.97%) groups were significantly lower than those (96.15 and 83.33%) of the control group (P<0.05). In the experiment II, the effects of the volume of VS in the OPS on the survival of embryos after in-straw thawing were investigated. When the length of the VS in the column was less than 1 cm, the in vitro viability of embryos thawed by stepwise in-straw dilution was no different among the experimental and control groups. The embryos could be successfully thawed by immersing the OPS in 0.5 M sucrose for 3 min and then 0.25M sucrose for 2 min. In experiment III, the effect of immersion time of the OPS in diluent (PBS) on the viability of vitrified embryos was investigated. After in-straw thawing, OPSs were immersed immediately in 1 ml PBS for 0 to 30 min. When the immersion time of the OPSs in PBS was less than 12 min, in vitro development of the in-straw thawed embryos was no different from that of the controls. In experiment IV, in-straw thawed blastocysts were directly transferred to pseudopregnant mice to examine their in vivo developmental viability. The pregnancy (91.67%) and birth rates (42.42%) of embryos in-straw thawed and directly transferred were no different from those of the unvitrified controls (90.90 and 40%) and embryos thawed by the conventional method (84.61 and 46.94%). These results demonstrate that mouse embryos vitrified with OPS could be successfully thawed by stepwise in-straw dilution and transferred directly to a recipient and that this method might be a model for field manipulation of vitrified embryos in farm animals.

All the species studied here have only one copy of Acc1 gene except Hystrix patula that has two copies, Hy. patina pla1 and Hy. patula pla2. Hy. patula pla1 was grouped with the St-genome species (excluded Elymus wawawaiensis), Thinopyrum bessarabicum and Lophopyrum elongatum. Hy. patula plat was clustered with E. wawawaiensis and Hordeum bogdanii. Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei ssp. duthiei and Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata are closely related to the species of Leymus. The species with same nucleotide acid compositions within the element form a group. It is concluded that: (1) Hy. patula contains the StH genomes; (2) Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei ssp. duthiei and Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata have the NsXm genomes; (3) the Xm genome in Leymus is different from the E-b and E-e genome; (4) Th. bessarabicum and Lo. elongatum are related to the Pseudoroegneria species. These results are consistent with those obtained from morphological and cytological studies. Therefore, the Acc1 gene is a potentially valuable source for phylogenetic analysis in Triticeae.

A few exceptions to this principle have been reported, but most of them are restricted to either a limited set of specific genes or specific types of alleles. Here, we show that a rice triploid and diploid hybridization resulted in stable diploid progenies, both in genotypes and phenotypes, through gene homozygosity. Furthermore, their gene homozygosity can be inherited through 8 generations, and they can convert DNA sequences of other rice varieties into their own. Molecular-marker examination confirmed that this type of genome-wide gene conversion occurred at a very high frequency.

The target genes for microarray were generated from Salmonella isolates by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. The specificity of the microarray was tested using 11 positive DNA probes. The sensitivity was tested with tetA gene and Salmonella isolates. Using detection threshold of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) >= 1.5 or median pixel intensity 1000, antimicrobial resistance genes carried by 30 Salmonella isolates were detected. Common genes included sul I (76.7%, 23/30), aph (3')-IIa (60%, 18/30), tetC (60%, 18/30), catI (43.3%, 13/30), tetA (40%, 12/30) and aadAl (36.7%, 11/30), and the results were confirmed to be correct by PCR.

Twenty-five samples were further selected for partial (420 bp) cytochrome b sequencing based on control region sequence information. Two yak samples shared sequences with Chinese cattle (Bos taurus); the remaining yak mtDNAs converged into two major clades in the phylogenetic analysis. Genetic diversity varied substantially among the breeds, with the hybrid Pianniu yak demonstrating the highest diversity. Our results suggest that the Chinese yak was domesticated from two distinct matrilineal sources or from a heterogeneous pool containing both divergent lineages, with occasional gene introgression from cattle.

Meiotic pairing in the hybrids H. patula x H. duthiei ssp. longearistata (Ns-), H. patula x Pseudoroegneria spicata (St), H. patula x Pse. libanotica (St), Elymus sibiricus (StH) x H. patula, H. patula x E. wawawaiensis (StH), Roegneria ciliaris (StY) x H. patula, H. patula x R. grandis (StY), and H. patula x Psathyrostachys huashanica (Ns(h)) averaged 1.32, 6.53, 5.62, 10.08, 12.83, 3.57, 3.98, and 0.29 bivalents per cell, respectively. The results indicate that: (1) H. patula has no genome homology with H. duthiei ssp. longearistata or the Ns genome from Psathyrostachys; (2) H. patula contains the same StH genomes as the Elymus species, and the St genome is homologous to the genome of Pse. spicata and Pse. libanotica; and (3) H. patula has a low genome affinity with the StY genomes of Roegneria.

Speer). Very little is known about the effects of below- and aboveground interspecific interactions on wheat nitrogen (N) nutrition and occurrence of wheat powdery mildew. A greenhouse pot experiment examined four N application rates and three belowground partition types (plastic film, nylon mesh partition or no partition) to study N nutrition and interactions between wheat and faba bean growing together. A field experiment investigated three N application rates and growth of wheat in monoculture and intercropped with faba bean with or without belowground plastic film partitions between wheat and faba bean. Disease incidence (DI) and disease severity index (DSI) were assessed at flowering stage and wheat leaves were sampled and analyzed for N. Foliar N was enhanced substantially by N addition in greenhouse and field conditions and also by belowground interactions (no partition compared with plastic film partition) in the pot experiment (all P < 0.001). There was a significant synergistic effect between N rate and belowground interactions on the enhancement of wheat N uptake (P < 0.01) in the pot experiment. DI and DSI of mildew increased markedly with increasing N rate in both experiments (all P < 0.001). In the pot experiment DI and DSI showed no marked differences among belowground partitions (both P > 0.05) but belowground interactions had different effects under different N rates, limiting disease occurrence under 0, 0.1 and 0.2 g N kg(-1) soil but promoting disease with 0.05 g added N kg(-1) soil. In the field experiment DI and DSI showed no significant differences between wheat monoculture and intercropping (both P > 0.05). However, the contributions of below- and aboveground interactions to disease control were different under different N rates, with interspecific root interactions increasing DI and DSI under different N rates and aboveground interactions increasing DI and DSI under zero-N application but decreasing DI and DSI at 150 and 300 kg N ha(-1). The data suggest that the microclimate in the field and biological control mechanisms due to belowground interactions in wheat-faba bean associations may influence the incidence and severity of wheat powdery mildew.

In this experiment, lmbr1 was taken as the candidate gene affecting chicken growth and carcass traits. T/C and G/A mutations located in exon 16 and one A/C mutation located in intron 5 of chicken lmbr1 were detected from Silky, White Plymouth Rock broilers and their F-2 crossing chickens by PCR-SSCP and sequencing methods. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results suggests that T/C polymorphism of exon 16 had significant association with eviscerated yield rate (EYR), gizzard rate (GR), shank and claw rate (SCR) and shank girth (SG); A/C polymorphism of intron 5 was significantly associated with SCR, liver rate and head-neck weight (HNW), while both sites had no significant association with other growth and carcass traits. These results demonstrate that lmbr1 gene could be a genetic locus or linked to a major gene significantly affecting these growth and carcass traits in chicken.

The results showed that RVA was a reliable fast technique for determining thin hydration curve of PK flour. The test conditions determining the hydration curves were optimized at the concentration of PK flour with 1.0%, test temperature at 30 +/- 1 degrees C, stirring speed at 160 RPM (Revolution Per Minute), and test time of 16 min. An empirical exponential model has also been established to describe the dissolution kinetics of PK flour at the concentration of 1.0%: eta = 161.9343 center dot EXP (-2.1522/tau) (R-2=0.9762) Where T tau is the lest time (min); 9 is the viscosity of the hydration process (RVU) of PK flour. The results also showed that a sign ficant difference among the hydration curves of 1.0% PK flour when dispersed in distilled water and in different concentrations of sucrose aqueous solution.

As microsatellites are highly polymorphic and play a vital role in gene function and recombination, they are an attractive subject for research in evolution and in the genetics and breeding of animals and plants. Orphan genes have no known homologs in existing databases. Using bioinformatic computation and statistical analysis, we identified 19,26 orphan genes in the rice ( Oryza sativa ssp. Japanica cv. Nipponbare) proteome. We found that a larger proportion of orphan genes are expressed after sexual maturation and under environmental pressure than nonorphan genes. Orphan genes generally have shorter protein lengths and intron size, and are faster evolving. Additionally, orphan genes have fewer PROSITE patterns with larger pattern sizes than those in nonorphan genes. The average microsatellite content and the percentage of trinucleotide repeats in orphan genes are also significantly higher than in nonorphan genes. Microsatellites are found less often in PROSITE patterns in orphan genes. Taken together, these orphan gene characteristics suggest that microsatellites play an important role in orphan gene evolution and expression. Copyright (C) 2007.

A delayed leaf senescence line, designated line 269, was generated from T-2 generation plants. PCR and Southern blot analysis indicated that the foreign DNA fragment was successfully integrated into the rice genome. By classic genetic linkage analysis, the introduced PPF1 gene was also proved to be inherited as a single Mendelian factor and to be the cause of the delayed leaf senescence-delaying phenotype. RT-PCR results also suggested that PPF1 expressed stably in this transgenic line. As a result, apparent inhibition of the process of leaf senescence was observed. Chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, and stoma conductance were also significantly or very significant improved in line 269. Significantly improvements in panicle weight, and 1,000-grain weight, yield per plant, and seed-setting rate were also observed for this transgenic line. We thus believe that expression of PPF1 gene in rice suppressed leaf senescence and hence increased productivity, possibly by controlling chloroplast development.

Twenty-five primer pairs could amplify successfully in the 60 durum wheat accessions, of which tri-nucleotide repeats were the dominant type, and revealed 26 loci on all seven wheat homologous chromosome groups. A total of 87 eSSR alleles were detected, and the number of alleles detected by a single pair of primers ranged from 1 to 11, with an average of 3.3 alleles per locus. Higher numbers of alleles and PIC were identified on the B genome than those on the A genome.

Nanosized maghemite (y-Fe2O3, 7.0 +/- 1.0 nm) was synthesized using thermal co-precipitation method and subsequently coated with functional groups by one-step suspension copolymerization. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study and thermogravitmetric analyses confirmed the successful functionalization of carboxyl groups on the surface of magnetic nanocrystals. The surface chemistry makes it possible for SPRI (solid phase reversible immobilization)-based DNA purification. Thus the nanoparticles were employed to isolate plasmid DNA from bacterial cell culture and the results demonstrated its applicability in DNA preparation.
