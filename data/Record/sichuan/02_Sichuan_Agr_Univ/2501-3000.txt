Major quality trait analysis and QTL detection in hexaploid wheat in humid rain-fed agriculture	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Wheat; Quality; Humid; Rain-fed agriculture; QTL; Consensus map	GRAIN PROTEIN-CONTENT; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; MICROSATELLITE CONSENSUS MAP; DOUBLED HAPLOID POPULATION; ASSESSING GLUTEN STRENGTH; BREAD WHEAT; DURUM-WHEAT; BAKING QUALITY; CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION; WINTER-WHEAT	Humid rain-fed agriculture is a special environment for wheat (Triticum aestivum) culture that tends to negatively affect wheat yield and quality. To identify quality characters of wheat in a humid environment, we conducted quality analysis and quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection in a recombinant inbred line whose parent had a high level of quality for several years. We found that high-quality wheat had less gluten content and lower protein content. Apparently, wheat quality and associated quantity traits were in a dynamic state of equilibrium. We detected 83 QTL for 10 wheat quality traits in this recombinant inbred line population. Nine QTL were detected in both evaluation years; Q.DT.scau-2A, linked to Xwmc522-2A, was detected at the same genetic location in both years. Other QTL for different traits were detected simultaneously in more than one location. Consequently, there appeared to be pleiotropic genes that control wheat quality. Based on previous studies and our research on QTL analysis of grain protein content, we conclude that there must be one or more genes for grain protein content on chromosome 6B, whose expression was little affected by environment. We constructed a consensus map and projected the QTL on it. It was useful for choosing optimal markers for marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning.	[Li, H. M.; Tang, Z. X.; Zhang, H.

Effect of dietary Bacillus subtilis on proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in swine intestine and lipid metabolism	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Probiotics; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes; Lipid metabolism; Growth performance	FERMENTED MILK PRODUCT; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; MICROBIAL ECOLOGY; GUT MICROBIOME; SOYBEAN-MEAL; DISTAL GUT; PIGS; PROBIOTICS; OBESITY; RATS	The ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacterial groups in the gut can affect the ability to absorb nutrients. We investigated the effect of probiotic Bacillus subtilis supplementation of diets on growth performance, fat deposition, blood lipids, copy numbers, and percentage of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in cecal contents, as well as mRNA expression of key lipid metabolism enzymes in the liver and adipose tissue of finishing pigs. Twenty-four Duroc x Meishan crossbreed 8-week-old pigs (10.28 +/- 0.59 kg) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments: maize-soybean meal-based diets with B. subtilis (probiotic group) and without B. subtilis (control group). The probiotic diet led to a significant increase in the average daily gain and feed conversion ratio of pigs weighing 10 to 110 kg. The mean backfat depth was increased while leaf lard weights were decreased by probiotic supplementation. Ingestion of probiotics decreased the serum triglyceride and glucose concentrations, but did not change the levels of total cholesterol and free fatty acids in the serum. The mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC alpha) in the liver were down-regulated by the dietary probiotic supplement. Conversely, the gene expressions of FAS and ACC alpha in the adipose tissue increased. The probiotic diet decreased the copy numbers and percentage of Bacteroidetes, while it increased the percentage of Firmicutes in the cecal contents. We conclude that the addition of B. subtilis improves growth performance and up-regulates lipid metabolism in subcutaneous fat of finishing pigs. We conclude that B. subtilis affects lipid metabolism through regulation of the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the gut.	[Cui, C.; Jia, G.; Wang, K.

To develop a specific PCR for early detection of Haemophilus parasuis, early treatment would effectively prevent phenotypic expression of the disease. A pair of specific primers were designed to amplify a 414 bp specific DNA fragment based on H. parasuis Outer Membrane Protein (OMP) gene published in GenBank also the PCR conditions were optimized. The established PCR test could detect a minimum of 425 cfu mL(-1) (0.425 cfu/PCR reaction) pure cultures of H. parasuis and only H. parasuis could amplify a 414 bp specific DNA fragment. No amplification was observed while tested with the closely affiliated species and the mainly contaminating flora. From 2 days post infection (dpi) to 5 dpi, all of the piglets challenged with H. parasuis showed a fever above 41 degrees C and all blood samples from those feverish piglets were positive for H. parasuis. Through blood PCR detection, 37 positive samples were picked out in 84 sucking pigs which were natural infected with H. parasuis, the result was verified by dissecting five positive piglets and isolating bacteria from lung tissue. The developed PCR was successfully applied for early diagnosis of H. parasuis infection, early treatment will reduce the incidence and mortality of disease.

A total of 540 healthy M. albus (weigh, 21.7 +/- 2.1 g) were randomly assigned to six groups (3 replicates per group, 30 M. albus per replicate) and fed with dietary VD3 at various concentrations (0 (control), 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 IU kg(-1)). After 20, 40 and 60 days of feeding, researchers randomly selected six M. albus from each group and collected tissues (hepatopancreas, spleen, head kidney and hindgut) for detection of MHC-II-beta gene expression using real-time quantitative PCR. MHC-II-beta was expressed in four tissues with expression in the head kidney significantly higher (p<0.01) than that in the spleen, hindgut and hepatopancreas. At 20 days, the highest MHC-II-beta expression was detected in the 4,000 IU kg(-1) group in the head kidney and in the 2,000 IU kg(-1) group in the spleen, both of which were significantly higher than that of the other groups (p<0.05). At 40 days, the 1 000 IU kg(-1) group showed the highest MHC-II-beta expression in the head kidney, hindgut and hepatopancreas. At 60 days, the 500 IU kg(-1) group showed the highest MHC-II-beta expression in the head kidney and spleen and was significant higher than that of the control (p<0.05) while the 4,000 IU kg(-1) group showed significantly lower MHC-II-beta expression compared to the control (p<0.05). Relative to the MHC-II-beta expression in the head kidney, the results demonstrate that short-term (20 days) and high dose dietary provision of VD3 (4,000 IU kg(-1)) significantly increased MHC-II-beta expression in M. albus immune organs. However, the highest MHC-II-beta expression was observed with long-term (60 days) dietary provision of VD3 at a dose of 500 IU kg(-1).

Pigs present high similarity with humans and have been used as an ideal mammalian model the use of MZ twins is even more valuable. In the study, researchers present a systematic method for the stepwise exclusion of inconsistently genotyped individuals in a large population by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) genotyping. Five pairs of microsatellite markers with different fluorescent dyes were selected and their reliability was tested. The results demonstrate that the cumulative exclusion rate of all markers was 99.67% in 1,201 pigs; two pairs of MZ twins were initially identified.

Growth inhibition was observed, and relative water content in the developing cotyledons significantly decreased in the 100 mM NaCl treatment. Lower levels of NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+ in the cotyledons were recorded when they were supplied with 50 and 100 mM NaCl. Nitrate reductase activities decline by 9.5% to 31.8% with respect to the control groups. Salt treatment also led to a marked decrease in nitrite reductase activity compared with the controls. Glutamine synthase, glutamate synthetase and dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) were markedly induced by the addition of NaCl. These findings will be useful for elucidating the roles key enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation pathway of J. curcas plant.

This study is aimed at presenting an equilibrium-oriented housing supply management model that integrates housing supply and demand with time lag and reasonable vacancy area. For validity test of the model, Chengdu City was selected as a sample. The study establishes the feasibility of this model by demonstrating that optimized housing supply can narrow the gap between housing supply and demand. The implication of this finding is that planning of housing supply is an important management tool and that in applying this tool, local government should intervene in housing market to ensure scientific consideration of city's development mand.

The composite structure was confirmed by multiple characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and potentiometric titration methods. The characterization results suggest that Fe3O4 particles successfully bound on the surface of chitosan, and the EDTAD thoroughly modified the MC. Furthermore, EMC had more amino, carboxyl, and hydroxy groups than typical MC. Adsorption conditions, such as pH values, initial concentrations of MB, reaction temperature, and contact time were systematically examined. In comparison, the maximum adsorption capacity of EMC was approximately twice as much as that of MC. The recovery efficiency for EMC was >80% using 0.1 M HCl as an eluent solution. Therefore, the results reported herein indicate that EMC is very attractive and imply a practical application for dye wastewater treatment.

Factor analysis was used to reject relativity among the environmental indicators. Then, thirty nine industries were clustered into four clusters. Lastly, optimization model was used to plan the industrial structure. Adjusting the industrial structure, it is difficult to reduce vast SO2, smoke, and dust with total industrial output value growth; the air pollutant emission only can be decreased by 10%. The parameters of smoke emission are limited constrains for the optimization. The reasonable and feasible way to solve the problem is to introduce the lower smoke emission technique of the cluster 2 and 4 industries.

Eighteen growing barrows (initial BW 25.8 +/- 0.3 kg) from 9 litters were allotted by BW and litter to 1 of 2 dietary treatments with 9 pigs per treatment in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were individually placed in metabolism cages and fed diets based on the 2 corns. The DE and ME in PTC (3,967 and 3,941 kcal/kg of DM, respectively) were greater (P < 0.05) than those in CC (3,917 and 3,848 kcal/kg of DM, respectively). Experiment 2 was conducted to measure apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) values of CP and AA in the 2 corns. Eighteen growing barrows (initial BW 41.8 +/- 0.7 kg) were equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Pigs were placed in metabolism cages in a completely randomized design with 3 dietary treatments of 6 pigs each. An N-free diet was used to estimate basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. The AID and SID values for CP and all AA did not differ between the 2 corns. Experiment 3 was conducted to measure apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) values of P in the 2 corns. Eighteen growing pigs (initial BW 30.5 +/- 0.5 kg) from 6 litters were placed in metabolism cages in a randomized complete block design with 3 dietary treatments of 6 pigs each based on BW and litter. Two diets were based on the 2 corns, and a P-free diet was used to measure endogenous P losses. The ATTD and STTD values of P were greater (P < 0.05) in the PTC diet (71.4% and 76.9%, respectively) than those in the CC diet (27.6% and 33.4%, respectively). Pigs fed the PTC diet had a greater (P < 0.05) P retention (70.7%) than those fed the CC diet (27.1%). It was concluded that PTC had a greater digestibility of energy and P than CC for growing pigs. As a consequence, if PTC replaces CC in a pig diet, the DE and ME in the diet will increase, and less inorganic P will need to be supplemented to the diet, and thus P excretion in manure will be decreased.

To develop EGA-resistant varieties, introducing the desirable genes from related species is regarded as an efficient avenue. In this study, the F-1, F-2 and F-3 plants derived from the cross of EGA-susceptible wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo amphiploid (PHW-SA, AABBDDNsNs) and EGA-resistant triticale (Zhongsi 828, AABBRR) were analyzed for EGA resistance. Consequently, PHW-SA was moderately susceptible while Zhongsi 828 and their F-1 hybrids were immune, suggesting that the resistance is dominant. All the F-2 plants showed high resistance or immunity over two years, indicating that EGA resistance genes are more likely carried by the rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosomes rather than the genomes A or B of Zhongsi 828. In the F 3 generation, 25 of 239 lines became susceptible. Giemsa C-banding patterns revealed that these F-3 lines had 38-40 chromosomes, including complete rye genome except 5R (and 2R in five lines). Genomic in situ hybridization analysis confirmed this result. During meiosis, all the chromosomes formed bivalents. Six bivalents in 20 lines and five bivalents in five lines were characterized from rye. In contrast, their F-2 parental lines had 42 chromosomes (21 bivalents), containing 1R-7R of rye. No P. huashanica chromosomes were detected. Therefore, we propose that the rye chromosome 5R may be related to EGA resistance.

SEE; GAS SENSORS; INTEGRATED-CIRCUITS; ADSORPTION	Bottom contact organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) using SiO2 dielectric layer deposited on silicon wafer were fabricated for the gas sensor application. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) was used as an active layer of OTFT device to test current-voltage characteristics and gas-sensing properties of the device. When the device was exposed to the atmosphere of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at room temperature, the source-drain current changed within a few minutes at the appropriate gate voltage and drain voltage. The dependence of sensing properties on the thickness of the insulator layer was investigated. The results showed that the device with an insulator layer of 195 nm exhibited the optimum electronic and sensing properties comparing with other devices based on the insulator layer of 125 nm and 300 nm.

Furthermore, the effects of gender on the development of skeletal muscle and MRFs expression remain unknown. In this study, we identified the caprine Myf5, Myf6, MyoD and myogenin genes and quantified their expressions at six different postnatal time points by real-time RT-PCR. The sex has a marked effect on the expression differences of Myf5, MyoD and myogenin in the five investigated skeletal muscles, while minor influence on the expression difference of Myf6 except for Semitendinosus and Quadriceps femoris tissues (P<0.001). The histological sections of muscles revealed a constant increase of muscle fiber diameter with aging but non-significant differences between genders. We provide novel evidence for MRFs expression in age- and gender-dependent manners, which will contribute to prioritizing these genes as potential candidate genes for trait-associated study and provide a foundation for understanding the molecular control of skeletal muscle growth in goat species.

Evolutionary analysis of the short-type peptidoglycan-recognition protein gene (PGLYRP1) in primates	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Innate immunity; Molecular evolution; PGLYRP1 gene; Primate; Purifying selection; Positive selection	L-ALANINE AMIDASE; INNATE IMMUNITY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ANGSTROM RESOLUTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DROSOPHILA; INFECTION; FAMILY; PGRP; DNA	Short-type peptidoglycan (PGN)-recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), an innate immunity protein that directly breaks down the structure of microbial cell wall PGNs, plays an important role both in antibacterial defenses and several inflammatory diseases. To explore the adaptive evolution of the PGLYRP1 gene in primates and provide insight into the function of this antibacterial protein, we sequenced the entire PGLYRP1 gene from Macaca thibetana and Rhinopithecus roxellana, identified the corresponding sequences from the draft genome of 8 other primates, including humans, and conducted related statistical analyses. Homology analysis showed that the identity of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of PGLYRP1 among 10 primates ranged from 82.0 to 99.0% and 74.5 to 98.5%, respectively. The R value (transition/transversion) and disparity index per site also presented relatively low-base composition biases. Selective pressure analysis for the PGLYRP1 sequences among major primates revealed that both the whole gene and the substructure of PGLYRP1 are under strong purifying selection at similar levels of selective pressure among 6 major primate lineages (human, great ape, lesser ape, Old World monkey, New World monkey, and prosimian monkey). Using the Bayes empirical Bayes procedure, we also detected 2 positively selected codons (121L and 141T sites) that are independent of PGN-binding and PGLYRP-specific regions, implying 2 potential key sites for the functional effect of the PGLYRP1 protein. These results demonstrated that PGLYRP1 was highly conserved at the molecular level and subjected to strong functional constraints during primate evolution.	[Liu, W.; Yao, Y. F.; Ni, Q. Y.; Xu, H.

Synonymous codon usage patterns in different parasitic platyhelminth mitochondrial genomes	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Platyhelminths; Mitochondrial genomes; Optimal codons; Codon usage bias; Correspondence analysis	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; TRANSLATIONAL SELECTION; GENE LENGTH; EVOLUTION; BIAS; MUTATION; DROSOPHILA; DNA; ARABIDOPSIS	We analyzed synonymous codon usage patterns of the mitochondrial genomes of 43 parasitic platyhelminth species. The relative synonymous codon usage, the effective number of codons (NC) and the frequency of G+C at the third synonymously variable coding position were calculated. Correspondence analysis was used to determine the major variation trends shaping the codon usage patterns. Among the mitochondrial genomes of 19 trematode species, the GC content of third codon positions varied from 0.151 to 0.592, with a mean of 0.295 +/- 0.116. In cestodes, the mean GC content of third codon positions was 0.254 +/- 0.044. A comparison of the nucleotide composition at 4-fold synonymous sites revealed that, on average, there was a greater abundance of codons ending on U (51.9%) or A (22.7%) than on C (6.3%) or G (19.14%). Twenty-two codons, including UUU, UUA and UUG, were frequently used. In the NC-plot, most of points were distributed well below or around the expected NC curve. In addition to compositional constraints, the degree of hydrophobicity and the aromatic amino acids also influenced codon usage in the mitochondrial genomes of these 43 parasitic platyhelminth species.

Stripe rust (or yellow rust), caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat. One of the most cost-effective and environmentally sound ways to control stripe rust is to use plant varieties that are resistant to this pathogen. It is an important task for wheat breeders and pathologists to identify new genes and pyramid them in order to achieve high-level, durable resistance to stripe rust. One spring wheat germplasm, HRMSN-81, with resistance to the most dominant races in China, is identified from the CIMMYT breeding lines. To elucidate the genetic basis of its resistance, HRMSN-81 was crossed with susceptible wheat genotype Taichung 29. Seedlings of the parents were tested with Chinese Pst isolates CYR31, CYR32, and CYR33 under controlled greenhouse conditions, and adult plants of the parents and F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 progeny were inoculated with the epidemic stripe rust mixed races, including CYR31, CYR32, and CYR33, in fields under natural infection. Genetic analysis showed that HRMSN-81 has a single dominant gene conferring all-stage resistance, temporarily designated as YrHRMSN-81. Resistance gene analogue polymorphism (RGAP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), target region amplified polymorphism (TRAP), and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) techniques in combination with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) were used to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. A linkage map consisting of six RGAP, two SSR, one TRAP, and two SRAP markers was constructed for YrHRMSN-81 using 148 F2 plants. The gene was mapped to chromosome arm 2DS by testing the complete set of nulli-tetrasomic lines and selected ditelosomic lines with two RGAP markers and was further confirmed by two chromosome-specific SSR markers. The results of gene characteristics and chromosome locations indicated that YrHRMSN-81 was probably a new stripe rust resistance gene. The two flanking markers Xwgp-180bp (93% polymorphism rate) and Xwmc453 (91% polymorphism rate) detected 100% polymorphism of the 56 tested wheat genotypes when they were used in combination. The identification of the gene YrHRMSN-81 and the determination of the flanking markers should be useful for rapidly transferring it in wheat breeding programs.

The piglets in each treatment were fed basal diet supplementation with either 0 (control), 5 and 10 mg kg(-1) folic acid. The trial lasted for 21 d. Dietary folic acid supplementation reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI) (P<0.05). In addition, the average daily gain (ADG) in 10 mg kg(-1) folic acid group was significantly decreased (P<0.01) and the ratio of feed:gain (FIG) increased slightly (P>0.05). Serum folic acid concentration increased (P<0.01) with increasing folic acid inclusion, however, serum homocysteine concentration decreased significantly (P<0.01). Enhanced serum urine nitrogen (SUN) and diminished serum total protein (TP) as well as liver TP content were observed in 10 mg kg(-1) folic acid group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the relative mRNA expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR) in liver were respectively tended to reduce (P=0.06) and significantly downregulated (P<0.05) in 10 mg kg(-1) group, in compared with 5 mg kg(-1) group. However, when compared with control group, folic acid supplementation had no significant effect on the mRNA abundance of IGF-1 and m-TOR. The results indicated that supplementation with 10 mg kg(-1) folic acid impaired growth performance and hepatic protein metabolism of early-weaned IUGR piglets while 5 mg kg(-1) folic acid enriched diet exerted limited positive effects.

And RLR-mediated antiviral pathway plays an important role in detection of viral RNA. However, little is known about the interaction of genetic background with RLR-mediated antiviral pathway in chicken against MDV infection. In this study, we adopted economic line-AA broilers and native Erlang mountainous chickens for being infected with MDV. Upon infection with MDV, the expression of MDA-5 was upregulated in two-breed chickens at 4, 7, and 21 d.p.i. It is indicated that MDA-5 might be involved in detecting MDV in chicken. Interestingly, the expression of IRF-3 and IFN-beta genes was decreased in spleen and thymus of broilers at 21 d.p.i, but it was upregulated in immune tissues of Erlang mountainous chickens. And the genome load of MDV in spleen of broiler is significantly higher than that in Erlang mountainous chickens. Meanwhile, we observed that the death of broiler mainly also occurred in this phase. Collectively, these present results demonstrated that the expression patters of IRF-3 and IFN-beta genes in chicken against MDV infection might be affected by the genetic background which sequently influence the resistance of chicken response to MDV.

Effects of dietary arginine supplementation on reproductive performance and immunity of sows	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						L-arginine; litter performance; placenta; humoral immune	AMINO-ACIDS; LATE-GESTATION; GROWTH; PIGS; PIGLETS; PLACENTA; SURVIVAL; FETUSES; MICE	Arginine (Arg) is considered to have beneficial effects on placental development and function, as well as reproductive performance. The well-developed placenta is highly required in late gestation for rapid fetal growth, however, it is unknown if there is a crucial role of Arg in late gestation. Likewise, the immunological response of sows to Arg needs to be determined. Therefore, this study is designed to investigate the effects of dietary Arg supplementation on reproductive performance and immunity of sows. At day 30 of gestation, sixty sows (Landrace x Large White) were allocated to 3 groups receiving corn and soybean-based control diet (control group, n = 20), control diet supplemented with 1% L-arginine HCl until day 90 of gestation (Arg90 group, n = 20), and control diet supplemented with 1% L-arginine HCl until day 114 of gestation (Arg114 group, n = 20), respectively. Litter performance was recorded at parturition. Blood samples (n = 6) collected at days 30, 90, and 110 of gestation were measured for metabolic and immunological parameters. At parturition, total litter size was not affected by dietary Arg supplementation. As a result of less pigs born dead, however, sows in Arg114 group had more pigs born alive than sows in control group (+1.6 pigs, P < 0.05), total and live litter weights were increased (+1.6 similar to 2.1 kg, P < 0.05) in Arg114 group relative to both control and Arg90 groups. Compared with control group, dietary Arg supplementation increased (+12 similar to 110%, P < 0.05) plasma levels of ornithine, proline, and arginine at either day 90 (Arg90 and Arg110 groups) or day 110 of gestation (Arg110 group). Moreover, immune response was enhanced in Arg-supplemented sows, as indicated by the increased levels of serum immunoglobulin and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antibody. These findings indicate dietary Arg supplementation can improve litter performance and immune response, and the beneficial effect of Arg on fetal growth is evident in late gestation.

Compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural, containing a 3D porous framework built of carboxylate-bridged layers with 6(6)-topology, while 3-10 display the same 2D double-layer structure based on binuclear Ln(2)O(2) units with 4(3).6(3)-topology. The PXRD and TGA prove their phase purity and high thermal stability, respectively. Photoluminescent studies indicate the efficient energy transfer from L3- ligand to Ln(3+) ions, exhibiting the typical intense emissions of corresponding Ln(3+) ions in the visible region. The magnetic exchange interactions also are studied in compounds 4-7 for their short O bridges between Ln(3+) ions, and the results show that there may be ferromagnetic interactions in 4-6, while in 7 the interactions cannot be distinctly deduced from the curves due to the nature of the Ho3+ ions. Furthermore, compound 6 displays slow magnetization relaxation, exhibiting single-molecule magnetic behavior.

However, the extremely poor oral bioavailability induced by its low water solubility greatly limits the potency of Rh2 in clinical use. Therefore, in this study we sulfated 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 with chlorosulfonic acid and pyridine method, and got two new sulfated derivatives, Rh2-B1 and Rh2-B2, with higher water solubility. Their chemical structures were characterized by spectroscopic methods (IR, MS and NMR). Additionally, Rh2-B1 and Rh2-B2 had the greater anti-inflammatory effects than Rh2 through inhibiting inflammatory cytokines and mediators in LPS-induced mouse RAW264.7 macrophages cells. These results suggested that the sulfated modification of Rh2 improved its water solubility and the sulfated derivatives could be more potential candidates for developing as anti-inflammatory agents.

Here we report the draft genome sequence of the rice sheath blight disease pathogen, R. solani AG1 IA, assembled using next-generation Illumina Genome Analyser sequencing technologies. The genome encodes a large and diverse set of secreted proteins, enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and transporters, which probably reflect an exclusive necrotrophic lifestyle. We find few repetitive elements, a closer relationship to Agaricomycotina among Basidiomycetes, and expand protein domains and families. Among the 25 candidate pathogen effectors identified according to their functionality and evolution, we validate 3 that trigger crop defence responses; hence we reveal the exclusive expression patterns of the pathogenic determinants during host infection.

The full-length cDNA of this SOD contained a 496-bp open-reading frame (ORF) encoding 162 amino acid residues. The recombinant plasmid containing the SOD coding sequence was introduced into Escherichia colt, and the SOD was expressed as a fusion protein. The recombinant SOD was purified from a high-density fed-batch culture using a combination of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and Sephadex G25 desalting chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis indicated that the recombinant SOD was a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of approximately 16.4 kDa. Isoelectric focusing showed that this SOD was a basic protein with pI values of 7.04, 7.33, 8.62, and 8.77. The activity of the SOD was stable at 70 degrees C for 10 min, and in a broad pH range from 4 to 9. The presence of urea (up to 8 M), guanidinium chloride (up to 6 M), and 2-mercaptoethanol (up to 8 mM) had little effect on the activity. The activity decreased gradually with increasing concentrations of imidazole, hydrogen peroxide, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Atomic absorption spectrometry showed the presence of 0.239 copper and 0.258 zinc atoms, respectively, in the SOD polypeptide.

Healthy 90-day Silky Fowls were abdominally injected with vitamin D-3 or untreated. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that injection of vitamin D-3 significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated the expression of TLRs (TLR2, TLR5), VDR, AvBDs (AVBD-6, GAL-1), and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) in the tissues (liver, spleen, and kidney) at various times 8-24 h post injection. These results suggest that expression of VDR, AvBDs, and TLRs seems to be induced by vitamin D-3 and it was concluded that the tissues expressing TLRs and VDR respond to vitamin D-3 and in turn upregulate these tissues cellular functions to synthesize AvBDs.

J	Liu, Y; Wang, XX				Liu, Yong; Wang, Xianxiang			Colorimetric speciation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) with a gold nanoparticle probe	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							SELECTIVE DETECTION; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; L-CYSTEINE; MERCURY(II); ASSAY; IONS; ACID	Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have frequently been explored for colorimetric probes for metal ions, including Cr(III), but probes capable of speciation of chromium, i.e., detection of both Cr(III) and Cr(VI), are seldom reported. In this work, by taking advantage of the coordination between Cr(III) and citrate, as well as the ligand effect of citrate for synthesis and stabilization of AuNPs, a colorimetric probe for Cr(III) detection based on citrate-capped AuNPs was reported. Cr(VI) was also detected after reduction to Cr(III). Speciation analysis of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) was thus performed. The citrate-capped AuNPs exhibited excellent selectivity toward Cr(III) over other common metal ions. Limits of detection for Cr(III) were 4 mu M and 0.3 mu M with the naked eye and UV-vis spectroscopic detection, respectively. The analytical performances for Cr(VI) were very much similar to those for Cr(III). The analytical potential of the proposed colorimetric speciation probe was evaluated for successful detection of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water samples, with spike-recoveries ranging from 96.7 to 106%.

Genetic effects of melatonin receptor genes on chicken reproductive traits	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						MTNR1A; MTNR1B; MTNR1C; polymorphism; egg production traits	POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; EGG-PRODUCTION; CANDIDATE GENES; HIGH-AFFINITY; POLYMORPHISMS; ASSOCIATION; AGE; PROLACTIN; SELECTION; HORMONE	The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that bind melatonin. Three types of melatonin receptors have been cloned. The MTNR1A (or Mel1A or MT1) and MTNR1B (or Mel1B or MT2) receptor subtypes are present in humans and other mammals, while an additional melatonin receptor subtype MTNR1C (or Mel1C or MT3) has been identified in amphibians and birds. Previous research has shown that the three common melatonin receptors regulate physiological processes, including seasonal reproduction and ovarian physiology. However, whether or not any polymorphisms of the different melatonin receptor subtypes are associated with reproductive traits in chickens is not known. In this study, we performed candidate gene analysis to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MTNR1A, MTNR1B, and MTNR1C genes in the Erlang Mountain Chicken population. SNP discovery was achieved by sequencing pooled DNA samples. Direct PCR-sequencing, PCR-SSCP/ PCR-sequencing, and PCR-RFLP method were used to genotype the MTNR1A, MTNR1B, and MTNR1C genes, respectively. The GLM Procedure was used to estimate the statistical significance of association between genotypes at each locus and reproductive traits of chickens. In a sample of 460 chickens, four novel polymorphisms (JQ249890: g. 384T>C, JQ249891: g. 387T>C, JQ249894: g. 63C>T, and JQ249896: g. 294G>A) were detected in the melatonin receptor genes MTNR1A, MTNR1B, and MTNR1C, respectively. A statistically significant association (P < 0.01) was found between two SNPs (MTNR1A SNP, MTNR1C SNP) and reproductive traits: egg number at 300 days of age (EN) and age at first egg (AFE).	[Li, D.

Folia Biologica (Krakoiw) 61: 59-64. The objective of this work was to elucidate the gene expression profiles of luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) and their receptors during the developmental and egg laying stage. The expression of genes encoding pituitary LH and PRL, as well as those for the ovarian LH receptor (LHR) and PRL receptor (PRLR), was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in Zi geese on day 1 and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 months of age, respectively. The expression of LH and LHR fluctuated and increased as the geese aged. The expression of LH was significantly higher at 5 to 8 months of age than in 1 day old geese (P<0.05). The expression of LHR was higher at 8 months than at 1 day, at 1 to 4 months and at 6 months (P<0.05). The expression of PRL decreased from day 1, followed by an increase from 3 months, and reached the highest values at 8 months of age in the study. The difference in PRL expression between 7 and 8 months of age was significant (P<0.05). The expression of PRLR decreased initially and this was followed by a fluctuating increase from 5 months until 8 months of age. The expression of PRLR in 1 to 8 month old geese was significantly lower than at day 1 (P<0.05). These results suggest that LH and PRLR may play an important role in ovarian development and the egg-laying process in Zi geese.

The anther cuticle and pollen exine play an essential role, and in many cereals, such as rice, orbicules/ubisch bodies are also thought to be important for pollen development. The formation of the anther cuticle, exine and orbicules is associated with the biosynthesis and transport of wax, cutin and sporopollenin components. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of sporopollenin and cutin components in Arabidopsis and rice, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they are transported to the sites of deposition. Here, we report that the rice ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG15, is essential for postmeiotic anther and pollen development, and is proposed to play a role in the transport of rice anther cuticle and sporopollenin precursors. ABCG15 is highly expressed in the tapetum at the young microspore stage, and the abcg15 mutant exhibits small, white anthers lacking mature pollen, lipidic cuticle, orbicules and pollen exine. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the abcg15 anther cuticle revealed significant reductions in a number of wax components and aliphatic cutin monomers. The expression level of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the abcg15 mutant was significantly different from their levels in the wild type, possibly due to perturbations in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism. Our study provides new insights for understanding the molecular mechanism of the formation of the anther cuticle, orbicules and pollen wall, as well as the machinery for lipid metabolism in rice anthers.

Continuous half-hourly measurements of soil surface efflux were made during the period March-December 2011 in a mixed forest in Beijing Olympic Forest Park, China. Daily mean R-s varied from 0.28 to 3.62 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Over this period of record, R-s increased exponentially with rising temperature; a Q(10) model with 5-cm soil temperature as the independent variable explained 76% of the variation in half-hourly R-s. The temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q(10)) varied seasonally, being greater in fall than in spring, suggesting seasonal hysteresis in the R-s-T-s relationship. During the summer months (June August 2011), when T-s was high and had relatively little day-to-day variation, R-s was hyperbolically related to VWC, increasing with increasing VWC up to a VWC threshold of 0.17 m(3) m(-3), but decreasing with increasing VWC above the threshold. A bivariate Q(10)-hyperbolical model, which incorporated both T-s and VWC effects, improved the performance of R-s simulation in summer, but not annually. These results indicated that R-s was dominantly controlled by soil temperature over the annual cycle. However, VWC served as the dominant control in summer. The annual total of R-s estimated from the Q(10) model was 475 g C m(-2). We recommend the use of the Q(10) model for predicting annual soil respiration due to its good performance and physiological basis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Gould (2n = 6x = 42, StStStStHH) is a hexaploid perennial wheatgrass species from the tribe Triticeae, distantly related to bread wheat Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). As a potential source of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB), E. repens was crossed to common wheat to transfer resistance genes. The progeny were advanced to homozygosity by single seed descent. A total of eight BC1F9 progeny lines were selected and characterized in this study. The chromosome numbers of these derived lines ranged from 42 to 56, including lines with 44, 52, and 54 chromosomes. All of the lines were cytologically stable in terms of meiotic chromosome behavior. The univalent frequency in the lines varied between 0.34 and 2.36 per cell. Similarly, the multivalent frequency did not exceed 1% in any of the lines. GISH analysis revealed that the number of intact wheat chromosomes in the various lines varied between 40 and 44. Numerous translocated chromosomes were detected in all lines. The translocations involved chromosomal segments from wheat, and the St and H genomes of E. repens. Furthermore, trigenomic translocated chromosomes were detected in some of the lines. The introgression into wheat chromosomes included not only terminal types but also interstitial segments. The Fusarium head blight resistance of the eight lines, following point inoculation, varied from 5.65% infected florets to 11.46% compared with the check cultivars T. aestivum 'Roblin' and T. aestivum 'Crocus' at 100% and 85%, respectively.

Biofortified foods can potentially be an inexpensive, locally adaptable, and long-term solution to dietary-nutrient deficiency. In order to improve the beta-carotene content in maize grain by breeding and minimize vitamin A deficiency, a complete diallel cross was designed with eight inbred lines of maize, and 64 combinations were obtained in this study. The experimental combinations were planted in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, respectively, with a random complete block design. The beta-carotene contents in the grains of the experimental materials were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the tested materials, the effect difference of general combining ability of the beta-carotene content was significant; however, the effect difference of the special combining ability and the reciprocal effect were not significant. The beta-carotene content of maize grain was not influenced significantly by the cross and the reciprocal cross. There was a significant correlation about the beta-carotene content in the maize grains between the F, and their parents. The combinations with high beta-carotene content were obviously influenced by the environment, and the mean value of beta-carotene content for the experimental materials planted in Ya'an of Sichuan was higher than that planted in Yuanjiang of Yunnan, with the results being significant at the 0.01 level.

The epididymis and ductus deferens were collected from matured roosters before and after 3 or 6 h of intravenous injection with 0.5 mg LPS per kg body-weight (LPS group) or phosphate buffered saline (control group). Their cryostat sections were immunostained using anti-chicken CD4 and CD8 antibodies. The frequencies of immunopositive cells in the rete testis, efferent duct and epididymal duct in the epididymis and ductus deferens were analyzed under a microscope with image analysis software. Both types of T cells were identified predominantly in the connective tissue underlying the mucosal epithelium and occasionally in the epithelium of the ducts in the epididymis and ductus deferens in all birds. Frequency of CD4+ T cell was increased in the ductus deferens 6 h post LPS injection. Their frequency in the efferent duct and ductus deferens was greater in the LPS group than in the control group after 6 h of injection. The frequency of CD8+ T Cells in the LPS treated group was significantly increased in the efferent duct after 3 h and in the ductus deferens after 6 h of LPS injection. Significantly higher frequency of CD8+ T cells in the LPS group than in the control group was identified after 6 h of injection in the rete testis, efferent duct and ductus deferens. These results suggest that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited in response to LPS stimulation in the rooster seminal tract, and the T cell-mediated local immune system is active in that organ.

It is a serious problematic weed in Hawai'i and has naturalized in many other countries. Biological control is being considered as a means to suppress it by introducing natural enemies from Asia, its native region. In this paper, we report 62 herbivorous insect species in 22 families that were collected on R. ellipticus during 2006-2010 in China. Two leaf-rolling moth species, Epinotia ustulana and Epiblema tetragonana; two warty beetle species, Chlamisus setosus and Chlamisus sp.; two flea beetle species in the genus Chaetocnema; four unidentified weevil species; five unidentified buprestids; one pyralid species; and one sawfly species were considered important. We also report results of preliminary host-range determinations for some of them. In addition, we summarize the literature on natural enemies associated with Rubus species in Asia, which encompasses 50 arthropod species in 14 families and 63 fungi species in 18 orders.

The genetic diversity of the isolates was studied by analyzing the housekeeping genes 16S rRNA and recA, and the symbiotic genes nifH and nodC. In the nodulation and symbiotic efficiency assay, only 11 of the 41 isolates promoted the growth of L. leucocephala while the majority of the isolates were ineffective in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, one fourth of the isolates had a growth slowing effect on the host. According to the 16S rRNA and recA gene analyses, most of the isolates were Ensifer spp. The remaining isolates were assigned to Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium. The sequence analyses indicated that the L. leucocephala rhizobia had undergone gene recombination. In contrast to the promiscuity observed as a wide species distribution of the isolates, the results implied that L. leucocephala is preferentially nodulated by strains that share common symbiosis genes. The symbiotic efficiency was not connected to chromosomal background of the symbionts and isolates carrying a similar nifH or nodC showed totally different nitrogen fixation efficiency.

In the present study, a T/C variant at -125 bp (relative to ATG start codon) of 5'regulatory region of rabbit MSTN was identified by direct sequencing. Two hundred and twenty two rabbits, which were randomly sampled from 3 breeds (Ira rabbits, Champagne rabbits and Tianfu black rabbits), were genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM). Comparing the genotyping results of 47 samples with direct sequencing, the HRM showed high sensitivity (0.96) and high specificity (0.98). In the three rabbit breeds, the allele C was the predominant allele. The polymorphic site showed high heterozygosity (He = 0.48) and high effective number of alleles (Ne = 1.91). The genetic diversity was reasonably informative (0.25<PIC<0.50). The association analysis showed that the genotype TC had significant effect on the 84-d-weight of rabbits compared with genotype CC (p = 0.047). In contrast, the genotypes had no significant effect on other production traits. These results showed that HRM could be effectively used for genotyping analysis of MSTN gene. The T/C variant in 5'regulatory region of MSTN might be one of the candidate SNP loci affecting the trait of 84-d-weight.

Rice, as one of the most important food crops, is grown in soils with variable levels of Cd and therefore, is important to discriminate the Cd tolerance of different rice cultivars to determine their suitability for cultivation in Cd-contaminated soils. This study investigates the primary mechanisms employed by four rice cultivars in attaining Cd tolerance. HA63 cultivar reduces Cd uptake by increasing Fe absorption through activation of phytosiderophores. T3028 cultivar accumulates the highest level of Cd in leaves while also activating its reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system, including antioxidant enzymes and phytochelatins. In some rice cultivars (such as HA63), a cyanide-resistant respiration mechanism, important in Cd detoxification, was also promoted under the Cd stress. In conclusion, different rice cultivars may adopt different biochemical strategies and respond with different efficiency to Cd stress.

It often enters into the gastrointestinal tract via a faecal-oral route and causes nontyphoid symptoms such as high fever and acute diarrhoea. In many developing countries, Salmonella Typhimurium has already become the leading cause of human food poisoning. The PhoP/PhoQ locus is an ancestral two-component regulatory system related to the pathogenicity of Salmonella Typhimurium. In this review, we clarify the functional roles as well as the complicated regulatory networks of the PhoP/PhoQ system.

Two materials were exposed to 12 days of drought stress and 6 days of rewatering in a greenhouse. Significantly higher activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase and root activity as well as lower electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde levels of the small-leafed in leaves and roots were observed as compared to the large-leafed under drought stress and rewatering. Lignification-related enzymes (polyphenol oxidase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) activities of two materials in leaves gradually increased from 0 to 9 days of drought stress; then declined at 12 days of drought stress and after rewatering. After 12 days of drought stress, lignin content of two materials in roots was significantly higher relative to the well-watered. Lignin content of leaves in the small-leafed also increased significantly after 6 days of rewatering, but not in the large-leafed. The small-leafed exhibited more sensitive lignin metabolism and faster lignification in leaves and roots than the large-leafed regarding the response of drought stress. These results indicated that antioxidant efficiency and lignin metabolism played important roles in response to drought stress and rewatering for different white clovers. Comparatively higher reactive oxygen species scavenging system and more sensitive lignin metabolism could be associated with better drought tolerance and post-drought recovery in white clover.

Methods: Pregnant dams were fed a control diet (folic acid 1.3 mg/kg) or an FS diet (folic acid 30 mg/kg) during gestation. The liver samples of newborn piglets from each group were collected at birth for the analysis of the proteome using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. Results: The results indicated that the expression levels of 11 proteins were changed dramatically in the newborn piglets after maternal FS. FS during gestation increased the content of proteins that regulate the immune response (90-kDa heat shock protein), energy metabolism (aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase), and intermediary metabolism (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase and abhydrolase). In addition, maternal FS downregulated the expression of proteins associated with cellular signal transduction ( heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein and exportin), proteolysis (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and porcine epsilon-trypsin), and cell migration regulation (actin-related protein-3). Conclusion: These findings suggest that maternal FS alters the expression abundance of several hepatic proteins that are involved in metabolic regulation, oxidative responses, and cancer-related processes.

Current information on the relation between amino acid transporter mechanisms and mTORC1 signaling is sparse. The objectives of this study were to determine whether an increase in leucine availability upregulates the gene transcription and translation of amino acid transporters and other amino acid members in an mTORC1-dependent pathway that control amino acid use (general control non-repressed-2 and activating transcription factor-4) and to measure the factors related to protein synthesis and proteolysis. Methods: L6 skeletal muscle cells that had been treated with L-leucine (0.105 g/L) were incubated for 30 min to stimulate the transcription of L-type amino acid transporter-1, CD98, and sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter-2 and increase activating transcription factor-4 protein, which is dependent on the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Results: A rapid, high level of p70 S6 kinase-1 phosphorylation was detected but was suppressed by rapamycin (P < 0.05). The addition of leucine decreased the atrogin-1 transcription abundance in an insulin-involved manner (P < 0.05), which could not be completely blocked by rapamycin (P = 0.055). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the mTOR is a component of the nutrient signaling pathway, which regulates system A and L amino acid transporters, the initiation factors involved in mRNA translation, and is downstream of forkhead box-O in L6 myotubes.

To date, five DVR activities have been detected, but adequate evidence of enzymatic assays using purified or recombinant DVR proteins has not been demonstrated, and it is unclear whether one or multiple enzymes catalyze these activities. In this study, we systematically carried out enzymatic assays using four recombinant DVR proteins and five divinyl substrates and then investigated the in vivo accumulation of various chlorophyll intermediates in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus). The results demonstrated that both rice and maize DVR proteins can convert all of the five divinyl substrates to corresponding monovinyl compounds, while both cucumber and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DVR proteins can convert three of them. Meanwhile, the OsDVR (Os03g22780)-inactivated 824ys mutant of rice exclusively accumulated divinyl chlorophylls in its various organs during different developmental stages. Collectively, we conclude that a single DVR with broad substrate specificity is responsible for reducing the 8-vinyl groups of various chlorophyll intermediates in higher plants, but DVR proteins from different species have diverse and differing substrate preferences, although they are homologous.

However, little is currently known about the native poplars occurring in this region, and considerable doubt still exists regarding the classification and evolutionary relationships of poplar species. In this study, nuclear and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences were utilized to determine the genetic relationships and phylogeny of Populus species in Southwest China. The results suggest that P. pseudoglauca belongs to the section of Tacamahaca. Further, P. schneideri may be a natural hybrid of P. kangdingensis and P. cathayana and, thus, it should likely not be regarded as a variety of P. kangdingensis, as in the existing classification system. In addition, cluster analyses showed that P. gonggaensis may be derived from a cross between species of section Leucoides and P. cathayana or P. schneideri of section Tacamahaca, although it is still doubtful whether P. gonggaensis can be regarded as a separate species, due to its narrow distribution range. The parents of the Luding poplar may be P. yunnanensis and P. lancifolia. P. butuoensis showed a close affinity to species of section Leucoides and had a close relationship with P. gonggaensis or P. lasiocarpa. However, further research is needed in order to appropriately classify these as species or varieties. The incongruence between phylogenetic trees based on nuclear- and chloroplast-DNA sequence data may be due to the different inheritance patterns between nuclear- and cpDNA genome.

"MetaQTL" software was used to project QTL positions on a reference map. Three hundred and thirty-seven QTL for traits associated with tolerance to abiotic stresses were included in this analysis which identified 79 metaQTL (MQTL) including 26 for drought, 11 for low temperature, 22 for salinity, 17 for water-logging, and 3 for mineral toxicity and deficiency. The distribution of MQTL was similar to that of the initial QTL. Many of these MQTL were located on chromosomes 2H (mainly for water-logging and drought) and 5H (mainly for salinity and low temperature). It inferred that chromosomes 2H and 5H were important for researches on barley abiotic tolerance, and the genes associated with abiotic stresses were concentrated relatively. As expected from trait correlations, 22.8 % of these MQTL displayed overlapping CIs. These overlapping regions were mainly on chromosomes 1H, 2H and 4H. The results indicated that the tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses were associated with each other in barley. Additionally, 67 candidate genes responsive to abiotic stresses were co-located with the abiotic-stress MQTL. Of them, a total of 55 had different conserved motifs. It inferred that the tolerance to abiotic stresses was contributed by multi-genes with diverse functions, though there might be some important genes associated with the tolerance to abiotic stresses in barley. Additionally, of these candidate genes, scsnp02622, scsnp01644 and scsnp19641 could be better for further studies of abiotic stresses tolerance.

Since the 1990s, many studies have shown that miRNAs act in many ways to regulate target expression in plant growth, development and stress response. The recent draft genome sequence of Nicotiana benthamiana has provided a framework for Digital Gene Expression (DGE) and small RNA sequencing to understand patterns of transcription in the context of plant response to environmental stress. We sequenced and analyzed three Digital Gene Expression (DGE) libraries from roots of normal and drought-stressed tobacco plants, and four small RNA populations from roots, stems and leaves of control or drought-treated tobacco plants, respectively. We identified 276 candidate drought responsive genes (DRGs) with sequence similarities to 64 known DRGs from other model plant crops, 82 were transcription factors (TFs) including WRKY, NAC, ERF and bZIP families. Of these tobacco DRGs, 54 differentially expressed DRGs included 21 TFs, which belonged to 4 TF families such as NAC (6), MYB (4), ERF (10), and bZIP (1). Additionally, we confirmed expression of 39 known miRNA families (122 members) and five conserved miRNA families, which showed differential regulation under drought stress. Targets of miRNAs were further surveyed based on a recently published study, of which ten targets were DRGs. An integrated gene regulatory network is proposed for the molecular mechanisms of tobacco root response to drought stress using differentially expressed DRGs, the changed expression profiles of miRNAs and their target transcripts. This network analysis serves as a reference for future studies on tobacco response stresses such as drought, cold and heavy metals.

In different ecological environments, the phenotypes of the developed populations were analyzed, the combining abilities were tested according to an incomplete diallel model to study the effects of selection, and the effects of MS on genetic diversity of the populations were also analyzed by using 51 pairs of SSR markers. It was found that MS was effective in improving the main traits and general combing ability (GCA), and it was effective on maintaining the genetic diversity of the population. At the same time, the genetic structure was changed with advance of selection.

To assess whether this characteristic improved grain filling in maize, we analyzed five stay-green traits, five grain yield-related traits, and three photosynthetic parameters in 10 hybrids derived from an incomplete diallele cross mating design between five temperate and two tropical maize germplasm inbred lines. The hybrids were grown in three different environments. The degree of stay-green (DSG) was significantly positively correlated with grain yield, ear length, number of grains per row, number of visible green leaves at maturity (MNL), ratio of visible source leaves (RSL), and photosynthetic potential at maturity (MPP). The highest correlation between traits was between RSL and MNL. All five stay-green traits were significantly positively correlated with net photosynthetic rate (Pn). RSL had the highest broad-sense heritability among the stay-green traits evaluated. Our findings suggest that RSL is an important stay-green trait and can be used as a selection criterion for improving stay-green traits in maize breeding programs.

This population was derived from the spontaneous chromosome doubling of triploid F-1 hybrid plants obtained from a cross between Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon PI377655 and A. tauschii ssp. strangulata AS66 x ssp. tauschii AS87. SynDH3 is a diploidization-hexaploid DH population containing recombinant D chromosomes from two different A. tauschii genotypes, with A and B chromosomes from T. turgidum being homogenous across the entire population. Using this population, we constructed a genetic map. Of the 440 markers used to construct the map, 421 (96%) were assigned to 12 linkage groups; these included 346 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 75 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The total map length of the seven D chromosomes spanned 916.27 cM, with an average length of 130.90 cM per chromosome and an average distance between markers of 3.47 cM. Seven segregation distortion regions were detected on seven linkage groups. Out of 50 markers shared with those on a common wheat map, 37 showed a consistent order. The utility of the diploidization-hexaploid DH population for mapping qualitative trait genes was confirmed using the dominant glaucousness-inhibiting gene W2(I) as an example.

The lengths of x-HGP varied from 897 to 955 bp, and there are 329 variable sites including 105 singleton sites and 224 polymorphic sites. Genetic distances of pairwise X-HGP sequences ranged from 0.30 to 16.40% within 21 species and four outgroup species of Hordeum. All five recognized regulatory elements emerged and showed higher conservation in the x-HGP of 21 Triticeae species. Most variations were distributed in the regions among or between regulatory elements. A 22 bp and 50 bp insertions which were the copy of adjacent region with minor change, were found in the x-HGP of Ae. speltoides and Ps. Huashanica, and could be regarded as genome specific indels. The phylogeny of media-joining network and neighbour-joining tree both supported the topology were composed of three sperate clusters. Especially, the cluster I comprising the x-HGP sequences of Aegilops, Triticum, Henrardia, Agropyron and Taeniatherum was highly supporting by both network and NJ tree. As conferring to higher level and temporal and spatial expression, x-HGP can used as the source of promoter for constructing transgenic plants which allow endosperm-specific expression of exogenous gene on higher level. In addition, the x-HGP has enough conservation and variation; so it should be valuable in phylogenetic analyses of Triticeae family members.

Only few studies reported QTLs for waterlogging tolerance. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for waterlogging tolerance, root dry weight index (RDWI), shoot dry weight index (SDWI), total dry weight index (TDWI) were measured at seedling stage in two unrelated recombinant inbred lines (RILs) populations. These populations were International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) population 'W7984 / Opata85', and 'SHW-L1 x Chuanmai 32' (SC) population. Conditional QTL mapping and unconditional QTL mapping were studied to dissect the genetic relationship between TDWI and its components of SDWI and TDWI. Total of 36 QTLs for waterlogging tolerance in ITMI population and 10 QTLs in SC population were identified in present study. Of them, 17 alleles from synthetic hexaploid wheat 'W7984' and 3 alleles from synthetic hexaploid wheat 'SHW-L1' contribute positively to waterlogging tolerance. Combinations of conditional and unconditional mapping methods indicate that SDWI showed tighter genetic correlation with TDWI than RDWI.

The sensing mechanism is originated from the oxidation state change of Au nanoclusters controlled by AA. Under optimal experimental conditions, a good linear relationship between the relative fluorescence quenching intensity and the concentration of AA can be obtained in the range of 1.5 to 10 mu M, with a detection limit as low as 0.2 mu M. The proposed method is simple, efficient and reliable for monitoring of AA in some biological samples.

Conventional energy and emergy are applied to quantify energy consumption and emissions' impact respectively. Several indicators, based on emergy, energy and monetary units, are applied to depict the relationships among economic growth and energy consumption and emissions' impact. The results show that energy consumption and emissions' impact rise simultaneously. Therein, nonrenewable energy resources possess absolute share in total energy consumption and undertake primary responsibility for increasing emissions' impact, and NH3-N in wastewater leads to the most emissions' impact on environment. Energy mix and energy efficiency and pollution control make some achievements, but their improvements fall far behind economic growth rate. As a result, the structure of China's economy has been obviously optimized; however, the improvement of the relationship between China's economy, energy and environment is far behind that of its economic structure in this period. Therefore, China will continue to face huge pressure on resources and environment its rapid economic growth brings about in future. Those study results imply that enhancing energy efficiency, optimizing economic structure and strengthening pollution control will still be the main tasks for China's governments in future.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							WATER MANAGEMENT; CULTIVARS; DISORDER; DIVERSITY; GENOTYPE; MINERALS; MAIZE; LOCUS; QTL	Straighthead, a physiological disorder characterized by sterile florets and distorted spikelets, causes significant yield losses in rice, and occurs in many countries. The current control method of draining paddies early in the season stresses plants, is costly, and wastes water. Development of resistant cultivar is regarded as the most efficient way for its control. We mapped a QTL for straighthead resistance using two recombinant inbred line (RIL) F-9 populations that were phenotyped over two years using monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA) to induce the symptoms. One population of 170 RILs was genotyped with 136 SSRs and the other population of 91 RILs was genotyped with 159 SSRs. A major QTL qSH-8 was identified in an overlapping region in both populations, and explained 46% of total variation in one and 67% in another population for straighthead resistance. qSH-8 was fine mapped from 1.0 Mbp to 340 kb using 7 SSR markers and further mapped to 290 kb in a population between RM22573 and InDel 27 using 4 InDel markers. SSR AP3858-1 and InDel 11 were within the fine mapped region, and co-segregated with straighthead resistance in both RIL populations, as well as in a collection of diverse global accessions. These results demonstrate that AP3858-1 and InDel 11 can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) for straighthead resistant cultivars, which is especially important because there is no effective way to directly evaluate straighthead resistance.

However, the genome sequences of different Brucella species reveal the presence of the flagellar genes needed for the construction of a functional flagellum. Due to its roles in the interaction between pathogen and host, we hypothesized that some of the flagellar proteins might induce protective immune responses and these proteins will be good subunit vaccine candidates. This study was conducted to screening of protective antigens among these flagellar proteins. Firstly, according to the putative functional roles, a total of 30 flagellar genes of Brucella abortus were selected for in vitro expression. 15 of these flagellar genes were successfully expressed as his-tagged recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli ER2566. Then, these proteins were purified and used to analyze their T cell immunity induction activity by an in vitro gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) assay. Five of the flagellar proteins could stimulate significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma secretion in splenocytes from S19 immunized mice, indicating their T cell induction activity. Finally, immunogenicity and protection activity of these 5 flagellar proteins were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Results showed that immunization with FlgJ (BAB1_0260) or FliN (BAB2_0122) plus adjuvant could provide protection against B. abortus 544 infection. Furthermore, mice immunized with FlgJ and FliN developed a vigorous immunoglobulin G response, and in vitro stimulation of their splenocytes with immunizing proteins induced the secretion of IFN-gamma. Altogether, these data suggest that flagellar proteins FlgJ and FliN are protective antigens that could produce humoral and cell-mediated responses in mice and candidates for use in future studies of vaccination against brucellosis.

The URYZ was regarded as a passageway of the former dispersal route; however, this assumption remains to be further investigated. We therefore analyzed the hypervariable segements of mitochondrial DNA from 513 individual pigs mainly from Sichuan and the Tibet highlands and 1,394 publicly available sequences from domestic pigs and wild boars across Asia. From the phylogenetic tree, most of the samples fell into a mixed group that was difficult to distinguish by breed or geography. The total network analysis showed that the URYZ pigs possessed a dominant position in haplogroup A and domestic pigs shared the same core haplotype with the local wild boars, suggesting that pigs in group A were most likely derived from the URYZ pool. In addition, a region-wise network analysis determined that URYZ contains 42 haplotypes of which 22 are unique indicating the high diversity in this region. In conclusion, our findings confirmed that pigs from the URYZ were domesticated in situ. Citation: Jin L, Zhang M, Ma J, Zhang J, Zhou C, et al.

Perinatal growth restriction is not related to higher intestinal distribution and increased serum levels of 5-hydroxytryptamin in piglets	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						gastrointestinal system; perinatal; pig; serotonin; serum; small-for-gestational-age	INFANTS; MOTILITY	Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamin (5-HT)] is abundantly present in intestinal enteroendocrine cells and neurons and plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal functions (i.e., motility and mucosal secretion). Increased concentrations of 5-HT and its precursor L-Trp are present in plasma and brain tissues in case of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Therefore, 5-HT might be involved in the impaired gastrointestinal function associated with IUGR. Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) piglets have been widely used as animal model for IUGR. Hence, the density of intestinal 5-HT cells in fetal and neonatal SGA piglets was compared with serotonergic cell density in normal weight (NW) littermates. Furthermore, 5-HT serum concentrations of the neonatal piglets were analyzed. Stereological analysis showed that fetal piglets have higher (P < 0.01) volume densities of 5-HT enteroendocrine cells compared to 3-d-old piglets irrespective of BW. Serum concentrations did not differ in relation to postnatal age (P = 0.637) and BW (P = 0.892). These results contrast with serum and brain 5-HT and L-Trp levels in human and guinea pig SGA individuals and seemingly contest the fact that 5-HT plays an important role in gut impairment in SGA.

The objective of this study is to understand the responses of J. curcas to different water and nitrogen levels. Results showed that under 80% and 50% FC without N-fertilization J. curcas had larger allocation to root, however, leaf N content, pigment content and maximal efficiency of PSII decreased, and large numbers of starch grain accumulated in the chloroplast, resulting in a reduction of net photosynthesis rate; accordingly, oxidative stress occurred with the increase of oxidative production content, and J. curcas enhanced ascorbic acid content and free proline content to confront the stress. Furthermore, due to the low leaf N content and the accumulation of starch grain in chloroplast, low soluble protein and high soluble sugar content were observed. N-fertilization could alleviate the damage to plants of 80% and 50% FC under the given soil N condition. In addition, N-fertilization increased the water use efficiency. However, under 30% FC for the given soil N condition, J. curcas had not suffered damage at physiological and biochemical levels, and N-fertilization had no significantly positive effects on it. Thus we concluded that water adaptability of J. curcas was modulated by soil nitrogen availability. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the content of chlorophyll a (chl-a) and activity of antioxidase (e.g. superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) increased with Ce3+ concentration in the range of 0.05 to 0.1 mg/L and the growth of A. flosaquae was stimulated. While at around 5 mg/L, the content of malondiadehyde (MDA) increased significantly but the activity of antioxidase reduced, which resulted in the ruin of antioxidant defense system. Compared to the control (Ce3+-free), the population size of live cells declined significantly. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), the most common and toxic cyanotoxins produced by A. flosaquae, was detected and the highest content of MC-LR was observed in 10 mg/L Ce3+ treatment. These results implied that the aqueous environment might suffer a more negative ecological impact when exposed to relatively low Ce3+ concentrations (<0.1 mg/L).

Rice-tartary buckwheat is a special type of tartary buckwheat with a non-adhering hull trait. Here, we investigated the levels of expression of genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in common tartary and rice-tartary buckwheat. The flavonoid biosynthetic genes, from FtPAL to FtANS, showed different expression levels, especially in the reproductive organs of the 2 cultivars. The transcription levels of these genes, except FtC4H and FtANS, were higher in the mature seeds of rice-tartary buckwheat than in those of common buckwheat. We also analyzed the flavonoid compounds found in the different organs of common tartary buckwheat and rice-tartary buckwheat. Even though the content of rutin was similar in both the cultivars, the distribution of the 3 main flavonoids-rutin, quercetin, and kaempferol-was different in the 2 cultivars, both across organs and within the seed. These results indicate that in the 2 tartary buckwheat cultivars, flayonoid biosynthesis is carried out by different mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, APS was employed as an adjuvant of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA vaccine (pcDS2) and its' effects on immune system of mice were investigated. Our data demonstrated that APS as an adjuvant could increase the HBsAg-specific antibody level as well as the proliferating activity of T cells. APS also could induce CD4(+) T cells to produce IL-4, IL-2 and IFN-gamma and enhance IFN-gamma expression of CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, APS could induce the robust activity of the cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). Additionally, APS could stimulate the dendritic cells (DC) maturation which is characterized by up-regulation of MHC I/II, CD40, CD80 and CD86, and decreased the frequency of the regulatory T cells (nTreg). Collectively, these findings suggest that APS is a potent adjuvant for the hepatitis B DNA vaccine and can enhance the immune responses of HBV DNA vaccine via promoting DC maturation and inhibit the Treg frequency.

The major gB epitope was detected using an agar gel precipitation and Western blot analysis with the polyclonal antibodies specific for the major epitope. An indirect-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using the expressed major gB epitope as a coating antigen for the detection of PCMV antibodies. The results of the tests show that the indirect-blocking ELISA has 98% specificity and 97.8% sensitivity. No cross-reactions were observed between the major gB epitope and the antibodies against other virus, which indicates that the gB epitope is specific for PCMV antibodies. The indirect-blocking ELISA is a highly specific, sensitive method for detecting anti-PCMV gB antibodies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To further characterize this vaccine candidate and provide information for vaccine development, in the present study, a whole genome DNA microarray of 16M were used to compare the transcriptome of the vjbR mutant to that of the wild type strains. A total of 126 genes were greatly differentially expressed in the vjbR mutant. A great proportion of virB and flagellar genes were differentially expressed in the vjbR mutant, implying that the vjbR regulate expression of virulence genes by sensing intracellular environments. Interestingly, the virB genes are regulated by the vjbR in independent manners as shown by their different fold changes and transcription abundances. A number of genes involved in translation, stress response, amino acid transport and metabolism, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, energy production and conversion, translation were differentially expressed. The vjbR mutant showed increased sensitivity to stresses of nutrition limitation, oxidative stress and acidification, and decreased survival in macrophage and mice, being consistent with its transcription profiles. These results indicated that the quorum sensing regulator vjbR could sense intracellular environments and response to them by regulate expression of virulence genes and other intracellular survival related genes, and therefore contribute to Brucella survival in host cells. This also provided direct evidence for the rational vaccine design by using antigenic global regulator for future development of genetically marked vaccine for brucellosis.

The ecological security situation of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) was evaluated using this concept in this study. The construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir has led to the change in the ecology and immigration status of TGRA. The ecological footprint method is an important means to study the regional ecological security. Our results suggested that, by excluding the areas for biodiversity conservation (12% of the total land), the ecological footprint per capita was 0.57895 ha, which exceeded the ecological carrying capacity in TGRA. The total ecological deficit was found to be 11,522,193.34 ha, accounting for 95.02% of the ecological carrying capacity. These findings suggested that the ecological security of TGRA was not good. In order to compensate for the ecological deficit, it was essential to introduce natural resources from other regions.

It was found that the sequence length at 7D loci was longer than that 7B and 7A. These sequences contained 170 singleton variable sites and 484 polymorphic sites and that the average length of Indels was 8.5 bp. There were abundant regions of restriction enzyme sites and two regions of simple sequence repeat, "GAA" and "CTGA", in all sequences. A total of 65 uORFs were detected and classed into 37 types, with the variation in uORFs mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and also to the presence of Indels. All sequences in tetraploids and hexaploids could be grouped into Types A, B, I, II, GI and GII based on sequence variation. Restriction enzyme sites, Indel polymorphisms and the classes of uORFs present together indicated that Type I was more similar to Ae. tauschii whereas Type II was more similar to Type B, and both more similar to Ae. longissima; Type A was more similar to Ae. speltoides. Population analysis was performed and Neighbour-joining trees derived from different species, types and accessions further confirmed that the ancestors of T. urartu, Ae. speltoides, Ae. longissima and Ae. tauschii were involved to the evolution of common wheat, and also implied that Ae. longissima might have participated later than Ae. speltoides. 5' UTRs of Waxy genes in tetraploid and hexaploid species conserved characters from their respective progenitors when compared with diploid. For the first time, we are able to conclude there is abundant variation in SNPs, Indels and uORFs between 5' UTRs of Waxy genes from different species related to common wheat, and suggest that further research could help to understand Waxy gene function more deeply and hence improve wheat breeding. Our results also show that three hexaploid species in China have unique diversity in the 5' UTR of their Waxy gene.

SDS-PAGE band of 1Dx3.1(t) was between those of 1Dx2 and 1Dx3, while 1Dy11*(t) was between 1Dy11 and 1Dy12. The lengths of 1Dx3.1 (t) and 1Dy11* (t) were 2,514 bp and 1,968 bp, encoding 836 and 654 amino acid residues, respectively. Their authenticity was confirmed by successful expression of the coding regions in Escherichia coli. Network analysis indicated that 1Dx3.1 (t) together with other five rare alleles only detected in Asia common wheat populations represented the ancestral sequences in Glu-D1 locus. Neighbor-joining tree analysis of previously cloned x-type and y-type alleles in the Glu-D1 locus supported the hypothesis that more than one Ae. tauschii genotypes were involved in the origin of hexaploid wheat and that different Ae. tauschii accessions contributed the D genome to common wheat and Ae. cylindrical Host, respectively. An Ae. tauschii accession with 1Dx3.1 (t) or a closely related allele probably have involved in the origin of common wheat. Since accession AS60 used in this study belonged to typical ssp. tauschii, present results suggested the possibility that ssp. tauschii was involved in the evolution of common wheat.

The ability of RA to adhere to, and more importantly, to invade DEF cells was demonstrated by using a gentamicin invasion assay and was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Adhesion of RA could be found by TEM after 1 h of inoculation. Both apoptosis and necrocytosis of DEF were indicated by TEM after 10 h of incubation, which suggested a complex mechanism of DEF cell death induced by RA. Our results showed that internalized RA had the ability to leave the DEF cells. Inhibition studies indicated that RA proteins play a role in adhesion. Moreover, invasion of RA to DEF cells was shown to require rearrangement of actin microfilaments and microtubular cytoskeletal elements. Because the adhesion and invasion ability of RA to DEF cells could be demonstrated in vitro, similar processes might occur in vivo, where DEF cells play a crucial role in the diffusion of RA in ducks.

The accumulation of RFOs in plant cells are closely associated with the responses to environmental factors, such as cold, heat and drought stresses. Systematic analysis of genes involved in the raffinose metabolism has not been reported to date. Searching the recently available working draft of the maize genome, six kinds of enzyme genes were speculated, which should encode all the enzymes involved in the raffinose metabolism in maize. Expression patterns of some related putative genes were analyzed. The conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships among the deduced maize proteins and their homologs isolated from other plant species were revealed. It was discovered that some of the key enzymes, such as galactinol synthase (ZmGolS5, ZmGolS45 and ZmGolS37), raffinose synthase (ZmRS1, ZmRS2, ZmRS3 and ZmRS10), stachyose synthase (ZmRS8) and beta-fructofuranosidase, are encoded by multiple gene members with different expression patterns. These results reveal the complexity of the raffinose metabolism and the existence of metabolic channels for diverse RFOs in maize and provide useful information for improving maize stress tolerance through genetic engineering.

Growing resistant cultivars has long been recognized as an essential component in effectively managing this disease, and successful breeding requires quality sources of resistance. This paper reports the first germplasm screening to identify CR resistance sources in barley. A total of 1047 genotypes, selected to represent different geographical origins and plant types, were assessed. Several genotypes with high levels of resistance were identified. As expected, those with the best resistance were predominantly landraces or wild barley accessions. Surprisingly, genotypes with the best CR resistance with known origins were mainly derived from East Asia where CR is not a major cereal disease. Further, the majority of the genotypes with the best CR resistance are slow growing, although such genotypes accounted for only a small proportion of all those assessed in this study. Possible explanations for these intriguing phenomena are discussed.

We present results of a research based on household survey. The data were analyzed with an ordered Probit model regression. The project surveyed 923 rural households in 2009 and 2010 in 39 national-level poverty-stricken counties of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces and Chongqing Municipality. This research determined that the economic strength of households is the most important factor affecting their disaster coping capacity. The ability of farming households to cope with disasters is also significantly impacted by family members' experiences and their economic context at the village level. Ethnic minority areas in southwestern China are the poorest in the country and are often the main disaster-affected areas. Since household endowments significantly affect the ability of farming households to cope with disasters, integration of disaster risk management and poverty reduction is a viable way of enhancing coping capacity of farming households to natural disasters.

Jian). A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) (6.9 +/- 0.03 g) were randomly distributed into six groups with four replicates each, fed semi-purified isonitrogenous diets (335.8 g crude protein/kg diet) containing graded levels of Ile (4.2, 7.0, 9.5, 11.9, 13.9 and 16.9 g/kg diets) for 60 days. The relative expression of gene was performed by real-time quantitative PCR. Compared with the control group, Ile supplementation increased (P<0.05): (1) specific growth rate (SGR) and feed intake, (2) body protein content and protein retention value, (3) intestine fold height, (4) activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase in hepatopancreas and intestine, (5) activities of alkaline phosphatase in distal intestine, Na+/K+-ATPase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in intestine, (6) glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase activity in hepatopancreas, and (7) relative mRNA expression of chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase in hepatopancreas, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in mid intestine, Na+/K+-ATPase in intestine and target of rapamycin (TOR) in hepatopancreas and mid intestine. However, Ile supplementation decreased (P<0.05): (1) feed conversion ratio, (2) glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activity in hepatopancreas, and (3) relative mRNA expression of trypsin in hepatopancreas, alkaline phosphatase in intestine, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in distal intestine and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) in hepatopancreas, proximal and mid intestine. Collectively, this study indicated that dietary Ile improves fish growth, promotes the digestive and absorptive ability and regulates gene expression of the digestive and brush border enzymes, TOR and 4E-BP.

But there was no any report of duck enteritis virus (DEV) UL16 gene. Findings: The kinetics of DEV UL16 gene was examined in DEV CHv infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) by establishment of real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) and western-blotting. In this study, UL16 mRNA was transcript at a low level from 0-18 h post-infection (p.i), and peaked at 36 h p.i. It can't be detected in the presence of acyclovir (ACV). Besides, western-blotting analysis showed that UL16 gene expressed as an apparent 40-KDa in DEV infected cell lysate from 12 h p.i, and rose to peak level at 48 h p.i consistent with the qRT-PCR result. Conclusions: These results provided the first evidence of the kinetics of DEV UL16 gene. DEV UL16 gene was a late gene and dependent on viral DNA synthesis.

PM2.5 samples were collected during January March 2004 and January-March 2005 and analyzed for major constituents and organic tracer species. Synoptic weather conditions and characteristics of common air pollutants were used to categorize the sampling days to three groups, i.e., groups mainly affected by local emissions or regional transport (RT) or cold front LRT. Concentrations of PM2.5 mass and its major constituents during cold-front days were lower than those during RT-dominated periods but higher than those during local emissions-dominated periods. Source apportionment using chemical mass balance (CMB) indicates that vehicular exhaust was a significant primary OC source of mainly local emissions, making average contributions of 1.82, 1.50, and 2.39 mu g C m(-3) to OC in the local, LRT, and RT sample groups, respectively. During cold front periods, primary OC concentrations attributable to biomass burning and coal combustion were approximately triple and double, respectively, those during periods dominated by local emissions. Suspended dust, a minor primary OC source (0.24-0.40 mu g C m(-3)), also showed increased contribution during cold fronts. The unexplained OC by CMB (i.e., total OC minus apportioned primary OC), an approximate indicator for secondary OC, was a significant fraction of OC (>48%) and its mass concentration was much higher in the cold front LRT and RT sample groups (6.37 and 9.48 mu g C m(-3)) than in the local sample group (3.8 mu g C m(-3)). Source analysis as well as tracer concentration variation shows that biomass burning OC and water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were correlated, suggesting biomass burning as a significant contributor to WSOC.

The method was based upon measuring the quenching of the fluorescence intensity of the bovine serum albumin (BSA) stabilized Au nanoclusters by enzymatic proteolysis. The calibration plot for trypsin was achieved over the concentration range 1-60 nmol L-1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.995 and a limit of detection of 0.6 nmol L-1. The method was also used satisfactorily for the assessment of the trypsin activity and the results showed that the Michaelis-Menten (K-m) and catalytic (K-cat) constant values of trypsin for BSA-Au nanoclusters substrate were 1.6x10(-5) mol L-1 and 3.8 s(-1) at 37 degrees C, respectively. This enzyme biosensor is of considerable interest due its promise for simple procedure and the established method has great potential in detection of other proteases in clinical diagnostics of various diseases.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, low-intensity and long-wavelength UV-B light is perceived as an informational signal to mediate UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis. Here, we report that the multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase, CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1), a known key player in UV-B photomorphogenic responses, is also a UV-B-inducible gene. Two transcription factors, FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), directly bind to distinct regulatory elements within the COP1 promoter, which are essential for the induction of the COP1 gene mediated by photomorphogenic UV-B signaling. Absence of FHY3 results in impaired UV-B-induced hypocotyl growth and reduced tolerance against damaging UV-B. Thus, FHY3 positively regulates UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis by directly activating COP1 transcription, while HY5 promotes COP1 expression via a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, FHY3 and HY5 physically interact with each other, and this interaction is diminished by UV-B. Together, our findings reveal that COP1 gene expression in response to photomorphogenic UV-B is controlled by a combinatorial regulation of FHY3 and HY5, and this UV-B-specific working mode of FHY3 and HY5 is distinct from that in far-red light and circadian conditions.

To investigate how chemical fertilizers contribute to C input (e.g. plant-derived C) and export (e.g. original SOC decomposition) in soil, a wheat (a C-3 plant) pot experiment was conducted using a Phaeozem that had previously been used to cultivate maize (a C-4 plant). The natural C-13 abundance method was used to quantify wheat-derived SOC (WSC) and microbial respiration using the original SOC (R-microbial) during the wheat growing season. The wheat grain, WSC, wheat-derived C (WDC: including WSC, root and stubble biomass C) and R-microbial-derived CO2 emission (SCE) in fertilized treatments increased by 4.8-31.1%, 48.9-122.4%, 21.3-62.2% and 6.0-51.8%, respectively, when compared to unfertilized treatments. The total SOC in the post-experimental soil increased by 0.14-0.97% when compared to pre-experimental soil because the WSC input was larger than the SCE export, and it would be increased further if wheat root and stubble biomass C were included. Therefore, application of chemical fertilizer not only directly increases crop yield, but also indirectly contributes to C sequestration by favoring crop growth and crop-derived C input in soil.

The present study conceptualized the observed phenomena with an ellipsoid morphology model, describing BSA as an ellipsoid taking a side-on or end-on conformation on granular surface, and identified the following processes: (1) at low adsorbed concentrations, BSA exhibited a side-on conformation blocking colloid deposition; (2) at high adsorbed concentrations, BSA adapted to an end-on conformation promoted colloid deposition; and (3) colloid deposition on the BSA layer may progressively generate end-on molecules (sites) by conformation change of side-on BSA, resulting in sustained increasing deposition rates. Generally, the protein layer lowered colloid attenuation by the porous medium, suggesting the overall effect of BSA was inhibitory at the experimental time scale. A mathematical model was developed to interpret the ripening curves. Modeling analysis identified the site generation efficiency of colloid as a control on the ripening rate (declining rate in colloid concentrations), and this efficiency was higher for BSA adsorbed from a more dilute BSA solution.

It grew well in broad living conditions, and the relative fluorescence intensity was stable at pH ranging from 5 to 7.5, NaCl concentrations from 0% to 3%, KCl from 1.5% to 5%, and CaCl2 from 1% to 3%. In contrast, the relative fluorescence intensity was negatively correlated with both CdCl2 and HgCl2 concentrations from 0 to 1 mg/L. The luminescent fraction from the cell lysate was purified by ion-exchange chromatography, and identified as a luciferase by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the biofilm of V. campbellii LZ5 was formed constantly under different conditions, and was not affected by heavy metal ions. The data collectively reveal that strain LZ5 has the potential to be developed into a biosensor for real-time monitoring of heavy metals.

Recently, wavelet analysis has been proven to be efficient in many fields, including signal processing and digital image analysis. It can be used to smooth signals and to reduce large data sets to parsimonious representations. The objective of this study was to capture the absorption features of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) by applying wavelet analysis to reflectance spectra. In addition, the correlation between SOC, TN contents, and soil spectra reflectance and wavelet coefficient were analyzed and compared. The results show that the maximum correlation coefficient between SOC, TN, and wavelet coefficient was more than 0.96 compared with the relationship between SOC, TN, and spectral reflectance (r = -0.79 for SOC, r = -0.40 for TN), especially for TN (the maximum negative correlation coefficient, r = -0.964). For SOC + TN and SOC/TN, because SOC contents accounted for a larger proportion of soil composition than TN, their spectral features were mainly affected by SOC in soil samples. In addition, wavelet analysis also enhanced the features of SOC + TN and SOC/TN obviously. These results suggest that wavelet analysis is a better method for capturing the absorption features of soil composition from hyperspectral data. Continuous wavelet transform was confirmed to be an essential and efficient tool used to locate the wavenumber where SOC and TN could be predicted with minimal interference from other components. The results also implied that continuous wavelet transform can be used in discriminating soil composition.

It is cultivated and adapted to marginal lands with harsh environments. Buckwheat has been praised as one of the most faddish green functional foods. Many functional foods including tea made from buckwheat have been put into production around the globe. The buckwheat proteins are particularly rich in lysine and contain less glumatic acid and praline, and more arginine and aspartic acid than cereal proteins. Buckwheat proteins also show a strong supplemental effect with other proteins to improve the dietary amino acid balance with special biological activities of cholesterol-lowering effects, antihypertensition effects, and improving the constipation and obesity conditions by acting in a similar way as dietary fiber and interrupting the in vivo metabolisms. Besides its high-quality proteins, buckwheat is also rich in many rare components that have healing effects on some chronic diseases. Among these components, the most attractive ones are flavones, flavonoids, phytosterols, D-chiro-Inositol, and myo-inositol. In this review we focus on buckwheat's general physical and chemical properties, rare components, functional effects, metabolic engineering of bioactive compounds and trends in the development of functional tea from buckwheat in the latest three years.

Aldehydes were generated in response to a suite of environmental stresses that perturb metabolism including salinity, dehydration, desiccation, and cold and heat shock. Many biologically important aldehydes are metabolized by the superfamily of NAD(P)(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases. Here, starting from the database of Z. mays, we identified 28 aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes and 48 transcripts by the in silico cloning method using the ALDH-conserved domain amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis and rice as a probe. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all 28 members of the ALDH gene families were classified to ten distinct subfamilies. Microarray data and quantitative real-time PCR analysis reveal that ZmALDH9, ZmALDH13, and ZmALDH17 genes involve the function of drought stress, acid tolerance, and pathogens infection. These results suggested that these three ZmALDH genes might be potentially useful in maize genetic improvement.

Full vector finite difference beam propagation method was applied to analyze systematically their transmission loss with different parameters. The structure was optimized by choosing optimal design solution such as the rib width w = 4 mu m, the branch height g = 11 mu m, the outer slab width of core layer in bending waveguide s = 2 mu m and the length of the sine-bending waveguide L-1 = 350 mu m. The results show that if symmetric rib waveguide is replaced by asymmetric rib waveguide, the length of branch waveguide could be reduced by 30% under the same conditions of transmission loss. The results will have a certain reference value to the design of polymer optical waveguide in M-Z modulator. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In total, 1,200 Cobb male broilers were randomly allocated into 5 treatments, with 8 replicates per treatment and 30 birds per replicate, in a 42-d experiment. The dietary treatments were as follows: control, 25, 50, 75, and 100% contaminated corn groups. Results showed that serum aspartate aminotransferase activity in the 75 and 100% contaminated groups were higher than that in the control group on d 21 (P < 0.05). Decreased content of hepatic total protein and increased activities of hepatic glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase were observed as the percentage of contaminated corn increased (P < 0.05). The activity of superoxide dismutase and the content of hepatic malondialdehyde increased when the broilers were fed with more than 50% contaminated corn (P < 0.05). A reduction in glutathione peroxidase level was observed in the AFB(1)- and AFB(2)-contaminated groups on d 21 (P < 0.05). The average pathological lesion scores and apoptosis rate of liver cells increased as the concentration of dietary AFB(1) and AFB(2) increased. Ultrastructural changes were found in the livers of broilers fed 100% contaminated corn. In conclusion, diets containing AFB(1) and AFB(2) could induce pathological lesions in the livers, slightly change the serum biochemical parameters, and damage the hepatic antioxidant functions when the inclusion of AFB(1)- and AFB(2)-contaminated corn reached or exceeded 50%.

Antiviral activity and mode of action of extracts from neem seed kernel against duck plague virus in vitro	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						antiviral activity; neem seed kernel; column chromatography; duck plague virus	AZADIRACHTA-INDICA OIL; ACARICIDAL ACTIVITY; ENTERITIS; OUTBREAK; LARVAE; ASSAY	Four fractions obtained from alcohol extracts of neem (Azadirachta indica) seed kernel by column chromatography were investigated for antivirus activity against the duck plague virus (DPV) in vitro. Duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) infected with DPV were treated with the neem seed kernel extracts, and the effect of antivirus was judged by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide colorimetric method assay and direct immunofluorescence assay. The mode of action was tested by the plaque reduction assay. The results showed that fractions 1 to 3 were inactive. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of fraction 4 was 10.9 mu g/mL and inhibited the virus protein expression in the direct immunofluorescence assay. In the plaque reduction assay, fraction 4 could significantly reduce the number of plaques compared with the negative control (P < 0.01) in all modes of action. This study indicated that the fourth fraction obtained from neem seed kernel could improve the viability of infected cells, and reduce the cytopathic effects caused by DPV and the amount of the virus protein expressed in virus-infected cells. The antiviral activity works in the whole process of virus infecting the normal cells.	[Xu, J.; Song, X.; Yin, Z. Q.; Cheng, A. C.; Jia, R. Y.; Deng, Y. X.; Ye, K. C.; Shi, C.

Integration and decoding of the calcium-spiking signal involve a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) and its phosphorylation substrates, such as CYCLOPS. Here we describe the Lotus japonicus ccamk-14 mutant that originated from a har1-1 suppressor screen. The ccamk-14 mutation causes a serine to asparagine substitution at position 337 located within the calmodulin binding site, which we determined to be an in vitro phosphorylation site in CCaMK. We show that ccamk-14 exerts cell-specific effects on symbiosis. The mutant is characterized by an increased frequency of epidermal infections and significantly compromised cortical infections by Mesorhizobium loti and also the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. The S337 residue is conserved across angiosperm CCaMKs, and testing discrete substitutions at this site showed that it participates in a negative regulation of CCaMK activity, which is required for the cell-type-specific integration of symbiotic signalling.

Recently, more and more studies showed that plastid signals affected more cellular processes other than PhANGs repression. Previous reports indicated that the herbicide norflurazon (NF)-derived signals, sugar signals and plastid gene expression (PGE)-derived signals all regulated anthocyanin accumulation and early anthocyanin biosynthesis gene expression in newly-germinated seedlings. In the research, we found that these signals also work as well for anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in mature Arabidopsis seedlings. Sugar/PGE signals doubled leaf total anthocyanins within 48 h (accumulated at the base of petiole), while NF signals induced a little anthocyanin accumulation (about 30 % and invisible to the naked eye). The plastid hexokinase (pHXK) participates in sugar/PGE signalling, while the plastid Genomes uncoupled protein 1 (GUN1) and the nuclear ABA-insensitive transcription factor 4 (ABI4) are involved in both sugar/PGE signalling and NF-derived signalling.

Effect of threonine on immunity and reproductive performance of male mice infected with pseudorabies virus	ANIMAL			English	Article						threonine; pseudorabies virus; immunity; reproductive performance	HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-2; FREE AMINO-ACIDS; SEMINAL PLASMA; MUCIN SYNTHESIS; DIETARY THREONINE; INFERTILE MEN; DISEASE VIRUS; SEMEN; PARAMETERS	The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary threonine (Thr) supplement on reproductive performance and immune function of the male mice challenged with pseudorabies virus (PRV). Kun-Ming male mice were assigned randomly to four groups with different Thr levels (0.70%, 0.88%, 1.10% and 1.30%). Half of the mice in each group were injected with PRV or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after 5 weeks' adaptation to diets. The second experiment examined the effects of dietary Thr level on copulation rate, pregnancy rate and average number per litter of PRV- or PBS-challenged male mice that copulated with adult female mice on the 9th day post PRV challenge. Sperm quality and testosterone of mice were decreased after PRV infection, but this effect was attenuated by increasing Thr levels. Copulation and conception rates were increased with increasing Thr levels (P = 0.14), but litter size was not affected (P > 0.05). In the PBS and PRV groups, mice fed higher levels of Thr had increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM concentrations. The PRV-specific antibody level, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha concentration in PRV groups enhanced with increasing Thr levels; however, there was no difference in PBS groups. Furthermore, higher toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR9 expressions in testis were observed by PRV challenge compared with PBS groups, and higher Thr supplement attenuated PRV-challenged induced the upregulation effect of TLR2 and TLR9 mRNA expression in testis (P < 0.05). These data suggest that higher Thr consumption was recommended in order to counteract the deleterious effects of virus invasion, possibly through the downregulated expression of TLRs, and thus to improve immunity and reproduction performance of male mice challenged with PRV.

The positive recombinant plasmid was selected and sequenced. Molecular characteristics analysis of the yrp1 gene and the protein which is encoded by it was performed. The results showed that the yrp1 gene is 1434 bp in length with G+C content of 44.35%. The analysis of codon bias indicated that the codon usage frequency of the yrp1 gene is distinctly different and it is preferable to perform in E. coli and yeast. The theoretical relative molecular mass and iso-electric point of the Yrp1 amino acid sequence are about 51.5 kDa and 4.48 separately. The polypeptide has some important sites related to post-translational modification, including 35 potential phosphorylation sites and 4 potential N-glycosylation sites. The polypeptide analyzed in this study contains a ZnMc superfamily conserved domains and does not contain a signal peptide, even though it is a secretory protein.

The purpose in the present study was to analyze the association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of exon 6 in prolactin receptor gene with egg production traits in Erlang mountainous chickens, a native breed from Poultry farm of Sichuan Agricultural University which consisted of two pure lines SD02 and SD03. Polymerase Chain Reaction-single-strand Conformation Polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods were used. Results showed that One SNP (G1836C) which had not yet been reported was found and two alleles (G, C) and two genotypes (GO, CC) were also detected. It observed significant differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies among all the chicken populations. Genotype frequencies in all chicken for GG and CC were 56.22 and 43.78%, respectively. Associations of polymorphisms of the PRLR gene with egg production traits were analyzed by using a GLM procedure. The CC genotype had extremely significant effect on Age at First Egg (AFE) (p<0.01) and the AFE of CC genotype had 3.75 days earlier than GG genotype. There was no significant association of G1836C with BWFE; body weight at first egg, WFE; weight at first egg, EN; egg number during 300 days after hatch, BWTA; body weight at 300 days of age and WTE; egg weight at 300 days of age. Therefore, the study showed that the PRLR gene may either a major gene that influences age at first egg of chicken or a molecular marker in close linkage with such a gene.

Characterization of a QTL affecting spike morphology on the long arm of chromosome 3H in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) based on near isogenic lines and a NIL-derived population	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; PLANT HEIGHT; LINKAGE MAP; WHEAT; GENES; RESISTANCE; RESOLUTION; CULTIVARS; LEAF; STEM	Traits related to spike morphology (SM), including grain density (GD), spike length (SL) and awn length (AL), are of central importance in cereal improvement. A recent study based on a two-row landrace of barley, TX9425, detected QTL controlling all of the three traits in a similar region on the long arm of chromosome 3H. To further characterize this chromosomal region, 12 pairs of near isogenic lines (NILs) for GD were generated from two populations between TX9425 and two different commercial cultivars. A population consisting of 1,028 lines segregating primarily for the target region was also developed using materials generated during the production of these NILs. Results from the analysis of the NILs and the NIL-derived population showed that these three traits were likely controlled by a single-locus which was mapped to a 2.84 cM interval between two SSR markers, GBM1495 and HVM33. Across the 12 pairs of NILs, the presence of the 3HL locus increased GD by 53.4 %, reduced SL and AL by 38.8 % and 62.7 %, respectively. In the NIL-derived population, the presence of the 3HL locus increased GD by 64.6 %, reduced SL and AL by 33.7 % and 62.6 %, respectively. An interesting question arising from this research is why some loci such as the one reported here affect several SM-related traits while others appear to affect one of these traits only. The NILs and the NIL-derived population generated in this study will help answer such questions by providing the germplasm to enable cloning and comparative analysis of the genes responsible for these SM-related traits.

A total of 420 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a control diet or the same diet supplemented with vanadium at the doses of 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg in the form of ammonium metavanadate. In comparison with control group, the dietary vanadium at the doses of 45 and 60 mg/kg could decrease the counts of Bifidobacterium spp. in the intestinal tract at 21 and 42 days of age. With increasing level in dietary vanadium, the counts of Escherichia coli were significantly increased in the ileum, cecum, and rectum and were decreased in the duodenum at 21 and 42 days of age. However, the counts of Lactobacilli were decreased in the cecum and rectum and increased in the ileum of 45 and 60 mg/kg groups. The colonization of these three bacteria could be affected by dietary vanadium. DGGE analysis showed that the number of bands in duodenum, ileum, cecum, and rectum were obviously decreased in the 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg groups at 21 and 42 days of age. In conclusion, the dietary vanadium in excess of 30 mg/kg could alter the amount and diversity of intestinal bacteria in broilers, implying that the structure and initial balance in the intestinal microbiota were disrupted.

One hundred Duroc x Landrance x Yorkshire crossbred castrated male pigs (41.7 +/- 3.9 kg body weight) were randomly allotted to 4 treatments with 5 replications (pens) per treatment, and 5 pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were: 1) CON (basal control diet), 2) BLBM-10 (BLBM replaced 10% crude protein in soybean meal), 3) BLBM-25 (BLBM replaced 25% crude protein in soybean meal), and 4) BLBM-50 (BLBM replaced 50% crude protein in soybean meal). In addition, two metabolism trials were conducted to determine the impact of BLBM on nitrogen metabolism and the excretion of purine base derivatives. Compared with the control pigs, BLBM-10 and BLBM-25 pigs had similar average daily gain (ADC), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G/F) during the growing period. The BLBM-50 treatment decreased ADC and elevated G/F during the growing and the whole period (P < 0.05). The BLBM-50 treatment had greater ADFI and G/F than other treatments during the finishing period (P < 0.05). The nitrogen digestibility and nitrogen biological value in pigs fed BLBM-10 and BLBM-25 diets were similar to the CON treatment, while those criteria in pigs fed BLBM-50 diets were lower than those on the CON treatment (P < 0.05). The serum urea nitrogen values increased in response to BLBM supplementation during the growing and finishing period (P < 0.05), and the pigs had the greatest urea nitrogen concentrations when they were fed the BLBM-50 diets (P < 0.05). The urinary excretion of purine base derivatives and the concentrations of uric acid, xanthine, and hypoxanthine in plasma increased with increasing dietary content of BLBM (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the nitrogen metabolism in growing-finishing pigs was unaffected when up to 25% of crude protein in soybean meal was replaced by BLBM. The excretion of purine base derivatives were increased by BLBM levels in diets. It is feasible that BLBM substitutes 25% of crude protein in soybean meal for growing-finishing pig diets.

Also, more detailed experiments were conducted on Athyrium wardii using a pot experiment to assure its Cd-accumulation ability and tolerance as a potential phytostabilizer of Cd-polluted soils. Nine dominant plant species growing on Pb/Zn mine tailings and their corresponding nonmining ecotypes were investigated for their potential to phytostabilize Cd. The performance of A. wardii exposed to high levels of Cd was investigated under controlled conditions. A field study revealed that the Cd concentrations in the roots of these plants ranged from 0.21 to 251.07 mg kg(-1), and the highest concentrations were found in A. wardii, which reached a concentration of 69.78, 251.07, and 126.35 mg kg(-1) during the early growth stage (May), vigorous growth stage (August), and late growth stage (October), respectively. The Cd concentrations of roots among the nine mining ecotypes were positively correlated with available content of Cd in the rhizosphere soils, whereas a negative correlation was observed in the nonmining ecotypes. A pot experiment showed that the mining ecotype of A. wardii had a higher biomass production and Cd retention capacity in roots than that of the nonmining ecotype. Due to the relatively high tolerance to Cd and the capacity of roots to retain this metal, A. wardii may be useful for the phytostabilization of soils contaminated by Cd.

First live offspring born in superovulated sika deer (Cervus nippon) after embryo vitrification	THERIOGENOLOGY			English	Article						Sika deer; Superovulation; Estrous detection; Vitrification; Embryo transfer	BOVINE EMBRYOS; ARTIFICIAL-INSEMINATION; SHEEP EMBRYOS; DAMA-DAMA; ELAPHUS; FROZEN; CRYOPRESERVATION; RECOVERY; STRAW; FSH	The rapid growth in sika deer (Cervus nippon) farming and interest in their conservation is an impetus for development of embryo transfer (ET) procedures. However, a paucity of research has prevented widespread application of ET in this species. The objective of the present study was to establish a multiple ovulation and ET procedure with both fresh and vitrified embryos in sika deer. Multiparous weaned hinds (N = 18) were used as embryo donors during the reproductive season of 2008 at a local breeding farm in China. Estrus was synchronized in donors and recipients (N = 38) by inserting a controlled internal drug release for 12 days (insertion = Day 0). Superovulation was induced with a total of 320 mg of NIH-FSH-P1 (Folltropin-V; Bioniche, Belleville, ON, Canada) given as 40 mg im every 12 h from the afternoon of Day 9 to the morning of Day 13. After estrus was detected, donors were artificially inseminated using a transcervical technique. The embryo recovery rate was 76.8% (63/82), including 1.6% (1/63), 77.8% (49/63), and 1.6% (1/63) blastocysts, morula, and eight-cell embryos, respectively. After transfer of fresh. and vitrified embryos, pregnancy rates were 85.7% and 61.6% and birth rates were 64.3% and 53.9% (P > 0.05). In conclusion developed a satisfactory multiple ovulation and ET procedure in farmed sika deer using vitrified embryos. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Wang, L.; Shi, J. M.; Tian, X.

Of these, 137 samples were BVDV-positive and the BVDV prevalence rate was 23.1% (9/39) in 2007,27.7% (44/159) in 2008,33.6% (34/101) in 2009, and 23.6% (50/212) in 2010. Twenty of 137 BVDV-positive samples were used for further genetic analysis of the 5'-UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were BVDV-1 and subtyped into BVDV-la, BVDV-1b, BVDV-1m, BVDV-1o and an unknown subgenotype. This study showed that BVDVs were highly prevalent in Chinese pig herds and appropriate measures should be taken to control BVDV prevalence in pig herds. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thioesterases play a key role in the regulation of the fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli. Therefore, exploring more promising thioesterases will contribute to the development of industrial microbial lipids production. Results: We cloned and expressed a cytosolic Acinetobacter baylyi thioesterase ('AcTesA) in E. coli by deleting its leader sequence. Protein sequence alignment, structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser(10), Gly(48), Asn(77), Asp(158) and His(161) residues composed the active centre of 'AcTesA. The engineered strain that overexpressed 'AcTesA achieved a FFAs titer of up to 501.2 mg/L in shake flask, in contrast to only 20.5 mg/L obtained in wild-type E. coli, demonstrating that the expression of 'AcTesA indeed boosted the synthesis of FFAs. The 'AcTesA exhibited a substrate preference towards the C8-C16 acyl groups, with C14:0, C16:1, C12:0 and C8:0 FFAs being the top four components. Optimization of expression level of 'AcTesA made the FFAs production increase to 551.3 mg/L. The FFAs production further increased to 716.1 mg/L by optimization of the culture medium. Fed-batch fermentation was also carried out to evaluate the FFAs production in a scaleable process. Finally, 3.6 g/L FFAs were accumulated within 48 h, and a maximal FFAs yield of 6.1% was achieved in 12-16 h post induction. Conclusions: For the first time, an A. baylyi thioesterase was cloned and solubly expressed in the cytosol of E. coli. This leaderless thioesterase ('AcTesA) was found to be capable of enhancing the FFAs production of E. coli. Without detailed optimization of the strain and fermentation, the finally achieved 3.6 g/L FFAs is encouraging. In addition, 'AcTesA exhibited different substrate specificity from other thioesterases previously reported, and can be used to supply the fatty acid-based biofuels with high quality of FFAs. Altogether, this study provides a promising thioesterase for FFAs production, and is of great importance in enriching the library of useful thioesterases.

J	Qin, P; Ting, D; Shieh, A; McCormick, S				Qin, Peng; Ting, Dylan; Shieh, Andrew; McCormick, Sheila			Callose plug deposition patterns vary in pollen tubes of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes and tomato species	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Callose plugs; Pollen tube growth; Sperm	IN-VITRO; GROWTH; GERMINATION; CELL; PLANTS	Background: The pollen grain contains the male gametophyte that extends a pollen tube that grows through female tissues in order to deliver sperm to the embryo sac for double fertilization. Growing pollen tubes form periodic callose plugs that are thought to block off the older parts of the tube and maintain the cytoplasm near the growing tip. The morphology of callose plugs and the patterns of their deposition were previously shown to vary among species, but variation within a species had not been examined. We therefore systematically examined callose plug deposition in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, tested for heritability using reciprocal crosses between ecotypes that had differing deposition patterns, and investigated the relationship between callose plugs and pollen tube growth rate. We also surveyed callose plug deposition patterns in different species of tomato. Results: We used in vitro grown pollen tubes of 14 different A. thaliana ecotypes and measured the distance from the pollen grain pore to the first callose plug (termed first interval). This distance varied among Arabidopsis ecotypes and in some cases even within an ecotype. Pollen tubes without a callose plug were shorter than those with a callose plug, and tubes with a callose plug near the grain were, on average, longer than those with the first callose plug farther from the grain. Variations in the first callose plug position were also observed between different species of tomato. Conclusions: We showed that the position of the first callose plug varied among Arabidopsis ecotypes and in tomato species, and that callose plug deposition patterns were heritable. These findings lay a foundation for mapping genes that regulate callose plug deposition or that determine pollen tube length or growth rate.

Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT), the levels of glutathion (GSH), and the ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical formation were significantly decreased (p<0.05 or p<0.01). On the other hand, the malondialdehyde (MDA) level was significantly increased (p<0.05 or p<0.01) in the two high F groups when compared with those of the control group from 14 to 42 days of age. The results indicate that high dietary F, especially in excess of 800 mg/kg, caused oxidative stress in the mucosa of the intestines, thereby reducing the intestinal antioxidant ability in broilers.

The effects of temperatures (12.9-27.1 degrees C) and water activity (NaCl% 0.6%-3.4%) on V. harveyi were investigated. The behavior and growth characteristics of V. harveyi was studied and modeled. Growth curves were fitted by using Gompertz and Baranyi models, and the Baranyi model showed a better fittness. Then, the maximum growth rates (mu(max)) and lag phase durations (LPD, lambda) obtained from both Gompertz and Baranyi model were modeled as a combination function of temperature and water activity using the response surface and Arrhenius-Davey models for secondary model. The value of r(2), MSE, bias and accuracy factor suggest Baranyi model has better fitness than Gompertz model. Furthermore, validation of the developed models with independent data from ComBase also shown better interrelationship between observed and predicted growth parameter when using Baranyi model.

In order to study the interaction, the three-dimension model test about adjacent tunnel was carried out with the system for structure and rockmass of highway tunnel and numerical methods are used to compare with the model test. Then the following conclusion comes out. First, model test datum accord with numerical analysis datum well and the testing datum about old tunnel's rockmass internal displacement and new tunnel's new tunnel's peripheral displacement, witch have been transformed with similarity principle, are close to numerical results. Secondly, old tunnel's rockmass internal displacement is compression deformation at crown, tensile deformation at hance. Thirdly, old tunnel's axial force and moment of supporting structure keep increasing and middle hance internal force of supporting structure increased most obviously. Fourthly, new tunnel's crown settlement is greater than peripheral convergence and left peripheral convergence is greater than right peripheral convergence. Last, model testing results that adjacent spacing has influence on the interaction between exiting tunnel and new tunnels, are larger than numerical analysis results.

The effects of initial sugar concentration, yeast inoculation, inorganic N, P nutrients, metal ions and vitamins on ethanol yield and SOD production were investigated. The results indicated that the SOD production of 2.99 x 10(4) U.L-1 could be achieved with the condensed juice (initial sugar concentration of 350 g.L-1) comparing with fresh juice (0.68 x 10(4) U.L-1), although approximately 6% of ethanol yield was lost. Extra high yeast inoculation could not improve ethanol yield and SOD production, and 0.25 g.L-1 yeast should be enough for VHG fermentation. For application, the compromised supplementation for (NH4)(2)SO4, KH2PO4, Zn(AC)(2), CuSO4, thiamine and inositol could be selected at 1.0 g.L-1, 3.0 g.L-1, 0 mg.L-1, 7.5 mg.L-1, 100 mg.L-1 and 75 mg.L-1, respectively, for fermentation with 350 g.L-1 initial sugar concentration. At their corresponding supplementations, ethanol yield and SOD production could be obtained in the ranges of 0.38 g.g(-1)-0.41 g.g(-1) and 1.23 x 10(4)-3.82 x 10(4) U.L-1, respectively.

We have developed a new hydrological runoff parameterization called XXT to improve the performance of a coupled land surface-atmosphere modeling system. The XXT parameterization, which is based upon the Xinanjiang hydrological model and TOPMODEL, includes an optimized function of runoff calculation with a new soil moisture storage capacity distribution curve (SMSCC). We then couple XXT with the Global/Regional Assimilation Prediction System (GRAPES) and compare it to GRAPES coupled with a simple water balance model (SWB). For the model evaluation and comparison, we perform 72-h online simulations using GRAPES-XXT and GRAPES-SWB during two torrential events in August 2007 and July 2008, respectively. The results show that GRAPES can reproduce the rainfall distribution and intensity fairly well in both cases. Differences in the representation of feedback processes between surface hydrology and the atmosphere result in differences in the distributions and amounts of precipitation simulated by GRAPES-XXT and GRAPES-SWB. The runoff simulations are greatly improved by the use of XXT in place of SWB, particularly with respect to the distribution and amount of runoff. The average runoff depth is nearly doubled in the rainbelt area, and unreasonable runoff distributions simulated by GRAPES-SWB are made more realistic by the introduction of XXT. Differences in surface soil moisture between GRAPES-XXT and GRAPES-SWB show that the XXT model changes infiltration and increases surface runoff. We also evaluate river flood discharge in the Yishu River basin. The peak values of flood discharge calculated from the output of GRAPES-XXT agree more closely with observations than those calculated from the output of GRAPES-SWB.

DNA rearrangements have also been reported to accompany allopolyploidization. A study of the effect of allopolyploidization on SSR mutation is therefore important for understanding the origin and evolutionary dynamics of SSRs in allopolyploids. Three synthesized double haploid (SynDH) populations were made from 241 interspecific F-1 haploid hybrids between Triticum turgidum L. and Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) through spontaneous chromosome doubling via unreduced gametes. Mutation events were studied at 160 SSR loci in the S-1 generation (the first generation after chromosome doubling) of the three SynDH populations. Of the 148260 SSR alleles investigated in S-1 generation, only one mutation (changed number of repeats) was confirmed with a mutation rate of 6.74 x 10(-6). This mutation most likely occurred in the respective F-1 hybrid. In comparison with previously reported data, our results suggested that allohexaploidization of wheat did not increase SSR mutation rate.

These 2 well-characterized SNPs in RYR1 and ESR1 are responsible for porcine stress syndrome (PSS) and litter size, respectively. Here, we describe a reliable, high-efficiency method for the genotyping of these 2 genes using the high-resolution melting (HRM) method. The HRM approach exhibited high-accuracy and repeatability, comparable with the classic PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) approach, and is potentially suitable for large-scale genotyping in commercial pig farms.

Natural hybridization between Kengyilia and Roegneria or Elymus species has not been reported as yet. Several sterile wheatgrass individuals exhibiting intermediately morphological traits between Kengyilia and Roegneria or Elymus species were identified in the meadow of Sichuan and Gansu provinces in China, suggesting their natural hybrid origin. The putative hybrids were analyzed by using the sequences of ITS and trnH-psbA together with cytological observation in order to assess the origin of hybrids. Both ITS and cytological data revealed the evidence of allopolyploid origin and confirmed the presence of StStYYP and StStYYHP genomes in the putative natural hybrids. The data suggest that the StStYYP hybrid originated from hybridization between Kengyilia and Roegneria and the hybrid with StStYYHP originated from hybridization between Kengyilia and Elymus. Chloroplast sequence data demonstrated that K. rigidula and K. melanthera were the likely maternal donors in the hybridization events.

Dwarf Polish wheat (Triticum polonicum L., 2n = 4x = 28, AABB AS304) is a potential donor of dwarfing and other traits for common wheat improvement. A genetic analysis using an F-2 population derived from a cross of AS304 and tall cultivar AS302 and derived F-2:3 lines indicated that AS304 carries a recessive dwarfing gene, temporarily designated Rht-dp. Molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis were used to characterize and map the gene. Eight polymorphic SSR markers (Xwmc511, Xgwm495, Xgwm 113, Xgwm192, Xgpw7026, Xgpw3017, Xgpw1108 and Xgpw7521) on chromosome arm 4BS and two AFLP markers (M (8) /E (5) and M (4) /E (3) ) were mapped relative to the dwarfing locus. The closest linked markers, Xgpw3017 and M (8) /E (5) at 0.5 and 3.5 cM, respectively, from Rht-dp will enable its marker assisted transfer to wheat breeding populations. Allelic tests indicated that Rht-dp was allelic to Rht-B1b; hence it may be an alternative allele at the Rht-B1 locus.

Although several SOTs have been identified and characterized in mammalian, their role in plant is still unclear. In this study, we report genome-wide comprehensive expression analysis of 35 putative SOT genes in rice. The 35 OsSOTs were tandemly arranged into six clusters. The phylogenetic analysis showed that there were 7 subfamilies of OsSOTs and 11 putatively conserved motifs. Six OsSOTs might be pseudogenes, 25 have the two motifs which were involved in PAPS binding regions I and IV. Microarray data indicated that all the OsSOTs were expressed almost at the same level but with different patterns: most OsSOTs were expressed exclusively in stigma and ovary and induced by IAA and BAP, several genes were induced by tZ and DMSO and 11 OsSOTs were response to abiotic stress. Further analysis showed that these 11 genes contained cis-regulatory elements responding to abiotic stresses.

Association of Protein Kinase Adenosine Monophosphate-activated gamma 3-subunit (PRKAG3) Gene Polymorphisms with Carcass Traits in Chinese Meat-type Chickens	JOURNAL OF POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						association analysis; carcass traits; chicken; PRKAG3 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; PIG SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PHENOTYPIC RELATIONSHIPS; GLYCOGEN-CONTENT; FOOD-INTAKE; QUALITY; GROWTH; IDENTIFICATION; POPULATIONS; EXPRESSION	The protein kinase adenosine monophosphate-activated gamma 3-subunit (PRKAG3) gene encodes the muscle specific isoform of the regulatory gamma 3 subunit of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), which participates in regulation of energy metabolism and food intake in animals. In the present study, we investigated the genetic polymorphisms of the PRKAG3 gene and the association with carcass performance in 470 Daheng meat-type chickens. One nucleotide substitution (c. 3207 A > G) was detected in the eleventh exon, which caused an amino acid change (p. 1069 T > A). The frequencies of the three genotypes were 44.22% (AA), 36.98% (AB), and 18.80% (BB), respectively. The association of genotypes with chicken carcass traits showed that the genotypes were significantly associated with live weight (LW), carcass weight (CW), breast muscle weight (BMW), leg muscle weight (LMW), abdominal fat weight (AW) and subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) traits. The BB genotype has higher performance than which of genotypes AB and AA in traits LW, CW, BMW, LMW and AW (P<0.01 or P<0.05), which would be genetically advantageous to improve carcass traits in Daheng meat-type chickens. To our knowledge, this is the first report to study the genetic polymorphism of the PRKAG3 gene and its association with carcass traits in chicken.

In this work, the effects of various plant hormones and sugars on the expression of the starch synthase I gene (ZmSSI) in developing maize endosperms were examined. The accumulation of ZmSSI mRNA was induced using abscisic acid (ABA) but not with glucose, sucrose, or gibberellin treatment. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this effect, the ZmSSI promoter region (1537 to 51) was isolated and analysed. A transient expression assay in maize endosperm tissue showed that the full-length ZmSSI promoter is activated by ABA. The results of deletion and mutation assays demonstrated that a CACCG motif in the ZmSSI promoter is responsible for the ABA inducibility. The results of binding shift assays indicated that this CACCG motif interacts with the maize ABI4 protein in vitro. The overexpression of ABI4 in endosperm tissue enhanced the activity of a promoter containing the CACCG motif in the absence of ABA treatment. Expression pattern analysis indicated that the transcription pattern of ABI4 in the developing maize endosperm was induced by ABA treatment but was only slightly affected by glucose or sucrose treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that ABI4 binds to the CACCG motif in the ZmSSI promoter and mediates its ABA inducibility.

The mitogenomes of two lenoks shared common features with those of other teleosts in terms of gene arrangement, base composition, and transfer RNA structures. The two genomes have an overall nucleotide sequence identity of 98.3%. Through the comparisons between the two lenoks, we found their gene arrangement, composition, and sizes are the same, and the A + T content is identical. As with other freshwater salmonids, a T-type mononucleotide microsatellite and various tandem repeats were identified in the control regions of the lenoks. The low pairwise distance (2.1%) inferred from 12 mitochondrial protein-coding genes on heavy strand showed close proximity of B. lenok and B. lenok tsinlingensis.

Development and application of specific polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the gyrB gene for rapid detection of Riemerella anatipestifer	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Riemerella anatipestifer; gyrB gene; polymerase chain reaction	PASTEURELLA-ANATIPESTIFER; PCR; SEQUENCE; SEROTYPES; BACTERIA; DUCKS; TESTS	A pair of PCR primers was designed and synthesized to amplify a gyrB gene sequence from Riemerella anatipestifer (RA). A fragment of 194 bp was detected in RA-positive isolates, whereas other isolates were negative, which confirmed the high specificity of the primers and PCR conditions. As little as 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/mL of cultural liquid was required by this method. We compared a 16S rRNA sequence-based PCR method and a Biolog bacterial identification system used in the detection and identification of suspicious isolates of RA in clinical tests. The results showed that the gyrB-based PCR was consistent with the results of the Biolog identification system and was more specific. By applying the gyrB-PCR to detect RA strains in 56 duck livers, a positive rate of 46% (26/56) was observed, whereas the positive rate of 85 throat swabs from clinically healthy ducks was 11%. Thus, this method could be used for the epidemiological investigation and preliminary isolate identification of RA.	[Wang, X. P.; Zhu, D. K.; Wang, M. S.; Cheng, A. C.; Jia, R. Y.; Chen, S.; Chen, X.

Comparison and characteristics of the formation of different adipose tissues in ducks during early growth	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						subcutaneous adipose tissue; regional difference; perilipin; adipose differentiation-related protein; 47-kDa tail interacting protein	ADIPOCYTE SIZE; GENE-EXPRESSION; GALLUS-DOMESTICUS; LIPID DROPLETS; PERILIPIN GENE; CELL SIZE; CELLULARITY; FAT; PROTEIN; OBESITY	The objective of the current research was to investigate the pattern of subcutaneous adipose tissue growth during Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) early development and to determine the reasons for regional differences. The morphological characteristics in 5 regions of subcutaneous tissue, including the neck area (NSF), chest area (CSF), lower abdomen area (ASF), back area (BSF), and leg area (LSF), were analyzed by comparing the morphology of the sections, adipocyte volume and number, and lipid content from wk 1 to 8. Moreover, the mRNA expression of several molecular marker genes, including 47-kDa tail interacting protein (TIP47), adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), and perilipin, were detected from wk 1 to 8 using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results revealed that the average cell number declined greatly as fattening proceeded (except in the NSF) and changed very little after wk 4 in all 5 regions. In contrast, the average cell volume and triglyceride content per cell increased gradually during early duck growth. The BSF and LSF lipid content had a different pattern of change than the other regions. The NSF, CSF, and ASP regions had the highest lipid content values at all stages, the BSF was intermediate, and the LSF was the lowest at all weeks except wk 3. The highest TIN 7 expression level was found in the NSF from wk 1 to 2 and BSF at wk 1. The relative expression level of TIP47 was higher in the CSF than in the ASF and BSF at wk 4, and was higher in the NSF than in the ASF at wk 6. The highest levels of ADRP and perilipin were detected in the LSF. These results suggest that a combination of adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy is mainly responsible for the development of duck adipose tissue before wk 4, after which adipose expansion is accomplished by adipocyte hypertrophy only. Adipocyte hyperplastic and hypertrophic capacity, fat storage capacity, and metabolic activity may be partial explanations for the regional differences during duck growth.	[Kou, J.; Wang, W.

The objective of this study was to identify, the significant pathways and key, genes that regulate intestinal development in Landrace piglets, and elucidate their rules of operation. The differential expression of genes related to intestinal development during suckling time was investigated using a porcine genome array. Time sequence profiles were analyzed for the differentially expressed genes to obtain significant expression profiles. Subsequently, the most significant profiles were assayed using Gene Ontology categories, pathway analysis, network analysis, and analysis of gene co-expression to unveil the main biological processes, the significant pathways, and the effective genes, respectively,. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to verify the reliability of the results of the analysis of the array. The results showed that more than 8000 differential expression transcripts were identified using microarray technology. Among the 30 significant obtained model profiles, profiles 66 and 13 were the most significant. Analysis of profiles 66 and 13 indicated that they were mainly involved in immunity, metabolism, and cell division or proliferation. Among the most effective genes in these two profiles, CN161469, which is similar to methylcrotonoyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase 2 (beta), and U89949.1, which encodes a folate binding protein, had a crucial influence on the co-expression network.

Methods: Seventy-two 3-mo-old rats were allocated to one of four groups: low fat/low fiber (L-L), low fat/high fiber, high fat/low fiber (H-L), or high fat/high fiber. Rats were fed the treatment diets 4 wk before mating and continued in pregnancy until sample collections were obtained on days 13.5 and 17.5 of pregnancy. Results: The fetal weight in the L-L group was significantly lower than that in the H-L group (P < 0.05). The placental nutrient transporter mRNA expressions of glucose transporter-3 (Slc2a3) and cationic amino acid transporter-1 (Slc7a1) in the L-L group with a decreased fetal weight were downregulated compared with that in the H-L group with an increased fetal weight. However, placental Slc2a1 and the system A amino acid transporter gene Slc38a4 mRNA expressions were adaptively upregulated by the L-L diet with a decreased fetal weight (P < 0.05). For the placental imprinted gene Igf-2 and H19 expressions, lower Igf-2 and higher H19 expressions were associated with the decreased fetal growth in the L-L group compared with the H-L group with an increased fetal weight. Different fetal growth was associated with different DNA methyltransferase-1 and methyltransferase-3a expressions (P > 0.05) and energy metabolism-related genes. Conclusion: Collectively, these results demonstrated that intrauterine fetal growth could be affected by different energy intake types through placenta nutrient transporter gene expressions, and different fetal growths were associated with altered fetal genes related to DNA methylation and energy metabolism.

However, the abortion mechanism of CMS-C is currently unknown. The major aim of this work was to characterize the expression of genes and proteins during pollen abortion. The materials assayed included CMS-C line C48-2, its maintainer line N48-2, and fertile F-1 (C48-2 x 18 white). A total of 20 unique genes and 25 proteins were identified by suppression subtractive hybridization and 2-D electrophoresis, respectively. Most of the genes and proteins identified are closely related to energy metabolism, stress responses, molecular chaperones, and cell death, which are generally considered to be essential to pollen development. Based on the function of these identified genes and proteins, reactive oxygen species in isolated mitochondria and DNA fragments were analyzed. The results from this study indicate that the oxidative stress which was associated with the specific expression patterns of some genes may be the physiological cause for the abortion of premature microspores in the maize CMS-C line.

Four well known brown midrib (bm) mutants, named bm1-4, were identified several decades ago. Additional recessive brown midrib mutants have been identified by allelism tests and designated as bm5 and bm6. In this study, we determined that bm6 increases cell wall digestibility and decreases plant height. bm6 was confirmed onto the short arm of chromosome 2 by a small mapping set with 181 plants from a F-2 segregating population, derived from crossing B73 and a bm6 mutant line. Subsequently, 960 brown midrib individuals were selected from the same but larger F-2 population for genetic and physical mapping. With newly developed markers in the target region, the bm6 gene was assigned to a 180 kb interval flanked by markers SSR_308337 and SSR_488638. In this region, ten gene models are predicted in the maize B73 sequence. Analysis of these ten genes as well as genes in the syntenic rice region revealed that four of them are promising candidate genes for bm6. Our study will facilitate isolation of the underlying gene of bm6 and advance our understanding of brown midrib gene functions.

Compared with previously reported HMW genes, they showed modifications in all domains. Qy genes had an extra glutamine and 105 residues in the N terminal, two irregular tandem repeats of P-GQQGQQVYYPTAPQQ in the repetitive domain, and had the same short peptide LAAQLPAMCRLE as in x-type genes in the C-terminal. Besides these modifications, the 11 aa peptides, GSYYPGQASPQQ, conserved in the repetitive domain in all genes, were absent in Qy. Oy genes with 103 residues, had the short IPTLLS peptide found in x-type genes in the N terminal, and had unique tandem repeats of PGQGQ-RQQGYYPTSQQQ and GQQGQQ in the repetitive domain, and shared the short peptide LAAQLPAMCRLE with those of x-type genes in the C-terminal. Three of four y gene ORFs were successfully expressed in bacteria. In the phylogenetic tree based on the N- and C-terminal sequences, Qy and Oy genes clustered with y and x genes, respectively. This suggested that genes Qy and Oy were not pure y genes, but also had some characteristics of x genes. These unique structures provide new information for understanding the origin and evolution of x and y genes as well as wheat quality improvement.

Suckling rabbits were challenged with 1.5 x 10(7) colony forming unit (CFU) of S. aureus at the base of the third pair teats, and they were treated and pretreated with JYT to detect the formula effects. The results showed that JYT could reduce the occurrence of Staphylococcal mastitis in rabbit model. To further investigate the action mechanism of JYT, we examined the leukocyte counts and inflammatory mediator levels such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 in blood and infected tissue. From histological study and blood analysis, we found that JYT could suppress leukocyte infiltration in infected mammary gland tissue and significantly inhibit the total leukocyte counts and lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON) and granulocytes (GRA) fractions of leukocyte counts in blood. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed JYT significantly decreased the TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations in serum and mammary gland. The analysis of these data suggested that JYT effectively inhibited inflammatory responses to reduce the occurrence of mastitis in rabbit model.

In this study, we characterized a cDNA of Schizothorax prenanti PGC-1 alpha and investigated its tissue and developmental profiles, as well as the relationship between its developmental change and intramuscular fat (IMF) content. Cloning and sequencing analysis revealed that S. prenanti PGC-1 alpha showed high similarity to those of other vertebrates with conservation of functional domain including Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) binding site, RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) and serine-arginine repeats. The expression of PGC-1 alpha in kidney, heart and intestine was significantly higher than in other tissues studied (p<0.05). Furthermore, the PGC-1 alpha gene expression level in muscle increased with the growth of fish, showing higher mRNA level at 24 months than at other stages (p<0.05). PGC-1 alpha mRNA levels were positively correlated with intramuscular fat (IMF) content (R-2 = 0.714. p<0.01.). Allelic variation at nucleotide positions 588 of S. prenanti PGC-1 alpha was detected by PCR-SSCP method and most samples examined were C/C homozygous. The results of this study will facilitate further investigation of fish PGC-1 alpha function and the eventual control of cultured fish quality.

Although various biological processes have been known for the ADAM family in different species including fertilization, neurogenesis, infection and inflammation, little is known about its detailed phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary history. In this study, the ADAMs of Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens were collected and analyzed by using the Bayesian analysis and gene synteny analysis to establish a comprehensive phylogenetic relationship and evolutionary drive of this gene family. It was found that there were more ADAMs in the two rodents than in the amphibian, suggesting an expansion of the ADAM gene family during the early evolution of mammals. All ADAMs from this expansion were retained in both the rodents, but other duplication events occurred subsequently in the two rodents, respectively, leading to the classification of rodent ADAMs as classes I, II and III. Moreover, these duplicated ADAM genes in the rodents were found to be driven by positive selection, which might be the major force to retain them in the genome. Importantly, it was also found that orthologs of ADAM3 and 5 have been lost in humans. These results not only provide valuable information of the evolution of ADAM genes, but may also help in understanding the role of ADAM genes in the pathobiology of relevant diseases.

The Maximum Parsimony, Bayesian Inference and TCS network phylogenetic reconstructions partitioned the species into three reciprocally monophyletic groups. Kengyilia kokonorica, Kengyilia melanthera, K. melon them var. tahopaica, Kengyilia mutica, and Kengyilia thoroldiana were related to species of Agropyron, whereas Kengyilia alatavica, Kengyilia batalinii, Kengyilia gobicola, Kengyilia kaschgarica, Kengyilia longigiumis, Kengyilia nana, Kengyilia stenachyra, Kengyilia tahelacana, and Kengyilia zhaosuensis were related to species of Pseudoroegneria and Roegneria. In addition, Kengyilia grandiglumis, Kengyilia hirsuta, Kengyilia laxiflora, and Kengyilia rigidula were related to species of Pseudoroegneria and Roegneria in phylogenetic analyses of matK and rbcL, but to species of Agropyron in phylogenetic analyses of trnH-psbA. These results indicate that there have been at least two phylogenetically divergent maternal donors within Kengyilia, i.e. Agropyron (P genome) and Roegneria (StY genome). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway leading to the synthesis of flavonoids and other important secondary metabolites in plants. A PAL gene (designated as FtPAL) was cloned and characterized from tartary buckwheat. Southern hybridization analysis suggested that FtPAL belonged to a multigene family. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis showed that during the florescence period, FtPAL was most highly expressed in the stem, expressed at a moderate level in immature seeds and expressed to a lesser extent in roots and flower margins. Only weak expression was detected in leaves and mature seeds. The expression of the recombinant FtPAL protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was about 77 kDa, and it reached maximum yield after 5 h of induction. The enzymatic activity of recombinant FtPAL protein was analyzed, and results showed that it was specific to L-Phe, with an activity up to 35.7 IU/g. Our data suggest that FtPAL expression is tissue-specific, and it is a functional gene in F. tataricum.

A total of thirty-six weaned pigs were randomly allocated into six groups with six replicates per group. Pigs were subjected to three dietary treatments (namely two groups per treatment) in the first week (0-7 d) and fed with diets containing 0, 0.5 and 1.0% L-Arg, respectively. On day 8, pigs were injected intramuscularly either with S. C500 or sterile saline. Serum samples were collected at day 8 (before injection), and at 1, 3 and 10 d post-injection, pigs were killed for evaluation of tissue gene expression following the last blood collection. Piglets fed the diets with 0.5 or 1.0% Arg supplementation had a higher concentration of serum Arg (P<0.05). S.C500-challenged piglets had higher (P<0.05) serum antibody levels during the days 9-18. Weight gain and feed intake were decreased remarkably (P<0.01) after the injection of S.C500, and 0.5 or 1.0% Arg supplementation tended to alleviate the inhibition. The S.C500 challenge significantly enhanced (P<0.05) serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon-gamma and IL-12 concentrations, but Arg supplementation attenuated (P<0.05) the increase in CRP level. The mRNA expression of TLR4, TLR5, Myd88, p65 NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha was up-regulated (P<0.05) by the S.C500 challenge in different tissues, but was down-regulated (P<0.05) by Arg supplementation. In conclusion, Arg supplementation could inhibit the excessive activation of the TLR4-Myd88 signalling pathway and thus attenuated the negative effects caused by the immune challenge of S.C500.

This frequently leads to their death and huge socioeconomic losses, especially in developing countries. This parasite can also cause zoonotic infections in humans, but has been largely neglected due to a lack of diagnostic techniques and studies. Recent developments in next-generation sequencing provide an opportunity to explore the transcriptome of T. multiceps. Methodology/Principal Findings: We obtained a total of 31,282 unigenes (mean length 920 bp) using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and a new Trinity de novo assembler without a referenced genome. Individual transcription molecules were determined by sequence-based annotations and/or domain-based annotations against public databases (Nr, UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot, COG, KEGG, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, InterPro and Pfam). We identified 26,110 (83.47%) unigenes and inferred 20,896 (66.8%) coding sequences (CDS). Further comparative transcripts analysis with other cestodes (Taenia pisiformis, Taenia solium, Echincoccus granulosus and Echincoccus multilocularis) and intestinal parasites (Trichinella spiralis, Ancylostoma caninum and Ascaris suum) showed that 5,100 common genes were shared among three Taenia tapeworms, 261 conserved genes were detected among five Taeniidae cestodes, and 109 common genes were found in four zoonotic intestinal parasites. Some of the common genes were genes required for parasite survival, involved in parasite-host interactions. In addition, we amplified two full-length CDS of unigenes from the common genes using RT-PCR. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides an extensive transcriptome of the adult stage of T. multiceps, and demonstrates that comparative transcriptomic investigations deserve to be further studied. This transcriptome dataset forms a substantial public information platform to achieve a fundamental understanding of the biology of T. multiceps, and helps in the identification of drug targets and parasite-host interaction studies.

A total of 206 E. coli isolates were collected from primates in six zoos in China in 2009 and their susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials were tested by broth microdilution. The susceptibility patterns of E. coli strains varied greatly among different zoos reflecting different backgrounds of antimicrobial usage. Both the ESBL-encoding genes and the PMQR genes were detected by PCR. Of the 206 strains, 65 (32%) were confirmed as phenotypic ESBL producers with bla(CTX-M) (27%, bla(CTX-M-15), n = 31, bla(CTX-M-3), n = 23 and bla(CTX-M-14), n = 2) mainly mediating the ESBL phenotype. qnrS1 (18%, n = 36) and oqxAB (15%, n = 31) were the predominant PMQR genes and the prevalence of PMQR genes was much higher among phenotypic ESBL producers than that among phenotypic non-ESBL producers from any zoo. Notably, the PMQR genes qnrS1 and oqxAB and beta-lactamase genes bla(TEM-1), and bla(CTX-M-3) were found together in 23 E. coli isolates in two zoos in Shanghai. PFGE analysis of these 23 isolates demonstrated nearly identical PFGE profiles (similarity matrix >97%) indicating this specific E. coli genotype was prevalent in these two zoos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these four genes coexisting in an E. coli genotype and the first report of antimicrobial resistance profiles in E. coli isolated from primates in China.

SDS-PAGE profiles revealed that tetraploid wheat has many different combinations of HMW-GSs and the number of subunits varies from 1 to 4. HMW glutenin genes at the Glu-A1x, Glu-A1y and Glu-B1y loci exhibited different frequencies of inaction while the Glu-B1x allele was expressed in all 87 accessions. Gene cloning showed that only 1Bx (Tdu-e) could express a full-length protein and its deduced protein sequence has the typical primary structure but with fewer cysteine residues. The expression of the other three HMW glutenin genes has been disrupted by stop codons in their repetitive domains. Besides short indels or mutations of one or more bases, an 85-bp deletion and a 185-bp insertion were found in the promoter regions of 1Ay (Tdu-s) and 1Bx (Tdu-e). The transient expression of promoter-GUS constructs indicated that the 1Ay promoter can drive expression of the GUS gene. We conclude that defects (stop codons or the insertion of large transposon-like elements) in the coding regions may be the most probable cause for the inaction of the HMW glutenin genes.

However, there is a lack of sequence information for paralogous genes in this locus. For this study, 59 gamma-secalin paralogous sequences in the Sec2 locus were characterized from a cultivated rye and derived lines after crossing with bread wheat. They had similar structures with conserved sequences in their repetitive regions for the signal peptide, N-terminal, C-terminal and the repeat motif. Their high homology indicated that they originated from an ancestor sequence that existed before the speciation of the genus Secale. Duplication and divergence might have led to the formation of the paralogous genes at Sec2. Besides point mutations, these paralogs showed variations in DNA length due to insertion or deletion events in their repetitive regions. They encoded secalins with deduced molecular weight ranges between 22.2 and 54.5 kDa. These insertion or deletions may be caused by illegitimate recombination and this locus seemed to contribute to increased levels of protein content. However, the incorporation of locus Sec2 may have a negative effect on flour processing quality since it reduced the SDS-sedimentation value. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To understand the host response to FV infection in maize, we examined gene expression changes in bract tissue of resistant inbred line Bt-1, as well as susceptible inbred line Ye478, at the fourth day after inoculation with FV, based on the genechip experiment. Results showed that seven expressed genes were specifically up-regulated (> 1.5-fold) in response to FV in Ye478, while 482 genes were significantly up-regulated in Bt-1, compared to their controls. Overall, the identity of the up-regulated genes indicates that the response of maize bract tissue to FV infection involves a complicated host-pathogen interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first large-scale identification of genes differentially expressed in maize ear rot after FV infection, providing new insight into the host processes potentially involved in maize defense against this pathogen.

The seed development of Amphicarpaea edgeworthii Benth. was observed using paraffin sectioning method by Nikon TE2000 light microscope. The ovule got fertilized and formed the zygote after flowering about 12 hours. The zygote was transversely divided into a terminal cell and a basal cell in two days after flowering. The proembryo continued cell division in directions forming globular embryo and then heart-shaped embryo, in which the cotyledons primordium began to occur. In 24 days after flowering, the embryo differentiated into matured embryo through Torpedo embryo (in 16 days after flowering). The endosperm cell formation began when the globular proembryo was formed,and the development of the endosperm was nuclear type. The mature seed of Amphicarpaea edgeworthii Benth is devoid of endosperm. The outer integument developed into the seed coat, and the seed coat cells were the fence cells with corneum, that may be one of the important reasons of hard seeds for Amphicarpaea edgeworthii Benth.

In the present study, the genes coding xylose reductase (XYL1) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2) from Pichia stipitis were successfully engineered into S. cerevisae. As compared to the control transformant, engineering of XYL1 and XYL2 into yeasts significantly increased the microbial biomass (8.1 vs. 3.4 g/L), xylose consumption rate (0.15 vs. 0.02 g/h) and ethanol yield (6.8 vs. 3.5 g/L) after 72 h fermentation using a xylose-based medium. Interestingly, engineering of XYL1 and XYL2 into yeasts also elevated the ethanol yield from sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (SUBH). This study not only provides an effective approach to increase the xylose utilization by yeasts, but the results also suggest that production of ethanol by this recombinant yeasts using unconventional nutrient sources, such as components in SUBH deserves further attention in the future.

A unique light-harvesting POR:Pchlide complexes (LHPP) has been found in barley etioplasts, but not in other plant species. Why PORs from barley, but not from other plants, can form LHPP? And its function is not well understood. We modeled the barley and Arabidopsis POR proteins and compared molecular surface. The results confirm the idea that barley PORA can form a five-unit oligomer that interacts with a single PORB. Chemical treatment experiments indicated that POR complex may be formed by dithiol oxidation of cysteines of two adjacent proteins. We further showed that LHPP assembly was needed for barley POR functions and seedling greening. On the contrary, Arabidopsis POR proteins only formed dimers, which were not related to the functions or the greening. Finally, POR complex assembly (including LHPP and POR dimers) did not affect the formation of prolamellar bodies (PLBs) that function for efficient capture of light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts.

Here, the classification and phylogenetic relationships of roundworms from 21 species of captive wild animals have been studied by sequencing and analysis of parts of the ribosomal 18S and 28S genes and the mitochondrial (mt) 12S gene. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by 3 methods (NJ/MP/ML) based on the data of single gene sequences and concatenated sequences. Homology analysis indicated that the 18S sequences were conserved among roundworms from all 21 species and that 28S showed interspecies variability. Divergence levels displayed in 12S suggested that 12S appears to be either intra-or interspecifically variable. Evolutionary trees indicated that the ascarids split into 2 families, 4 genera and 7 species, with high bootstrap support for each clade.

Housing system affects broiler characteristics of local Chinese breed reciprocal crosses	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						chicken; housing system; carcass trait; breeding; meat composition	MEAT QUALITY; GROWING CHICKEN; FREE-RANGE; CARCASS; STANDARD	Artificial selection in closed populations can fix or differentiate alternative alleles of loci associated with selected traits. Two closed chicken populations, A and B, originating from Jiuwu, a Chinese native breed, were bred for more than 10 generations. We compared progeny from reciprocal crosses (AB and BA) under free range (trial 1) and cage and pen (trial 2) systems. Traits measured included feed conversion, live BW, subcutaneous fat thickness, percentages of carcass, semi-eviscerated carcass, eviscerated carcass, breast muscle (pectoralis major and minor), leg muscle (boneless drum and thigh), heart, gizzard, proventriculus, liver, comb, and abdominal fat, plus moisture and fat content in breast muscle at 91 d. In trial 1, there were no significant differences between crosses for any trait except percentage proventriculus (AB > BA). Males were significantly heavier with greater proportions of semi-eviscerated carcass, leg muscle, heart, and comb than females, whereas females had thicker subcutaneous fat and higher percentage abdominal fat, breast muscle, gizzard, and proventriculus than males. In trial 2, chickens raised in cages were significantly heavier, had superior feed efficiency, thicker subcutaneous fat, higher fat content and percentage abdominal fat, carcass, semi-eviscerated carcass, liver, and comb than those reared in pens. Those reared in pens exhibited significantly greater proportions of breast muscle, gizzard, and proventriculus than those raised in cages. The only significant 2-way interaction was cross x sex for percentage semi-eviscerated and eviscerated carcass, because BA males were greater than other combinations. Interactions of cross x sex x housing system for percentage liver and abdominal fat were significant; cage-reared AB females displayed higher percentages than pen-reared BA males. Results implied that sub-populations should be considered rather than a single larger population as a way to reduce loss of genetic variation in local and heritage stocks. Although performance of reciprocal crosses was similar across housing systems, caging during the finishing stage of a slow-growing breed enhanced feed efficiency, BW, and meat composition.	[Zhao, X.

The atypical resistance (R) protein RPW8.2 activates salicylic acid (SA)-dependent, haustorium-targeted defenses against Golovinomyces spp., the causal agents of powdery mildew diseases on multiple plant species. How RPW8.2 activates defense remains uncharacterized. Here, we report that RPW8.2 interacts with the phytochrome-associated protein phosphatase type 2C (PAPP2C) in yeast and in planta as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Down-regulation of PAPP2C by RNA interference (RNAi) in Col-0 plants lacking RPW8.2 leads to leaf spontaneous cell death and enhanced disease resistance to powdery mildew via the SA-dependent signaling pathway. Moreover, down-regulation of PAPP2C by RNAi in the RPW8.2 background results in strong HR-like cell death, which correlates with elevated RPW8.2 expression. We further demonstrate that hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PAPP2C prepared from tobacco leaf cells transiently transformed with HA-PAPP2C possesses phosphatase activity. In addition, silencing a rice gene (Os04g0452000) homologous to PAPP2C also results in spontaneous cell death in rice. Combined, our results suggest that RPW8.2 is functionally connected with PAPP2C and that PAPP2C negatively regulates SA-dependent basal defense against powdery mildew in Arabidopsis.

Unfortunately, the distribution region, population size and individual numbers of P. decomposita rapidly decrease in the wild. It is a particularly rare, highly endangered, protective plant endemic to Southwest China. To understand the causes of seed dormancy of P. decomposita, the effects of aqueous extracts of the seed coat, endosperm of P. decomposita on germination, seedling growth and amylases activities of wheat seeds were examined in this paper. The results showed that the seed, especially the endosperm tissue of P. decomposita contained substances that strongly suppressed seed germination. The crude extract of endosperm of P. decomposita, which significantly reduced the activities of alpha and beta-amylase, showed a more significant inhibition than that of seed coat at the same dose. It was concluded that the presence of inhibitory substances in seed, especially in endosperm tissue, seem to be responsible for P. decomposita seed dormancy.

J	Yang, XY; Liang, DX; Deng, SH				Yang, Xinyao; Liang, Dongxu; Deng, Shihuai			Quantifying the influence of EDTA on polymer nanoparticle deposition and retention in an iron-oxide-coated sand column	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							SATURATED POROUS-MEDIA; NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER; COLLOID TRANSPORT; HUMIC-ACID; MICROSPHERE DEPOSITION; CHARGE HETEROGENEITY; PARTICLE DEPOSITION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; NANOMATERIALS; WATER	Ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid (EDTA) occurring in groundwater aquifers complicates the prediction of nanoparticle movement in the porous medium. This paper demonstrates an approach combining Triple Pulse Experiments (TPEs) and numerical modelling to quantify the influence of EDTA on the deposition and retention of polymer nanoparticles in a water-saturated column packed with iron-oxide-coated sand. TPEs injecting three successive pulses in the order of nanoparticle, EDTA, nanoparticle permit nanoparticle deposition in the absence and the presence of EDTA to be compared. Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) modelling of the nanoparticle breakthrough curves combining mass balance calculation allows the influence of EDTA to be quantified. TPE results demonstrate that the injected EDTA eluted the oxide coatings (favorable deposition sites) from the sand surface and the resulting decline in sites led to enhanced nanoparticle mobility in the subsequent pulse. Quantification results suggest that at the experimental time-scale and under the controlled conditions, elution of one deposition site requires injection of 2.4 x 10(11) EDTA molecules. In total, 75 gram EDTA needs to be injected to remove all the column sites.

Shannon diversity (H), richness (S) and evenness (E (H)) indices were used to analyze the DGGE results. The results showed that the nifH gene diversity for rhizosphere soil was lower than that of the non-rhizosphere at three sampling sites. The increase in H of non-rhizosphere soil was due mainly to the increase in pH and the decrease in available N. Richness was correlated closely with H. There was a great difference of evenness between the rhizosphere and the non-rhizosphere samples. A range of sequence divergence was observed in the eight sequenced nifH clones. The sequences were divided into three clusters in the phylogenetic tree. The majority of the clones were similar to the nifH genes of Betaproteobacteria, Zoogloea oryzae, Dechloromonas sp. and Azovibrio restrictus. There was a difference regarding dominant species between the rhizosphere and the non-rhizosphere samples.

It has an open reading frame of 807 bp, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 268 amino acids. Sequence similarity analysis clearly suggested that MsERF11 encoded an ethylene response factor protein. The results of transient expression of MsERF11 in onion epidermal cells indicated that MsERF11 is a nuclear protein. The expression pattern of MsERF11 gene was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and a higher level of expression was observed in leaves than was observed in roots, stems, flower buds and flowers. Furthermore, the expression was induced by PEG6000, NaCl, Al-2(SO4)(3) and six different hormones. Over-expressing MsERF11 resulted in enhanced tolerances to salt stress in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. This research indicates that MsERF11 has the potential to be used for improving crop's salt tolerance in areas where salinity is a limiting factor for agricultural productivity. Key message MsERF11 was isolated from alfalfa. Its expression was induced by different abiotic stresses and hormones.

Following the weaning at 22( +/- 1) d of age, the pigs were allocated randomly to 4 treatments, with 5 replicates per treatment and 16 pigs per replicate, receiving 4 experimental diets for initial 10 d and then all pigs were offered the common diet for further 22 d. The experimental diets were formulated to contain the same amounts of DE, CP. Lys and Met on an iso-nitrogenous basis derived from different protein supplements, including 4.00% spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) (control), 4.88% soy protein concentrate (SPC), 9.18% whey protein concentrate (WPC) and 6.50% spray-dried whole egg (SDE), respectively. From day 1 to 10 after weaning, pigs fed SDPP had a significantly higher ADG and consequently a lower feed:gain ratio than those offered SPC or SDE diet. However, all dietary treatments did not affect feed intake and ADG during the period from day 11 to 32 or from day 1 to 32 after weaning. There were no significant treatment effects on villous height to crypt depth ratio (VCR) in ileum measured on day 10 after weaning, whereas this variable in duodenum and jejunum was significantly lower with pigs offered SPC diet than those given SDPP diet. Furthermore, in comparison with pigs offered SDPP diet, pigs fed SPC diet had significantly lower levels of classical swine fever virus (CSFV)-specific antibody titer and unspecific immune molecules (IgG, IgA, C-3), and significantly higher levels of IL-10 and cortisol. Although WPC and SDE diets also affected these variables when compared with SDPP diet, the magnitudes of their effects were much smaller than those derived from SPC diet. Our results suggest that WPC and SDE can be used to replace SDPP as protein supplements for weanling pigs with little adverse effects on feed intake, ADG or development of the immune system. The SPC supplement can influence growth rates and immune response of weanling pigs during initial adaptation period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirty crossbred piglets weaned at 21 days of age were allotted to 1 of 3 diets supplemented with 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0% L-arginine (10 pigs/treatment). Pigs consumed the diets for 7 d. On d 7, 6 pigs from each treatment were randomly killed, and the tissue and blood samples were collected. Compared with control pigs, dietary L-arginine supplementation did not affect the growth performance and serum concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgM, IL-l beta, IL-2 and INF-alpha (P> 0.05), but dietary supplementation with 0.5% L-arginine reduced serum urea concentration (P< 0.05). Additionally, dietary L-arginine supplementation significantly increased porcine beta-defensin-1 gene expression of tongue, porcine beta-defensin-3 gene expression of ileum and inguinal lymph node, and porcine beta-defensin-2 gene expression of oral epithelium, tongue, ileum and inguinal lymph node (P <0.05).

Low protein diet up-regulate intramuscular lipogenic gene expression and down-regulate lipolytic gene expression in growth-finishing pigs	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Dietary protein content; IMF; Gene expression; Lipid metabolism; Pigs	PORCINE ADIPOSE-TISSUE; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; LONGISSIMUS-MUSCLE; LIPID-METABOLISM; INSULIN SENSITIVITY; BINDING PROTEINS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; EATING QUALITY; MEAT QUALITY; DEPOSITION	The objective of this investigation was to study the regulatory mechanism underlying the increased intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation in animal muscle tissue while fed a low protein diet. We investigated the mRNA and protein expression changes of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including uptake and transport (heart fatty-acid binding protein, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1), lipogenesis (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and lipolysis (hormone-sensitive lipase), adipocyte differentiation regulation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), and fatty acid desaturation (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) in pigs either a high protein (HP: 18%) or a low protein (LP: 14%) diet. Thirty Wujin pigs per group were slaughtered at 30, 60, or 100 kg at 96.5 +/- 1.5, 155 +/- 5, or 234 +/- 12 day of age. The growth performance, carcass traits, intramuscular adipocyte diameter, IMF content, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and mRNA and protein expression levels were investigated in the longissimus muscle. Intramuscular adipocyte diameters increased with body weight. The LP diet showed increased slaughter age, fat: meat weight ration, intramuscular adipocyte diameter, IMF content, PUFA and MUFA as compared to the HP diet pigs in the 60 and 100 kg body weight groups. Gene expressions differed between the two diet groups and between the weight groups within a diet. The data indicated that the underlying regulatory mechanism of LP diet increased IMF accumulation related mainly to increased intramuscular lipogenic gene expression and decreased lipolytic gene expression during the growth-finishing stages. As a result, the lipogenic and lipolytic capacities changes with increasing body weight. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wang, J.; Chen, D.

In this study, female Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) at weeks 1 to 8 post-hatching were selected for experimentation. We measured the mRNA levels of 6 DNL-related genes in the duck liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue and abdominal adipose tissue by real-time PCR during the 8 weeks. Correlations of the plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) concentrations with fat deposition at these sites were also detected during growth. Our results showed that fat content was highest in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and lowest in the liver during the growth period we studied. Additionally, plasma VLDL and TG were significantly associated with lipid content in adipose tissue (P<0.05), but not in the liver. Lastly, in the growing birds, the expression levels of lipogenic genes (with the exceptions SREBP-1 c and SCD1) were much higher in the liver than in the adipose tissues, and the maximal expression levels of these genes occurred at week 4 or 5 at these sites. These findings indicated that the main site of DNL is always the liver in post-hatching ducks, and adipose tissues are of little importance for DNL Taken together, our results suggested that the plasma lipoproteins contribute greatly to fat deposition in adipose tissues originating from hepatic lipogenesis.

Prematurity does not markedly affect intestinal sensitivity to endotoxins and feeding in pigs	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						Intestinal absorption; Bacterial stimulation; Cytokines; Colostrum; Birth	NEONATAL NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-4; PRETERM PIGS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; RAT MODEL; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; COLONIZATION; INFLAMMATION; PATHOGENESIS; ABSORPTION	Preterm neonates show enhanced sensitivity to nutrient maldigestion and bacteria-mediated gut inflammatory disorders, such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). We hypothesised that preterm birth increases the sensitivity of intestinal nutrient absorption to endotoxins and that feeding after birth reduces this response. Hence, we investigated the postnatal development of nutrient digestive and absorptive capacity in the preterm and term pig intestine, and its responsiveness to endotoxins. Pigs were delivered by caesarean section at preterm (n 20) or term (n 17) gestation, and the small intestine was collected at birth or after 2 d of colostrum feeding, followed by ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide endotoxins and mixed gut contents collected from pigs with NEC. Brush border enzyme activities were reduced in newborn preterm v. term pigs (39-45% reduction, P < 0.05), but normalised after 2 d of feeding. Ex vivo leucine and glucose uptake increased with prenatal age. Bacterial stimulation reduced the nutrient uptake similarly at birth and after 2 d in preterm and term pigs (23-41% reduction, P < 0.05), whereas IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression was stimulated only at birth. Toll-like receptor-4 expression increased markedly at day 2 for preterm and term pigs (22-33-fold, P < 0.05) but with much lower expression levels in newborn preterm pigs (approximately 95 %, P < 0.01). In conclusion, digestive and absorptive functions mature in the prenatal period, but are similarly affected by postnatal feeding and bacterial exposure in both preterm and term pigs. Nutrient maldigestion may contribute to NEC development, while a prematurity-related hyper-responsiveness to endotoxins could be less important, at least in pigs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in various body fluids and are selectively packaged inside the exosomes, a type of membrane vesicles, secreted by most cell types. These exosomal miRNAs could be actively delivered into recipient cells, and could regulate target gene expression and recipient cell function. Here, we analyzed the lactation-related miRNA expression profiles in porcine milk exosomes across the entire lactation period (newborn to 28 days after birth) by a deep sequencing. We found that immune-related miRNAs are present and enriched in breast milk exosomes (p<10(-16), chi(2) test) and are generally resistant to relatively harsh conditions. Notably, these exosomal miRNAs are present in higher numbers in the colostrums than in mature milk. It was higher in the serum of colostrum-only fed piglets compared with the mature milk-only fed piglets. These immune-related miRNA-loaded exosomes in breast milk may be transferred into the infant body via the digestive tract. These observations are a prelude to in-depth investigations of the essential roles of breast milk in the development of the infant's immune system.

There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified. Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading. Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression. In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions. Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor GRAIN NUMBER, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.

Here we report the molecular characterization and evaluation of a recombinant S. scabiei tropomyosin (SsTm) protein in a vaccination trial in rabbits. Methods: The full-length cDNA was cloned in a bacterial pET vector, and the recombinant protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified. Using specific rabbit antiserum, tropomyosin was localized immunohistochemically in mite tissue sections. Vaccination trials with the recombiant SsTm was carried out in New Zealand rabbits. Results: The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of the 852 bp cloned gene from S. scabiei encodes a 32.9 kDa protein. The amino acid sequence showed 98.94%, 97.89% and 98.59% homology to Dermatophagoides farina and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus group 10 allergens and Psoroptes ovis tropomyosin, respectively. Tropomyosin was localized immunohistochemically in mite tissue sections mainly in the mouthparts, legs and integument of the epidermis. The predicted cross-reactivity of SsTm indicated that it is an allergenic protein. While vaccination with the recombiant SsTm resulted in high levels of specific IgG (P < 0.01), a low IgE antibody response and no significant protection against S. scabiei challenge were observed. After challenge, specific IgG levels remained significantly higher than the control (P < 0.01), while changes of total IgE levels were not significant (P > 0.05). However, the lesion areas in the vaccination group decreased at the end of the experiment compared with controls. Conclusions: Although vaccination with recombinant SsTm did not efficiently control sarcoptic mange in rabbits, the immunogenic properties of tropomyosin suggest it may be developed as a vaccine with alternative adjuvants or delivery methods.

The y-scrambling method was used to test if there is a chance correlation in the developed SVM model. In the meantime, five-fold cross validation of these machine learning methods results in the prediction accuracies of 87.2-92.5% for hPXR activators and 73.8-87.8% for hPXR non-activators, and the prediction accuracies for external test set are 93.8-95.8% for hPXR activators and 86.7-92.8% for hPXR non-activators. Our study suggested that the tested machine learning methods are potentially useful for hPXR activators identification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet little is known about the relationships between the amounts of resources stored in the roots and resprouting ability when the total aboveground part of plants/trees was fully removed or destroyed, and about the resprouting ability in relation to increasing elevation associated with decreasing site productivity. The present study investigated the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations and its pool size in roots of Quercus aquifolioides clumps grown at 3000 m, 3500 m, and 3950 m a.s.l. on Zheduo Mt., southwestern China, to test two competing hypotheses that (1) decreases in net primary productivity and growing season length with increasing elevation result in less allocation to storage of belowground NSC reserves, so that after coppicing, shrubs at higher elevations produce fewer resprouts and less total biomass than those at lower elevations, vs. (2) the shrubs growing at high-elevation sites with low-productivity produce more resprouts and biomass than those at low-elevation sites after coppicing, as it is expected that resprouting is favored in low-productivity environments. Our results indicated that early resprouting of Q aquifolioides shrubs after coppicing is largely determined by the initial carbohydrate pool but not by the carbohydrate concentrations in roots. The large resprouting vigor of this species may be mainly ascribed to its large ratios of root to shoot biomass or root NSC pool to shoot NSC pool. The resprouting vigor of clumps decreased significantly with increasing elevation, which corresponds to significant decreases in the root biomass or root NSC pool size per clump with increasing elevation. Resprouts self-thinned more early and rapidly in clumps at lower elevations than at higher elevations, which may be mainly resulted from competition occurred more early in the more productive sites at lower elevations compared to higher elevations. Our results support the 1st but not the 2nd hypothesis.

Optimal degree of substitution (DS) of 0.32 was obtained at 45 degrees C in 25 min using aqueous ethanol media with water/solvent of 0.15 at 200 W. The molar ratio of sodium hydroxide and monochloroacetic acid to anhydroglucose unit for optimal DS were 2.5 and 1.0, respectively. FT-IR spectrometry revealed the carboxymethyl starch to show new bands at nu = 1614 cm(-1) and = 1429 cm(-1). Wide angle X-ray diffractometry and DSC revealed a remarkable reduction in starch crystallinity after carboxymethylation, which was consistent with destroyed surface observed in SEM. The digestibility of carboxymethyl starch (CMS) was lower than that of native starch. With similar DS, there was no difference in digestibility of carboxymethyl starch prepared with and without microwave. As DS increased from 0.05 to 0.32, the amount of resistant starch in microwave-assisted carboxymethyl starch was elevated from 14.6% to 20.0%, which was much higher than that of native starch (10.8%).

SynDH1 is a tetraploidization-hexaploid doubled haploid (DH) population because it contains recombinant A and B chromosomes from two different T. turgidum genotypes, while all the D chromosomes from Ae. tauschii are homogenous across the whole population. This paper reports the construction of a genetic map using this population. Results: Of the 606 markers used to assemble the genetic map, 588 (97%) were assigned to linkage groups. These included 513 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers, 72 simple sequence repeat (SSR), one insertion site-based polymorphism (ISBP), and two high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) markers. These markers were assigned to the 14 chromosomes, covering 2048.79 cM, with a mean distance of 3.48 cM between adjacent markers. This map showed good coverage of the A and B genome chromosomes, apart from 3A, 5A, 6A, and 4B. Compared with previously reported maps, most shared markers showed highly consistent orders. This map was successfully used to identify five quantitative trait loci (QTL), including two for spikelet number on chromosomes 7A and 5B, two for spike length on 7A and 3B, and one for 1000-grain weight on 4B. However, differences in crossability QTL between the two T. turgidum parents may explain the segregation distortion regions on chromosomes 1A, 3B, and 6B. Conclusions: A genetic map of T. turgidum including 588 markers was constructed using a synthetic doubled haploid (SynDH) hexaploid wheat population. Five QTLs for three agronomic traits were identified from this population. However, more markers are needed to increase the density and resolution of this map in the future study.

Eight LAB isolates were obtained from feces samples and were identified as Lactobacillus acidipiscis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus durans and Leuconostoc fallax using morphology, physiology, biochemical and 16s rDNA PCR methods. Five strains were selected after safety and function tests which showed no hemolytic activity, no harmful indole and hydrogen sulphide produced, safety to KM mouse, growth inhibition to Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Salmonella pullorum (CVCC527) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC29213), and no acquired resistance genes detected. The growth of five strains could not be inhibited by 0.9% pig bile. Two Lactobacillus strains could survive at as low as pH 2.0. One L. acidipiscis strain and one E. durans strain could survive at as high as 70 degrees C. Five strai ns identified as L. acidipiscis, L. plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and L. fallax could be well suitable for developing an orally delivered probiotic. To our knowledge, this is the first time to isolate and identify LAB from forest musk deer feces and the characterized strains have good potential for developing an orally delivered probiotic to improve health condition of forest musk deer.

We identified a late-flowering long vegetative phase1 (lvp1) mutant in rice and used map-based cloning to reveal that lvp1 affects the SET domain group protein 724 (SDG724). SDG724 functions as a histone methyltransferase in vitro and contributes to a major fraction of global histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation in vivo. Expression analyses of flowering time genes in wild-type and lvp1 mutants revealed that Early heading date1, but not Heading date1, are misregulated in lvp1 mutants. In addition, the double mutant of lvp1 with photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5) flowered later than the se5 single mutant, indicating that lvp1 delays flowering time irrespective of photoperiod. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that lvp1 had reduced levels of H3K36me2/3 at MADS50 and RFT1. This suggests that the divergent functions of paralogs RFT1 and Hd3a, and of MADS50 and MADS51, are in part due to differential H3K36me2/3 deposition, which also correlates with higher expression levels of MADS50 and RFT1 in flowering promotion in rice.

LINDL.]	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							GENOTYPES; PAKISTAN	In this study the pistil structure of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl) was investigated for the first time through free-hand section and observation on seed set under manually controlled pollination. The results showed that 5 styles with stigmas, free at base, inserted on the upper surface of the ovary. The ovary consisted of 5 fused carpels; the septums, originating from the carpellary margins, divided the ovary into 5 locules, with each locule containing a placenta to which the 2 ovules attached: the locules were lined by a thick cuticle. In the hand-pollination to the only one stigma left (4 styles were removed), seeds were produced only in one locule (fertile locule). while in other 4 locules all the 8 ovules were unfertilized and wilt. 76.67% fertile locules produced two normal seeds and 23.33% fertile locules produced only one normal seed and the other degenerated. Therefore, it can be concluded that 5 styles and 5 locules had a one-to-one relationship in both morphological and reproductive characteristics in loquat.

Concerted evolution leads to intragenomic uniformity of repeats even between loci on nonhomologous chromosomes. However, a number of studies have shown that the ITS polymorphism within individuals is quite common. The molecular systematics of Bambusinae and related species were recently assessed by different teams using independently generated ITS sequences, and the results disagreed in some remarkable features. Here we compared the ITS sequences of the members of Bambusa s. l., the genera Dendrocalamus, Dinochloa, Gigantochloa, Guadua, Melocalamus, Monocladus, Oxytenanthera, Thyrsostachys, Pleioblastus, Pseudosasa and Schizostachyum. We have reanalysed the ITS sequences used by different research teams to reveal the underlying patterns of their different results. After excluding the sequences suspected to represent paralogous loci, a phylogenetic analysis of the subtribe Bambusinae species were performed using maximum parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods. The implications of the findings are discussed. The risk of incorporating ITS paralogues in plant evolutionary studies that can distort the phylogenetic signal should caution molecular systematists.

E-mail: abtcxzw@126.com This paper reports on the development and validation of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) for the rapid and specific detection of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleuropneumoniae). A set of six primers were designed derived from the dsbE-like gene of A. pleuropneumoniae and validate the assay using 9 A. pleuropneumoniae reference/field strains, 132 clinical isolates and 9 other pathogens. The results indicated that positive reactions were confirmed for all A. pleuropneumoniae strains and specimens by LAMP at 63 C for 60 min and no cross-reactivity were observed from other non-A. pleuropneumoniae including Haemophilus parasuis, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and Pseudorabies virus. The detection limit of the conventional PCR was 102 CFU per PCR test tube, while that of the LAMP was 5 copies per tube. Therefore, the sensitivity of LAMP was higher than that of PCR. Moreover, the LAMP assay provided a rapid yet simple test of A. pleuropneumoniae suitable for laboratory diagnosis and pen-side detection due to ease of operation and the requirement of only a regular water bath or heat block for the reaction.

The primers were used to amplify the TLR5 gene from Tibetan macaque, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The compiled sequences were analyzed by bioinformatics. The DNA sequencing and additional combined results showed that the Tibetan macaque TLR5 gene is about 2825 bp and contains an open reading frame of 2577 bp encoding for 858 amino acids. Homology analysis of TLR5 in both species showed that the amino acid and nucleotide identity is about 99.7% and 99.8% and their transmembrane and intracellular domains appeared more conservative than the extracellular domains of proteins. However, re-examining the entire Tibetan macaque TLR5 coding sequence we found that a purifying selection was also acting on the TLR5 gene region encoding for its intracellular domain of the protein. Even though the selection tests indicated that the TLR5 gene experienced a strong purifying selection in the process of evolution, most likely because its potential role in the primate adaptive immune defense, the Tibetan macaque still has the highest relationship with the rhesus macaque.

In the present study, three haplotypes, i.e. haplotype I without deletion, haplotype II with a 24 bp deletion, and haplotype III with two deletions of 24 and 15 bp, were identified in the upstream of the coding region in 80 Ae. tauschii accessions. The haplotype distribution was related to subspecies taxon. All typical ssp. tauschii accessions had haplotype I, whereas all ssp. strangulata had haplotype III. The three haplotypes were observed in Ae. tauschii with morphologically intermediate forms between the two typical subspecies. Present results supported that ssp. strangulata or intermediate form was the D-genome donor of common wheat since only haplotype III were found in wheat. Moreover, a 16 bp deletion in exon 8 of gene Ppd-D1 exists in common wheat. However, none of Ae. tauschii accessions analyzed had the 16 bp deletion.

ZH-1, derived from the progeny of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. MY15 x Chinese Weining rye (Secale cereale L.). ZH-1, exhibiting shorter plant height and higher tillering ability compared to MY15, is immune to both powdery mildew and stripe rust and has stable fertility. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and C-banding revealed that the chromosome composition of triticale ZH-1 was 14 A-genome (1A-7A), 12 B-genome (1B-2B, 4B-7B), 12 R-genome (1R, 3R-7R), chromosomes 6D and T2DS.2DL-?R. Moreover, the PCR results of PLUG and EST-SSR markers also strongly supported the above stated chromosome composition of triticale ZH-1. In addition, the physical mapping of chromosome T2DS.2DL-?R showed a minute chromosomal fragment derived from rye was attached at the distal end of 2DL. The new triticale ZH-1 could be a valuable source for wheat improvement, especially for resistance to disease.

The definition of gene loss and acquisition is essential for understanding Brucella's ecology, evolutionary history, and host relationships. A DNA microarray containing unique genes of B. melitensis Type strain 16MT and B. abortus 9-941 was constructed and used to determine the gene contents of the representative strains of Brucella. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from sequences of housekeeping genes. Gene loss and acquisition of different Brucella species were inferred. A total of 214 genes were found to be differentially distributed, and 173 of them were clustered into 15 genomic islands (GIs). Evidence of horizontal gene transfer was observed for 10 GIs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 19 strains formed five clades, and some of the GIs had been lost or acquired independently among the different lineages. The derivation of Brucella lineages is concomitant with the parallel loss or acquisition of GIs, indicating a complex interaction between various Brucella species and hosts.

In this study, we determined the effect of dietary Se on mRNA levels of the remaining porcine selenoprotein genes along with protein production of 4 selenoproteins (Gpx1, Sepp1, Selh, and Sels) and body glucose homeostasis. Weanling male pigs (n = 24) were fed a Se-deficient (<0.02 mg Se/kg), basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.3, or 3.0 mg Se/kg as Se-enriched yeast (Angel Yeast) for 16 wk. Although mRNA abundance of the 13 selenoproteins in 10 tissues responded to dietary Se in 3 patterns, there was no common regulation for any given gene across all tissues or for any given tissue across all genes. Dietary Se affected (P < 0.05) 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, and 8 selenoprotein genes in muscle, hypothalamus, liver, kidney, heart, spleen, thyroid, and pituitary, respectively. Protein abundance of Gpx1, Sepp1, Selh, and Sels in 6 tissues was regulated (P < 0.05) by dietary Se concentrations in 3 ways. Compared with those fed 0.3 mg Se/kg, pigs fed 3.0 mg Se/kg became hyperinsulinemic (P < 0.05) and had lower (P < 0.05) tissue levels of serine/threonine protein kinase. In conclusion, dietary Se exerted no global regulation of gene transcripts or protein levels of individual selenoproteins across porcine tissues. Pigs may be a good model for studying mechanisms related to the potential prodiabetic risk of high-Se intake in humans. J. Nutr. 142: 1410-1416, 2012.

Association mapping for pre-harvest sprouting resistance in white winter wheat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; CONTROLLING SEED DORMANCY; BREAD WHEAT; MAJOR QTL; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; COMPLEX TRAITS; GRAIN DORMANCY; CHROMOSOME 4A	Association mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and the markers linked to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) resistance in an elite association mapping panel of white winter wheat comprising 198 genotypes. A total of 1,166 marker loci including DArT and SSR markers representing all 21 chromosomes of wheat were used in the analysis. General and mixed linear models were used to analyze PHS data collected over 4 years. Association analysis identified eight QTLs linked with 13 markers mapped on seven chromosomes. A QTL was detected on each arm of chromosome 2B and one each on chromosome arms 1BS, 2DS, 4AL, 6DL, 7BS and 7DS. All except the QTL on 7BS are located in a location similar to previous reports and, if verified, the QTL on 7BS is likely to be novel. Principal components and the kinship matrix were used to account for the presence of population structure but had only a minor effect on the results. Although, none of the QTLs was highly significant across all environments, a QTL on the long arm of chromosome 4A was detected in three different environments and also using the best linear unbiased predictions over years. Although previous reports have identified this as a major QTL, its effects were minor in our biparental mapping populations. The results of this study highlight the benefits of association mapping and the value of using elite material in association mapping for plant breeding programs.

This paper reports the major physico-chemical properties and enzyme activities of the soils of Lhasa's main arable lands and the factors that influence these soil properties. Composite and core samples were taken from the three main arable soil types (alluvial soil, subalpine arable steppe soil, and subalpine arable meadow soil) and were analysed using standard methods. The bulk density and the ventilation porosity ratio of the soils were close to the recommended values for arable lands, and the dominant soil texture was sandy. The soil moisture release rates were arable steppe soil > alluvial soil > arable meadow soil. Soil organic matter content, Cation-Exchange Capacity (CEC), total and available nitrogen content, and catalase activity of the arable meadow soil were higher than those of the alluvial and the arable steppe soils, while soil pH in the arable meadow was lower. Most of the measured properties did not show a significant variance among these three soils. However, the measured indices (apart from the total potassium) indicate that there are notable differences among the three types of soil. The results implied that the utilisation patterns of the arable soil or human activities, such as tillage practices and fertiliser applications, have a substantial effect on the soil properties in this region. Our results suggest that the cultivation practices in the region have apparently positive impact on the soil organic matter, nutrient contents and bulk density probably due to the sound fertiliser management such as the applications of farmyard manure and chemical fertilisers. However, intense cultivation practices lowered the activity of most soil enzymes. The results demonstrate that the choice of soil management strategy had a significant impact on the soil physicochemical and biological properties in the region studied.

We have previously reported a new major gene, Mi3, regulating grain length in rice, and that the Mi3 allele from Y34 functioned in a dominant manner. In this paper we report the fine mapping and candidate analysis of Mi3. By employing a chromosome walking strategy in the F-2 population of 9311/Y34, the Mi3 gene was finally narrowed to an interval of similar to 41.6 kb between the markers RM6881 and LM9 in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 3. According to the rice genome annotations, five putative gene loci, LOC_Os03g_29614, LOC_Os03g_29630, LOC_Os03g_29650, LOC_Os03g_29660 and LOC_Os03g_29680, were located in this candidate region. Mi3 was also determined to be a new gene for grain size in rice by allelic analysis with the previously reported genes. Our results will facilitate the cloning and functional characterization of the Mi3 gene and targeted marker-assisted breeding.

Ten (L. catta) from the Chengdu Zoological Garden in China, which were naturally infected with H. nana, were treated with mebendazole (10 mg/kg for 5 days). A posttreatment fecal examination was conducted 10 and 20 days after the start of treatment. All treatments resulted in a decrease in the number of eggs per gram in the posttreatment sample compared with the pretreatment sample. Reduction of mean egg count was 97.6% and 100% on days 10 and 20, respectively. The results indicated that mebendazole has marked efficacy against H. nana infections in L. catta.

Effects of zearalenone on calcium homeostasis of splenic lymphocytes of chickens in vitro	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						zearalenone; calcium homeostasis; ATPase; calmodulin; mycotoxin	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; REAL-TIME PCR; HEP G2 CELLS; INTRACELLULAR PH; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; CA2+ CHANNELS; GUINEA-PIG; CALMODULIN; CYTOTOXICITY	Zearalenone (ZEA) is an estrogenic mycotoxin. It is produced by several Fusarium species and can contaminate food and feed. To investigate the role of calcium homeostasis in ZEA-induced toxicity of poultry and elucidate its cytotoxic mechanism, splenic lymphocytes isolated from chickens were exposed to ZEA (0-25 mu g/mL) for 48 h. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), pH, calmodulin (CaM) mRNA levels, and Na+/K+-ATPase activities and Ca(2+-)ATPase activities were detected by the fluorescent dyes Fluo-3/AM and BCECF/AM, quantitative real-time PCR, and chromatometry. Supernatant CaM concentrations were simultaneously detected by ELISA. As the ZEA exposure concentration increased, the [Ca2+] i and CaM mRNA levels gradually increased, while intracellular pH, CaM concentrations of supernatants, and intracellular Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase activities gradually decreased in a dose-dependent manner. There were significant differences (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) between the treatment groups and the control group. These results indicate that ZEA cytotoxicity arises by causing an imbalance in calcium homeostasis and intracellular acidification in lymphocytes.	[Wang, Y. C.; Deng, J.

Expression of Toll-like receptors and effects of lipopolysaccharide on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine in the testis and epididymis of roosters	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						proinflammatory cytokines; testis; epididymis; rooster; lipopolysaccharide	SALMONELLA-ENTERITIDIS INFECTION; PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE; GENE-EXPRESSION; FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION; CHICKEN HETEROPHILS; FOLLICULAR-GROWTH; OVARIAN-FOLLICLES; SEXUAL-MATURATION; BRONCHITIS VIRUS; LAYING HENS	The aim of this study was to determine the expression profiles of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the testis and epididymis of rooster and whether the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, CXCLi2, and TLR-4 was affected by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR-4 ligand. Roosters were intravenously injected with LPS or phosphate-buffered saline. Testes and epididymis were collected before and after 3 or 6 h postinjection. Total RNA was isolated from those tissues and expression of TLR and proinflammatory cytokines was analyzed by reverse-transcription PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed that 7 of the known 10 chicken TLR in the testis and 9 of 10 in the epididymis were expressed. Expression of TLR-4 was found in both tissues. Expression of TLR-4 was significantly upregulated by LPS in the testis but not in the epididymis. Injection with LPS upregulated the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and CXCLi2 in the testis and epididymis by 3 to 6 h postinjection. However, injection with phosphate-buffered saline (control) did not affect their expression. These results suggest that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine expression was upregulated by LPS probably through TLR-4 activation, and thus the reproductive tissues are comprehensively equipped to deal with a pathogenic insult.

A total of 391 bacterial isolates with florfenicol MICs epsilon 16 mg/L were obtained from nasal swabs of 557 individual pigs; of these, 75 Gram-positive isolates other than staphylococci and enterococci were screened by PCR for the presence of known florfenicol resistance genes. Species assignments of the cfr-carrying isolates were based on the results of biochemical profiling and 16S rDNA sequencing. The locations of the cfr gene were determined by Southern blotting. Regions flanking each cfr gene were sequenced by a modified random primer walking strategy, and the transferability of cfr was assessed by electrotransformation. Two M. caseolyticus isolates and one J. pinnipedialis isolate were cfr positive. The cfr gene was located either on a 7057 bp plasmid, pSS-03, which was widely distributed among staphylococci of pig origin, or on the approximate to 53 kb plasmid pJP1. The region of pJP1 that included the cfr gene and the adjacent IS21-558, showed 99.7 identity to the corresponding region of plasmid pSCFS3. In addition, the genes aadDaacA-aphD, ble and erm(C), coding for aminoglycoside, bleomycin and macrolidelincosamidestreptogramin B resistance, respectively, were also identified on plasmid pJP1. This study showed that plasmids carrying the multidrug resistance gene cfr are present in two new genera of commensal and environmental bacteria, Macrococcus and Jeotgalicoccus. This observation underlines the role of commensal and environmental flora in the dissemination of clinically important resistance genes, such as cfr.

The See2 beta gene functions in remobilizing leaf nitrogen and exporting it to developing grain during foliar senescence. We analyzed See2 beta sequences from 49 inbred lines representing four key lines and their derivatives: Huangzaosi, Mo17, Dan340, and Ye478. We found that the See2 beta gene had one insertion and two deletions in most Huangzaosi lines and three insertions in the Mo17 group; that the Huangzaosi, Dan340, and Ye478 lines, but not the Mo17 line, had unique indels; and that the See2 beta gene in lines derived from the same key inbred line had higher sequence homology, according to phenetic analysis of the inbred lines derived from Huangzaosi and Mo17. Thus, a candidate inbred line could be preliminarily identified using markers closely linked to the See2 beta gene combined with sequence alignment of See2 beta.

Variable responses of P (N) to SAR occurred depending on the type of plant. A majority (13 species) of the dosage-response relationship could be described by an S-shaped curve and be fitted with the Boltzmann model. Model fitting allowed quantitative evaluation of the dosage-response relationship and an accurate estimation of the EC10, termed as the pH of the acid rain resulting in a P (N) 10 % lower than the reference value. The top 9 species (Camellia sasanqua, Cinnamomum camphora, etc. EC10 a parts per thousand currency sign 3.0) are highly endurable to very acid rain. The rare, relict plant Metasequoia glyptostroboides was the most sensitive species (EC10 = 5.1) recommended for protection.

S. agalactiae infections are becoming an increasing problem in aquaculture and have been reported worldwide in a variety of fish species, especially those living in warm water. Recently, a very serious infectious disease of unknown aetiology broke out in ya-fish (Schizothorax prenanti) farms in Sichuan Province. A Gram-positive, chain-forming coccus was isolated from moribund cultured ya-fish. The goals of this study were to identify the bacterial strains isolated from diseased fish between 2009 and 2011 in Sichuan Province, China, to evaluate the pathogenicity of the pathogen in ya-fish, crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus); and to determine the susceptibility of the pathogen strains to many currently available anti-microbial agents. The virulence tests were conducted by intraperitoneal injection of bacterial suspensions. In this study, four strains of a Gram-positive, chain-forming coccus were isolated from moribund cultured ya-fish (S. prenanti). The coccoid microorganism was identified as S. agalactiae using a commercial streptococcal grouping kit and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis. Susceptibility of the isolates to 22 antibiotics was tested using the disc diffusion method. All isolates showed a similar antibiotic susceptibility, which were sensitive to amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, vancomycin, azithromycin, florfenicol, cefalexin, cefradine and deoxycycline and resistant to gentamicin, sinomin (SMZ/TMP), penicillin, tenemycin, fradiomycin and streptomycin. Furthermore, the virulence tests were conducted by intraperitoneal injection of the isolated strain GY101 in ya-fish, crucian carp and the Nile tilapia. This coccus was lethal to ya-fish, Nile tilapia and crucian carp. The mortality rates of infected ya-fish were 100%, 100%, 60% and 20% at doses of 1.0 x 107, 1.0 x 106, 1.0 x 105 and 1.0 x 104 CFU/fish, respectively. The values were 100%, 80%, 60% and 30% for Nile tilapia and 100%, 60%, 10% and 0% for crucian carp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. agalactiae as a pathogen of ya-fish.

One hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were randomly divided into two groups of 60 each and were fed on a low Se diet (0.0342 mg/kg Se) or a control diet (0.2 mg/kg Se), respectively. The weight and relative weight of the spleen were significantly decreased in the low Se group when compared with those of the control group. Histopathologically, splenic lesions in low-Se chicken were characterized by lymphocyte depletion and congestion of red pulp. As measured by flow cytometry, splenocytes in G(0)/G(1) phase were significantly increased, while splenocytes in S phase and G(2) + M phase were obviously decreased in the low Se group. The percentage of apoptotic splenocytes was greatly increased in the low Se group when compared with that of control group. At the same time, the occurrence frequencies of apoptotic splenocytes was markedly increased in the low Se group with the appearance of condensed nucleus ultrastructurally. Oxidative stress in the spleens of the low Se group was evidenced by decrease in glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities and increase in malondialdehyde contents. The results showed that low Se diet intake caused increased apoptosis, arrested cell cycle, and obvious oxidative stress, which provided a possible pathway for the injured structure and immune function of the spleen in chickens.

Compared with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) shows less severe FCR stem-base browning symptoms (indicative of greater resistance or tolerance) but suffers higher yield loss (indicative of greater susceptibility), whereas durum wheat (T. durum Desf.) shows similar FCR severity but suffers much worse yield loss. To understand these differences, fungal biomass in bread and durum wheats and barley was estimated by real-time quantitative PCR at different stages of FCR disease development. Similar to a previous report on bread wheat infection by Fusarium graminearum, FCR infection caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum also showed three distinct phases in each of the three crop species analysed. During all stages of FCR disease development, barley varieties invariably displayed earlier and faster fungal accumulation compared with either bread or durum wheat. Although suffering much greater yield loss than barley, durum wheat appears to accumulate significantly lower levels of F. pseodugraminearum during infection. These results demonstrate that bread wheat varieties are more resistant to FCR infection and pathogen accumulation than barley varieties, and the less yield loss of the latter is likely due to its better tolerance to this disease. If also existing among different sources of resistance within a given species, these different features of disease resistance and tolerance could be exploited to minimize yield loss of new varieties.

We do not know whether there is limited similarity between co-existing species when accounting for the parallel effect of abiotic habitat filtering and biotic competition. By accounting for such effects, we test the predictions of three theories (classic niche theory, the Hubbell neutrality theory and the Scheffer and van Nes theory) of community assembly. Location Two vegetation transitions (a grazing gradient and a timber line ecotone) in a sub-alpine area of western Sichuan Province, China (31 degrees 51'N, 102 degrees 41'E). Methods We used a null model to investigate the above plant community assembly theories on two sub-alpine gradients of woody vegetation. In the null model, species traits were constrained between the maximum and minimum trait values of observed communities to test the principle of limiting similarity between co-existing species by testing for even spacing of traits. We analysed traits characterizing growth strategies of stems, leaves and twigs, measured at the level of individuals in situ. Results After accounting for variations in trait range, it became evident that six out of eight traits showed significantly uneven spacing within some plots, notably towards the forest end of the gradient, i.e. under increased competition pressure among woody plants. The Wilcoxon rank test showed that seven out of eight traits were significantly unevenly spaced within plots. The two transitions studied showed surprisingly similar patterns, despite their dissimilar precise drivers. Conclusion Our results support the recent theory of Scheffer & van Nes, which suggests that competition could result in a clumped pattern of species along a niche axis.

In this study, a small RNA library was constructed to identify conserved miRNAs as well as novel miRNAs in maize seedling roots under low level phosphorus stress. Twelve miRNAs were identified by high throughput sequencing of the library and subsequent analysis, two belong to conserved miRNA families (miRNA399b and miRNA156), and the remaining ten are novel and one of latter is conserved in gramineous species. Based on sequence homology, we predicted 125 potential target genes of these miRNAs and then expression patterns of 7 miRNAs were validated by semi-RT-PCR analysis. MiRNA399b, Zma-miR3, and their target genes (Zmpt1 and Zmpt2) were analyzed by real-time PCR. It is shown that both miRNA399b and Zma-miR3 are induced by low phosphorus stress and regulated by their target genes (Zmpt1 and Zmpt2). Moreover, Zma-miR3, regulated by two maize inorganic phosphate transporters as a newly identified miRNAs, would likely be directly involved in phosphate homeostasis, so was miRNA399b in Arabidopsis and rice. These results indicate that both conserved and maize-specific miRNAs play important roles in stress responses and other physiological processes correlated with phosphate starvation, regulated by their target genes. Identification of these differentially expressed miRNAs will facilitate us to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of maize seedling roots development under low level phosphorus stress.

The objective of the current research was to screen for polymorphism, expression of POU1F1 and their association with carcass quality traits. A total of 126 Erlang mountainous chickens from two strains (SD02 and SD03) were employed for testing. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, but only two SNPs (g.96217999 T > C and g.96219442 C > T) were associated with carcass quality traits. In SD03 chicken, g.96217999 T > C genotypes were significantly associated with body weight (BW), carcass weight (CW), eviscerated weight (EW), and semi-eviscerated weight (SEW; P < 0.05), and was highly significantly associated with breast muscle weight (BMW) and abdominal fat weight (AW; P < 0.01). g.96219442 C > T was significantly associated with BW, EW, SEW (P < 0.05). However, these two SNPs were not significantly associated with any carcass traits in SD02 chicken. Diplotypes showed that in SD03 chicken, the haplotype [C: C] was the most favorable haplotype because it was associated with higher BW, CW, SEW, EW, BMW, and AW (P < 0.05). On the contrary, haplotype [T: T] was associated with lower carcass quality traits (P < 0.01). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that at 13 weeks, the POU1F1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in breast muscle of cock compared to that of hens (P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant correlation between POU1F1 expression and carcass traits. These results suggested that POU1F1 could be a potential candidate gene for carcass traits in chicken.

This improvement might be related to the target of rapamycin (TOR) and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP). A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp, Cyprinus carpio var. Jian, with an average initial weight of 6.33 (SE 0.03) g, were fed with diets containing graded concentrations of arginine, namely, 9.8 (control), 12.7, 16.1, 18.5, 21.9 and 24.5 g arginine/kg diet for 9 weeks. An real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed to determine the relative expression of TOR and 4E-BP in fish muscle, hepatopancreas and intestine. Dietary arginine increased (P < 0.05): (1) glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities in muscle and hepatopancreas; (2) intestine and hepatopancreas protein content, folds height, and trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, Na+/K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase activities in intestine; (3) Lactobacillus counts; (4) relative expression of TOR in the muscle, hepatopancreas and distal intestine (DI); (5) relative expression of 4E-BP in proximal intestine (PI) and mid-intestine (MI), as compared with the control group. In contrast, dietary arginine reduced (P < 0.05): (1) plasma ammonia content; (2) Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli counts; (3) relative expression of TOR in PI and MI; (4) relative expression of 4E-BP in the muscle, hepatopancreas and DI. The arginine requirement estimated by specific growth rate using quadratic regression analysis was found to be 18.0 g/kg diet. These results indicate that arginine improved fish growth, digestive and absorptive ability and regulated the expression of TOR and 4E-BP genes.

In Expt 1, in situ ligated duodenal loops from Mn-deficient chicks (29-d-old) were perfused with solutions containing 0-8.74 mmol Mn/l from either MnSO4, or one of two organic chelates of Mn and amino acids with moderate (OM) or strong (OS) chelation strength (Q(f)) up to 30 min. In Expt 2, Mn-deficient intact broilers (14-d-old) were fed a control diet (12.45 mg Mn/kg) or the control diet supplemented with 100mg Mn/kg as one of all Mn sources for 14 d. The uptake kinetics of Mn from different Mn sources in the ligated duodenal loops followed a saturable process as determined by regression analysis of concentration-dependent uptake rates. The maximum transport rate (J(max)) and K-m values, and DMT1 mRNA levels in the ligated duodenal loops were higher (P<0.01) for OM and OS than for MnSO4. DMT1 mRNA levels were much higher (P<0.01) in the duodenum than in the jejunum and ileum. Both DMT1 mRNA levels in the duodenum and plasma Mn contents from the hepatic portal vein of intact chicks on day 14 post-feeding increased (P<0.05) in the following order: control, MnSO4, OM, OS. These results indicated that organic Mn sources with stronger Q(f) showed higher Mn transport and absorption, and DMT1 might be involved in the regulation of organic Mn transport in the proximal small intestine of broilers.

However, the prevalence and intensity of the parasite infection has been inconsistently reported through a method that uses sedimentation-floatation followed by a microscope examination. This method fails to accurately determine infection because there are many bamboo residues and/or few B. schroederi eggs in the examined fecal samples. In the present study, we adopted a method that uses PCR and capillary electrophoresis combined with a single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR/CE-SSCP) to detect B. schroederi infection in wild giant pandas at a nature reserve, and compared it to the traditional microscope approach. The PCR specifically amplified a single band of 279-bp from both fecal samples and positive controls, which was confirmed by sequence analysis to correspond to the mitochondrial COII gene of B. schroederi. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the amount of genomic DNA was linearly correlated with the peak area of the CE-SSCP analysis. Thus, our adopted method can reliably detect the infectious prevalence and intensity of B. schroederi in wild giant pandas. The prevalence of B. schroederi was found to be 54% in the 91 fecal samples examined, and 48% in the fecal samples of 31 identified individual giant pandas. Infectious intensities of the 91 fecal samples were detected to range from 2.8 to 959.2 units/gram, and from 4.8 to 959.2 units/gram in the fecal samples of the 31 identified giant pandas. For comparison, by using the traditional microscope method, the prevalence of B. schroederi was found to be only 33% in the 91 fecal samples, 32% in the fecal samples of the 31 identified giant pandas, and no reliable infectious intensity was observed.

One bottleneck for the design of fundamentally new intervention and management strategies against D. immitis may be the currently limited knowledge of fundamental molecular aspects of D. immitis. Methodology/Principal Findings: A next-generation sequencing platform combining computational approaches was employed to assess a global view of the heartworm transcriptome. A total of 20,810 unigenes (mean length = 1,270 bp) were assembled from 22.3 million clean reads. From these, 15,698 coding sequences (CDS) were inferred, and about 85% of the unigenes had orthologs/homologs in public databases. Comparative transcriptomic study uncovered 4,157 filarial-specific genes as well as 3,795 genes potentially involved in filarial-Wolbachia symbiosis. In addition, the potential intestine transcriptome of D. immitis (1,101 genes) was mined for the first time, which might help to discover 'hidden antigens'. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides novel insights into the transcriptome of D. immitis and sheds light on its molecular processes and survival mechanisms. Furthermore, it provides a platform to discover new vaccine candidates and potential targets for new drugs against dirofilariosis.

It is brown solid readily soluble in water and methanol. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer show strong absorption bands, which correspond to the pi-pi* transition of p-conjugated segments. Fluorescence spectra in different solvents show that this kind of polymer has solvent-dependency. It was found that the existence of polymer-type surfactant significantly increased the intensity of fluorescence of the polymer. The fluorescence of the polymer in water solution could be effectively quenched by methyl viologen. Linear fit of the quenching plots affords Stern-Volmer constants (Ksv) of 5.65x10(5)M(-1) for intrinsic fluorescence emission of the polymer m-PPYPE-SO3Na and this revealed its good fluorescence sensitivity.

Nevertheless, their functions appear to be highly diverse and remain rather unclear. To date, no genome-wide characterization of this gene family has been conducted in a legume species. Here we report the first genome-wide analysis of the whole MYB superfamily in a legume species, soybean (Glycine max), including the gene structures, phylogeny, chromosome locations, conserved motifs, and expression patterns, as well as a comparative genomic analysis with Arabidopsis. Results: A total of 244 R2R3-MYB genes were identified and further classified into 48 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis with their putative orthologs, showed both gene loss and duplication events. The phylogenetic analysis showed that most characterized MYB genes with similar functions are clustered in the same subfamily, together with the identification of orthologs by synteny analysis, functional conservation among subgroups of MYB genes was strongly indicated. The phylogenetic relationships of each subgroup of MYB genes were well supported by the highly conserved intron/exon structures and motifs outside the MYB domain. Synonymous nucleotide substitution (d(N)/d(S)) analysis showed that the soybean MYB DNA-binding domain is under strong negative selection. The chromosome distribution pattern strongly indicated that genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of soybean MYB genes. In addition, we found that similar to 4% of soybean R2R3-MYB genes had undergone alternative splicing events, producing a variety of transcripts from a single gene, which illustrated the extremely high complexity of transcriptome regulation. Comparative expression profile analysis of R2R3-MYB genes in soybean and Arabidopsis revealed that MYB genes play conserved and various roles in plants, which is indicative of a divergence in function. Conclusions: In this study we identified the largest MYB gene family in plants known to date. Our findings indicate that members of this large gene family may be involved in different plant biological processes, some of which may be potentially involved in legume-specific nodulation. Our comparative genomics analysis provides a solid foundation for future functional dissection of this family gene.

However, in pigs, the information on GSK3 is very limited. Identification and characterization of pig GSK3 are not only important for pig genetic improvement, but also contribute to the understanding and development of porcine models for human disease prevention and treatment. Methodology: Five different isoforms of GSK3 beta were identified in porcine different tissues, in which three isoforms are novel. These isoforms had differential expression patterns in the fetal and adult of the porcine different tissues. The mRNA expression level of GSK3 beta isoforms was differentially regulated during the course of the insulin treatment, suggesting that different GSK3 beta isoforms may have different roles in insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, GSK3 beta 5 had a different role on regulating the glycogen synthase activity, phosphorylation and the expression of porcine GYS1 and GYS2 gene compared to other GSK3 beta isoforms. Conclusions: We are the first to report five different isoforms of GSK3 beta identified from the porcine different tissues. Splice variants of GSK3 beta exhibit differential activity towards glycogen synthase. These results provide new insight into roles of the GSK3 beta on regulating glycogen metabolism.

DNA vaccine plasmids pVAX-UL24 and pVAX-LTB-UL24 were constructed and transformed into attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL7207 resulting SL7207 (pVAX-UL24) and SL7207 (pVAX-LTB-UL24) respectively. After ducklings were orally inoculated with SL7207 (pVAX-UL24) or SL7207 (pVAX-LTB-UL24), the anti-DEV mucosal and systemic immune responses were recorded. To identify the optimum dose that confers maximum protection, we used different doses of the candidate vaccine SL7207 (pVAX-LTB-UL24) during oral immunization. The strongest mucosal and systemic immune responses developed in the SL7207 (pVAX-LTB-UL24) (10(11) CFU) immunized group. Accordingly, oral immunization of ducklings with SL7207 (pVAX-LTB-UL24) showed superior efficacy of protection (60-80%) against a lethal DEV challenge (1000 LD50), compared with the limited survival rate (40%) of ducklings immunized with SL7207 (pVAX-UL24). Our study suggests that the SL7207 (pVAX-LTB-UL24) can be a candidate DEV vaccine.

GDSL-lipases is one of the lipases that exhibit a GDSL motif GxSxxxxG, in which the active site Serine is located near the N-terminus and display a Gly-Asp-Ser-(Leu) [GDS(L)] motif in conserved block I. However, the knowledge about their roles in developmental processes and response to various stimuli are still very limited in rice. A systematic analysis revealed the presence of at least 113 GDSL lipase (GLIP) genes in the rice genome. The tandem gene duplications have contributed a major role in expansion of this gene family. Phylogenetic analysis classed proteins into three groups; OsGLIP group B contained 56 genes, 50 in group A and only 2 genes in group C. The organization of putative motifs indicated potential diverse functions of GLIP gene family members in rice. Microarray data analysis revealed tissue and developmental stage-specific expression patterns of several OsGLIP genes. 38 OsGLIP genes were especially expressed in stigma and seed germination, several genes expressed exclusively in root and 17 OsGLIP genes were induced by any of three stresses. Our analysis also suggests differential accumulation of cluster genes during these processes. Our analyses indicated OsGLIP genes may have potential roles in rice development and abiotic stresses.

RyhB, an iron-responsive sRNA, is conserved in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriae, indicating the downregulation of numerous genes during iron depletion. This sRNA is tightly regulated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) and interacts with the RNA binding protein Hfq. Hfq is generally purported to be essential for stabilizing sRNAs and promoting sRNA-mRNA duplex formation. Maintenance of iron homeostasis is an essential step in the lifecycle of Yersinia pestis. Y. pestis encodes two RyhB homologs, RyhB1 and RyhB2. In this study, we found that as in the case of E. colt, both RyhB homologs in Y. pestis are negatively regulated by Fur and have a half-life of >30 min. In the absence of Hfq, RyhB1 is rapidly degraded, while RyhB2 retains its stability. RyhB I stabilization is mediated by Hfq, but RyhB2 does not require Hfq for stability. Additionally, both RyhBs are upregulated in lungs infected with Y. pestis, while the ryhB mutant shows no visible effects on virulence in mice upon either subcutaneous or intranasal inoculation.

Forage quality not only affects the growth and production efficiency of livestock, but also determines the final output and quality of livestock products. Forage quality mainly depends on nutrient concentrations and their digestibility, palatability and the level of presence of antiquality factors and mycotoxins in forage. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy(NIRS) has been widely used in many research areas because it is a inexpensive, rapid, simple and nondestructive technique offering the potential for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The present paper briefly introduces the principle and characteristics of NIRS, detailedly expounds the application of NIRS in forage quality. In addition, other applications of near infrared spectroscopy technique in forage are also discussed, including forage breeding, identification of variety and classification by kind. This paper comprehensively reviews the status quo of application of NIRS in forage filed, in order to contribute to promoting development of NIRS in this field in China.

Mammalian STINGs have been isolated from human, mouse, pig, cattle and chimpanzee. In this study, the rat STING cDNA was cloned by degenerate PCR and rapid amplification of 3'-cDNA ends (3'-RACE) strategies. The full-length cDNA of rat STING consists 01 1615 bp with a 1140-bp open reading frame (ORF). The predicted protein is composed of 379 amino acids and contains 2 putative transmembrane domains. The amino acid similarities between the STING from rat and other mammals range from 68% to 82%. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that rat STING mRNA was most abundant in the spleen, pancreas and lymph node. Overexpression of rat STING led to upregulation of IFN-beta mRNA expression in IEC-6 cells. Rat STING mRNA was up-regulated when IEC-6 cells were transfected with poly (I:C). In addition, a miR-24 binding site in the .3'UTR of rat STING was identified. We also found that endogenous STING could be regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-24 in IEC-6 cells. These results are of importance to reveal the biological function of STING in rat animal model. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The polysaccharide BEBP was further purified by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column, giving three major polysaccharide fractions termed BEBP-1, BEBP-2 and BEBP-3. In the next experiment, the average molecular weight (Mw), IR and monosaccharide compositional analysis of the three polysaccharide fractions were determined. The evaluation of antioxidant activities both in vitro and in vivo suggested that BEBP-3 had good potential antioxidant activity, and should be explored as a novel potential antioxidant.

RFI and CM traits are difficult and expensive to measure and genetic improvement for these traits through traditional selection methods is not very effective. Therefore, genome-wide selection using DNA markers may be a potential alternative for genetic improvement of these traits. In this study, the efficiency of a genome-wide selection model for genetic improvement of RFI and CM was assessed. The Illumina Bovine50K bead chip was used to genotype 922 beef cattle from the Kinsella Beef Research Ranch of the University of Alberta. A Bayes model and multiple marker regression using a stepwise method were used to conduct the association test. The number of significant SNP markers for carcass weight (CWT), carcass back fat (BF), carcass rib eye area (REA), carcass grade fat (GDF), lean meat yield (LMY), and residual feed intake (RFI) were 75, 54, 67, 57, 44 and 50, respectively. Bi-variate analysis of marker scores and phenotypes for all traits were made using DMU Software. The genetic parameter for each trait was estimated. The genetic correlations of marker score and phenotype for CWT, BF, REA, GDF, LMY and RFI were 0.75, 0.69, 0.87, 0.77, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. The average prediction accuracies of phenotypic EBV for the six traits were increased by 0.05, 0.16, 0.24, 0.23, 0.17 and 0.19, respectively. The results of this study indicated that the two-trait marker-assisted evaluation model used was a suitable alternative of genetic evaluation for these traits in beef cattle.

Until now, little was known about how protective immunity to B. schroederi infection could be achieved. The present study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant Bs-Ag1 from B. schroederi, by cloning the full-length Bs-Ag1 gene of B. schroederi and expressing it in a heterologous host, Escherichia coli BL21. In mice vaccinated with rBs-Ag1 coupled with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), there was a significant reduction (69.2%) in the recovery of challenged B. schroederi L3 compared with either nonvaccinated controls or mice vaccinated with FCA alone. Our study supports the use of Bs-Ag1 as a potential candidate for vaccination against B. schroederi infection and provides basic data for further vaccination trials with mixtures of antigens (with Bs-Ag2 and Bs-Ag3) to B. schroederi.

The effects of the electrode gap, oxygen flow rate, electrode connection method, input voltage and pulse frequency and initial solution concentration on MO removal performance;characterized by MO removal efficiency or TOC mineralization rate) were investigated. The experimental results indicated that GH of 3 mm and LH of 5 mm were beneficial to MO removal efficiency; a moderate oxygen flow rate of 0.16 or 0.12 m(3)/h was favorable for MO removal efficiency or TOC mineralization rate, respectively; the positive-negative (+-) connection, i.e. the bottom titanium electrode was connected to the HV power supply and the top electrode was connected to the ground, was better than the negative-positive (-+) connection; discharge voltage of 30 kV and pulse frequency of 100 Hz was the reasonable choice, regarding the MO removal efficiency and TOC mineralization rate as well as the energy yield and the stable discharge status. MO in a lower initial concentration of solution was more easily to be degraded. Ozone generated during pulse discharge was likely to be one of the main active species for MO degradation, meanwhile, intermediates recalcitrant to ozone, including small molecular acids and inorganic ions, were proved to be generated. Although a higher initial MO solution concentration negatively affected the MO removal performance, it could positively influence the energy yield. A layer of titanium dioxide film was presumed to form on the surface of a titanium plate electrode. (C) 2012 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, we found the main function of US2 gene in herpesvirus is to target the heavy chain of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in endoplasmic reticulum and then to induce the degradation of MHC by the proteasome in cytoplasm. MHC plays an important role in antigen presentation, but after the US2 gene interfers with the expression of MHC on cell surface, the virus can avoid the immunologic mechanism of the host because it disrupts the antigen presentation. We hope to describe the characteristics and function of the herpesvirus US2 gene and its encoding protein, and also the interactions with Us11 and Us10 proteins to enable further research on the herpesvirus genome.

Characterizing standing variation in this complex genome has been challenging, with only a small fraction of it described to date. Using a population genetics scoring model, we identified 55 million SNPs in 103 lines across pre-domestication and domesticated Zea mays varieties, including a representative from the sister genus Tripsacum. We find that structural variations are pervasive in the Z. mays genome and are enriched at loci associated with important traits. By investigating the drivers of genome size variation, we find that the larger Tripsacum genome can be explained by transposable element abundance rather than an allopolyploid origin. In contrast, intraspecies genome size variation seems to be controlled by chromosomal knob content. There is tremendous overlap in key gene content in maize and Tripsacum, suggesting that adaptations from Tripsacum (for example, perennialism and frost and drought tolerance) can likely be integrated into maize.

The results showed that drought (25% of FC) caused disorder in photosynthesis, increased the amounts of osmotically active substances (soluble sugars, proteins and proline), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and damage in the integrity of cellular membranes and chloroplasts in both males and females. However, compared with drought-stressed females, drought-stressed males showed (1) higher values of net photosynthetic rate (P-n), maximum rate of electron transport driving RuBP regeneration (J(max)), maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax), carboxylation efficiency (CE) and non-photochemical quenching coefficient (qP); (2) higher contents of soluble proteins and proline; (3) higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO); (4) less negative effects on cellular membranes and chloroplasts. These results indicate that P. cathayana males have a better self-protection of the photosynthetic system, greater accumulation of substances for osmotic adjustment and a more efficient enzymatic detoxification cycle for eliminating the negative effects caused by ROS under drought stress than do females.

Enhancing Fusarium crown rot resistance of durum wheat by introgressing chromosome segments from hexaploid wheat	EUPHYTICA			English	Article						Fusarium crown rot; Durum wheat; Gene transfer; Introgression lines; Quantitative trait loci	HEAD BLIGHT RESISTANCE; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; BREAD WHEAT; DISEASE; PSEUDOGRAMINEARUM; BARLEY; ROOT	Compared with hexaploid wheat, tetraploid durum is more susceptible to Fusarium crown rot (FCR) infection. The feasibility of enhancing FCR resistance in durum wheat by introgressing chromosome segments of hexaploid wheat was investigated by generating and analysing a backcross population derived from a susceptible durum wheat variety 'Bellaroi' (recurrent parent) and a resistant hexaploid genotype 'CSCR6' (donor parent). Together with a few scattered segments on various chromosomes, segments of a large section of the donor chromosome 6B showed a significant effect in enhancing FCR resistance in the durum background. However, a known major locus on the donor 3BL conferring high level of resistance to FCR in hexaploid wheat failed to provide any improvement in resistance than that of the genome average once it was introduced into the durum wheat. A small proportion of the backcross population gave similar resistance to the bread wheat variety 'Kennedy', a level of FCR resistance acceptable to durum growers. These lines share a 4B segment from the hexaploid donor, although the segment was not among those with the largest individual effect across the whole population. These results show that it is feasible to improve FCR resistance of durum wheat by exploiting hexaploid chromosome segments, although resistance loci of the hexaploid wheat may not function properly in durum backgrounds.

Sixteen piglets at normal birth weight and 16 IUGR piglets were fed either a control diet (C) or a folic acid-supplemented diet (FS, C+5 mg/kg folic acid) from 14 d of age to 35 d of age postnatal. Blood and liver samples were collected at the end of the study. The results showed that body weight was lower for IUGR piglets than that of NBW piglets at 14 d of age and 35 d of age postnatal (P < 0.05). Dietary folic acid supplementation increased plasma folic acid concentrations and hepatic GPx activity, but decreased plasma homocysteine levels (P < 0.05). Reduced activities of Mn-SOD and T-AOC, mitochondria! DNA (mtDNA) content, and ATP concentration (P < 0.05) were observed in the liver of IUGR pigs fed a control diet. However, the changes in mtDNA content and activities of Mn-SOD and T-AOC were negated in IUGR pigs fed a FS diet (P < 0.05). Also, dietary folic acid supplementation decreased protein carbonyls and MDA concentration in the liver of IUGR piglets (P < 0.05). Expression levels of genes encoding for PPAR gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), mammalian silencing information regulator-2 alpha (SIRT-1), nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), mt transcription factor A (TFAM), mt single-strand DNA-binding protein (mt SSB), mt polymerase r (mt polr), glucokinase, citrate synthase (CS), ATP synthase (ATPS), and cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX) subunit I and V were decreased in IUGR piglets compared with NBW piglets. However, mRNA levels of PGC-1 alpha, SIRT-1, NRF-1, TFAM, and mt polr in the liver of IUGR pigs fed FS diet were not different from that of NBW pigs. Gene mRNA expression abundance of CcOX IV was enhanced by folic acid supplementation (P < 0.05) regardless of birth weight. The present study indicates that IUGR impaired hepatic antioxidant function and mRNA expression levels of genes are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Dietary folic acid supplementation prevented the harmful effect of IUGR on hepatic antioxidant function and mtDNA biogenesis, but had no effect on mRNA expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial function.

As attenuated Salmonella typhimurium is already being used as an effective vehicle for the transfer of DNA vaccines, so in this study we evaluated two DNA vaccines mediated by S. typhimurium on their ability of eliciting antibody production. SPF chickens were respectively immunized with SL7207 (pVAX-sigma B), SL7207 (pVAX-sigma C) and SL7027 (pVAX-sigma B-sigma C) three times. The results showed that the antibody production was highly dependent on the immunizing times, detectable antibodies of serum antibody IgG and small intestinal mucosal antibody IgA were generated at week 4 and were further improved at week 6 and antibody titers in group SL7207 (pVAX-sigma C) were higher than that in group SL7207 (pVAX-sigma B), demonstrating that SL7207 (pVAX-sigma C) was more powerful than SL7207 (pVAX-sigma B) in antibody production. The higher antibody titer in SL7027 (pVAX-sigma B-sigma C) than that in SL7207 (pVAX-sigma C) group showed that co-expressing sigma B and sigma C could improve antibody production. IFN-gamma detection showed that significant higher IFN-gamma was generated both in groups SL7027 (pVAX-sigma B-sigma C) and SL7207 (pVAX-sigma C). Subsequent challenge showed that SL7207 (pVAX-sigma B), SL7207 (pVAX-sigma C) and SL7027 (pVAX-sigma B-sigma C) conferred 50%, 75% and 87.5% respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the role of miRNAs in myoblast proliferation remains poorly understood. Here we found that the expression of miR-27a was increased during proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, overexpression of miR-27a in C2C12 cells promoted myoblast proliferation by reducing the expression of myostatin, a critical inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis. In addition, the miR-27a was confirmed to target myostatin 3'UTR by a luciferase reporter analysis. Together, these results suggest that miR-27a promotes myoblast proliferation through targeting myostatin. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The ghrelin gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using total RNA extracted from intestine of crucian carp. PCR product was cloned into the pMD (R) 19-T vector to construct pMD (R) 19-T-ghrlein for sequencing. Then the cDNA was subcloned into the prokaryotic expressing plasmid vector pET32a and was transformed into host Escherichia coli strain Rosetta for expression. In this study, 490 bp fragment of ghrelin was obtained by RT-PCR. In comparison with other fishes, the amino acid sequences of ghrelin in crucian carp showed a high similarity to that of goldfish (99%). The high expression of ghrelin gene was detected in the intestine and liver by real-time PCR. IPTG at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 mmol/L could efficiently induce the expression of pGh-32. The result showed that the optimal concentration of IPTG was 0.3 mmol/L by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The ghrelin gene expressed as early as 1 h after IPTG induction, and reached peak levels after 3 h. Successful expression of ghrelin fusion protein in prokaryotic cell could lay a basis for further study of industrial production.

In view of the projections of global climate change and their implications on the ability of strawberry to adapt to such changes, we extended our studies to know the possible role of such transgenic plants in contributing to sustainable strawberry production and also made some basic studies to analyse the behaviour of osmotin (transgene)/in vitro-regenerated transgenic strawberry plants. Ten different lines of transgenic strawberry plants, with osmotin transgene were developed using Agrobacterium-mediated method. Expression of osmotin gene was observed in three transgenic lines and drought tolerance was confirmed. RAPD analysis, within its limits of sensitivity and accuracy, failed to detect any appreciable polymorphism in the genomic DNA of wild and tissue culture-raised (transgenic and control) plants. No morphological abnormalities were detected in the transgenic lines overexpressing osmotin, although their rate of growth was lesser under in vitro as well as ex vitro conditions, possibly due to diversion of energy towards constitutive expression of osmotin. These plants resumed normal growth and overcame the growth penalty when inoculated with Piriformospora indica. Surprisingly, the overexpression of osmotin, a PR-5c protein with antifungal activity, had no adverse impact on the colonization or symbiotic association of P. indica and Sebacina vermifera with these transgenic plants. We report here on the association of symbiotic fungi with transgenic strawberry and their usefulness in overcoming growth penalty in such transgenic plants.

J	Chen, Q; Yu, HW; Tang, HR; Wang, XR				Chen, Qing; Yu, Haowei; Tang, Haoru; Wang, Xiaorong			Identification and expression analysis of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in the fruit of blackberry	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Anthocyanin; Proanthocyanidin; Gene isolation; Expression analysis; Blackberry fruit	ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY; RUBUS SPP.; STRAWBERRY; SPECTROMETRY; PATHWAY; ENZYMES; GRAPE; PCR	Anthocyanin and proanthocyanin are two major secondary metabolites involved in fruit maturation. In this work, the variations of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin content were determined during blackberry fruit development. Genes associated with biosynthesis of both two compounds were isolated. Expression patterns of these genes were also investigated by quantitative PCR throughout fruit maturation. Anthocyanins, which remained at a low concentration in the early developing stage, increased dramatically as the fruit matured. On the contrary, proanthocyanidins exhibited a continuously decreasing pattern. Transcript levels of genes specifically controlling either of these two compounds: anthocyanin synthase (RuANS) for anthocyanin, leucoanthocyanidin reductase (RuLAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (RuANR) for proanthocyanidin, were generally coordinated with the products' changing patterns. The expression of the RuMYB10, encoding a transcription factor, was also concomitant with the synthesis of anthocyanins, indicating its specificity regulation role in anthocyanin branch. The other two genes, chalcone synthase (RuCHS) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (RuDFR), showed cross regulation for not only the synthesis of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin, but also other flavonoid compounds. According to the temporal expression patterns, the isolated RuGT gene might encode a glucosyltransferase participating in modifying metabolites besides anthocyanins. Our discoveries of the temporal gene expression and compounds accumulation will shed new light into genetic and physiological metabolisms in blackberry fruit development, thus assisting in future attempts to alter anthocyanin or PA metabolites in fruits.

However, the inconsistent results were observed in different ecosystems due to various temperature dynamics. Based on previous observations on nutrient dynamics, soil microbial biomass, enzyme activity and soluble carbon and nitrogen were investigated in the highly humified soils of subalpine and alpine fir (Abies faxoniana) forests along an altitude gradient in the Eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau every 10 days from 5 March until 25 April, 2009, including the winter-spring transitional period. Soil temperature significantly changed during the soil thawing period with frequent soil temperature fluctuations around 0 degrees C. Microbial biomass sharply increased as soil thawing proceeded until an obvious peak when soil temperatures rise to 0 degrees C. Thereafter, microbial biomass declined during the thawing period when soil temperatures exceeded 0 degrees C. Likewise, the rapid crashed in the soluble organic nutrient pools occurred shortly before or coincident with the microbial biomass dropped as soil temperature fluctuated close to 0 degrees C. Meanwhile, the sudden decline in enzyme activity occurred just before the soluble organic nutrient pools collapsed. Additionally, the dynamic patterns of microbial biomass, enzyme activity and soluble organic substrate varied with altitudes due to different temperature fluctuations. The results indicate that the release of nutrients as microbial biomass decline might represent an important pulse of carbon and nutrients pools for vegetation growth in the early stage of growing season.

Comparative proteome analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: A global overview of in vivo targets of the yeast activator protein 1	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Yap1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transcription factor; Stress response; Proteome	YAP-1 TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION; PENTOSE-PHOSPHATE PATHWAY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GENE-EXPRESSION; JUN FAMILY; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; HEXOKINASE; METABOLISM; PROTECTION	Background: The activity of the yeast activator protein 1 (Yap1p) increases under stress conditions, which leads to enhanced transcription of a number of genes encoding protective enzymes or other proteins. To obtain a global overview of changes in expression of Yap1p-targeted proteins, we compared a Yap1p-overexpressing transformant with a control transformant by triplicate analysis of the proteome using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Proteins of interest were identified using MALDI-MS or LC-MS/MS. Results: The relative quantities of 55 proteins were elevated significantly upon overexpression of Yap1p, and most of these proteins were found to have a Yap1p-binding site upstream of their coding sequences. Interestingly, the main metabolic enzymes in the glycolysis and pyruvate-ethanol pathways showed a significant increase in the Yap1p-overexpressing transformant. Moreover, a comparison of our proteome data with transcriptome data from the literature suggested which proteins were regulated at the level of the proteome, and which proteins were regulated at the level of the transcriptome. Eight proteins involved in stress response, including seven heat-shock and chaperone proteins, were significantly more abundant in the Yap1p-overexpressing transformant. Conclusions: We have investigated the general protein composition in Yap1p-overexpressing S. cerevisiae using proteomic techniques, and quantified the changes in the expression of the potential Yap1p-targeted proteins. Identification of the potential Yap1p targets and analysis of their role in cellular processes not only give a global overview of the ubiquitous cellular changes elicited by Yap1p, but also provide the framework for understanding the mechanisms behind Yap1p-regulated stress response in yeast.

The toxic effect of each extract was tested against Psoroptes cuniculi and Sarcoptes scabiei in vitro. Ethanol thermal circumfluence extract had strong toxicity against mites, killing all S. scabiei at 0.5 and 1.0 g/ml (w/v) concentration, while 1 g/ml extract was also found to kill all P. cuniculi within a 4-h period. Similarly, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 g/ml concentration of extract had strong toxicity against S. scabiei, with median lethal time (LT50) values at 0.866, 0.785 and 0.517 h, respectively. 0.5 g/ml and 1 g/ml showed strong acaricidal action against P. cuniculi: the LT50 values were 0.93 h and 1.29 h, respectively. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 0.22 g/ml for Scabies mite and 0.64 g/ml for P. cuniculi in 1 h. The results indicated that E. adenophorum contains potent acaricidal ingredients; as a first step in the potential development of novel drugs, it may provide new acaricidal compounds for the effective control of animal acariasis.

To date, no genome-wide characterization of this gene family has been conducted in maize (Zea mays). In the present study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis, to yield a complete overview of the R2R3-MYB gene family in maize, including the phylogeny, expression patterns, and also its structural and functional characteristics. The MYB gene structure in maize and Arabidopsis were highly conserved, indicating that they were originally compact in size. Subgroup-specific conserved motifs outside the MYB domain may reflect functional conservation. The genome distribution strongly supports the hypothesis that segmental and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of maize MYB genes. We also performed an updated and comprehensive classification of the R2R3-MYB gene families in maize and other plant species. The result revealed that the functions were conserved between maize MYB genes and their putative orthologs, demonstrating the origin and evolutionary diversification of plant MYB genes. Species-specific groups/subgroups may evolve or be lost during evolution, resulting in functional divergence. Expression profile study indicated that maize R2R3-MYB genes exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Furthermore, computational prediction potential targets of maize microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed that miR159, miR319, and miR160 may be implicated in regulating maize R2R3-MYB genes, suggesting roles of these miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation and transcription networks. Our comparative analysis of R2R3-MYB genes in maize confirm and extend the sequence and functional characteristics of this gene family, and will facilitate future functional analysis of the MYB gene family in maize.

We attempted the development of transgenic Chinese cabbage expressing the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene (pinII) and bioassayed the pest-repelling ability of these transgenic plants. Cotyledons with petioles from aseptic seedlings were used as explants for Agrobacterium-mediated in vitro transformation. Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 contained the binary vector pBBBasta-pinII-bar comprising pial and bar genes. Plants showing vigorous PPT resistance were obtained by a series concentration selection for PPT resistance and subsequent regeneration of leaf explants dissected from the putative chimera. Transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR and genomic Southern blotting, which showed that the bar and pinII genes were integrated into the plant genome. Double haploid homozygous transgenic plants were obtained by microspore culture. The pinII expression was detected using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and detection of PINII protein content in the transgenic homozygous lines. Insect-feeding trials using the larvae of cabbage worm (Pieris rapae) and the larvae of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) showed higher larval mortality, stunted larval development, and lower pupal weights, pupation rates, and eclosion rates in most of the transgenic lines in comparison with the corresponding values in the non-transformed wild-type line.

J	Wang, Y; Zhu, Q; Yang, L; Liu, YP				Wang, Yan; Zhu, Qing; Yang, Ling; Liu, Yi-Ping			Ontogenic Expression Pattern and Genetic Polymorphisms of the Fatty Acid Transport Protein 4 (FATP4) Gene in Chinese Chicken Populations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						FATP4 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; mRNA expression; carcass trait	ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; METABOLISM; MARKERS; CLONING; GENOME; MOUSE; CELLS	In the current research, the polymorphism of FATP4 gene was analyzed in Erlang Mountainous chickens. A total of nine genetic variants were identified by FATP4 gene sequencing analysis across the chicken samples. Significant associations (p < 0.05) were observed for two SNPs (g.5608778C>T and g.5608814G>A in exon 6) with certain carcass traits (such as live weight, carcass weight, eviscerated weight) in S01 and S05 populations, respectively. Meanwhile, in S05 population, haplotype 3 (T-G) and haplotype 2 (C-A) were associated with higher and lower partial carcass traits such as live weight, carcass weight, eviscerated weight and semi-eviscerated weight, respectively. Moreover, we investigated the expression profile of this gene during ontogenesis in Mountainous black-boned chicken. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that FATP4 mRNA had the highest expression level in small intestine tissue over all other tissues examined. The FATP4 mRNA levels presented remarkable developmental changes with age in the various tissues. These results suggested that the FATP4 gene might play an important role in controlling chicken carcass traits.

There are anatomical, cellular, molecular and physiological differences among adipose tissues deposited in different body sites. However, current understanding of the intrinsic differences between the sub-compartments of the subcutaneous adipose tissue remains rudimentary. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation differences between the porcine superficial and deep backfat tissues using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing. We show that the genes with differentially methylated regions in their promoter are mainly involved in the processes of "lipid metabolism" and "regulation of immune-related cytokines". Compared with the deep backfat tissue, the promoters of genes related to the 'positive regulation of cytokine production' were significantly hypermethylated in the superficial backfat tissue, which reflects the intrinsic functional and metabolic differences between the sub-compartments of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. This study provides epigenetic evidence for functionally relevant methylation differences between different layers of porcine backfat tissues.

This is first report on the biosynthesis of HFAs from renewable sugar, without the need of exogenous fatty acids. By employing thioesterases BTE and 'TesA to tailor the composition of free fatty acids (FFAs) and using fatty acid hydroxylase P450(BM3) to convert FFAs to HFAs, high-specificity production of C12 and C14 HFAs was achieved. By further knocking out the endogenous fadD gene of E. coli, an engineered strain capable of producing 117.0 mg/L HFAs was finally obtained, representing a high HFA production in shake flask. This study indicated an attractive metabolic strategy for the biosynthesis of HFAs directly from renewable carbohydrates resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to investigate early symptoms of the loss of membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation in root tissues and physiological adaptation mechanism to Pb in accumulating ecotypes (AE) and non-accumulating ecotypes (NAE) of Sedum alfredii under Pb stress in hydroponics. Methods and results Histochemical in situ analyses, fluorescence imaging, and normal physiological analysis were used in this study. Pb accumulation in roots of both AE and NAE increased linearly with increasing Pb levels (0-200 mu M), and a significant difference between both ecotypes was noted. Both loss of plasma membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation in root tissues became serious with increasing Pb levels, maximum tolerable Pb level was 25 and 100 mu M for NAE and AE, respectively. Pb supplied at a toxic level caused a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in root cells in both ecotypes. However, the root cells of AE had inherently higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), and lipoxygenase (LOX) in control plants, and the induction response of these antioxidant enzymes occurred at lower Pb level in AE than NAE. AE plants maintained higher ascorbic acid and H2O2 concentrations in root cells than NAE when exposed to different Pb levels, and Pb induced more increase in dehydroascorbate (DHA), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in AE than NAE roots. Discussion and conclusion Results indicate that histochemical in situ analyses of root cell death and lipid peroxidation under Pb short-term stress was sensitive, reliable, and fast. Higher tolerance in roots of accumulating ecotype under Pb stress did depend on effective free oxygen scavenging by making complex function of both constitutively higher activities and sensitive induction of key antioxidant enzymes in root cells of S. alfredii.

The optimal formulation of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was oil/SAA/water = 1/2/5 (w/w), in which the SAA consisted of emulsifier HSH and methanol with ratio of 3/2 (w/w). The cloud point of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was 70 degrees C and its effective ingredient content was 2.5% measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Its heat storage stability was studied according to the standards. The decomposition rates of the difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion were merely 2.45%, 2.63% respectively and met the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) standards of pesticide microemulsion. Investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) the particle size of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was 90 similar to 140 nm and its antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA were tested and compared with that of Meiyu. We found that the inhibition rates in the difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion treatment group were significantly higher than that of the emulsion group with the same content of effective ingredients and the study also revealed that its inhibiting ability on the formation and germination of sclerotia was significant.

Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) there is a close relationship among North American StH genome species; (2) the DMC1 gene sequences of the StH genome species from North America and Eurasia are evolutionarily distinct; (3) the StH genome polyploids have higher levels of sequence diversity in the St genome homoeolog than the H genome homoeolog; (4) the DMC1 sequence may evolve faster in the polyploid species than in the diploids; (5) high dN and dN/dS values in the St genome within polyploid species could be caused by low selective constraints or AT-biased mutation pressure. Our result provides some insight on evolutionary dynamics of duplicate DMC1 gene, the polyploidization events and phylogeny of the StH genome species.

SDS-PAGE band of 1Dx5.3(t) was between those of 1Bx6 and 1Bx7, while 1Dy12.1**(t) with slightly faster migration rate than that of 1Dy12. The lengths of 1Dx5.3 (t) and 1Dy12.1** (t) were 2115 bp and 1986 bp, encoding 703 and 660 amino acid residues, respectively. Their authenticity was confirmed by successful expression of the coding regions in Escherichia coli. 1Dx5.3(t) is the shortest of the known Dx-type alleles. 1Dy12.1**(t) is also a special subunit since it has an additional cysteine in the front of the central repetitive domain. This cysteine that is not existed in previously reported Dy-type genes may be useful for improving bread wheat quality.

Identification of a specific SCAR marker for detection of Tilletia foetida (Wall) Liro pathogen of wheat	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							BUNT FUNGI; CONSPECIFIC STATUS; DWARF BUNT; CONTROVERSA; DNA; CARIES; TELIOSPORES; TRITICI; AFLP; RAPD	Common bunt is one of the most important destructive diseases of wheat worldwide and is a domestic quarantined disease in China. However, a rapid and efficient method to identify the corresponding pathogens is currently limited. The objective of the present study was to develop a diagnostic molecular marker specific towards Tilletia foetida (Wall) Liro, a causal agent of the bunt disease. One specific DNA fragment for T. foetida (286 bp in length) was amplified using an Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) assay and, this fragment was cloned and sequenced. One pair of specific primers (SC286-1/SC286-2), which was designed according to the sequence, could specifically amplify the corresponding fragment in all of the T. foetida isolates employed from both the People's Republic of China and United States, whereas this fragment could not be amplified by the other fungal species tested. Therefore, a specific Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) marker was developed. This SCAR marker could distinguish T. foetida from related pathogenic fungi efficiently and could be used for the early diagnosis of the common bunt of wheat in the field, and provide an efficient way for disease surveillance and disease forecasting in cereal crop.

To reveal the genetic architecture for flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity, a comprehensive evaluation of the relevant literature was performed and followed by meta analysis. A total of 25 synthetic consensus quantitative trait loci (QTL) and four hot-spot genomic regions were identified for photoperiod sensitivity including 11 genes related to photoperiod response or flower morphogenesis and development. Besides, a comparative analysis of the QTL for flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity highlighted the regions containing shared and unique QTL for the two traits. Candidate genes associated with maize flowering were identified through integrated analysis of the homologous genes for flowering time in plants and the consensus QTL regions for photoperiod sensitivity in maize (Zea mays L.). Our results suggest that the combination of literature review, meta-analysis and homologous blast is an efficient approach to identify new candidate genes and create a global view of the genetic architecture for maize photoperiodic flowering. Sequences of candidate genes can be used to develop molecular markers for various models of marker-assisted selection, such as marker-assisted recurrent selection and genomic selection that can contribute significantly to crop environmental adaptation.

A total of 420 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups (seven replicates in each group and ten broilers in each replicate) and fed on control diet or the same diet supplemented with 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg vanadium in the form of ammonium metavanadate. The results showed that the percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells in both ileac lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were significantly lower (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 45- and 60-mg/kg groups than in the control group from 14 to 42 days of age. The CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio was increased in ileac LPLs in the 60-mg/kg group at 28 days of age, and in ileac IELs in the 60-mg/kg group at 28 days of age and in the 45-mg/kg group at 42 days of age. Meanwhile, the ileac IL-2, IL-6 contents were decreased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 60-mg/kg group from 14 to 42 days of age and in the 45-mg/kg group from 28 to 42 days of age in comparison with those of the control group. It was concluded that dietary vanadium in excess of 30 mg/kg reduced the ileac T cell population and percentages of T cell subsets, and IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma contents, implying that the immune function of local intestinal mucosa in broilers could be affected by the dietary vanadium.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary vanadium on the tissue distribution and quantity of immunoglobulin A-positive (IgA(+)) cell in the cecal tonsil by immunohistochemistry. Simultaneously, the changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) contents in the cecal tonsil were also quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 420 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet (control diet) or the same diet supplemented respectively with 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg of vanadium in the form of ammonium metavanadate for 42 days. The results showed that the population of the IgA(+) cells in the cecal tonsil were significantly lower (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 45 and 60 mg/kg groups than that in the control group. Meanwhile, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha contents in the cecal tonsil were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in the 30, 45 and 60 mg/kg groups in comparison with those of the control group. However, IL-6 content in the cecal tonsil was only decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in 60 mg/kg at 14 and 28 days of age. In conclusion, dietary vanadium in excess of 30 mg/kg reduced the numbers of the IgA(+) cells and changed the contents of the abovementioned cytokines in the cecal tonsil, which may finally impact the function of local mucosal humoral immunity in broilers.

Surface ditch sediment samples were collected from headwater subcatchment of forestland, sloping cropland, paddy field, and residential area in a representative catchment in the central Sichuan Basin. These sediment samples were used for determination of P sorption-desorption characteristics by a batch equilibrium technique. Results showed that the maximum P sorption capacities (Q(m)) in the sediments ranged from 159.7 to 263.7 mg/kg, while higher Q(m) were observed in the ditch sediments from the paddy fields. The Q(m) was significantly and positively correlated with oxalate-extractable Fe and Al oxides (r=0.97 and 0.98, p < 0.01), clay fraction (r = 0.78, p < 0.05) and organic matter (r = 0.95, p < 0.01). Sediment pH, clay and organic matter influenced the P sorption through amorphous Fe and Al oxides. CaCO3 content was negatively correlated with the Q(m) (r = -0.83, p < 0.05), implying that saturated CaCO3 (> 50 g/kg) would not increase P sorption capacity in the ditch sediments. The ditch sediments featured a linear desorption curve, suggesting that P release risk would be enhanced with the increase of the P adsorption. The P desorption rate was positively correlated with Olsen P (r = 0.94, p < 0.01), but negatively related to the fine particle-size fractions (r = -0.92, p < 0.01), the sum of the amorphous Fe and Al oxides (r = -0.67, p < 0.05) and the P sorption capacity (r = -0.59, p < 0.05). The ditch sediments from residential area had a higher P release risk than that from the other ditches of forestland, sloping cropland and paddy field. The P sorption index (PSI) derived from single-point measurement was significantly correlated with the P sorption capacity (r = 0.99, p < 0.01), and could be used for estimating Q(m) as 1.64 times PSI plus 24.0 (Q(m) = 1.64 PSI + 24.0) for similar sediments with highly calcareous soils and sediments. Ditch cleaning and sediment removal for the ditch in residential area were recommended in this area to reduce the P release risk.

In this study, plant height and biomass measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used as criteria for drought tolerance. A total of 305 lines representing temperate, tropical and subtropical maize germplasm were genotyped using two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips each containing 1536 markers, from which 2052 informative SNPs and 386 haplotypes each constructed with two or more SNPs were used for linkage disequilibrium (LD) or association mapping. Single SNP- and haplotype-based LD mapping identified two significant SNPs and three haplotype loci [a total of four quantitative trait loci (QTL)] for plant height under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. For biomass, 32 SNPs and 12 haplotype loci (30 QTL) were identified using NDVIs measured at seven stages under the two water regimes. Some significant SNP and haplotype loci for NDVI were shared by different stages. Comparing significant loci identified by single SNP- and haplotype-based LD mapping, we found that six out of the 14 chromosomal regions defined by haplotype loci each included at least one significant SNP for the same trait. Significant SNP haplotype loci explained much higher phenotypic variation than individual SNPs. Moreover, we found that two significant SNPs (two QTL) and one haplotype locus were shared by plant height and NDVI. The results indicate the power of comparative LD mapping using single SNPs and SNP haplotypes with QTL shared by plant height and biomass as secondary traits for drought tolerance in maize.

In this study, a drought-tolerant genotype was screened from 48 accessions of Tibetan hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare). By using virus-induced gene silencing, the influence of two LEA genes (HVA1 and Dhn6) on drought tolerance of Tibetan hulless barley was investigated. Results of quantitative real-time PCR indicated that the relative expression levels of HVA1 and Dhn6 in silenced plants were significantly reduced compared with control plants. Both HVA1-silenced and Dhn6-silenced plants showed a consequently lower survival rate than control plants under drought stress. However, only HVA1-silenced plants exhibited a significantly higher water loss rate (WLR). These results suggested that HVA1 and Dhn6 might participate in adaptive responses to water deficit in different ways. Vegetative growth of HVA1-silenced plants was significantly retarded even under optimal growth conditions, and their biomass accumulation was also much lower than that of the controls. These results indicate that HVA1 might play a role in vegetative growth of Tibetan hulless barley.

The potential application of myostatin-based technology has been prompted in different ways in agriculture. We previously constructed an expression vector of duck FST and isolated the FST fusion protein. After the protein was purified and refolded, it was added to the medium of duck myoblasts cultured in vitro. The results show that the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide value of the myoblasts in the duck FST treatment group is higher than that in the control group, which indicates that the duck FST fusion protein exhibits the biological activities that can accelerate myoblast proliferation. To further investigate the roles of duck FST on muscle development, we injected the protein into the duck muscle tissues in vivo. The results show that both the duck muscle fiber cross-sectional area and the satellite cell activation frequency are influenced more in the FST treatment group than they are in the control group. In addition to these phenomena, expression of MyoD and Myf5 were increased, and the expression of myostatin was decreased. Together, these results suggest the potential for using duck FST fusion protein to inhibit myostatin activity and subsequently to enhance muscle growth in vivo. The mechanism by which FST regulates muscle development in the duck is similar to that in mammals and fishes.

Since the rate of discovery of novel antibiotics is decreasing, actinobacteria from unique environments need to be explored. In particular, actinobacterial biocontrol strains from medicinal plants need to be studied as they can be a source of potent antibiotics. We combined culture-dependent and culture-independent methods in analyzing the actinobacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of seven traditional medicinal plant species from Panxi, China, and assessed the antimicrobial activity of the isolates. Each of the plant species hosted a unique set of actinobacterial strains. Out of the 64 morphologically distinct isolates, half were sp., eight were sp., and the rest were members of 18 actinobacterial genera. In particular, Diels. hosted a diverse selection of actinobacteria, although the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence identity ranges of the isolates and of the 16S rRNA gene clone library were not congruent. In the clone library, 40% of the sequences were related to uncultured actinobacteria, emphasizing the need to develop isolation methods to assess the full potential of the actinobacteria. All isolates showed antimicrobial activity. While the antimicrobial activities of the rare actinobacteria were limited, the growth of , , and were inhibited only by rare actinobacteria, and strains related to and showed broad antimicrobial activity.

Fermentation ability of four yeast strains and influences of residual solids after hydrolysis on fermentation were investigated in SHF. Meanwhile, influences of inorganic salts on fermentation were assessed to determine their suitable supplementations for ethanol production. Additionally, influences of initial yeast inoculation on SHF and SSF were further investigated. The results showed the adopted yeast strain, Tembec 1, displayed the best fermentation performance on the hydrolysate of pretreated SSB, and the residual solids in hydrolysate had negligible influences on ethanol fermentation. Although the deficiency or overdose of (NH4)(2)HPO4 or MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O could reduce ethanol yield in SHF, the suitable supplementation of (NH4)(2)HPO4 (0.5 g L (1)) and MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O (1.0 g L (1)) could increase ethanol yield by 5.2% and 8.3%, respectively. The initial yeast inoculation of 3 g L (1) could satisfy both SSF and SHF, which achieved 63.8% and 57.9% ethanol yield of theoretical one with final ethanol concentration of 23.3 g L (1) and 21.2 g L (1), respectively. In addition, ethanol yield kept almost constant as yeast was inoculated from 3 to 5 g L (1) in SHF, whereas it decreased significantly in SSF. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Warming effects on the early decomposition of three litter types, Eastern Tibetan Plateau, China	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							LEAF-LITTER; SOIL RESPIRATION; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; LOBLOLLY-PINE; FOREST; ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE; QUALITY; AVAILABILITY	Temperature and litter quality are two of the key factors controlling litter decomposition. Predicted global warming and vegetation succession will therefore have profound impacts. This study was conducted to assess effects of experimental warming on litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics of two contrasting tree species (red birch, Betula albosinensis Burk., and dragon spruce, Picea asperata Mast.) and a mixture of the two with the heating cable method in the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. This treatment raised surface soil temperature by 3.2 degrees C and resulted in a 5.2% decline in soil moisture 10 cm below the soil surface. The water content of dragon spruce, red birch and mixed litter was decreased by 18, 11 and 13%, respectively. Marked differences between the two species in the decomposition rates and nutrient remaining percentages were detected. Moreover, we found positive, non-additive effects of litter mixture. Experimental warming did not affect mass loss and nutrient release of dragon spruce litter but significantly increased mass loss and affected nutrient release of red birch and mixed litter during the early decomposition period. Overall, inter-specific (red birch and dragon spruce) differences in decomposability were substantially larger than warming-induced responses. Thus, a warming-induced community succession towards dragon spruce forests in the Tibetan Plateau region could have a greater impact on early litter decomposition than warming itself.	[Xu, Z.

Responses of growth performance and tryptophan metabolism to oxidative stress induced by diquat in weaned pigs	ANIMAL			English	Article						pigs; oxidative stress; tryptophan metabolism; tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase	GLUTATHIONE-PEROXIDASE; ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; PLASMA; SYSTEM; RAT; LIVER; SEROTONIN; CORTISOL	During many pathological conditions, the tryptophan concentration in blood may be reduced. However, the effects of oxidative stress on tryptophan metabolism remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress on growth performance and tryptophan metabolism in weaned pigs. A total of 24 weaned pigs were assigned to one of three treatments that included pigs fed ad libitum (control), pigs challenged with diquat at a dose of 10 mg/kg BW and fed ad libitum (oxidative stress) or pigs pair-fed to receive the same amount of feed as the diquat-challenged pigs. The trial lasted for 7 days. The growth performance and activities of antioxidant enzymes were declined in diquat-challenged pigs. The diquat challenge decreased the tryptophan concentration in serum and the 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration in the hypothalamus, and increased large neutral amino acids, kynurenine (Kyn) and malondialdehyde in serum. The 544-bp porcine partial mRNA sequence of the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) gene was obtained according to the conserved region in the human gene sequence. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by the diquat challenge stimulated TDO-relative mRNA abundance in the liver and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in intestinal mucosa, but did not affect the mRNA levels of Na+-neutral amino acid transporter B0. These results suggested that oxidative stress induced by diquat depressed growth performance and increased metabolism of tryptophan via Kyn pathway that upregulated TDO mRNA expression in weaned pigs.

The Tibetan porcine IPS-1 gene was first cloned from spleen. The entire open reading frame (ORF) of the IPS-1 is 1,575 bp and encodes for 524 amino acid residues, has 1 putative transmembrane domains, with a higher degree of sequence similarity with common pig (99.37%) and cattle (81.23%) than with human (70.20%) or mouse (63.44%). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that Tibetan porcine IPS-1 mRNA was most abundant in the liver and kidney.

In this study, the non-coding intergenic region of trnH-psbA was investigated to assess the genetic diversity and infer the maternal origin within T. intermedium accessions. Eleven haplotypes were distinguished among the thirty-five accessions of T. intermedium. They showed a relatively low nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.00473 +/- 0.00037 and a moderately high haplotype diversity (H-d) of 0.733 +/- 0.061. In the phylogenetic analysis, all accessions of T. intermedium were positioned into two clades, which corresponded to the different diploid donors. These results suggested that there were two phylogenetically divergent maternal donors in T. intermedium.

However, the diversity and variations of HMW-GSs are relatively low in bread wheat. More interests are now focused on wheat wild relatives in Triticeae. The genus Aegilops represents an important germplasm for novel HWM-GSs and other useful genes for wheat genetic improvement. Results: Six novel Glu-1 alleles and HMW-GSs were identified and characterized from three species of Aegilops section Sitopsis (S genome). Both open reading frames (ORFs) and promoter regions of these Glu-1 alleles were sequenced and characterized. The ORFs of Sitopsis Glu-1 genes are approximately 2.9 kb and 2.3 kb for x-type and y-type subunits, respectively. Although the primary structures of Sitopsis HMW-GSs are similar to those of previously reported ones, all six x-type or y-type subunits have the large fragment insertions. Our comparative analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences verified that Aegilops section Sitopsis species encode novel HMW-GSs with their molecular weights larger than almost all other known HMW-GSs. The Glu-1 promoter sequences share the high homology among S genome. Our phylogenetic analyses by both network and NJ tree indicated that there is a close phylogenetic evolutionary relationship of x-type and y-type subunit between S and D genome. Conclusions: The large molecular weight of HMW-GSs from S genome is a unique feature identified in this study. Such large subunits are resulted from the duplications of repetitive domains in Sitopsis HMW-GSs. The unequal crossover events are the most likely mechanism of variations in glutenin subunits. The S genome-encoded subunits, 1Dx2.2 and 1Dx2.2* have independent origins, although they share similar evolutionary mechanism. As HMW-GSs play a key role in wheat baking quality, these large Sitopsis glutenin subunits can be used as special genetic resources for wheat quality improvement.

AcSERK2 shared high similarity to AcSERK1 and other SERKs, containing all the characteristic domains of the SERK family. The expressed recombinant protein of pET-AcSERK2 was soluble. AcSERK2 expression was effectively induced by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and maintained in high level at the early stage of somatic embryogenesis (SE). The results of in situ hybridization showed that AcSERK2 expressed at high level in the competent cells under the induction of 2, 4-D and at low level during the development of meristematic center to globular embryo. This indicated that AcSERK2 could be used as a potential marker gene to monitor the acquisition of embryogenic competence. However, AcSERK2 expression was also detected in all the tested organs and the expression level decreased along with the development of calyx, ovule and ovary. These results suggested that AcSERK2 maybe play a broader role in organ development. AcSERK2 transcription could be induced by exogenous hormones and abiotic stress. It was deduced that AcSERK2 may participate in response to exogenous hormones and abiotic stress regulation in pineapple. The expression pattern of AcSERK2 during SE differed from that of AcSERK1, and this indicated that the SERK genes may be non-redundant in somatic embryogenesis. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports the finding of a flavonol synthase (FLS) gene, cloned and characterized from F. tataricum and designated FtFLS1, that is involved in rutin biosynthesis. The FtFLS1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the recombinant soluble FtFLS1 protein had a relative molecular mass of 40 kDa. The purified recombinant protein showed, with dihydroquercetin as substrate, total and specific activities of 36.55 X 10(-3) IU and 18.94 x 10(-3) IU/mg, respectively, whereas the total and specific activities were 10.19 X 10(-3) IU and 5.28 X 10(-3) IU/mg, respectively, with dihydrokaempferol. RT-PCR revealed that during F. tataricum florescence there was an organ-Specific expression pattern by the FtFLS1 gene, with similar trends in flavonoid content. These observations suggest that FtFLS1 in F. tataricum encodes a functional protein, which might play a key role in rutin biosynthesis.

The C12/14 and C16/18 alcohols are important feedstocks for the production of surfactants and detergents, which are widely used in the most respected consumer detergents, cleaning products and personal care products worldwide. Though bioproduction of fatty alcohols has been carried out in engineered E. coli, several key problems have not been solved in earlier studies, such as the quite low production of C16/18 alcohol, the lack of optimization of the fatty alcohol biosynthesis pathway, and the uncharacterized performance of the engineered strains in scaled-up system. Results: We improved the fatty alcohol production by systematically optimizing the fatty alcohol biosynthesis pathway, mainly targeting three key steps from fatty acyl-acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to fatty alcohols, which are sequentially catalyzed by thioesterase, acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase and fatty acyl-CoA reductase. By coexpression of thioesterase gene BTE, acyl-CoA synthase gene fadD and fatty acyl-CoA reductase gene acr1, 210.1 mg/L C12/14 alcohol was obtained. A further optimization of expression level of BTE, fadD and acr1 increased the C12/14 alcohol production to 449.2 mg/L, accounting for 75.0% of the total fatty alcohol production (598.6 mg/L). In addition, by coexpression of thioesterase gene 'tesA, acyl-CoA synthase gene fadD and fatty acyl-CoA reductase gene FAR, 101.5 mg/L C16/18 alcohol was obtained, with C16/18 alcohol accounting for 89.2% of the total fatty alcohol production. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report on selective production of C12/14 and C16/18 alcohols by microbial fermentation. This work achieved high-specificity production of both C12/14 and C16/18 alcohols. The encouraging 598.6 mg/L of fatty alcohols represents the highest titer reported so far. In addition, the 101.5 mg/L 89.2% C16/18 alcohol suggests an important breakthrough in C16/18 alcohol production. A more detailed optimization of the expression level of fatty alcohol biosynthesis pathway may contribute to a further improvement of fatty alcohol production.

Maize kernels have low alpha-tocopherol content, the compound with the highest vitamin E activity, thus, raising the risk of vitamin E deficiency in human populations relying on maize as their primary vitamin E source. In this study, two insertion/deletions (InDels) within a gene encoding gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase, Zea mays VTE4 (ZmVTE4), and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located similar to 85 kb upstream of ZmVTE4 were identified to be significantly associated with alpha-tocopherol levels in maize kernels by conducting an association study with a panel of similar to 500 diverse inbred lines. Linkage analysis in three populations that segregated at either one of these three polymorphisms but not at the other two suggested that the three polymorphisms could affect alpha-tocopherol content independently. Furthermore, we found that haplotypes of the two InDels could explain similar to 33% of alpha-tocopherol variation in the association panel, suggesting ZmVTE4 is a major gene involved in natural phenotypic variation of alpha-tocopherol. One of the two InDels is located within the promoter region and associates with ZmVTE4 transcript level. This information can not only help in understanding the underlying mechanism of natural tocopherol variations in maize kernels, but also provide valuable markers for marker-assisted breeding of alpha-tocopherol content in maize kernels, which will then facilitate the improvement of maize as a better source of daily vitamin E nutrition.

To date, thousands of miRNAs have been identified in different organisms. Several viruses have been reported to encode miRNAs. Findings: Here, we extended the analysis of miRNA-encoding potential to the Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1). Using computational approaches, we found that AHV-1 putatively encodes 12 mature miRNAs. We then compared the 12 mature miRNAs candidates with the all known miRNAs of the herpesvirus family. Interestingly, the "seed sequences" (nt 2 to 8) of 2 miRNAs were predicted to have the high conservation in position and/or sequence with the 2 miRNAs of Marek's disease virus type 1 (MDV-1). Additionally, we searched the targets from viral mRNAs. Conclusions: Using computational approaches, we found that AHV-1 putatively encodes 12 mature miRNAs and 2 miRNAs have the high conservation with the 2 miRNAs of MDV-1. The result suggested that AHV-1 and MDV-1 should have closed evolutionary relation, which provides a valuable evidence of classification of AHV-1. Additionally, seven viral gene targets were found, which suggested that AHV-1 miRNAs could affect its own gene expression.

Then the three-dimensional(3D) structure mode of TK was constructed by the homology modeling method, and the model reliability was determined by both Ramachandran plot and Profile-3D image. Insight II/Binding site, Delphi and Affinity modules were used to explore the possible functional sites and interaction model of the TK and its inhibitor. The results show that Site 1 are the possible active sites and a new low molecular inhibitor, N-phenyl-N'-methylurea, is designed, and the special hydrogen-band interaction may play an important role in inhibiting the enzyme activity. These results may provide new theoretical references and pathway through PRV-TK inhibitors designing to the study of methods of PRV control.

Here we used comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand its potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses. Results: Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon, while CBF4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species. Conclusions: We conclude that B. distachyon can serve as an interesting model for specific molecular mechanisms involved in low temperature responses in core Pooideae species. However, the evolutionary history of key genes involved in low temperature responses has been different in Brachypodium and core Pooideae species. These differences limit the use of B. distachyon as a model for holistic studies relevant for agricultural core Pooideae species.

In this study, we develop a LAMP assay specific for detection of a particular clone (clone SA) of Campylobacter jejuni, associated with the vast majority of recent sheep abortions in the U.S. Using a set of specific primers for C. jejuni IA3902 (a clone SA isolate) and genomic DNA or boiled cell extract as template, the target DNA was amplified at 63 degrees C for 50 min in a water bath. A positive reaction was identified visually as white precipitate or fluorescence under UV, and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Detection limit of the assay was comparable to that of conventional PCR. The LAMP was shown to be specific for detection of clone SA when tested on a number of C. jejuni strains of different genetic backgrounds. Applicability of the LAMP assay for specific detection of clone SA was demonstrated in animal tissues experimentally infected with IA3902 or genetically diverse C. jejuni strains. Since clone SA is the predominant cause of sheep abortions in the U.S. and is a zoonotic pathogen, the LAMP assay may be a valuable detection tool in future epidemiological studies.

Their structures were established on the basis of their spectroscopic data and comparison with those of the literature. Among these alkaloids, chasmanine, oxonitine and 15-acetylsongoramine were isolated for the first time from this medicinal plant. The cytotoxic activity of the alkaloids were tested against several cell lines by the MTT method in which aconitine, hypaconitine, mesaconitne and oxonitine were found to strongly inhibit the growth of the HePG2 cell line, which showed that the existence and quantity of the ester groups have a significant influence on the cytotoxicity of the diterpenoid alkaloids.

Two PSB strains, Pseudomonas chlororaphis and Bacillus megaterium, and two NFB strains, Arthrobacter pascens and Burkholderia cepacia, were selected to investigate interaction between PSB and NFB in liquid medium. The maximum concentration of soluble phosphorus (P) was determined in the mixing culture of P. chlororaphis and A. pascens. A strong correlation was found between pH and soluble P concentration, as well as the total organic acid production and P solubilization. Co-inoculation with P. chlororaphis and A. pascens amendment with RP resulted in the highest plant height, shoot and root dry weight, P and nitrogen (N) uptake of walnut seedlings, and the maximum amounts of available P and N in soils under shade house conditions. However, mixed inoculation with B. megaterium and A. pascens failed to increase these parameters. The results demonstrated that co-inoculation with PSB and NFB amendment with RP could be a promising and alternative option for utilizing this potent source as P fertilizer in walnut plants and maintaining greater nutrient availability in soils.

Here, using pig as a model, we investigate the systematic association between DNA methylation and obesity. We sample eight variant adipose and two distinct skeletal muscle tissues from three pig breeds living within comparable environments but displaying distinct fat level. We generate 1,381 Gb of sequence data from 180 methylated DNA immunoprecipitation libraries, and provide a genome-wide DNA methylation map as well as a gene expression map for adipose and muscle studies. The analysis shows global similarity and difference among breeds, sexes and anatomic locations, and identifies the differentially methylated regions. The differentially methylated regions in promoters are highly associated with obesity development via expression repression of both known obesity-related genes and novel genes. This comprehensive map provides a solid basis for exploring epigenetic mechanisms of adipose deposition and muscle growth.

The complete genome of the virus contained 15,198 nucleotides. Based on length of the genome and a partial sequence of the F gene, the virus was classified as a class I genotype 4 NDV. The antigenicity of the virus was compared with that of NDV strain La Sota via hemagglutination inhibition (HI), virus neutralization (VN) assay and animal experiments. Our results show that JS10 generates higher HI and VN titers than La Sota against both class I and II virulent NDV strains. Experiments on animals demonstrate that virus shedding from chickens vaccinated with JS10 is significantly reduced when compared to those vaccinated with La Sota. Overall, this study strongly suggests that JS10 may qualify as a new vaccine candidate against Newcastle disease.

To improve the understanding of genetic architecture of orchardgrass and provide a template for heading date candidate gene search in this species, the goals of the present study were to construct a tetraploid orchardgrass genetic linkage map and identify quantitative trait loci associated with heading date. A combination of SSR markers derived from an orchardgrass EST library and AFLP markers were used to genotype an F-1 population of 284 individuals derived from a very late heading Dactylis glomerata subsp. himalayensis parent and an early to mid-heading Dactylis glomerata subsp. aschersoniana parent. Two parental maps were constructed with 28 cosegregation groups and seven consensus linkage groups each, and homologous linkage groups were tied together by 38 bridging markers. Linkage group lengths varied from 98 to 187 cM, with an average distance between markers of 5.5 cM. All but two mapped SSR markers had homologies to physically mapped rice (Oryza sativa L.) genes, and six of the seven orchardgrass linkage groups were assigned based on this putative synteny with rice. Quantitative trait loci were detected for heading date on linkage groups 2, 5, and 6 in both parental maps, explaining between 12% and 24% of the variation.

In this study, a new trigeneric hybrid involving species of Triticum, Psathyrostachys, and Thinopyrum was synthesized by crossing Triticum aestivum L. (wheat) - Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey amphiploid Zhong 3 with wheat - Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo amphiploid PHW-SA. Crossability of the two amphiploids was 19.74%, and the fertility of the hybrid was 16.20%. The mean meiotic configuration of the trigeneric hybrid (2n = 56) was 13.06 I + 17.24 IIring + 3.73 IIrod + 0.28 III + 0.04 IV. GISH analysis indicated that the trigeneric F-1 had seven P. huashanica chromosomes and seven Th. intermedium chromosomes. The mean chromosome numbers of F-2, F-3, and F-4 progenies were 2n = 49.24, 2n = 48.13, and 2n = 46.78, respectively, a gradual decrease. GISH analysis revealed that most F-2 and F-3 plants had 2-10 Th. intermedium chromosomes and 0-4 P. huashanica chromosomes. In the F-4 progenies, 1-7 Th. intermedium chromosomes were labeled, but no P. huashanica chromosomes were detected. It seems that Th. intermedium chromosomes are more likely than P. huashanica chromosomes to be transmitted to the progenies. The stripe rust response of PHW-SA was expressed in the F-1 and some F-2 and F-3 progenies. The trigeneric hybrid could be a useful bridge for transfering P. huashanica and Th. intermedium chromosomes to common wheat.

The developed method offered the low detection limits of 0.42-0.70 and 0.28-0.57 ng/mL for BA and FFA, respectively. Compared with the reported methods, the proposed method here is capable of offering higher detection sensitivity and selectivity, with less cost and lower volume of sample preparation. This method was validated to ensure high accuracy and precision, and the reliability of its results. When applied to the serum samples of healthy volunteers and patients with hepatic carcinoma, it showed excellent applicability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AOA were detected at all sampling dates, and there were significant variations in archaeal amoA gene copy numbers (7.63 x 10(5) to 8.35 x 10(8) per gram of dry soil) throughout the nongrowing season. Compared with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), the AOA displayed a higher abundance on the majority of sampling dates during the freeze-thaw period. All of the AOA sequences fell within soil and sediment lineages and were affiliated with 7 clusters. Compared with the other clusters, cluster 1 was more sensitive to low temperature and was the dominant group in August. In contrast, cluster 3 dominated the AOA community in winter and probably represents a group of cold-adapted archaea. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the seasonality of the AOA community was mainly attributed to changes in soil temperature and nutrient availability (e. g., dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon). Our results indicate that AOA exist in frozen soils in the alpine coniferous forest ecosystem of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, soil temperature may directly and (or) indirectly affect AOA abundance and composition and may further influence the soil N cycle during the winter.

We obtained 108 E. coli isolates from nine sampling sites during May and December 2010. The total bacterial count varied from 79 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml to 14,550 CFU/ml, and coliform group number from 13 to 1,435 MPN/ml. Among the 108 isolates, 0-31.48% were resistant to beta-lactams and beta-lactam inhibitors, 1.85-7.40% to aminoglycoside, 1-20% to fluoroquinolone, and 50% to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. The total bacterial count and antimicrobial resistance of different sites were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Among the 34 ampicillin-resistant isolates, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing showed that bla (TEM), bla (SHV), and bla (CTX-M) were detected in 85.29% (n = 29), 41.18% (n = 14), and 5.88% (n = 2) of the isolates, respectively, whereas bla (KPC) and bla (GES) were not observed in any of the isolates. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR patterns revealed that the 34 ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates belonged to three distinct groups. Plasmid DNAs from the 14 SHV producer isolates yielded one to five bands of ca. 0.15-40 kb. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to describe the phenotypic and genetic characterizations of beta-lactam resistance in E. coli isolates of river water origin from the Fu River, Chengdu, southwestern China. Results of the present study suggest that the river water may be considered as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes.

The growth rate of Jinghai lateral buds was higher than that of Jingyun. In vegetative growth stage, IAA level in apical buds of Jingyun was significantly higher than in Jinghai. After flower induction, IAA level in apical buds of two cultivars decreased remarkably, but the IAA level decreased in Jingyun faster than in Jinghai. These results showed that the higher was the IAA level in apical buds the stronger was inhibition of lateral bud outgrowth. An increase in IAA and iP/iPA and a decrease in ABA concentrations were closely associated with lateral bud growth alterations in chrysanthemum.

Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective approach to control the disease. To determine inheritance of stripe rust resistance and map the resistance gene in a common wheat line D31, developed from Triticum sphaerococcum Perc. (accession number AS348), F-1, F-2, and BC1 progenies derived from the Taichung 29 x D31 cross were firstly inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR32 during whole growth stages under the field conditions. Genetic analysis indicated that the resistance to CYR32 in the line D31 was conferred by one recessive gene, temporarily designated as YrSph. A total of 400 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 315 pairs of sequence-related amplified polymorphism and 42 pairs of target region amplified polymorphism markers were screened, and four SSR markers and three TRAP markers were found to be polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible DNA bulks as well as their parents. Genetic linkage was tested on segregating F-2 population and indicated that all of the ten markers were linked to the resistance gene, two of which flanked the locus at 8.5 and 6.9 cM, respectively. The SSR markers mapped the resistance gene on chromosome arm 2AS. The results of chromosome location and pedigree analysis indicate that YrSph was probably a novel stripe rust resistance gene.

In order to understand the effects of future warming on treeline birch, this study was conducted to examine the effects of experimental warming on leaf phenology, growth and gas exchange of B. utilis saplings using the open top chamber (OTC) method in a treeline ecotone of eastern Tibetan Plateau. The OTCs enhanced daily mean air temperature by 2.9 K throughout the growing season. Conversely, soil moisture within the OTCs on average declined by 3% over the experimental period. Experimental warming did not affect the timing of bud break, although treeline birch saplings growing in the OTCs manifested later leaf abscission, resulting in longer leaf life span. Artificial warming significantly accelerated the leaf and shoot growth rates of treeline birch saplings, resulting in larger leaf area and longer shoot elongation late in the growing season. Moreover, experimental warming significantly reduced the leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and tended to increase specific leaf area (SLA). Moreover, elevated temperatures significantly enhanced the transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g (s)), maximum net assimilation rate (A (max)), dark respiration rate (R (d)) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) but did not influence the light compensation point (LCP) and light saturation point (LSP) of treeline birch saplings. Taken together, our results indicated that short-term experimental warming markedly altered structural/functional leaf traits and enhanced photosynthetic capacity of treeline birch saplings; such positive responses in treeline birch would be favorable for the growth of this species under future warmer world.

Jian) fed graded levels of methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA) (0, 5.1, 7.6, 10.2, 12.7, 15.3 g kg(-1) diet) for 60 days were investigated. Results indicated that head kidney index, spleen index, red and white blood cell counts significantly increased with increasing MHA levels up to a point (P < 0.05), whereupon decreased (P < 0.05). Glutathione reductase activity in head kidney and spleen, anti-hydroxy radical and glutathione-S-transferase activities in spleen, catalase activity and GSH content in head kidney significantly increased by MHA supplement, while malondialdehyde content, anti-superoxide anion, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activities in head kidney and spleen, protein carbonyl content and catalase activity in spleen, anti-hydroxy radical activity in head kidney significantly decreased by MHA supplement. However, protein carbonyl content and glutathione-S-transferase activity in head kidney, GSH content in spleen remained unaffected. After 60-day feeding trial, a challenge study was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila for 17 days. Results showed that survival rate, leukocytes phagocytic activity, lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase activity, total iron-binding capacity, haemagglutination titre, complement 3, 4 and immunoglobulin M contents significantly increased by optimal dietary MHA supplement (P < 0.05). These data suggested that MHA affected antioxidant status of immune organs and promoted immune response in juvenile Jian carp. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phenotypic responses of chickens to long-term selection for high or low antibody titers to sheep red blood cells	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						chicken; antibody selection; correlation analysis; body weight; reproduction	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; LINES; ERYTHROCYTES; GROWTH; SYSTEM	A long-term bidirectional selection experiment was conducted to study antibody response to SRBC. Lines, high antibody selection (HAS) and low antibody selection (LAS), originating from the same White Leghorn base population had undergone 37 generations of selection for either high or low antibody response 5 d after a single intravenous injection of 0.1 mL of a 0.25% suspension of SRBC antigen. Subpopulations, where selection was relaxed, were maintained as contemporaries with the selected lines from generations 16 to 24 [high antibody relaxed (HAR) and low antibody relaxed (LAR)] and 24 to 37. Body weights were obtained at 4, 24, and 38 wk of age and at the onset of lay (BW at first egg). Also measured were age in days to first egg, percentages of hen-day ovulations and normal egg production, and percentages of normal and defective eggs from total ovulation (PNE and PDE). Selection lead to a large divergence in antibody titers between the selected lines, with a plateau reached in line LAS. Line HAS and HAR females displayed higher antibody titers, lower BW4, and matured at older ages than those from LAS and LAR (P < 0.05). Correlations between BW at 4 wk and antibody titers were different between the selected lines, being positive in line LAS and negative in line HAS. Quadratic regression models fit well with antibody titers, BW4, and PNE, with limiting values for these traits calculated based on regression curves. For line HAS, plots showed that an increased tendency of antibody titers was followed by decreased BW4 and increased PNE. For line LAS, however, antibody titers and BW4 decreased in parallel while PNE increased. It appears that at the phenotypic level there was a resource balance between immune response, growth, and reproductive traits, which during long-term selection, individuals altered their dynamic of resource allocations to satisfy certain needs.

A major factor in the development of insulin resistance syndrome is obesity. NYGGF4 is a novel gene that is abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue of obese subjects. NYGGF4 induced the secretion of FFAs and TNF-alpha and caused mitochondrial dysfunction, which may cause insulin resistance. This review will summarize the effect of NYGGF4 on the adipogenesis, glucose uptake and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro, and the possible mechanism and signal pathway of NYGGF4 for insulin resistance.

Here, a novel cDNA fragment (MsERF8) encoding an ERF protein with an AP2 domain was isolated and characterized from alfalfa. The MsERF8 cDNA has an open reading frame of 603 bp and encodes a nuclear protein of 201 amino acids. Q-RT-PCR analysis revealed that MsERF8 was strongly enriched in roots and leaves compared with stems, flower buds and flowers of mature alfalfa plants. Bioinformatic analysis of the MsERF8 promoter indicated a number of elements associated with stress-related responses, and MsERF8 transcripts in alfalfa seedlings were induced by NaCl, PEG6000, Al-2(SO4)(3) and five different hormones. Expression of MsERF8 in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in higher tolerance to salinity than with non-transgenic plants. This data shows that MsERF8 is a gene which prevents or alleviates salinity damage and has strong potential to impart salt tolerance to other crop plants.

In addition, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) increases the susceptibility of offspring to high-fat (HF) diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Recent findings suggested that HF feeding decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and impaired mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Therefore, we hypothesized that the long-term consequences of IUGR on mitochondrial biogenesis and function make the offspring more susceptible to HF diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Normal birth weight (NBW), and IUGR pigs were allotted to control or HF diet in a completely randomized design, individually. After 4 weeks of feeding, growth performance and molecular pathways related to mitochondrial function were determined. The results showed that IUGR decreased growth performance and plasma insulin concentrations. In offspring fed a HF diet, IUGR was associated with enhanced plasma leptin levels, increased concentrations of triglyceride and malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glycogen and ATP contents in skeletal muscle. High fat diet-fed IUGR offspring exhibited decreased activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). These alterations in metabolic traits of IUGR pigs were accompanied by impaired mitochondrial respiration function, reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents, and down-regulated mRNA expression levels of genes responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In conclusion, our results suggest that IUGR make the offspring more susceptible to HF diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

In the present study, the pathological changes of the gill, skin and muscle from the grass carp exposed to I. multifiliis were observed experimentally by the light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Results showed that I. multifiliis were observed in gill, skin and muscle sections of exposed fish and infections induced by this parasite were associated with epithelial hyperplasia, focal areas of cellular disruption and disappearance. Notably, the histological changes in ultrastructure of the mitochondria and nuclei, such as dislocation of nuclei, brown atrophy (pigmentation accumulation) destruction of striation were observed by TEM compared to control groups. In conclusion, the results obtained indicated that invasion intensified occurrence of morphological lesions in the gill, skin and muscle of grass carp exposed to I. multifiliis, which may lead to respiratory insufficiency of infected fish, bacterial or fungal secondary infection, and even cause mass mortality.

This study was done to determine if a prolonged high intake of dietary Se actually induced gestational diabetes in rat dams and insulin resistance in their offspring. Forty-five 67-day-old female Wistar rats (n = 15/diet) were fed a Sedeficient (0.01 mg/kg) corn-soy basal diet (BD) or BD + Se (as Se-yeast) at 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg from 5 weeks before breeding to day 14 postpartum. Offspring (n = 8/diet) of the 0.3 and 3.0 mg Se/kg dams were fed with the same respective diet until age 112 days. Compared with the 0.3 mg Se/kg diet, the 3.0 mg/kg diet induced hyperinsulinemia (P<0.01), insulin resistance (P<0.01), and glucose intolerance (P<0.01) in the dams at late gestation and/or day 14 postpartum and in the offspring at age 112 days. These impairments concurred with decreased (P<0.05) mRNA and/or protein levels of six insulin signal proteins in liver and muscle of dams and/or pups. Dietary Se produced dose-dependent increases in Gpx1 mRNA or GPX1 activity in pancreas, liver, and erythrocytes of dams. The 3.0 mg Se/kg diet decreased Selh (P<0.01), Sepp1 (P = 0.06), and Sepw1 (P<0.01), but increased Sels (P<0.05) mRNA levels in the liver of the offspring, compared with the 0.3 mg Se/kg diet. In conclusion, supranutrition of Se as a Se-enriched yeast in rats induced gestational diabetes and insulin resistance. Expression of six selenoprotein genes, in particular Gpx1, was linked to this metabolic disorder. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adult T. pisiformis (canines as definitive hosts) and Cysticercus pisiformis (rabbits as intermediate hosts) cause significant health problems to the host and considerable socio-economic losses as a consequence. No complete genomic data regarding T. pisiformis are currently available in public databases. RNA-seq provides an effective approach to analyze the eukaryotic transcriptome to generate large functional gene datasets that can be used for further studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, 2.67 million sequencing clean reads and 72,957 unigenes were generated using the RNA-seq technique. Based on a sequence similarity search with known proteins, a total of 26,012 unigenes (no redundancy) were identified after quality control procedures via the alignment of four databases. Overall, 15,920 unigenes were mapped to 203 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Through analyzing the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and axonal guidance pathways, we achieved an in-depth understanding of the biochemistry of T. pisiformis. Here, we selected four unigenes at random and obtained their full-length cDNA clones using RACE PCR. Functional distribution characteristics were gained through comparing four cestode species (72,957 unigenes of T. pisiformis, 30,700 ESTs of T. solium, 1,058 ESTs of Eg+Em [conserved ESTs between Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis]), with the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) and gene ontology (GO) functional classification systems. Furthermore, the conserved common genes in these four cestode species were obtained and aligned by the KEGG database. Conclusion: This study provides an extensive transcriptome dataset obtained from the deep sequencing of T. pisiformis in a non-model whole genome. The identification of conserved genes may provide novel approaches for potential drug targets and vaccinations against cestode infections. Research can now accelerate into the functional genomics, immunity and gene expression profiles of cestode species.

The optimal way of harvesting 1.67 x 10(9) protoplasts per gram from Rhizoctonia solani was to deal with 12 h aged mycelium in 0.6 M MgSO4 stabilizer (pH 5.2) combining cellulase and driselase at 35 degrees C for 3 h. Meanwhile, the most suitable condition for protoplast regeneration had been attained. The condition was to deal with 16 h aged mycelium in 0.6 M MgSO4 stabilizer (pH 5.2) combining cellulase with driselase at 35 degrees C for 2.5 h, and incubation at 26 degrees C in the regeneration medium. Furthermore, a two-phase system of 0.6 M sucrose and 0.6 M mannitol was developed for separation and purification of intact protoplasts from broken protoplasts, excellent results were obtained. There was a breakthrough for protoplast technology of R. solani and other fungus was recorded in this paper.

The results showed that the content of these cytokines in the cecal tonsil was significantly lower (p<0.05 or p<0.01) in the high F groups II and IIII than in the control group. Lower cytokine levels in the cecal tonsil can impact the local immune function of intestines by affecting pathways that decrease the lymphocyte numbers and/or lymphocyte activation.

The results showed that the contents of stearic acid (C18:0), eicosanoic acid (C20:0), behenic acid (C22:0), myristoleic acid (C14:1), oleic acid (C18:1), alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3), linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n-6), and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) were significantly higher (p<0.01), mainly in the high F groups II and III than in the control group. In contrast, especially in these two groups, the contents of myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), lignoceric acid (C24:0), hexacosanoic acid (C26:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), erucic acid (C22:1), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3, EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA) were significantly lower (p<0.01) than in the control group. In conclusion, feeding broilers high F diets alters fatty acid composition in broiler breast muscle, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The likelihood of an adverse impact of these changes on the quality and flavor of chicken breast and other muscle qualities must also be kept in view.

Molecular marker-assisted breeding procedures can be facilitated and revolutionized through whole-genome strategies, which utilize full genome sequencing and genome-wide molecular markers to effectively address various genomic and environmental factors through a representative or complete set of genetic resources and breeding materials. These strategies are now increasingly based on understanding of specific genomic regions, genes/alleles, haplotypes, linkage disequilibrium (LD) block(s), gene networks and their contribution to specific phenotypes. Large-scale and high-density genotyping and genome-wide selection are two important components of these strategies. As components of whole-genome strategies, molecular breeding platforms and methodologies should be backed up by high throughput and precision phenotyping and e-typing (environmental assay) with strong support systems such as breeding informatics and decision support tools. Some basic strategies are discussed in this article, including (1) seed DNA-based genotyping for simplifying marker-assisted selection (MAS), reducing breeding cost and increasing scale and efficiency, (2) selective genotyping and phenotyping, combined with pooled DNA analysis, for capturing the most important contributing factors, (3) flexible genotyping systems, such as genotyping by sequencing and arraying, refined for different selection methods including MAS, marker-assisted recurrent selection and genomic selection (GS), (4) marker-trait association analysis using joint linkage and LD mapping, and (5) sequence-based strategies for marker development, allele mining, gene discovery and molecular breeding.

Dry seed treatment with uniconazole powder is a simple low-cost technology. To test whether such technology could be used to increase tolerance to water deficits in soybean, the effects of uniconazole application on photosynthesis, leaf relative water content, chlorophyll fluorescence and seed yield were studied. Uniconazole at 0, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg seed was 'applied before sowing. Four levels of soil moisture (75% field capacity for well-watered control and 60, 45 and 30% for drought-stressed treatment) were applied at blooming stage. Drought stress depressed leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomata! conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr), while leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content, Pn, Gs and Tr of uniconazole-treated plants were higher than that of none uniconazole treated plants under the same soil moisture. Uniconazole treatment markedly increased maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) and photochemical quenching (qP) of drought-stressed plants. Treatment with uniconazole also significantly increased biomass accumulation, root/shoot ratio, the numbers of branch pod, branch seed and decreased empty pod of soybean when drought-stressed. This study shows that dry seed treatment with uniconazole can be used as a plant growth regulator technology to enhance drought tolerance and minimize the yield loss of soybean caused by water deficits.

Juzep is a common traditional Chinese medicine. The objectives of this study were to analyze genotype x environment (GE) interaction on yield and quality of four cultivars in seven environments by additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. Main effects due to environment (E), genotype (G), GE interaction as well as first three interaction principal component axes (IPCA 1 to 3) were found to be significant (P < 0.01). Cluster analysis divided the A. orientale into three main sub-regions and three genotypes. Genotype 2 and genotype 4 could be chosen as excellent resources from these wild resources and used them to breed new and high quality cultivars. Production in Dujiangyan had the best yield and quality output, the region should be acted as the main production region. This classification of locations could be useful in breeding for specific adaptability within sub-regions.

In our study, the forming processes of the chlamydospores, chlamydospore balls, conidiospores, and secondary conidiospores during the asexual reproduction were observed more precisely and in greater detail than previous descriptions. The microstructure of the infected rice kernel showed that the outer dense chlamydospores piled around the false smut balls grown on XBZ medium; moreover the sclerotia consisting of dense mycelium were found. The different morphology was observed across the different growing conditions. In addition, we observed the nuclear numbers of both the conidiospores and hyphae using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Because the fungus has small chromosomes and the numbers were not previously known, we analyzed the electrophoretic karyotype using a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) technique. The results showed that V. virens has at least 10 chromosomes ranging in size from 0.6 kb to 6 Mb. The V. virens genome size is estimated to be 23 Mb. Here, we report the morphological characteristics of the fungus and the process of asexual spores forming asexual propagules, along with the first analyze the molecular karyotype of V. virens. These results supply a foundation for further study of the pathogenicity and biology of this devastating pathogen.

Among the three oligosaccharides, the crude oligosaccharide prepared by acid hydrolysis of WEP was found to be the most efficient elicitor to enhance the production of palmarumycins C-12 and C-13 in liquid culture of endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12. When OW was applied to the medium at 300 mg/L on day 3 of culture, the maximal yields of palmarumycin C-12 (87.96 mg/L) and palmarumycin C-13 (422.28 mg/L) were achieved on day 15 of culture, which were 9.83 and3.24-fold in comparison with those (8.95 and 130.43 mg/L) of control, respectively. The results indicate that addition of the oligosaccharides from the host plant D. zingiberensis should be an effective strategy for enhancing production of palmarumycins C-12 and C-13 in liquid culture of endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp.

Germplasm Based on Gliadin Analysis	MOLECULES			English	Article						Elymus sibiricus; genetic diversity; cluster analysis; gladin markers	SEED STORAGE PROTEINS; POPULATION-SIZE; MATING SYSTEM; RAPD MARKERS; VARIABILITY; TAXONOMY; SINENSIS; PLATEAU; POACEAE	E. sibiricus L., the type species of the genus Elymus, is a perennial, self-pollinating and allotetraploid grass indigenous to Northern Asia, which in some countries can be cultivated as an important forage grass. In the present study, eighty-six Elymus sibiricus accessions, mostly from different parts of Asia, were assayed by gliadin markers based on Acid Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis to differentiate and explore their genetic relationships. The genetic similarity matrix was calculated by 47 polymorphic bands, which ranged from 0.108 to 0.952 with an average of 0.373. The total Shannon diversity index (H-o) and the Simpson index (H-e) was 0.460 and 0.302, respectively. Cluster analysis showed a clear demarcation between accessions from Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China and the others as separate groups. The clustering pattern was probably dependent on geographic origin and ecological adaptability of the accessions. The population structure analysis based on Shannon indices showed that the proportion of variance within and among the five geographic regions of the Northern Hemisphere was 55.9 and 44.1%, respectively, or 63.4 and 36.6% within and among six Chinese provinces. This distinct geographical divergence was perhaps depended on ecogeographical conditions such as climate difference and mountain distribution. The results of gladin analysis in this study are useful for the collection and preservation of E. sibiricus germplasm resources.

The acaricidal bioassay was conducted using a dipping method. The results indicated that the median lethal concentration (LC50) of the petroleum ether extract (at the concentration of 500.0 ml/l) was 70.9 ml/l, 24 h after treatment. At concentrations of 500.0, 250.0, 125.0, 62.5 and 31.2 ml/l, the median lethal times (LT50) of the petroleum ether extract were 8.7, 8.8, 10.8, 11.5 and 13.1 h, respectively. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) showed that the petroleum ether extract of neem oil separated into four fractions (F1-F4). Acaricidal activity of 68.3% and 100.0% in the F2 and F4 was confirmed. These results suggest that petroleum ether extracts of neem oil and its four fractions possess useful acaricidal activity in vitro. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The morphology and structure of the prepared SnO2-Pt/CNTs nanocatalyst are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. In addition, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-atom emission spectroscopy results prove the presence of Pt and SnO2 nanoparticles on CNTs surface with the molar ratio of Pt:SnO2 in SnO2-Pt/CNTs as 0.48. In comparison with the commercial Pt/C, SnO2-Pt/CNTs nanocatalyst exhibits higher electrocatalytic mass activity and better long-term cycle stability for methanol oxidation.

The vitrified embryos were warmed and introduced into M16 medium for culture that contains melatonin at different concentrations (10-3, 10-5, 10-7, 10-9, 10-11 m). This process caused reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and jeopardized the development of the embryos. Melatonin, at different concentrations, significantly suppresses ROS production and promotes embryonic development in vitrified embryos compared with untreated ones. The mechanistic studies indicated that the beneficial effects of melatonin on vitrified 2-cell embryos of mouse were melatonin receptor (MT1 and MT2) independent. The direct free radical scavenging activity, the enhancement of endogenous glutathione levels, and the anti-apoptotic capacity of melatonin may account for its protective effects on vitrified embryonic development.

G. Don is a plant species known for its production of a variety of terpenoid indole alkaloids, many of which have pharmacological activities. Catharanthine can be chemically coupled to the abundant leaf alkaloid vindoline to form the valuable anticancer drug vinblastine. To study and extract catharanthine and other metabolites from C. roseus, a technique was developed for producing hairy root cultures. In this study, the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 was induced in the hairy roots from leaf explants, and the concentration of antibiotics (100 mg/L kanamycin) was elucidated for selection after transformation. The polymerase chain reaction amplification of rol genes results revealed that transgenic hairy roots contained rol genes from the root induced (Ri)-plasmid. Catharanthine from C. roseus hairy roots was separated and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Over-expression of CrOrca3 (octadecanoid-responsive Catharanthus AP2/ERF domain), and cytohistochemical staining methods were used to validate transgenic hairy roots from C. roseus. Hairy root culture of C. roseus is a valuable approach for future efforts in the metabolic engineering of terpenoid indole alkaloids in plants.

The four species T. turgidum L., T. polonicum L., T. turanicum Jakubz. and T. zhukovskyi Men. et Er. were firstly discovered with expressed 1Ay subunit. The distribution frequencies for diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats were at 87.89, 20.31 and 1.79%, respectively. Among the observed eight 1Ay alleles, three with the electrophoretic mobilities similar to 1Bx6, 1By8, and between 1By8 and 1Dy10 were firstly observed. Five had the mobilities similar to 1Bx6, 1Bx7, 1By8, 1Dy10, and 1Dy12 in Glu-1B and Glu-1D loci of hexaploid wheat. It is very difficult to distinguish these 1Ay alleles in Glu-1Ay from those in hexaploid wheat. The predominant 1Ay alleles were those with the mobilities similar to 1Bx7, 1By8, 1Dy10 and 1Dy12, and faster than 1Dy12. Comparison results of 1Ay alleles in different species indicated that multiple diploid lines were involved in the evolution process of tetraploid wheat. The 1Ay allelic variations and genetic resources might be useful in the quality improvement of common wheat.

In this study, pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of P incorporation on P accumulation and physiological mechanisms of Polygonum hydropiper in a mining ecotype (ME) and nonmining ecotype (NME) from a phosphorus mining and a noncontaminated agricultural area, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ME of P. hydropiper growing in soil supplied with 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 mg P (kg soil)1 showed a significantly higher biomass compared to the NME. Phosphorus accumulation of the ME was positively correlated with the soil P concentration. APase activity in roots of the ME significantly increased at 1600 mg P (kg soil)1 and phytase activity of the ME increased with increasing P supply. APase activity of the ME was more than twice that of the NME on average. A significant increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was observed compared with the NME at all supplied P levels. Peroxidase (POD) activity of the ME was significantly higher at 200 and 400 mg P (kg soil)1. No statistical differences in the catalase (CAT) activity of the ME were observed compared with the control. Activity of CAT in the NME was obviously induced after exposure to 100800 mg P (kg soil)1. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in leaves of the ME decreased with increasing P supply to reach a minimum at 400 mg P (kg soil)1. In the NME, an increase in MDA concentration compared to the control was observed at higher P levels. The APase and phytase induction and antioxidative defense allowed for the high P accumulation of the ME.

Those soils did not receive organic fertilizer input, but did receive chemical fertilizer inputs. Thus, to investigate the hypothesis that the observed SOC increases were driven by chemical fertilizer additions, a maize pot experiment was conducted using a Fluvisol that developed under C-3 vegetation in the Yellow River reaches. Methods Using the natural C-13 abundance method we calculated the SOC renewal ratio (C-renewal), and separated total soil organic carbon (TOC) into maize-derived soil organic carbon (SOCmaize) and original soil organic carbon (SOCoriginal). Carbon dioxide fluxes and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were determined by closed chamber method and fumigation-extraction method, respectively. The experiment included five treatments: (1) NPK: application of chemical fertilizer NPK; (2) NP, application of chemical fertilizer NP; (3) PK: application of chemical fertilizer PK; (4) NK, application of chemical fertilizer NK; and (5) CK: unfertilized control. Results Fertilization increased maize biomass (including grain, straw and root), TOC, C-renewal, SOCmaize, maize-derived carbon (MDC: including SOCmaize, and root and stubble biomass carbon) and MBC, and these values among the treatments ranked NPK>NP>PK>NK>CK. The C-renewal was 5.548.50% across the treatments. Fertilization also increased soil CO2 emission (including root respiration and SOCoriginal decomposition), while the SOCoriginal decomposition during the maize growing season only amounted to 74.0-93.4 and 33.5-46.1% of SOCmaize and MDC among the treatments, respectively. Thus input was larger than export, and led to SOC increase. Maize grain and straw biomass were positively and significantly correlated with soil delta C-13, TOC, C-renewal, SOCmaize, MDC and MBC. Conclusions The study suggests that chemical fertilizer application could increase C-renewal by increasing crop-derived C and accelerating original SOC decomposition, and that as long as a certain level of crop yield or aboveground biomass can be achieved, application of chemical fertilizer alone can maintain or increase SOC level in Fluvisol in the Yellow River reaches.

In the present study, the alleviative effect of a common antioxidant flavonoid quercetin on mouse germ cells intoxicated by PNMC was investigated. Results showed that a single intraperitoneal injection of PNMC at 100 mg/kg induced severe testicular damage after one week. PNMC-treated mice showed a significant loss of germ cells (approximate 40% loss of round germ cells). PNMC caused an increase of hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide production and lipid peroxidation, as well as a decrease in glutathione level, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Furthermore, treatment of PNMC increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in germ cells. In addition, testicular caspase-3 activity was significantly up-regulated and germ cell apoptosis was significantly increased in the PNMC-treated mice. In contrast, combined administration of quercetin at 75 mg/kg significantly attenuated PNMC-induced testicular toxicity. These results indicate that the antioxidant quercetin displays a remarkable protective effect on PNMC-induced oxidative damage in mouse testes and may represent an efficient supplement to attenuate reproductive toxicity by environmental toxicants to ensure healthy sperm production.

These attributes are of major agronomic importance as they determine the adaptability of a plant to various methods of cultivation, which in turn influence harvest index and grain yield. We detected a recessive mutant from the aromatic cultivar Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDM105), which exhibits a plant architecture with shorter height, shorter and more erect leaves and panicle than the wild type. The mutant line was named ser for short and erect rice. The ser mutation was induced by 30 kilorads of gamma radiation. Averaged from 10 mature plants grown in the greenhouse, the ser had 104.6 degrees smaller angle between the flag leaf and culm, compared with the KDM105 wild type. For the leaf below the flag leaf, the ser mutant was 46.2 degrees more erect than the wild type. The length of the flag, 2nd and 3rd leaf of the ser was 21.8, 24.4 and 16.3 cm shorter than the wild type, respectively. Plant height as measured from soil surface to flag leaf tip was reduced by 43.5 cm, while plant height measured from soil to panicle tip was reduced by 28.5 cm in the ser in comparison with the wild type. Characterization of 10 booting plants each of the ser, wild and their reciprocal F1 populations confirmed the shortening mutation with no cytoplasmic effect. The ser was identically monomorphic to its wild type and F1 hybrid for all 11 SSR markers covering seven chromosomes, indicating a true mutation. In the F2 generation, a ratio of three wild type to one ser was observed, resulting in a chi(2) of 0.067 (P = 0.795) for a single gene segregation and demonstrating a recessive mutation. The ser will be an ideal material for the study on gene pleiotropy and metabolism functions. Further, the pleiotropic gene in such a premium quality cultivar globally known will be valuable for improving plant architecture in rice cultivars.

Dzf12 by the polysaccharides from its host plant Dioscorea zingiberensis which serve as elicitors. Three polysaccharides, namely water-extracted polysaccharide (WEP), sodium hydroxide-extracted polysaccharide and acid-extracted polysaccharide were sequentially prepared from the rhizomes of D. zingiberensis. Among them, WEP was found to be the most effective elicitor to enhance diepoxin zeta production. When WEP was added to the medium at 400 mg l(-1) on day 3 of culture, the maximal diepoxin zeta yield (intracellular diepoxin zeta in mycelia plus extracellular diepoxin zeta in medium) of 350.76 mg l(-1) on day 15 was achieved, which was about 2.69-fold in comparison with that (130.43 mg l(-1)) of the control.

Jian) (8.76 +/- 0.02 g) were fed diets containing graded levels of histidine at 2.3 (unsupplemented control), 4.4, 6.3, 8.6, 10.8 and 12.7 g kg-1 diet for 60 days to investigate the effects of histidine levels on growth performance, body composition, intestinal enzymes activities and microflora. Specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, protein productive value, body protein content and lipid content of fish were lowest in fish fed the basal diet (P < 0.05). Activities of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in muscle and hepatopancreas, trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, lipase activities in intestine and hepatopancreas, and Na+, K+-ATPase, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities in three intestinal segments were improved by dietary histidine (P < 0.05), whereas glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase activities and plasma ammonia content followed an opposite trend. The amounts of Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas were significantly affected by dietary histidine levels (P < 0.05). These results suggested that histidine could improve growth and enhance intestinal enzymes activities of juvenile Jian carp. The dietary histidine requirement of juvenile Jian carp (8.7668.02 g) based on SGR was 7.8 g kg-1 diet or 2.38 g 100 g-1 protein by quadratic regression analysis.

Karyotype analysis showed that Fagopyrum wenchuanense, F. qiangcai and F. pugense are diploid (2n = 2x = 16) while F. crispatofolium is tetraploid (2n = 4x = 32). The karyotype evolutionary trend of buckwheat indicated that F. crispatofolium, F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes seemed to be more advanced than F. wenchuanense, F. qiangcai, F. pugense, F. esculentum, F. cymosum and F. tataricumare. Three polymorphic enzyme systems were used for the examination of variation, including peroxidase, esterase and superoxide dismutase. Consistent banding patterns were obtained for esterase and superoxide dismutase, while peroxidase produced a large number of sharp bands. A total of 18 ISSR primers were selected for the analysis and showed high variations among the species. Allozymes and ISSR markers were utilized to estimate the genetic distance among accessions and to draw phylogenetic trees. Our data provide evidence of a high degree of genetic diversity among southwestern Sichuan buckwheats. In addition, both cultivars and wild types showed a high degree of divergence suggesting a complex domestication process in this crop. This study provides a better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms and genetic relationships in four new species of buckwheat.

A total of 420 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into 6 groups in which there were 7 replicates in each group and 10 broilers in each replicate and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet (vanadium 0.073 mg/kg) or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3). Ultrastructurally, mitochondrial injury and increased numbers of apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were observed in the 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg groups. As measured by flow cytometry, the percentages of apoptotic lymphocytes were significantly increased in the 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-mg/kg groups when compared with those of control group. Meanwhile, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick end-labeling assay showed that there were increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the 30-, 45-, and 60-mg/kg groups. Immunohistochemical tests showed increased numbers of positive cells under Bax and caspase-3 protein detection and decreased Bcl-2 protein in the 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-mg/kg groups. The vanadium content of the bursa was found to be significantly increased in the 30-, 45-, and 60-mg/kg groups. These results suggested that dietary vanadium in excess of 15 mg/kg could cause lymphocyte apoptosis in the bursa of Fabricius and impact humoral immunity in broilers. Lymphocyte apoptosis in the bursa induced by high levels of dietary vanadium is associated with mitochondrial injury and changes in levels of apoptogenic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3.

The deduced amino acid sequence showed three histidine boxes characteristic of all membrane-bound desaturase and a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CtFAD2-1 is grouped with other plant FAD2 sequences which are specifically or highly expressed in developing seeds. Functional expression of the corresponding CtFAD2-1 cDNA in yeast confirmed that it encodes a microsomal oleate desaturase, partially converting oleic fatty acid to linoleic fatty acid. Our transcriptional analysis suggested that CtFAD2-1 is constitutively expressed, with maximum transcript accumulation, in developing seeds. The sequence of this microsomal oleate desaturase gene was also obtained from high oleic safflower genotypes, CtFAD2-1'. The comparison between the coding regions of CtFAD2-1 and CtFAD2-1' revealed that a deletion of cytosine (C) exists at the position +603 bp of CtFAD2-1'. Analysis of transcript level showed that the expression of CtFAD2-1' in high oleic acid genotype is significantly lower than that in normal genotypes during seed development. These results suggested that the change of CtFAD2-1' gene sequence results in the deactivation and lower transcription of delta-12 fatty acid desaturase in high oleic safflower genotypes.

With the help of this assay, we can detect Salmonella enterica serovar Enteriditis and Salmonella enterica serovar Anatis above 6.0 cfu/test and 4.8 cfu/test, respectively, in pure-culture conditions, even in the existence of 0.01 g of duck liver or spleen homogenates; the detection thresholds were still achieved at 6.0 cfu per test tube. Further experiments of the test strains indicated the high specificity of this LAMP assay. In the detection of clinical specimens, a total of 115 Salmonella suspect infected clinical samples was analyzed by traditional culture method, LAMP, and PCR. The results suggested that 11 samples were positive by LAMP and culture methods; however, only 8 specimens were positive by PCR. In consideration of the high sensitivity and fast scanning speed of our LAMP method in clinical specimens, it was more suitable for field application and epidemiological investigation.

J	Liu, X; Ye, M; Pu, B; Tang, Z				Liu, Xuan; Ye, Meng; Pu, Biao; Tang, Zhikang			Risk management for jatropha curcas based biodiesel industry of Panzhihua Prefecture in Southwest China	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Risk management; Jatropha biodiesel industry; Panzhihua; China		As one of the most important regions selected for jatropha biodiesel industry in Southwest China, Panzhihua has received very high and optimistic expectations. However, current situation suggests that jatropha in Panzhihua has not changed local energy scenario and the industry has been threatened by many risks. Moreover, the study of risk management on jatropha biodiesel industry is largely absent. Therefore, this study applies the idea of risk management to jatropha biodiesel industry in Panzhihua, covering complete procedures with respect to risk identification, risk assessment, risk response and risk monitoring. By risk identification, this study reveals 14 key risks which have critical influences upon this industry. The risk assessment determines the risks which are ranked as the first status to take risk response: risks of low seed yield, insect pests and diseases, poor implementation for the plans set for establishing jatropha biodiesel refining capacity, low profitability for jatropha biodiesel production, no local gas station selling jatropha biodiesel, low comparative price of biodiesel versus diesel, insufficient subsidy for farmers to conduct cultivation, insufficient subsidy for conducting biodiesel production. Accordingly, the measures for risk reduction have been given. It is a very long way to cover before the jatropha biodiesel to be realized in Panzhihua. The urgent tasks for the local governments in Panzhihua are just to maintain but adjust their ambitious plans, enhance the demonstration effects of industrial projects at an appropriate and economic scale.

In this study, we clarified ways and areas of the over-summering of this fungus, and provided information for control of the disease in Sichuan Province. We observed cleistothecial survival under a variety of different storage conditions both indoors and outdoors. Cleistothecia in humid conditions completely died by mid-July; those in dry conditions maintained a 40% survival rate into the autumn. Cleistothecia were not only able to survive until fall, but also to produce ascospores as initial inoculums for autumn-sown wheat Field inoculation experiments using ascospores and conidia at different altitudes in Ya'an, Yibin, and Bazhong demonstrated that B. graminis f. sp. tritici is able to over-summer at an altitude of 595 m and above in Sichuan Province. Volunteer wheat plants are abundant in these areas. Through systematic monitoring, volunteer wheat plants were found to be heavily infected during the summer months, providing an inoculation bridge to the fall planting season. The type of crops following wheat also had an important influence on the over-summering of the fungus: high-shade corn was more favorable to volunteer wheat survival and the occurrence of powdery mildew than short-shade soybeans. The most effective strategy for reducing inoculation would be to eliminate the remaining wheat straws and the volunteer wheat before fall seeding. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we quantified the expression of calpain-3 (CAPN3) mRNA in a Chinese local chicken breed (Sichuan Mountainous Black-boned chicken [MB]), to discern the tissue and ontogenic expression pattern. Meanwhile, we compared the CAPN3 mRNA expression pattern in MB chicken at 10 weeks with a commercial meat type chicken line (S01) of the same age to identify the unique expression pattern under different genetic background. A real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was developed for an accurate measurement of its expression in various tissues from chickens at different ages (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks). Expression of the CAPN3 mRNA was detected in the selected tissues, regardless of age. The breast muscle and leg muscle tissues had a significantly higher expression than the other tissues from the same individual (P < 0.01). Overall, the CAPN3 mRNA level exhibited a "rise-decline" developmental change in detected tissues except for brain. The S01 chicken had a higher expression of the CAPN3 mRNA in detected tissues than the MB chicken at 10 weeks. The present expression data of chicken CAPN3 gene may provide some information to shed light on the tissue and ontogenic expression pattern during chicken development.

Peripheral blood serves as an important producer and carrier of viruses and cytokines in NDV infection. In order to explore the difference of cytokine expression in the peripheral blood between velogenic strain and lentogenic strain infection, NDV virulent strain F48E9 and vaccine strain Lasota were used to infect specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens separately, and peripheral blood was collected on 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days post-infection (d.p.i.). Real-time PCR was then used to detect the expression of six kinds of immune-related cytokine genes. For the F48E9 group, a sharp increase of the expression of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-16 and IL-18 was observed on 3 d.p.i. before the NDV blood peak (7 d.p.i.), followed by a rapid decline to the level lower than that of control group, then the expression of IFN-alpha increased slowly and reached or exceeded the level of control group in the later phase of the infection, while the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-16, and IL-18 fluctuated at the level of control group for the rest of study period. The increase of IL-2 expression was not obvious, and no increase of IL-15 expression was noted. For the Lasota (vaccine) group, the picture was quite different, a sharp increase of IFN-gamma (but not IFN-alpha), IL-2 was observed on 7 d.p.i. before the NDV blood peak (10 d.p.i.). On the contrary, there was no dramatic increase of IL-16 and IL-18. Interestingly, in contrast to the F48E9 group, there was an increase of IL-15 on day 10 d.p.i., but it remained modest. There was also an increase of IFN-alpha on day 21 d.p.i. Our results revealed that infection with NDV strains of different virulence was associated with distinct cytokine expression patterns in peripheral blood, modulation of cytokine responses may play a key role in mediation of NDV pathogenesis.

Predicted global warming therefore could have profound impacts on these ecosystems in the future. This study was conducted to compare effects of experimental warming on the phenology, growth and photosynthesis of dragon spruce seedlings of two age classes (2- and 8-year-old seedlings) grown in two contrasting subalpine forest ecosystems (dragon spruce plantation versus spruce-fir dominated natural forest) using the open top chamber (OTC) method in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. The OTCs enhanced daily mean air (30 cm above the soil surface) and soil temperatures (5 cm below the soil surface) by 1.2 degrees C and by 0.6 degrees C in two experimental sites, respectively, throughout the growing season. Conversely, soil volumetric moisture declined by 3.8% and 2.8% in the plantation and natural forest. Experimental warming markedly extended the growing season of two age classes in both sites. However, there were no clear differences in phenology between ages or sites. Warming often increased the growth and photosynthesis of dragon spruce seedlings. There were pronounced differences in the morphological and physiological performances between ages or sites. Nevertheless, there were no significant interactions of warming, age and site on phenology, growth and photosynthesis. Irrespective of seedling ages or experimental sites, artificial warming had significant increases in component biomass except the root. The size of warming effect on biomass depended strongly on seedling age and experimental site. Elevated temperatures remarkably increased net N mineralization rates and extractable inorganic N pools in both sites. Both net N mineralization and extractable inorganic N pool were pronouncedly greater in the natural forest than in the plantation. Taken together, our results indicate that warming generally has positive effects on the phenology, growth and photosynthesis for both seedling age classes in any site. Younger seedlings are more sensitive to warming as compared with the older seedlings. Reforestation dramatically affects the responses of soil N turnover and availability to warming. We conclude that both direct and indirect warming effects synchronously modify the seedling responses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cytolytic delta-endotoxin (Cyt) also has high toxicity to dipteran larvae and synergism with other crystal proteins (Cry), but synergism between Cyt and Vip3 proteins has not been tested. We analyzed for synergism between Cyt2Aa3 and Vip3Aa29. Both cyt2Aa3 and vip3Aa29 genes were co-expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 carried on vector pCOLADuet-1. Vip3Aa29 showed insecticidal activity against Chilo suppressalis and Spodoptera exigua, with 50% lethal concentration (LC50) at 24.0 and 36.6 mu g ml(-1), respectively. It could also inhibit Helicoverpa armigera growth, with 50% inhibition concentration at 22.6 mu g ml(-1). While Cyt2Aa3 was toxic to Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50: 0.53 mu g ml(-1)) and Chironomus tepperi (LC50: 36 mu g ml(-1)), it did not inhibit C. suppressalis, S. exigua, and H. armigera. However, the co-expression of Cyt2Aa3 and Vip3Aa29 showed synergistic effect on C. suppressalis and S. exigua, and the individual activities were strengthened 3.35- and 4.34-fold, respectively. The co-expression had no synergism against C. tepperi and H. armigera, but exerted some antagonistic effect on Cx. quinquefasciatus. The synergism between Cyt2Aa and Vip3Aa was thus discovered for the first time, which confirmed that Cyt toxin can enhance the toxicity of other toxins against some non-target insects. By synergism analysis, the effectiveness of microbial insecticides can be verified.

In addition, expression of two important myogenic transcription factors MyoD and Myf5 were detected and compared in the two types of muscle tissues. Results indicated that IGF-1 administration increased the duck body weight, MFD, CSA, MFN, and quantity of activated satellite cells and mitotic nuclei in the two types of muscle tissues. The MyoD and Myf5 expressed at a higher level in IGF-1-treated muscle. IGF-1 stimulated muscle weight growth more in the leg muscle than in the breast muscle. These results indicate that in ovo feeding of IGF-1 can stimulate duck growth and, especially, lead to increased muscle hypertrophy. These increases appear to be mainly dependent on the activation of satellite cells, some of which proliferate and fuse to the myofiber, enabling increased muscle mass. IGF-1 can indirectly affect satellite cells by regulating the expression of two important myogenic transcription factors, MyoD and Myf5, which help activate satellite cells. J. Cell.

This paper attempted to evaluate the relationships among Chinese economy, energy and its impact of emissions during 1991-2009 using several novel indicators based on emergy, energy and monetary units. The results show that NH3-N in wastewater has taken main responsibility for impact of emissions, the hidden environmental cost per unit economic output has been continuously reduced, education and R & D investment has cut pollutants generating intensity since 1997, and environmental protection investment has cut emission intensity since 1996. Generally speaking, the coordination degree of structure and scale of China's economy has been improved to different degree from 1991 to 2009. However, the growth of education and R & D investment and environmental protection investment has not prevented impact of emissions from increase caused by economic aggregate growth, and the turning point has not appeared in this period. Finally, this paper discusses some related issues and puts forward the corresponding suggestions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we examined the evolution of short pentraxins in Murinae lineages. By molecular evolutionary analysis, CRP and SAP have been experiencing rapid diversification, driven by adaptive selection. Further, our protein modeling demonstrates that adaptively selected amino acids lie in the ligand-binding region and contact region between subunits. Our findings suggest that rapid diversification of these regions could contribute to the determinants of recognizing specificity and the interaction between subunits.

However, the obvious difference of the dedifferentiation frequency of immature maize embryo among various genotypes indicates that its genetic transformation is dependence on genotype and immature embryo-derived undifferentiated cells. To identify important genes and metabolic pathways involved in forming of embryo-derived embryonic calli, in this study, DGE (differential gene expression) analysis was performed on stages I, II, and III of maize inbred line 18-599R and corresponding control during the process of immature embryo dedifferentiation. A total of similar to 21 million cDNA tags were sequenced, and 4,849,453, 5,076,030, 4,931,339, and 5,130,573 clean tags were obtained in the libraries of the samples and the control, respectively. In comparison with the control, 251, 324 and 313 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the three stages with more than five folds, respectively. Interestingly, it is revealed that all the DEGs are related to metabolism, cellular process, and signaling and information storage and processing functions. Particularly, the genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and signal transduction mechanism have been significantly changed during the dedifferentiation. To our best knowledge, this study is the first genome-wide effort to investigate the transcriptional changes in dedifferentiation immature maize embryos and the identified DEGs can serve as a basis for further functional characterization.

The vibrational spectra of tantalum cluster cations are simulated with one empirical scaling factor of 0.943, and compared to the experimental ones [P. Gruene, A. Fielicke, G. Meijer, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 234307 (2007)]. By assigning the vibrational peaks of experimental spectra, the favored geometries actually existing in the molecular beam are obtained for several studied clusters. Based on the favored geometries, the relative stabilities, spin magnetic moments, and electronic dipole moments are determined. Furthermore, spin-related indices (omega(+/-)(s)) are computed and found to be good linear correlation with vertical lower-upper energy gap. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Firstly, the embryos at 8 to 16-cell stages were exposed to different concentrations (1 to 4 mol/L) of DMSO, Gly, MeOH, EG, PG and DMF for 40min at 26 degrees C. After removal of the cryoprotectants (CPAs), the embryo survivals were assessed by their development into live fries following 9 day of culture. The results showed that the higher concentration of the CPA, the lower survival of the embryos; and that the toxicity of the six CPAs to medaka embryos is in the order of PG < MeOH = DMSO < Gly < EG < DMF (P<0.05). Secondly, based on the results obtained above, embryos at 8 to 16-cell stages or other stages were exposed to 2 mol/L of PG, MeOH or DMSO for up to 180 min at 0 degrees C and up to 80 min at -5 degrees C respectively. The 8 to 16-cell embryos treated with MeOH at low temperatures showed highest survival. Thirdly, when embryos at different stages were treated with 2 mol/L of MeOH at -5 degrees C for 60 min, 16-somite stage embryos showed highest survival, followed by 4-somite, neurula, 50% epiboly, blastula, 32-cell and 8 to 16-cell embryos. These results demonstrated that PG had the lowest toxicity to medaka embryos among the six permeable CPAs at 26 degrees C, whereas MeOH showed highest cryoprotective efficiency under chilling conditions and chilling injury decreased gradually with the development of medaka embryos.

Here we present the effect of application of ethephon (an ethylene-releasing compound) on the production of monoterpenes and induction of oxidative stress in Houttuynia cordata Thunb., a medicinal and aromatic herb rich in monoterpenes. H. cordata showed two peaks of total monoterpene content at 0.1 and 100 mM ethephon applications, after treatment with different concentrations of ethephon. However, high dose of ethephon (100 mM) also led to oxidative damage, as shown by increase in H2O2, malondialdehyde and antioxidative enzyme activities. Monoterpene accumulation at 100 mM ethephon is accompanied by oxidative stress and, hence, adverse to H. cordata, while 0.1 mM ethephon application is the most appropriate for enhanced monoterpene production.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, it is predominantly associated with resistance against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, and triggering systemic acquired resistance. In contrast, the effect of SA on the defence efficiency of wheat against fusarium head blight (FHB) and its causal agent, Fusarium graminearum, is still poorly understood. Here we show that the F. graminearum mycelial growth and conidia germination were significantly inhibited, and eventually halted in the presence of increasing concentration of SA in both liquid and solid media. Addition of SA also significantly reduced the production of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). However the inhibitory effect of SA required acidic growth conditions to be observed while basic conditions allowed F. graminearum to use SA as a carbon source. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis confirmed the capacity of F. graminearum to metabolize SA. To better understand the effect of SA on F. graminearum mycelial growth, we have compared the expression profiles of SA-treated and untreated F. graminearum liquid cultures after 8 and 24 h of treatment, using an F. graminearum custom-commercial microarray. The microarray analysis suggested that F. graminearum can metabolize SA through either the catechol or gentisate pathways that are present in some fungal species. Inoculation of F. graminearum conidia in a SA-containing solution has led to reduced FHB symptoms in the very susceptible Triticum aestivum cv. Roblin. In contrast, no inhibition was observed when SA and conidia were inoculated sequentially. The expression patterns for the wheat PR1, NPR1, Pdf1.2, and PR4 genes, a group of indicator genes for the defence response, suggested that SA-induced resistance contributed little to the reduction of symptoms in our assay conditions. Our results demonstrate that, although F. graminearum has the capacity to metabolize SA, SA has a significant and direct impact on F. graminearum through a reduction in efficiency of germination and growth at higher concentrations.

Growth and photosynthetic responses of four landscape shrub species to elevated ozone	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						biomass; Chionanthus retusus Lindl. & Paxt.; chlorophyll a fluorescence; Cornus alba; Euonymus bungeanus; gas exchange; ozone; Photinia x fraseri	CHLOROPHYLL-A FLUORESCENCE; GAS-EXCHANGE; VISIBLE SYMPTOMS; URBAN TREES; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; PLANTS; AIR; SENSITIVITY; LEAVES	Attention should be paid to ozone (O-3) sensitivity of greening plant since ground-level O-3 concentrations are increasing especially in urban and suburban area. We studied the ecophysiological responses to elevated O-3 of four shrub species [Euonymus bungeanus Maxim. (EB), Photinia x fraseri (PF), Chionanthus retusus Lindl. & Paxt. (CR) and Cornus alba L. (CA)], which are often used for garden greening in China. Saplings of those species were exposed to high O-3 concentration (70 nmol mol(-1), 7 h d(-1) for 65 d) in open-top growth chambers. Responses to O-3 were assessed by gas exchanges, chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence and dry mass. We found that elevated O-3 significantly decreased lightsaturated net photosynthetic rate (P (Nsat)), transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (g (s)). The ratio of intercellular CO2 to ambient CO2 concentration (C (i)/C (a)) did not reduce under O-3 fumigation which suggested that the O-3-induced depressions of P (Nsat) under O-3 fumigation were probably due to limitation of mesophyll processes rather than stomatal limitation. High O-3 exposure also significantly depressed the maximum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry in the dark-adapted state (F-v/F-m) which meant the O3-induced photoinhibition. Both root dry mass and root/shoot ratios were significantly decreased under ozone fumigation, but the total mass was unchanged. The responses of gas exchange such as P (Nsat) in these four shrubs to O-3 exposure were species-specific. Highest loss of P (Nsat) was observed in EB (-49.6%), while the CR had the lowest loss (-36.5%). Moreover, the O-3-exposed CR showed similar g (s) as CF, reflecting that its O-3 flux might be unchanged under elevated O-3 environment. Ozone drastically decreased actual quantum yield of PSII (I broken vertical bar(PSII)) and electron transport rate (ETR) in EB while increased I broken vertical bar(PSII) and ETR in CR. Furthermore, the relative losses in P (Nsat) positively correlated with the relative decreases in I broken vertical bar(PSII) and ETR which indicated that the impairment of photosynthesis was probably affected by the light reaction process. The light reaction of EB was impaired most seriously but that of CR was not damaged. All results indicated that EB was probably the most sensitive shrub species to O-3 while CR the most tolerant one. Therefore, CR might be an ideal choice for greening in ozone-polluted areas.	[Zhang, L.; Xu, H.; Li, Y.

Due to its unique characteristics, such as small body size, high brain-to-body mass ratio, short reproductive cycle and life span, and low-cost of maintenance, tree shrew has been proposed to be an alternative experimental animal to primates in biomedical research. However, there are some debates regarding the exact phylogenetic affinity of tree shrew to primates. In this study, we determined the mtDNA entire genomes of three Chinese tree shrews (T. belangeri chinensis) and one Malayan flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus). Combined with the published data for species in Euarchonta, we intended to discern the phylogenetic relationship among representative species of Dermoptera, Scandentia and Primates. The mtDNA genomes of Chinese tree shrews and Malayan flying lemur shared similar gene organization and structure with those of other mammals. Phylogenetic analysis based on 12 concatenated mitochondrial protein-encoding genes revealed a closer relationship between species of Scandentia and Glires, whereas species of Dermoptera were clustered with Primates. This pattern was consistent with previously reported phylogeny based on mtDNA data, but differed from the one reconstructed on the basis of nuclear genes. Our result suggested that the matrilineal affinity of tree shrew to primates may not be as close as we had thought. The ongoing project for sequencing the entire genome of Chinese tree shrew will provide more information to clarify this important issue.

To improve the production of rutin in buckwheat, we overexpressed the flavonol-specific transcription factor, AtMYB12 using Agrobacterium rhizogenes into hairy root culture systems. This induced the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, flavone 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, and flavonol synthase. This led to the accumulation of rutin in buckwheat hairy roots up to 0.9 mg/g dry wt. PAP1 expression, however, did not correlate with the production of rutin.

This study was conducted to estimate the changes in SOC fractions in the topsoil of croplands, horticultural plots and afforestation areas from degraded lands in the Liusha River Valley, Sichuan. The cover and shoot biomass of plants, soil thickness and bulk density in the restored lands differed significantly from those of the degraded lands (P < 0.05). When compared with the degraded lands, the concentrations of SOC fractions in restored lands were substantially enhanced (P < 0.05). Among the three restoration classes, the concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), dichromate oxidizable carbon, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) and water-soluble carbon (WSOC) were higher in the croplands and afforestation areas than in the horticultural plots (P < 0.05), while the humic carbon and humic acid carbon (HAC) were higher in the afforestation areas than in the horticultural plots (P < 0.05). The SOC fraction concentrations displayed significant relationships with the cover and shoot biomass of plants, elevation, soil thickness and bulk density (P < 0.05), except that WSOC showed no relationship with elevation (P > 0.05). Additionally, POXC, WSOC and HAC represented 14.62-16.17, 0.91-1.15 and 7.73-8.66% of the TOC of the restored soils, respectively, and improved significantly during the restoration process. Therefore, these fractions can be considered indicators of changes in restoration-induced soil quality and sensitivity to environmental factors and restoration practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Inter and intra chromosome connections were observed in 12 root-tip cells of CA4.4.7 (S-2 generation), and translocations between wheat and rye chromosomes were also detected in five root-tip cells. In root-tip cells of CA4.4.7.5 and CA4.4.7.2.2 (S-3 and S-4 generation), the chromosome connections occurred again, a dissociative small rye segment was detected in seven cells of CA4.4.7.5. In plants MSV6.1 and MSV6.5 (S-1 generation), almost half of the root-tip cells contained 13 rye chromosomes and the rest held 12 rye chromosomes, and all the cells of the two plants contained 42 wheat chromosomes. Five pairing configurations of rye chromosomes, including 5 II + 3 I, 6 II + 1 I, 6 II, 5 II + 2 I and 4 II + 4 I, were observed in pollen mother cells of the two plants. The two plants' progeny, including S-2, S-3, and S-4 generation plants, contained 42 wheat chromosomes and 12 rye chromosomes. Therefore, the inter chromosome translocation and unequal chromosome division could occur in somatic cells of wide hybrids. The unequal chromosome division in somatic cell could induce chromosome elimination at the early stages of allopolyploidization.

The polymorphism of CAG triplet repeat (polyCAG), in the N-terminal transactivation domain of the AR protein, has been involved either in endocrine or neurological disorders in human. We obtained partial sequence of AR exon 1 in 10 carnivore species. In most carnivore species, polyglutamine length polymorphism presented in all three CAG repeat regions of AR, in contrast, only CAG-I site polymorphism presented in primate species, and CAG-I and CAG-III sites polymorphism presented in Canidae. Therefore, studies focusing on disease-associated polymorphism of poly(CAG) in carnivore species AR should investigate all three CAG repeats sites, and should not only consider CAG-I sites as the human disease studies. The trinucleotide repeat length in carnivore AR exon 1 had undergone from expansions to contractions during carnivores evolution, unlike a linear increase in primate species. Furthermore, the polymorphisms of the triplet-repeats in the same tissue (somatic mosaicism) were demonstrated in Moutain weasel, Eurasian lynx, Clouded leopard, Chinese tiger, Black leopard and Leopard AR. And, the abnormal stop codon was found in the exon 1 of three carnivore species AR (Moutain weasel, Eurasian lynx and Black leopard). It seemed to have a high frequency presence of tissue-specific somatic in carnivores AR genes. Thus the in vivo mechanism leading to such highly variable phenotypes of the described mutations, and their impact on these animals, are worthwhile to be further elucidated.

However, in pigs, the information on MTPN gene is very limited. In this study, we cloned cDNA sequences and analyzed the genomic structure of porcine MTPN gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of porcine MTPN contains two the ankyrin repeat domains. RT-PCR analysis revealed that porcine MTPN gene was widely expressed in many tissues, a high expression level was observed in the spleen, liver and uterus, and transient transfection indicated that porcine MTPN proteins was located in cytoplasms within Pig Kidney Epithelial cells (PK15). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that MTPN expression peaked at embryonic 65 day post conception (dpc). During postnatal muscle development, MTPN expression was down-regulated from the 3 day to the 180 day in Yorkshire pigs. This result suggests that the MTPN gene may be important gene for skeletal muscle growth and provides useful information for further studies on its roles in porcine skeletal muscle.

Predictive potential of microsatellite markers on heterosis of fecundity in crossbred sheep	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article						Sheep; Microsatellite; Heterosis; Litter size	GENETIC-DISTANCE; HERITABILITY; POPULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; TRAITS; SIRES	Small Tail Han (STH) sheep is a famous Chinese local breed and has perfect prolificacy performance, but it is inferior to imported mutton sheep breeds on meat production. In this study, six imported male sheep populations (White Suffolk, Black Suffolk, Texel, Dorper, South African Mutton Merino and East Friesian) were crossbred with STH female sheep respectively. The heterosis values of litter size, average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of crossbred sheep were analyzed for seeking the optimal cross. Meanwhile 28 microsatellite markers were used to measure the genetic distance between imported populations and STH population. Regression between the genetic distance and heterosis was analyzed for evaluating potential of microsatellite on predicting heterosis. Results showed a significant positive linear correlation (r = 0.892, P < 0.05) between heterosis of litter size and genetic distance D-A of six crosses. This implied that these microsatellite markers had moderate potential to forecast heterosis of litter size in sheep. Results of this study also indicated that South African Mutton Merino and East Friesian sheep would be the optimal sire breeds for the litter size and might bring the greatest economic benefit in six imported populations; Suffolk sheep could be prior consideration as sire breeds when breeding objective focused on ADG. Finally these results provided valuable information for Chinese sheep industry.	[Di, R.; Chu, M. X.; Fang, L.; Feng, T.; Cao, G.

Isolates were screened by measuring the resting spores' germination inhibition. The suppressive effects of six antagonistic strains against clubroot on Chinese cabbage in the glasshouse and the field were assessed, respectively. Strain A316 was the most promising antagonist against clubroot, which showed the highest control values of 73.69% in the glasshouse experiment and 65.91% in the field trial. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence analysis, strain A316 was most closely related to Streptomyces griseoruber NBRC 12873 (99.9% similarity). Together with morphological, cultural and physio-biochemical characteristics, strain A316 was identified as Streptomyces griseoruber. The results indicate that the isolate A316 might have the potential possibility to be used as an antagonist against P. brassicae. This is the first report of S. griseoruber for controlling clubroot.

In this study, a new trigeneric hybrid involving species from the Triticum, Psathyrostachys and Secale was synthesized by crossing wheat-P. huashanica amphiploid (PHW-SA) with wheat-S. cereale amphiploid (Zhongsi 828). The crossability of F-1 hybrid was high with 35.13%, and the fertility was 41.95%. The morphological characteristics of F-1 plants resembled the parent Zhongsi 828. The trigeneric hybrids pollen mother cells (PMCs) regularly revealed averagely 19.88 univalents, 9.63 ring bivalents, 3.97 rod bivalents, 0.60 trivalents and 0.03 tetravalents per cell. Multivalents consisted of trivalents and tetravalents can be observed in 52.7% of cells. A variation of abnormal lagging chromosome, micronuclei and chromosome bridge were formed at anaphase I and telophase II. The mean chromosomes number of F-2 progenies was 2n = 46.13, and the distribution range was 42-53. GISH results revealed that most F-2 plants had 6-12 S. cereale chromosomes, and only 0-2 P. huashanica chromosomes were detected. The results indicated that S. cereale chromosomes can be preferentially transmitted in the F-2 progenies of trigeneric hybrid than P. huashanica chromosomes. A survey of disease resistances revealed that the stripe rust resistance from the PHW-SA were completely expressed in the F-1 and some F-2 plants. The trigeneric hybrid could be a useful bridge for the transference of P. huashanica and S. cereale chromatins to common wheat.

Identification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented yak milk and evaluation of their application in fermented milk products	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						fermentation characteristic; lactic acid bacteria; Xueo; fermented yak milk	FUNCTIONAL STARTER CULTURES; GENE SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; SET-TYPE YOGURT; STREPTOCOCCUS-THERMOPHILUS; DAIRY-PRODUCTS; FOOD; STRAINS; DIFFERENTIATION; LACTOBACILLUS; ENTEROCOCCI	In this study, 53 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Xueo, a traditional fermented yak milk in the western Sichuan Plateau of China, were identified and their use in fermented milk was evaluated. All gram-positive and catalase-negative strains were divided into 6 groups at the level of 87% similarity using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. These groups were identified as 6 species using 16S rDNA sequence analysis and atpA gene analysis. The dominant LAB strains in Xueo were Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus paracasei, accounting for 45.3, 22.6, and 17.0% of isolates, respectively. Milk fermented with most of the representative strains was high in quality, exhibiting relatively high viscosity, moderate acidity, good sensory quality, and high counts of viable LAB. Fermented milk of E. thwarts SCA16 and L. fermentum SCA52 achieved the highest scores for overall sensory quality. Most strains displayed antimicrobial activity against at least 1 of 9 spoilage microorganisms. Lactic acid was the main factor inhibiting the growth of spoilage bacteria, and H2O2 was also inhibitory to some extent. Excluding the influence of acid and H2O2, strains SCA52 (L. fermentum) and SCA7 (Lactobacillus plantarum) were antagonistic against some of the indicators, suggesting that the 2 strains may produce a bacteriocin-like substance. Therefore, the development of superior strains isolated from Xueo to ferment milk with similar flavor and texture to Xueo is expected.

In order to optimize N application and understand how the different combinations of water and N management affect yield and the relative physiological parameters, we designed three irrigation regimes, standing irrigation (W-1), alternation irrigation (W-2), and dry cultivation (W-3), combined with different N application managements at 180 kg ha(-1) of total N condition in our study. The relationship between yield or NUE and ammonia assimilation enzyme activities, photosynthetic rate and root activity were respectively investigated. Our data revealed that there were obvious interacting effects of irrigation regime and N application strategies on grain yield and NUE as well. Our correlation analysis revealed that the grain yield or NUE was significantly related to ammonium assimilation enzyme activities, photosynthetic rate, and root activity, respectively, at several rice growth stages. Our correlation analysis also revealed that the grain yield was significantly related to the N uptake and utilization, and that the root activity was significantly related to the ammonium assimilation enzymes and photosynthetic rate. Further more, we found that the ammonium assimilation enzyme activities and the photosynthetic rate in flag leaves, or root activity at heading stage was able to be used as indicators for grain yield, total N accumulation, and NUE as well. These results suggest that the N application strategy should be adjusted according to different irrigation regimes in order to obtain the highest yield and the best NUE. Under standing irrigation, on the basis of 40-60% basetiller N fertilizer, panicle N-fertilizer should account for 40-60% applied equally at 4th and 2nd leaves emerged or 3rd and 1st leaves emerged from the top. Under alternation irrigation, the N application ratio should be split into 30% base, 30% tillering, and 40% panicle fertilizer with the last being applied equally at 4th and 2nd leaves emerged from the top. Under dry cultivation, however, panicle N-fertilizer should account for 20-40% applied equally at 5th and 3rd leaves emerged from the top. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Brucella is a facultative intracellular bacterium and cell mediated immunity plays essential roles for protection against Brucella infection. Identification of Brucella antigens that present T-cell epitopes to the host could enable development of such vaccines. In this study, 45 proven or putative pathogenesis-associated factors of Brucella were selected according to currently available data. After expressed and purified, 35 proteins were qualified for analysis of their abilities to stimulate T-cell responses in vitro. Then, an in vitro gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) assay was used to identify potential T-cell antigens from B. abortus. In total, 7 individual proteins that stimulated strong IFN-gamma responses in splenocytes from mice immunized with B. abortus live vaccine S19 were identified. The protective efficiencies of these 7 recombinant proteins were further evaluated. Mice given BAB1_1316 (CobB) or BAB1_1688 (AsnC) plus adjuvant could provide protection against virulent B. abortus infection, similarly with the known protective antigen Cu-Zn SOD and the license vaccine S19. In addition, CobB and AsnC could induce strong antibodies responses in BALB/c mice. Altogether, the present study showed that CobB or AsnC protein could be useful antigen candidates for the development of subunit vaccines against brucellosis with adequate immunogenicity and protection efficacy.

In this study 8 Streptococcus strains isolated from Giant Pandas in different parts of China were identified by amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA sequence by PCR. Genomic diversities of 8 identified Streptococcus strains were analyzed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR). REP-PCR and ERIC-PCR fingerprinting showed different patterns of each Streptococcus. The cluster analysis revealed there is a low level of similarity among these isolated Streptococci which were separated into different subtypes and the same serotype Streptococci were divided into sub-genotypes. REP-PCR and ERIC-PCR fingerprinting results were correlated with serotype. The results also demonstrated the two PCR methods have good discriminative ability and have potential as rapid methods for typing Streptococcus as well as high genomic diversity of Streptococci of pandas.

Previous research based on molecular tagging has suggested that the restorer lines used widely today have narrow genetic backgrounds. However, patterns of genetic variation at a genome-wide scale in these restorer lines remain largely unknown. The present study performed resequencing and genome-wide variation analysis of three important representative restorer lines, namely, IR24, MH63, and SH527, using the Solexa sequencing technology. With the genomic sequence of the Indica cultivar 9311 as the reference, the following genetic features were identified: 267,383 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 52,847 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels), and 3,286 structural variations (SVs) in the genome of IR24; 288,764 SNPs, 59,658 InDels, and 3,226 SVs in MH63; and 259,862 SNPs, 55,500 InDels, and 3,127 SVs in SH527. Variations between samples were also determined by comparative analysis of authentic collections of SNPs, InDels, and SVs, and were functionally annotated. Furthermore, variations in several important genes were also surveyed by alignment analysis in these lines. Our results suggest that genetic variations among these lines, although far lower than those reported in the landrace population, are greater than expected, indicating a complicated genetic basis for the phenotypic diversity of the restorer lines. Identification of genome-wide variation and pattern analysis among the restorer lines will facilitate future genetic studies and the molecular improvement of hybrid rice.

Kengyilia is a group of allohexaploid species with the StYP genomic constitutions in the wheat tribe. To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the Pgk1 gene in Kengyilia and its diploid relatives, three copies of Pgk1 homoeologues were isolated from all sampled hexaploid Kengyilia species and analyzed with the Pgk1 sequences from 47 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) Kengyilia species from the Central Asia and the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau have independent origins with geographically differentiated P genome donors and diverged levels of nucleotide diversity at Pgk1 locus; (2) a relatively long-time sweep event has allowed the Pgk1 gene within Agropyron to adapt to cold climate triggered by the recent uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; (3) sweep event and population expansion might result in the difference in the d(N)/d(S) value of the Pgk1 gene in allopatric Agropyron populations, and this difference may be genetically transmitted to Kengyilia lineages via independent polyploidization events; (4) an 83 bp MITE element insertion has shaped the Pgk1 loci in the P genome lineage with different geographical regions; (5) the St and P genomes in Kengyilia were donated by Pseudoroegneria and Agropyron, respectively, and the Y genome is closely related to the Xp genome of Peridictyon sanctum. The interplay of evolutionary forces involving diverged natural selection, population expansion, and transposable events in geographically differentiated P genome donors could attribute to geographical differentiation of Kengyilia species via independent origins.

For incorporating with the Noah LSM, a new rainfall-runoff model named XXT (the first X stands for Xinanjiang, the second X stands for hybrid, and T stands for TOPMODEL) was developed and presented in this study, based on the soil moisture storage capacity distribution curve (SMSCC), some essential modules of the Xinanjiang model, together with the simple model framework of the TOPMODEL (a topography based hydrological model). The innovation of XXT is that the water table is incorporated into SMSCC and it connects the surface runoff production with base flow production. This improves the description of the dynamically varying saturated areas that produce runoff and also captures the physical underground water level. XXT was tested in a small-scale watershed Youshuijie (946 km(2)) and a large-scale watershed Yinglouxia (10009 km(2)) in China. The results show that XXT has better performance against the TOPMODEL and the Xinanjiang model for the two watersheds in both the calibration period and the validation period in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Moreover, XXT captures the largest peak flow well for both the small- and large-scale watersheds during the validation period, while the TOPMODEL produces significant overestimates or underestimates, so does the Xinanjiang model.

Three global ensemble weather prediction systems of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in THORPEX (The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive are used in this research to drive the Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System (GRAPES) to produce 6-h lead time forecasts. The output (precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and pressure) in turn drives a hydrological model XXT (the first X stands for Xinanjiang, the second X stands for hybrid, and T stands for TOPMODEL), the hybrid model that combines the TOPMODEL (a topography based hydrological model) and the Xinanjiang model, for a case study of a flood event; that lasted from 18 to 20 July 2007 in the Linyi watershed. The results show that rainfall forecasts by GRAPES using TIGGE data from the three forecast centers all underestimate heavy rainfall rates; the rainfall forecast by GRAPES using the data front. the NCEP is the closest to the observation while that from the CMA performs the worst. Moreover, the ensemble is not better than individual members for rainfall forecasts. In contrast; to corresponding rainfall forecasts, runoff forecasts ace much better for all three forecast; centers, especially for the NCEP. The results suggest; that; early flood warning by the GRAPES/XXT model based on TIGGE data is feasible and this provides a new approach to raise preparedness and thus to reduce the socio-economic impact of floods.

In the present study, serum samples from 314 household dogs were collected from Wenchuan. Heishui, and Jiuzhaigou in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, in May and June 201; sera were assayed for T. gondii antibodies using an indirect haemagglutination test (IHA). Antibodies to T gondii were found in 11 of 314 (3.5%), with IHA titers of 1:64 in 4 dogs, 1:128 in 3, 1:256 in 2, 1:512 in 1, and 1:1024 in I. No regional difference was observed among the 3 counties (P > 0.05). The results of the present study indicated that infection with T gamin in dogs is common in China, including household dogs in Sichuan Province, and should be of public health concern.

Reliable information on the rates of soil loss is urgently needed. The traditional techniques for documenting rates of soil loss may meet this need, but face many limitations. The fallout radionuclides, especially Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex), are increasingly used as effective tracers to quantify soil erosion rates, and they represent a valuable complement to the existing classical methods. This paper aims to introduce the basis for assessing soil erosion rates on cultivated and uncultivated slopes by using Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) measurements, to compare the Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) reference inventories, and to report several case studies undertaken in the hilly area of Sichuan Basin and the Three Gorges area of China.

This study developed a set of genetic markers that use the potential intron length polymorphism in resistance gene analogs (RGAs) in Zea mays. By searching the genome of Zea mays B73 for the homologs of 73 R genes which have already been identified in plants, we found 861 RGAs, 632 of which have at least one intron that can serve as putative markers targeting the intron length polymorphism in RGAs (RGA-ILP). We developed 1972 candidate markers via electronic PCR (e-PCR) with primer pairs designed in each pair of exonic regions that flank an intron. Furthermore, the performance of RGA-ILP among four maize inbred lines (Huangzao4, B73, Mo17, and Dan340) was evaluated with 69 pairs of randomly selected primers. Of them, 46.4% showed bands that had discriminating length polymorphism, and between any two of the inbred lines the proportion of polymorphism ranged from 23.2 to 31.9%. To make it convenient to use these markers for those interested in molecular breeding of disease-resistant maize, we provide all related information in a web-based database named MaizeRGA, which is available at http://www.sicau.edu.cn/web/yms/rga/maizeRGA.html.

A total of 1200 male COBB 500 broilers were randomly allocated into 1 of 10 treatment groups by a 5 x 2 factorial design in a 42-d experiment. The dietary treatments were as follows: T-1 to T-5: basal diets with 0, 10, 20, 33.3, and 50 mg CYA per kg diet; T-6 to T-10: basal diet with CYA regimens similar to T-1 to T-5 but with 100 mg MEL per kg diet. There were 6 replication pens with 20 chicks per pen. No differences were observed in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. But on d 22, uric acid (UA) and creatinine (Crea) concentrations were significantly greater when birds were fed CYA at 33.3 mg/kg with MEL 100 mg/kg, and Crea concentration was also higher when birds were fed CYA at 50 mg/kg. No crystals were found in kidneys but dilated renal tubules and small blood vessel expansion were found in kidneys of birds fed CYA at 50 mg/kg and CYA at 33.3 mg/kg with MEL 100 mg/kg. The apoptosis rate (AR) of kidneys of all birds fed CYA and MEL contaminated diets were higher than the control group. These results indicated that the dietary addition of CYA and MEL could induce kidney damage, and the effects were harmful when the ratio of CYA/MEL was 1:3.

A total of 720 commercial 1-day-old COBB 500 male broilers were randomly allotted into 6 groups with 6 replicates each and 20 broilers in each replicate. The dietary treatments were as follows: group I was the control group, group II included 10 mg/kg MEL and 3.3 mg/kg CYA, group III included 30 mg/kg MEL and 10 mg/kg CYA, group IV included 100 mg/kg MEL and 33.3 mg/kg CYA, group V included 100 mg/kg MEL, and group VI included 33.3 mg/kg CYA. The trial lasted for 42 days. CYA alone and the combination of MEL and CYA had adverse effects on the performance, but MEL alone had no effects on the performance. On day 21, the uric acid (UA) content of group IV was increased in serum (p < 0.05); on day 42, the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity and the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 increased in group IV (p < 0.05); 100 mg/kg MEL alone increased the level of TNF-alpha and the rate of renal apoptosis (p < 0.05); and 33.3 mg/kg CYA alone increased the level of IL-8 and the rate of renal apoptosis (p < 0.05). The livers contained MEL concentrations of 17-125 mu g/kg wet weight and CYA concentrations of 28-73 mu g/kg, and the muscle contained MEL concentrations of 14-105 mu g/kg wet weight.

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a biological mechanism known to exhibit some C-4 characteristics such as the C-3 cycle during daylight and demonstrates the C-4 cycle at night. There are also various C-3-CAM intermediates, whose CAM pathway can be induced by environmental changes. However, neither fungus-induced CAM nor Theaceae CAM have been reported previously. Here, we show that CAM could be generated by fungus infection in Camellia oleifera Abel. young leaves, even at a location of a single leaf where the upper part had been transformed into a succulent one, while the lower part remained unchanged. The early photosynthetic products of dark-grown C. oleifera succulent leaves were malate, whereas C. oleifera normal leaves and light-grown succulent leaves incorporated most of C-14 into the primary photosynthetic product 3-phosphoglycerate. Camellia oleifera succulent leaves have a lower absolute delta C-13 value, much lower photorespiration rates and lower transpiration rates during the day than those of C. oleifera normal leaves. Like a typical CAM plant, stomata of C. oleifera succulent leaves closed during the daylight, but opened at night, and therefore had a detectable CO2 compensation point in darkness. Net photosynthetic rates (P-n) fluctuated diurnally and similarly with stomatal aperture. No light intensity saturation could be defined for C. oleifera succulent leaves. C-4 key enzymes in C. oleifera succulent leaves were increased at both the transcriptional/translational levels as well as at the enzyme activity level.

The as prepared NHMCS were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and elemental analysis. The results show that NHMCS have the ordered macroporous structure, high-surface-area as well as 1.7% nitrogen doped content. The typical electrochemical methods were used to study the activity of NHMCS for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, and the results show that NHMCS possess better electrocatalytic activity and high resistance to the methanol crossover than commercial Ilt/C via a four-electron pathway.

The mutated gene was linearized and inserted into plasmid vector pPIC9K and transformed by electroporation into Pichia pastoris GS115. A single transformant, PP-NPep-6A, showing the strongest phytase activity from among the 5,500 transformants, was selected for detailed analyses. Southern blot analysis of the mutant yeast transformant showed that phyA(ep) gene was integrated into the chromosome genome through single crossover with one copy of phyA. The kinetic parameters indicated that the mutant one showed 61% higher specific activity and 53% lower k(m) value than that of PP-NPm-8 (P<0.05). In addition, the overall catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) of the mutant one was 84% higher (P<0.05) than that of PP-NPm-8. Nine bases were altered in the mutant sequences, which resulted in three amino acid changes, namely, Glu156Gly, Thr236Ala, and Gln396Arg. The structural predictions indicated that the mutations generated by ep-PCR somehow reorganized or remodeled the active site, which could lead to increasing catalytic efficiency.

A total of 420 one-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet (vanadium 0.073 mg/kg), and five high vanadium diets (vanadium 5 mg/kg, high vanadium group I; 15 mg/kg, high vanadium group II; 30 mg/kg, high vanadium group III; 45 mg/kg, high vanadium group IV; and 60 mg/kg, high vanadium group V) throughout the experimental period of 42 days. The results showed that the renal and hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, ability to inhibit hydroxy radical, and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, and vanadium contents were not significantly changed in high vanadium group I and II when compared with those of the control groups. However, the SOD and GSH-Px activities, ability to inhibit hydroxy radical, and GSH content were significantly decreased, and the MDA and vanadium contents were markedly increased in high vanadium groups III, IV, and V. At the same time, the lesions were also observed in the kidney and liver of high vanadium groups III, IV, and V. The renal tubular epithelial cells showed granular degeneration and vacuolar degeneration, and hepatocytes showed granular degeneration, vacuolar degeneration, and fatty degeneration. It was concluded that dietary vanadium in the range of 30-60 mg/kg could cause oxidative damage and vanadium accumulation, which induced renal and hepatic toxicity and lesions. The renal and hepatic function was finally impaired in boilers.

Aim of the study To determine the effects of maternal intake of fat and fiber on fetal intrauterine development and antioxidant defense systems of rats. Methods Virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups according to diet: the low-fat, low-fiber group (LL); the low-fat, high-fiber group (LH); the high-fat, low-fiber group (HL); and the high-fat, high-fiber group (HH). The diets were fed 4 weeks prior to breeding through day 17.5 of pregnancy. Dietary intakes of fiber (wheat bran and oat) and fat were quantitatively varied, while intakes of energy and essential nutrients were kept constant among the diets. Results Rats fed a fiber-rich diet had significantly improved fetal numbers, as well as enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and capacity of scavenging free radicals (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the placental malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were affected by the diet fat and fiber levels (p < 0.05). Compared with the LL group, the mRNA abundance of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) in the maternal liver and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) in the placenta and fetus were significantly downregulated in the HL group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, rats fed a fiber-rich diet had significantly upregulated mRNA expressions of Cu,Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and HIF-1 alpha in the maternal liver (p < 0.05); Cu, Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD in the placenta (p < 0.05); and Cu, Zn-SOD in the fetus (p < 0.05). Conclusion When energy intakes are equivalent, consumption of fiber in high- or low-fat diets benefits fetal development and growth, through improvements in maternal, placental, and fetal antioxidant defense capacities.

J	Yu, J; Yu, B; Jiang, HL; Chen, DW				Yu, Jie; Yu, Bing; Jiang, Honglin; Chen, Daiwen			Conjugated linoleic acid induces hepatic expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 through PPAR-alpha	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						Conjugated linoleic acid; Fibroblast growth factor 21; PPAR-alpha; Liver	PRIMARY CULTURES; FAT MASS; TRANS-10; CIS-12; FIBROBLAST-GROWTH-FACTOR-21; HUMANS; LIVER; GAMMA; MICE; REGULATOR	Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a PPAR-alpha-regulated metabolic regulator that plays critical roles in glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity and obesity. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), especially trans-10 (t-10), cis-12 (c-12), have shown anti-obesity properties. In addition, CLA is reported as a high-affinity ligand and activator of PPAR-alpha. This raises the possibility that FGF21 might be involved in the anti-obesity effect of CLA. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that FGF21 expression in the liver could be induced by t-10, c-12-CLA through PPAR-alpha. HepG2 cells were treated with 100 mM-bovine serum albumin, 10mM-t-10, c-12-CLA or 100 mM-t-10, c-12-CLA for 8 h. A total of ten adult C57BL/6J mice were fed with the diets containing 1% soya oil or t-10, c-12-CLA for 5d. t-10, c-12-CLA stimulated hepatic FGF21 mRNA abundance as determined by real-time RT-PCR. t-10, c-12-CLA also increased serum FGF21 concentrations as measured by an ELISA. Co-transfection analysis indicated that reporter gene expression from the mouse FGF21 promoter was induced by t-10, c-12-CLA in a PPAR-alpha-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that t-10, c-12-CLA induces hepatic FGF21 expression through PPAR-alpha. This FGF21 and PPAR-alpha linkage may provide another potential explanation for the anti-obesity effect of t-10, c-12-CLA.

Interestingly, FGF21 is also known to inhibit Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling from the GH receptor in the liver, where FGF21 mRNA is predominantly expressed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that FGF21 gene expression in the liver is controlled by GH through STAT5. We found that GH injection to cattle increased FGF21 mRNA expression in the liver. Mapped by a 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay, transcription of the FGF21 gene in the bovine liver was mainly initiated from a nucleotide 24 bp downstream of a TATA box. The bovine FGF21 promoter contains three putative STAT5-binding sites. EMSA confirmed the ability of them to bind to liver STAT5 protein from GH-injected cattle. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that GH administration increased the binding of STAT5 to the FGF21 promoter in the liver. Cotransfection analyses showed that GH induced reporter gene expression from the FGF21 promoter in a STAT5-dependent manner. GH also stimulated FGF21 mRNA expression in cultured mouse hepatocytes. These data together indicate that GH directly stimulates FGF21 gene transcription in the liver, at least in part, through STAT5. This finding, together with the fact that FGF21 inhibits GH-induced JAK2-STAT5 signaling in the liver, suggests a novel negative feedback loop that prevents excessive JAK2-STAT5 signaling from the GH receptor in the liver.

Here, a comparative study of mtDNA control region (D-loop) (835 bp) sequences was performed to analyze its wild population structure and evaluate the genetic diversity for 110 individuals from five locations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China. A total of 49 polymorphic sites and 45 haplotypes yielded high haplotype diversity (h = 0.952), but low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.00454) as that of many fish species. Sequence divergences between haplotypes ranged from 0.0033 +/- 0.0011 to 0.0050 +/- 0.0012 in intra-groups, and from 0.0037 +/- 0.0.0011 to 0.0050 +/- 0.0012 between groups. Significant values of Tajima's D (-1.86383, P < 0.01) and Fu's F (S) (-25.93, P < 0.01), together with uni-modal mismatch distribution, indicated a recent genetic bottleneck or population expansion of the species. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a small amount of differentiation among groups (1.7%); most of the total variation occurred within groups (98.3%). Also, there was no significant population structure (F (ST) = 0.017, P > 0.05), and estimates of gene flows among groups were extremely high (Nm = 28.88), suggesting low genetic divergence between populations in the species. The lack of genetic differentiation among groups is most likely due to the combined gene flow from the downstream movement of eggs and larvae with currents and the upstream or downstream migration of adults throughout the distribution. These groups of L. elongata distributed in upper reaches of the Yangtze River should be considered as a single management unit.

J	Wang, ZY; Qi, LJ; Wang, XZ				Wang, Zhao Yin; Qi, Lijian; Wang, Xuzhao			A prototype experiment of debris flow control with energy dissipation structures	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Debris flow; Energy dissipation; Step-pool system; Check dams; Landslide	MOUNTAIN STREAMS; STEPPED SPILLWAYS; SKIMMING FLOWS; CHANNEL; ORIGIN	Large-volume debris flow events are defined when the volume of solid materials exceeds 1 million m(3). Traditional engineering measures, such as check dams, diversion channels, and flumes, are effective for normal debris flow control but are not sufficient to control large-volume debris flows. Experiments were conducted with an artificial step-pool system on the new Wenjiagou Gully to mitigate large-volume debris flows. The old Wenjiagou Gully was buried by 81.6 million m(3) of loose solid material created by a landslide that was triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008. The new gully was formed during the scouring process caused by debris flows in 2008. Large-volume debris flows were initiated by rainstorm flood with high kinetic energy. The artificial step-pool system was constructed with huge and big boulders on the new Wenjiagou Gully in 2009. The step-pool system dissipated flow energy in steps and hydraulic jumps. Analysis proved that the step-pool system dissipated two-third of the kinetic energy of flow; thus, the critical discharge for triggering debris flow increased threefold. Due to the step-pool system maximized the flow resistance and protected the bed sediment and banks from erosion, the rainstorm floods in 2009 did not trigger debris flows. In 2010, the step-pool system was replaced with 20 check dams. Huge boulders were broken into small pieces of diameter less than 0.5 m and were used as building materials for the 20 dams. Without the protection of the step-pool system, a rainstorm flood scoured the base of the dams and caused failures for all of the 20 check dams in August 2010. The flow incised the gully bed by 50 m. The loose bank materials slid into the flow mixed with water and formed a large-volume debris flow with a volume of 4.5 million m(3). Many houses were buried by the debris flow, and 12 people were killed. Comparison of the two strategies proved that energy dissipation structures are necessary for controlling large-volume debris flows. Check dams, if they are stable, may reduce the potential of bank failures and control debris flows. The step-pool system dissipates flow energy and control gully bed incision and bank failure. A combination of check dams and step-pool systems may be the most effective for mitigating debris flows.

Under Cd exposure, the plant displayed leaf chlorosis, which is a typical symptom of iron (Fe) deficiency. Interactions of Cd with Fe have been reported. However, the molecular mechanisms of Cd-Fe interactions are not well understood. Here, we showed that FER-like Deficiency Induced Transcripition Factor (FIT), AtbHLH38, and AtbHLH39, three basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors involved in Fe homeostasis in plants, also play important roles in Cd tolerance. The gene expression analysis showed that the expression of FIT, AtbHLH38, and AtbHLH39 was up-regulated in the roots of plants treated with Cd. The plants overexpressing AtbHLH39 and double-overexpressing FIT/AtbHLH38 and FIT/AtbHLH39 exhibited more tolerance to Cd exposure than wild type, whereas no Cd tolerance was observed in plants overexpressing either AtbHLH38 or FIT. Further analysis revealed that co-overexpression of FIT with AtbHLH38 or AtbHLH39 constitutively activated the expression of Heavy Metal Associated3 (HMA3), Metal Tolerance Protein3 (MTP3), Iron Regulated Transporter2 (IRT2), and Iron Regulated Gene2 (IREG2), which are involved in the heavy metal detoxification in Arabidopsis (Arabidopis thaliana). Moreover, co-overexpression of FIT with AtbHLH38 or AtbHLH39 also enhanced the expression of NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHETASE1 (NAS1) and NAS2, resulting in the accumulation of nicotiananamine, a crucial chelator for Fe transportation and homeostasis. Finally, we showed that maintaining high Fe content in shoots under Cd exposure could alleviate the Cd toxicity. Our results provide new insight to understand the molecular mechanisms of Cd tolerance in plants.

In this study, nine dominant plant species growing on lead-zinc mine tailing and their corresponding non-mining ecotypes were investigated for their potential phytostabilization of lead. Lead concentration in roots of these plants was higher than in shoots, and the highest concentrations of lead were found in Athyrium wardii: 15542 and 10720 mg kg(-1) in the early growth stage (May) and vigorous growth stage (August) respectively, which were 426 and 455 times higher than those of the non-mining ecotypes. Because of poor lead translocation ability, lead accumulation in roots reached as high as 42 mg per plant. Available lead in the rhizosphere soils of A. wardii was 310 mg kg(-1), which was 17 times higher than that of the non-rhizosphere soil. Lead concentrations of roots for the nine mining ecotypes were positively correlated with available lead in the rhizosphere soils, whereas a negative correlation was observed in the non-mining ecotypes. These results suggest that A. wardii was the most promising candidate among the tested species for lead accumulation in roots, and it could be used for phytostabilization in lead polluted soils.

Both malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content in serum and muscle decreased with increasing dietary MHA level up to 5.110.2 g kg-1 diet (P < 0.05). Anti-hydroxyl radical and activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in muscle and serum, as well as anti-superoxide anion, superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content in serum, increased with optimal MHA supplement (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, glutathione-S-transferase activity in serum showed a downward trend with dietary MHA up to 7.6 g kg-1 diet (P < 0.05). These results indicated that MHA improved antioxidant status and depressed lipid and protein oxidation in serum and muscle.

PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER			English	Article						Microsomal oleate desaturase; Safflower; Linoleic acid; Real-time PCR; Cold stress	FATTY-ACID DESATURASES; LOW-TEMPERATURE; SEED OIL; GROWTH; PLANTS	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated oleate desaturase (FAD2) is the key enzyme responsible for the production of linoleic acid in plants. In safflower, a seed-type FAD2 gene (CtFAD2-1) has been isolated previously. In this study, two different cDNA sequences, designated CtFAD2-2 and CtFAD2-3, encoding two microsomal oleate desaturases have been isolated from safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. Both deduced amino acid sequences showed the three histidine boxes characteristic of all membrane-bound desaturases, and possess a C-terminal ER retention signal. Phylogentic analysis shows that CtFAD2-2 is grouped with other house-keeping type FAD2 sequences from oil crops, while CtFAD2-3 does not belong to seed type or house-keeping type FAD2. Real-time PCR analysis showed that CtFAD2-2 gene is constitutively expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds, with higher transcript levels in roots, stems and petioles. Transcript of CtFAD2-3 was strongly detected in developing seeds, showing low levels in vegetative tissues. In response to low-temperature stress, CtFAD2-2 and CtFAD2-3 in different tissues showed a different behavior (up- or down-regulated). The transcript of CtFAD2-2 was dramatically decreased in roots, stems and petioles under low temperature, while CtFAD2-3 showed a significant increase in these tissues. On the contrary, in leaves, the strongly enhanced expression of CtFAD2-2 was observed under low temperature, while the transcript of CtFAD2-3 showed a little decrease.

Shenwan	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER			English	Article						Ananas comosus; SERK; Somatic embryogenesis; Expression pattern	AGROBACTERIUM-MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION; EMBRYOS; EXPRESSION; PROTEIN; CELLS; CULTURES; KINASES; FAMILY; GROWTH	A somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (SERK) gene, designated as AcSERK1, was isolated from pineapple (Ananas comosus cv. Shenwan). AcSERK1 shared all the characteristic domains of the SERK family, including five leucine-rich repeats, one proline-rich region motif, transmembrane domain, and kinase domains. Somatic embryogenic cultures of pineapple were established following transfer of callus cultures to Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The role of AcSERK1 during establishment of somatic embryogenesis in culture was investigated. The AcSERK1 was highly expressed during embryogenic competence acquisition and global embryo formation in culture. These findings were obtained along with morphological changes in callus cultures exhibiting embryogenic potential. Overall, levels of expression of AcSERK1 were lower in nonembryogenic tissues and organs than in embryogenic callus. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that AcSERK1 expression was detected in embryogenic tissues, including single competent cells, meristematic centers wherein embryogenic structures are formed, and global embryos. These results suggested that AcSERK1 expression was associated with induction of somatic embryogenesis and that it could be used as a potential marker gene to monitor the transition of pineapple callus tissues into competent and embryogenic cells and tissues.

We investigate whether giant pandas exhibit innate predator recognition. We analyzed behavioral responses of 56 naive adult captive giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), to urine from predators and non-predators and water control. Giant pandas performed more chemosensory investigation and displayed flehmen behaviors more frequently in response to predator urine compared to both non-predator urine and water control. Subjects also displayed certain defensive behaviors, as indicated by vigilance, and in certain cases, fleeing behaviors. Our results suggest that there is an innate component to predator recognition in captive giant pandas, although such recognition was only slight to moderate. These results have implications that may be applicable to the conservation and reintroduction of this endangered species.

Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of cold stress on endogenous hormones and the expression of homologs of CBF (1) in four bamboo species differing in their tolerance to cold. All four bamboo species were subjected to cold stress with a temperature gradient (10, 5, 0, -5, and -10A degrees C), and each low temperature treatment was maintained for 48 h. Results showed that ABA, GA(1), and GA(4) were significantly affected by cold stress: ABA increased with cold stress in all species, while GA(1) and GA(4) reduced with cold stress. ABA levels and the ratio of ABA/(GA(1) + GA(4)) in leaves of Neosinocalamus affinis and Bambusa rigida were both higher than those of hybrid bamboo (Bambusa pervariabilis x Dendrocalamopsis grandis) and Dendrocalamus latiflorus for all treatments, while GA(1) and GA(4) were conversely lower as compared to the hybrid variety and D. latiflorus. Moreover, CBF (1) homolog was up-regulated during cold stress, with higher expression levels in the leaves of cold-tolerant species than cold-sensitive ones. Results revealed that high levels of ABA and CBF (1) , as well as the ABA/GA(s) balance, are important in increased plant resistance to cold stress.

Multiple RGs for gene expression analysis of soybean exposed to heavy metal stress treatment have not been reported in the literature. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of ten candidate RGs in leaves, roots and stems of two soybean cultivars exposed to cadmium (Cd). Based on the geNorm and NormFinder analysis, ACT3, PP2A, ELF1B and F-box were the most stable RGs in these gene expression studies. In contrast, G6PD, UBC2, TUB, and ELF1A were the most variable ones and should not be used as RGs in these experimental conditions.

In this study, we quantified the expression of calpastatin (CAST) in two Chinese chicken breeds (mountainous black-bone chicken breed (MB) and a commercial meat type chicken breed (S01)), to discern the tissue and age-related specific expression pattern and its potential role on muscle tissue metabolism. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was developed for accurate measurement of CAST mRNA levels in various tissues from chicken with different ages (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 week). CAST mRNA was detected in collected organs. The heart and leg muscle tissues had the highest expression of CAST than other tissues from the same chicken (P < 0.01). Age-related expression pattern of CAST gene was evident in breast muscle, liver, and brain tissues (P < 0.05), but not in heart and leg muscle tissues (P > 0.05). Overall, the CAST mRNA level exhibited a "rise-decline-rise-decline" developmental change in breast muscle and liver, with the highest expression at 2 weeks and the lowest expression at 8 weeks. The S01 chicken had significantly higher expression of CAST in breast muscle and heart than the MB chicken (P < 0.05) at 10 weeks. Our results suggested the CAST expression may be related to muscle fiber development.

Twenty-eight PIC male piglets were divided into four homogeneous groups according to initial body weight (similar birth and parity, weaned at 21 +/- 1.5 days). Diets for the four treatments consisted of corn starch, wheat starch, tapioca starch and pea starch with the determined ratio for amylose to amylopectin of 0.21, 0.24, 0.12 and 0.52 respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was applied to: (1) detect genomic DNA of Bacillus and to quantify the number of Bacillus in the intestinal tract chyme of piglets with the primers and probe which designed based on the 16S rRNA sequences of maximum species of Bacillus on GenBank; (2) measure the mRNA level of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), insulin-like growth factors 1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Results showed that the number of Baciilus and the percentage based on all bacteria in the whole intestinal content of piglets fed pea starch was highest in all groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant differance on copy numbers for all bacteria and Bacillus in the whole intestinal tract of piglets between the corn starch group and wheat starch group (P > 0.05). In addition, the expression level of GLP-2, IGF-1 mRNA in jejunum and ileum of pea starch treatment (the high amylose/amylopectin ratio) were increased while the tapioca starch decreased their mRNA level significantly compared to other three treatments (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference for the mRNA level of EGF in each group. The present study revealed that high amylose/amylopectin ratio of starches significantly enhanced the numbers of Bacillus in all segments of intestine and the mRNA level of intestinal development related genes.

PCR-ready human DNA extraction from urine samples using magnetic nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles; DNA; Urine sediment; PCR	SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; GENOMIC DNA; PLASMID DNA; MS ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; ENRICHMENT; SEPARATION; NANOBEADS; DIAGNOSIS; PEPTIDES	Urine-derived human genomic DNA (gDNA) has wide application in a variety of disciplines including clinical medicine, sports, and forensic science. We describe a novel method for gDNA extraction from urine samples using carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles (CMNPs) as solid-phase adsorbents. Sedimentation associated with freezing of urine samples significantly reduces cell capture by CMNPs. However, the addition of 10 mM EDTA and subsequent pH modification (pH 6.0-7.1) can re-dissolve urine sediments. Purified gDNA ranged from around 0.1 kb to more than 23 kb. PCR using specific primers targeting K-ras, GAPDH,CYP3A4 and GDF5 amplified 100% of varying sized gene fragments, verifying the high quality of the isolated DNA. Successful PCR amplifications using DNA isolated from urine samples as small as 50 ill were demonstrated. Enrichment of urine cells and subsequent adsorption of DNA can be achieved with the same CMNPs, greatly simplifying extraction procedures. The CMNP gDNA extraction technique proved to be simple, rapid, sensitive and environmentally friendly, with application for routine laboratory use and potentially within automated urine extraction platforms.

Preliminary structural characterization was conducted by physicochemical property, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals were also evaluated. The physicochemical property analysis indicated the identicalness of the polysaccharide indices obtained by the hot water and ultrasonic methods. The indices obtained by the alkali and enzyme methods were significantly different. The FTIR spectra revealed the general characteristic absorption peaks of the four polysaccharides. The SEM images demonstrated significant differences in the surface features of the different polysaccharides. The antioxidant activity assay revealed the significant antioxidant activities of three polysaccharides. Overall, the polysaccharides from S. miltiorrhiza Bunge may have potential applications in the medical and food industries. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Twenty pigs were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Control Group (CG) and inoculated with APP (TG). The infected-APP pigs' lung exhibited significantly (p<0.05) greater levels of chemokines CCL2, CCL20, IL8 and slightly increase levels of chemokines CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL2 while significantly(p<0.05) decrease levels of chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL12. APP infection significantly (p<0.05 or 0.01) stimulated expression of cytokines IL-18, IL-6, TNT, GM-CSF, CASP3, CASP8 and significantly (p<0.05 or 0.01) suppressed expression of cytokines CD40, IRF1 in lung. Cytokines in infected-APP pigs' lung, IL-1A, IL-27, IRF3, IL-10 were slightly increased and CASP1, IRF7, IL-12B, IL-2 were slightly decreased. Relative cytokine and chemokine microarray data in. UN indicated that APP infection significantly (p<0.05) stimulated expression of cytokine IL-6 and significantly (p<0.05 or 0.01) suppressed expression of cytokines CXCL12, CD40 and CASP1. In conclusion, 26 cytokine and chemokines mRNA expression levels in lung and RN obtained from infected-APP or control swines were elucidated in this study. This research provided evidence that the increased severity of lesions in. the infected-APP swines was associated mainly with alterations of cytokine and chemokines microarray profiles, especialy in. lung. The changes of all the cytokines in lung and FIN can lead stem cells to produce granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and monocytes and also promoted neutrophil and macrophages to phagocytose bacterial and foreign antigen at the site of inflammation. Defense function of pig infection with APP was enhanced while immune function was weakened.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the PPAR-gamma gene on slaughter traits of 170 individuals from Zhejiang White geese (ZW) and the ontogenetic expression pattern. PCR-SSCP technique was developed to analyze coding region of the PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism. The results showed that two genotypes (AA and AG) which were the products of two alleles (A and G) were observed. Association analysis indicated that this SNP was significantly associated with percentage of goose leg muscle (p<0.05) and the allele A was the predominant allele. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay measured the PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in ZW and Landes goose five tissues of different ages (P1, P14, P21, P28, P35, P42, P49, P56 and P63). The results showed that the PPAR-gamma mRNA had the highest expression level in goose abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat followed by lung and intestine. The PPAR-gamma mRNA levels exhibited a rise-decline change in fat tissues except for ZW subcutaneous fat. The values in fat tissues were higher than those of other tissues at the same goose breed (p<0.01). Besides, average values in. ZW fat and liver tissues were higher than those of Landes goose totally. These results suggested that the PPAR-gamma expressions were positively associated with goose fat development and had a breed-related tendency. The PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism could be used in Marker Assistant Selection (MAS) as a genetic marker for goose slaughter traits.

Researchers cloned an hsp 70 gene from Tenebrio molitor larvae by PCR and RACE Method and determined the mRNA abundance it the beetle developmental stages by real-time qPCR. The cDNA cloned was 2,282 bp in full length containing a 115 bp 5'untranslated region rich in adenine, a 1,935 bp open reading frame and a 232 bp 3'untranslated regionrich in adenine and thymine. It also had seven repeats of the Heat Shock Element (HSE) nGAAn in its 5'UTR and a 22 bp Poly (A) tail in the 3'UTR. The deduced heat shock protein had a highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domain and a conserved C-terminal peptide-binding domain. The tertiary structure of ATPase domain was made of two large globular subdomains which were separated by a deep cleft and the peptide-binding domain was a sandwich of 2 four-stranded beta-sheets with four loops protruding upwards and two alpha-helices. Real-time qPCR analysis revealed that the hsp70 mRNA expression in T. molitor was characterized by heat-inducible and developmental-regulation features. The results form a basis for further research on structure, function and expression regulation of HSPs from T. molitor as well as to decipher the relationship between HSPs and stress-resistance in the beetle.

In order to investigate DARC gene in golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellanae), two pairs of primers were designed based on DARC gene sequence of the Macaca mulatta (HQ285849.1) and used to amplify approximately 1.0 and 1.1 kb DNA fragments respectively by PCR technique from genomic DNA sample of golden monkey. The DNA, sequencing and combing results showed that the DARC gene of the golden monkey was 1593 bp in length and contained a 47 bp 5 flanking region, two extrons (21 and 990 bp), one complete intron (478 bp) and a 57 bp 3 flanking region The Open Reading Fragment (ORF) was 1 011 bp and encoded 336 amino acid residues. The DARC was a hydrophobic protein with less hydrophilic components. The prediction of topological structure for the protein. indicated that it contained 16 potential function sites: three N-glycosylation sites, one protein kinase C phosphorylation site, two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and ten N-myristoylation sites. In addition, the protein comprised seven transmembrane helix regions and four extracellular regions and four intracellular regions. Alignment analysis revealed that the homologies of DARC gene nucleotide sequence of golden snub-nosed monkey with other primate species and human was 95-99% and the homologies of amino acid sequence was 80-99%. These results would provide the molecular basis for golden monkey against human malarias.

The positive recombinant plasmid was selected and sequenced. Then, the yrp1 gene was subcloned into pET-32a (+) vector and transformed into BL21 (DE3) followed by induction with IPTG and detection with SDS-PAGE. Optimization of the induction conditions were conducted. The results showed that the recombinant protein with a molecular mass of about 72 kDa was mostly packaged into inclusion bodies. The optimization of induction process conditions led us to perform the fusion protein induction at 37 degrees C for 4 h with 0.8 mM IPTG.

In present study, researchers analyzed 218 prior published partial mitochondrial D-loop sequences (415 bp) by using phylogenetic, network, mismatch distribution and Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) analysis to clarify the population differentiation and explore the relationships among populations from different geographical locations of Tibetan pigs. The results revealed a total of 43 haplotypes in 218 samples from seven Tibetan pig populations in which only one common Haplotype (H1) was shared by the seven populations. Haplotype diversity was high (0.889) whereas nucleotide diversity among all individuals was low (0.00534). It is notable that Hezuo Tibetan pigs have 19 unique haplotypes in total 24 haplotypes of 53 individuals with the highest nucleotide diversity (0.00765). Bayesian tree and median joining network procedures carried out on the data showed that seven Tibetan pig haplotypes were essentially indistinguishable except some unique haplotypes from Hezuo. The AMOVA analysis indicated that the genetic variation mainly occurred within populations (85.41%) but variance among populations was only 14.59%. The unimodal mismatch distribution of haplotypes, together with significant negative values of Fu's F-s and negative values of Tajima's D suggest that a recent population expansion of Tibetan pig has been occurred in Diqing, Hezuo and total population.

In the studies, Coding Sequences (CDS) of MT1, MT2 and MT3 genes from Chinese-Belgium rabbit were cloned and sequenced. The results showed: CDS length of MT1, MT2 and MT3 was 186, 186 and 201 bp, respectively, encoded 61, 61 and 66 amino acids, respectively. Amino acid sequence of MTs includes 7 typical Cys-Xaa-Cys motifs and 20 cysteines which form 10 disulfide-bonds. Similarity analysis showed that the similarity of MT1 and MT2 reached to 87.6%; the similarity of MT2 and MT3 was 78.0%; the similarity of MT3 and MT1 was 76.3%. Alignment and cluster analysis of MTs genes from different species suggest MTs are high conserved but different subtype of MTs genes have separated and formed in the early stages of the evolution of species and then they individually evolve.

To explore the reason of the disease, samples of the liver and lung tissue, acquired sterilely in a typically sickened pig were intended for pathogenic detection. The suspicious strain, named after SCAB-1 was diagnosed which depended on cultural characteristics, morphologic observation and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) experiment. Its pathogenicity was diagnosed by the virulence test on mice. And the strain was exactly identified by the analysis of 16S rDNA sequence with its resistance inspected by sensitive test. According to cultural characteristics, morphology, NAD experiment and the analysis of 16S rDNA sequence, it revealed that the study triumphantly isolated a strain of Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia which could lead a mouse to death, after infected 16 h and depend on NAD. The homology of the 16S rDNA sequence between SCAB-1 and Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia is highly 99.9%. SCAB-1, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia is susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, norfloxacin, SMZco; moderately sensitive to cefazolin, cefoperazone and resistance to cephaloridine IV, vancomycin and gentamycin.

Changes in inflorescence protein during advanced stages of floret development in Buchloe dactyloides (Poaceae)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Buchloe dactyloides; Sex differentiation; Floret; Proteome; Inflorescence	PROTEOMICS; BUFFALOGRASS; MAIZE; DIFFERENTIATION; IDENTIFICATION; FLOWERS	Buffalograss, Buchloe dactyloides, is a dioecious species native to the Great Plains of North America. The florets at the early stages of development possess both gynoecium and androecium organ primordia but later become unisexual. Very little is known about the proteomic changes that occur when the florets change from hermaphroditism to unisexuality. We compared the protein composition of florets at the hermaphroditic stage with that at the unisexual stage. The development stage of the floret was determined by stereomicroscopic observation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to separate the proteins extracted from female and male inflorescences. Stage-specific protein maps, with an average of about 400 spots per map, were analyzed with the protein analysis software. Eighteen spots were found to be differentially expressed between the hermaphrodite and unisexual stages. Of these, 12 were present at both stages but with a different expression value. Four specific spots appeared at the hermaphrodite stage and disappeared at the unisexual stage. Two specific protein spots were associated with female and male floret differentiation. One appears to be associated with contabescence in the female floret and the final protein appears to lead to the abortion of gynoecium in the male floret. The MALDI TOF/TOF technique was used for peptide mass fingerprinting of the differentially expressed proteins and the MASCOT software was used to search the protein database. However, only two protein spots were identified from the database. These were aldolase1 and Os05g0574400 (similar to malate dehydrogenase). This type of proteomic study can help to identify novel protein products and determine the mechanisms involved in the floral sex differentiation process in buffalo grass.

Genetic effect of the prolactin receptor gene on egg production traits in chickens	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						DNA polymorphism; PRLR gene; Egg production traits; Chicken	GROWTH-FACTOR-I; REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS; CANDIDATE GENE; KNOCKOUT MICE; POLYMORPHISMS; ASSOCIATION; BROODINESS; LINE	The identification and utilization of potential candidate genes with significant effects on economically important traits have become increasingly important in poultry breeding programs. The prolactin (PRLR) receptor is a specific receptor for prolactin, which is an anterior pituitary peptide hormone involved in various physiological activities and is essential for reproductive success. In chickens, the PRLR gene resides on the Z chromosome. We used a pooled DNA sequencing approach for identifying SNPs of the PRLR gene. Three hundred and nine-six Erlang Mountainous chicken hens were genotyped for six SNPs using PCR-SSCP and PCR-sequencing methods; the association with chicken egg production traits was studied using general linear model procedures. Three linked SNPs (G14952A, A14969C and G14984A) at the P1 locus, two linked SNPs (G17560A and T17626A) at the P2 locus, and one SNP (T20868C) at the P3 locus were identified. Eight haplotypes were reconstructed on the basis of the six SNPs. The general linear model analysis indicated that there were significant associations of certain genotypes and haplotypes with some egg production traits. We conclude that chicken PRLR gene polymorphisms are associated with egg production traits and have potential as molecular markers for chicken breeding.	[Zhang, L.; Li, D. Y.; Liu, Y.

One hundred and twenty weaned pigs (half castrated males and half females) were reared and slaughtered at a predestinated slaughter age. The general carcass and meat quality traits were measured and analyzed. The DLY and PIC crosses had significantly heavier live weights (93.39 and 96.33 kg, P < 0.01), significantly higher dressing percentages (80.65 and 79.39%, P < 0.05), significantly bigger loin areas (42.69 and 43.91 cm(2), P < 0.001), and significantly more lean carcasses (65.78 and 66.40%, P < 0.001) than LM and DLM. On the other hand, LM had a significantly lower live weight (70.29 kg, P < 0.01), significantly thicker back fat (3.54 cm, P < 0.001), significantly less lean carcasses (46.82%, P < 0.001), and significantly less ham and breech (26.53%, P < 0.05) than the other crossbreeds. Among meat quality parameters, LM had the highest intramuscular fat content (5.02%, P < 0.001) and the smallest fiber area (3126.45 mu m(2), P < 0.01). However, PIC showed the lowest pH(1) (5.82, P < 0.01) and pH(2) (5.63, P < 0.01), the highest drip loss (2.89%, P < 0.01), and the lowest intramuscular fat (1.35%, P < 0.001). We concluded that LM and DLM had good meat quality traits but poorer carcass traits than DLY and PIC; DLY had good carcass and meat quality traits; PIC had good carcass traits, but it had less intramuscular fat, lower pH and higher drip loss.

Fifty-five wild accessions of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) were collected from southwest China (Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet), and their genetic diversity was analyzed using simple sequence repeat markers. A total of 267 polymorphic bands were detected with 18 primer combinations. The genetic similarity among the accessions ranged from 0.688 to 0.894 with an average of 0.797. All 55 wild accessions were clustered into 7 eco-geographic groups. Our data showed that the dendrogram was almost in accordance with geographic distribution, and accessions from the same collection sites tended to be clustered into the same group. A genetic differentiation analysis revealed that the percentage of genetic variance was 70.07 and 29.93% within and among groups, respectively. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for C. dactylon in southwest China.

In this study, a multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the characteristics of codon bias and the main factors affecting synonymous codon usage in Brachypodium. We found that low- and high-GC content genes with different codon usage occur frequently in the genome. The results of neutrality, correspondence, and correlation analyses indicated that mutational pressure and selective constraint were the main factors in shaping codon usage. Coding sequence length and the hydrophobicity of each protein were also identified as influences on codon usage bias, although their effect was minor. In addition, 27 codons, defined as "optimal codons", might provide useful information for gene engineering, gene prediction, and molecular evolution studies.

The Effects of Different Types of Feed Flavors on Feed Intake and Feeding Behaviors in Growing Pigs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND VETERINARY ADVANCES			English	Article						Feed flavor; feeding behavior; growing pig; sweetener; basal diet	SCANNING-ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; WEANLING PIGS; TASTE; PERFORMANCE; FOOD; SWEETENERS; SELECTION; PAPILLAE; EXPOSURE; STIMULI	The experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of different feed flavors on feed intake and intake behavior in growing pigs under auto feeding system. A total of 30 barrows (Landrace x Yorkshire) of 95 days old were selected and allocated to 1 of 5 treatments by BW for this 14 days experiment. There were 6 replicates in each treatment and 1 pig in each replicate. Diets containing: CON, the basal diet; BF, CON + 400 mg kg(-1) banana flavor; MF, CON + 400 mg kg(-1) sow milky flavor; SF, CON + 150 mg kg(-1) sweetener and BMS, CON + 400 mg kg(-1) banana flavor + 400 mg kg(-1) milky flavor + 150 mg kg(-1) sweetener. The ADFI in BF, MY, SF and BMS complex group was enhanced compared to the CON, respectively. The ADO and feed efficiency was respectively increased (p<0.05) related to the control treatment. The feed intake speeds and feed intake time of fruit, milky, sweetener and complex group were increased (p<0.05) than control. The results indicated that feed flavors affect feed intake behavior by elevating the feed intake speed and reducing the time of feed intake to enhance the feed intake of growing pigs and no difference was found between the three flavors.

Downstream of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal signaling pathways, liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is involved in female gonadal hormone synthesis. In the chicken, although the two genes are known to be associated with reproductive traits, the interaction between gonadotropins and gonadal steroids remains unclear. We used quantitative real-time PCR to quantify the tissular (hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, liver, kidney, oviduct, heart) and ontogenetic (12, 18, 32, and 45 weeks) mRNA expression profiles of CALM and LRH-1 in Erlang Mountainous chickens to determine their roles in the endocrine control of fertility, and compared these profiles with expression in Roman chickens. We found that the relative expressions of CALM and LRH-1 genes had the highest levels in the pituitary and ovary at 32 weeks. The expression level of CALM mRNA in the pituitary of Roman chickens was significantly higher than that in Erlang Mountainous chickens at 32 and 45 weeks, while the LRH-1 transcript level in the ovaries of Roman chickens was significantly lower than that of Erlang Mountainous chickens at 32 and 45 weeks. In summary, the transcript levels of CALM and LRH-1 genes are associated with chicken reproductive traits; in addition, we found that the CALM gene is the key regulator in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal signaling network.

Methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism analysis of fat and muscle tissues in pigs	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Pig; Fat; Muscle; DNA methylation; MSAP	X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION; DNA-METHYLATION; WIDE	DNA methylation may be involved in regulating the expression of protein-coding genes, resulting in different fat and muscle phenotypes. Using a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism approach, we obtained 7423 bands by selective amplification of genomic DNA from six different fat depots and two heterogeneous muscle types from Duroc/Landrace/Yorkshire cross-bred pigs. The degrees of DNA methylation, determined by the percentages of hemi-and fully methylated sites relative to the total number of CCGG sites, were similar in male and female pigs for each specific tissue [chi(2) test; P (two-tailed) > 0.05]. Gender bias was therefore ignored. There were significant differences in the degree of DNA methylation among the eight tissue types [chi(2) test; P-total (two-tailed) = 0.009]. However, similar degrees of methylation were observed among the six fat depots [chi(2) test; P-fat (two-tailed) = 0.24 > 0.05] and between the two muscle types [chi(2) test; P-muscle (two-tailed) = 0.76 > 0.05]. We conclude that the degree of DNA methylation differs between porcine fat and muscle tissue, but that the methylation status of a particular tissue type is similar, despite being deposited at different body sites.

DEV leads to heavy economic losses to the commercial duck industry due to its high mortality rate and decrease in egg production. With development of molecular biology, more information about DEV genes is reported, nonetheless little information is known about DEV UL29 gene and its product major DNA-binding protein or infected-cell protein 8 (ICP8). The sequence characteristics of DEV UL29 gene was initially showed in our article. Phylogenetic tree analysis provided useful proof that DEV belongs to the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. The predicted characteristics of ICP8 amino acid sequence showed that ICP8 possesses good immunogenicity and is a hydrophobic protein. These findings correlate with the experimental results that ICP8 protein forms inclusion bodies in the prokaryotic expression system. By immunofluorescence we have identified ICP8 as nuclear protein. All the fundamental data in this article contribute to understanding the functions of DEV UL29 gene and its product ICP8.

In order to understand this virus better, truncated UL27 gene (tUL27) was used to construct pET-28a-tUL27 recombinant plasmid. The tUL27 gene product, truncated gB protein (tgB), was used to prepare rabbit anti-tgB protein polyclonal antibody. The polyclonal antibody was used for characteristics of DEV glycoprotein B (gB) intracellular localization. Protein gB was firstly detected in nuclear membrane of the infected DEF, and later during the infection it appeared as the punctiform fluorescence in cytoplasm. We also proved that DEV gB is a late protein. Localization of DEV gB in nuclear membrane, suggested a possible role in virus assembly, while appearance in cytoplasm suggests its role in viral egress. All these data provide a basal and useful knowledge about the functions of DEV UL27 gene and its product gB.

The anti-SRBC titer and other immune traits were measured in up-selected (H), down-selected (L) and Control (C) lines in each Generation (G0-G4) and reproductive traits were measured in G4. In the 4th generation, the difference in SRBC titers (measured on days 61) between the selected lines was 7.18 versus 6.1 0, a 17% increase in the H compared to the L lines. The heritability of SRBC titer was 0.26. The genetic correlations between anti-SRBC and IgG (0.87) and IgM (0.81) were high and those between SRBC titers and those against AI (0.56), ND (0.48) and the H/L ratio (0.58) were moderate. Immune and reproductive traits compared among the H, L and C lines in the final Generation (G4) showed that AI, ND and IgM were improved significantly (p<0.05) by selection for SRBC but the age at first lay was slightly delayed (0.48 days) in the H line. This study demonstrates that selecting for antibody response to SRBC improves other immune traits consistent with broad disease resistance of chickens.

Therefore, soil faunas were investigated in both the soil organic layer (OL) and mineral soil layer (ML) in the primary fir (Abies faxoniana) forest (PF), fir and birch (Betula albosinensis) mixed forest (MF) and secondary fir forest (SF) in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau every ten days between March 5 and April 25, 2009. Soil macrofauna was picked up by hand in the fields. Mesofauna was collected and separated from the soil samples by Baermann and Tullgren methods, respectively. The dominated species of macrofauna belonged to Coleoptera and Diptera at the early stage of soil thawing, and to Coleoptera, Diptera, Araneae and Hymenoptera at the later stage. However, the dominated species of mesofauna belonged to Nematode, Collembola, and Acari in the whole soil thawing. The density, number of taxa, and diversity index of soil fauna showed significant change with temperature fluctuations and reached an obvious peak when soil temperatures rising above 0 degrees C. The density and number of taxa of macrofauna in both the OL and ML were the lowest on March 5 in the three forests, but the density of mesofauna in both the OL and ML was the highest on March 25, except for the ML in the PF. These results implied that soil fauna community was sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which is important in understanding the ecological processes in the winter-spring transitional period.

These three genes expressed in several of tissues and organs in vertebrates. In order to investigate whether or not the relationships between Pax3, Pax7 and MyoD in other tissues are still similar with that in skeletal muscle, we detected the expression of Pax3, Pax7 and MyoD in duck different tissues and organs using real-time PCR technical. Results showed that these three genes not only expressed in skeletal muscle tissues, but also expressed in other tissues like heart, brain, spleen, fat and so on. The Pax3 and Pax7 also have coordinate roles in heart, spleen and brain, which are similar with that in skeletal muscle. Results indicate that the MyoD, Pax3 and Pax7 may involve in other tissues development besides skeletal muscle in duck and may also act on a similar mechanism between Pax3/7 and MyoD in skeletal muscle.

In this experiment, broilers were administered corn that was naturally contaminated with AFB(1) and AFB(2). We found that the broilers were more sensitive during the starter period and had a poor performance during the grower period. In addition, the broilers showed a significant reduction in feed intake when consuming material contaminated with 134.0 and 23.6 mu g/kg of AFB(1) and AFB(2), respectively. Our results also demonstrate that villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth significantly decreased when the broilers were fed daily with diets contaminated with AFB(1) and AFB(2). Furthermore, AFB(1) residues in livers and breast muscles were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) at levels of 0.137 and 0.016 mu g/kg, respectively. The AFM(1) residue was also detected in livers at a level of 0.051 mu g/kg but it was not detectable in breast muscles.

The scores of percent ratooning germinability (PRG) and overwintering germinability (POG) were evaluated. The overwintering germination rate of axillary buds was scored to represent the overwintering germinability. Two significant QTLs (qPRG-4 and qPRG-7) on chromosomes 4 and 7 were detected and explained 8.3 and 7.2% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. Three significant QTLs (qPOG-2, qPOG-3 and qPOG-7) were identified and mapped on chromosomes 2, 3, and 7, respectively. These QTLs contributed 9.6, 6.7, and 17.8% of phenotypic variations, respectively. A comparative analysis using SSR markers closely linked to the three QTLs for the overwintering revealed cold-tolerant individuals, which harbour the Glutinous rice 89-1 alleles at RM7110, RM250, RM418, and RM232, had a high percent overwintering germinability, while cold-sensitive individuals, which carry Shuhui 527 alleles at these loci, had a low percent overwintering germinability in the F-2 population of Shuhui 527/Glutinous rice 89-1. This study demonstrated the utility of these SSR markers for selection of overwintering germinability genotypes.

The Chinese wheat cultivar Chuanmai 32 has shown stable resistance to stripe rust for 10 yr in Sichuan Province, a hotspot for stripe rust epidemics. The objective of the present study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in a population of 140 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Chuanmai 32/Chuanyu 12. Field trials were conducted in Chengdu and Yaan, Sichuan, from 2005 to 2008, providing stripe rust reaction data for 6 environments. 797 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened for association with stripe rust reaction, initially through bulked segregant analysis (BSA). Based on the mean disease values averaged across environments, the broad-sense heritability of maximum disease severity (MDS) was 0.75. Two QTLs for stripe rust resistance were detected by composite interval mapping (CIM). They were designated QYr.caas-3BL and QYr.caas-3BS and explained from 6.6 to 20.1%, respectively, of the phenotypic variance across environments. QYr.caas-3BL came from Chuanmai 32; QYr.caas-3BS with lower effect was from the susceptible parent Chuanyu 12. Both QTLs appear to be new.

An alternative cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-based protocol for RNA isolation from blackberry (Rubus L.)

We developed a novel protocol based on the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method to isolate high-quality RNA from blackberry plant tissues, especially fruits. Most DNA was removed when acetic acid was utilized, before RNA precipitation. Thus, lithium chloride, a reagent widely used for RNA purification, was not needed. The isolation time was shortened to less than 3 h. The RNA was quite pure, with little DNA contamination. The quality of the RNA was assessed by spectrophotometric readings and electrophoresis on agarose gels. It was good enough for downstream enzymatic reactions, such as reverse transcription-PCR, cloning and real-time PCR assay. The method yielded an amount of total RNA comparable to previously described protocols.	[Chen, Q.; Yu, H. W.; Wang, X. R.; Xie, X. L.; Yue, X. Y.; Tang, H.

Molecular diversity and population structure of the forage grass Hemarthria compressa (Poaceae) in south China based on SRAP markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Hemarthria compressa; Genetic diversity; SRAP; Population structure	GENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; CLONAL DIVERSITY; RAPD MARKERS; ISSR MARKERS; LINKAGE MAP; AFLP; SYSTEMS; RFLP	Hemarthria compressa is one of the most important and widely utilized forage crops in south China, owing to its high forage yield and capability of adaptation to hot and humid conditions. We examined the population structure and genetic variation within and among 12 populations of H. compressa in south China using sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. High genetic diversity was found in these samples [percentage polymorphic bands (PPB) = 82.21%, Shannon's diversity index (I) = 0.352]. However, there was relatively low level of genetic diversity at the population level (PPB = 29.17%, I = 0.155). A high degree of genetic differentiation among populations was detected based on other measures and molecular markers (Nei's genetic diversity analysis: G(ST) = 54.19%; AMOVA analysis: F-ST = 53.35%). The SRAP markers were found to be more efficient than ISSR markers for evaluating population diversity. Based on these findings, we propose changes in sampling strategies for appraising and utilizing the genetic resources of this species.

POACEAE; MARGINAL POPULATIONS; ALASKANUS; MARKERS; PLANTS; FLOW; DIFFERENTIATION; TRACHYCAULUS; ALLOZYME; GLAUCUS	Genetic diversity of Elymus sibiricus (Poaceae) was examined in eight populations from the southeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We detected 291 RAPD polymorphic loci in 93 samples. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 79%. Genetic diversity (H-E) was 0.264, effective number of alleles (N-E) was 1.444, Shannon's information index (H-O) was 0.398, and expected Bayesian heterozygosity (H-B) was 0.371. At the population level, PPB = 51%, N-E = 1.306, H-E = 0.176, I = 0.263, and H-B = 0.247. A high level of genetic differentiation was detected based on Nei's genetic diversity analysis (G(ST) = 32.0%), Shannon's index analysis (33.7%), and the Bayesian method (theta(B) = 33.5%). The partitioning of molecular variance by AMOVA demonstrated significant genetic differentiation within populations (60%) and among populations (40%). The average number of individuals exchanged between populations per generation (N-m) was 1.06. The populations were found to share high levels of genetic identity. No significant correlation was found between geographic distance and pairwise genetic distance (r = 0.7539, P = 0.9996). Correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.762) between RAPD H-E found in this study and ISSR H-E values from a previous study.

During gestation, primiparous Yorkshire sows were fed a Control diet (folic acid 1.3 mg/kg) or a folic acid-supplemented diet (folic acid 30 mg/kg) with 16 replicates per diet. During the 28-d lactation period, sows were fed a common diet. Compared with NBW piglets, hepatic ATP concentrations and mtDNA contents were decreased in IUGR piglets. Furthermore, IUGR piglets exhibited lower membrane potential and decreased oxygen consumption in liver mitochondria, but these parameters were not affected by maternal folic acid supplementation. Intrauterine growth retardation decreased mRNA expression abundance of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha, mitochondrial transcription factor A, uncoupling protein 3, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and IV. Impaired antioxidant capacity characterised by increased malondialdehyde content and decreased manganese-superoxide dismutase activity was also observed in IUGR pigs. In IUGR piglets, however, nearly all of these parameters were normalised to the level of NBW piglets when the maternal diet was supplemented with folic acid during pregnancy. Hence, maternal folic acid supplementation was proved to be an effective way to reverse the changes in gene expressions in IUGR pigs, which provided a possible nutritional strategy to improve growth development of IUGR individuals.

We have developed an indica restorer line 7302R that displays the IPA phenotype in terms of tiller number, grain number, and stem strength. However, its mechanism had to be clarified. We performed re-sequencing and genome-wide variation analysis of 7302R using the Solexa sequencing technology. With the genomic sequence of the indica cultivar 9311 as reference, 307 627 SNPs, 57 372 InDels, and 3 096 SVs were identified in the 7302R genome. The 7302R-specific variations were investigated via the synteny analysis of all the SNPs of 7302R with those of the previous sequenced none-IPA-type lines IR24, MH63, and SH527. Moreover, we found 178 168 7302R-specific SNPs across the whole genome and 30 239 SNPs in the predicted mRNA regions, among which 8 517 were Non-syn CDS. In addition, 263 large-effect SNPs that were expected to affect the integrity of encoded proteins were identified from the 7302R-specific SNPs. SNPs of several important previously cloned rice genes were also identified by aligning the 7302R sequence with other sequence lines.

We characterized the fir (Abies faxoniana) litter decomposition over a whole winter (November 2008 to April 2009) during the late autumn, deep winter, and early spring stages. The mass loss, nutrient release, and quality change of fir litter were determined using the litterbag method at 2700, 3000, 3300, and 3600 m altitude in southwest China. Over the winter an average of 18% mass, 27% C, 50% N, 40% P, 36% K, 30% cellulose, and 14% lignin were lost. Of these total losses, a majority loss of mass (70%), C (65%), N (50%), P (58%), K (42%), cellulose (70%), and lignin (68%) occurred during the deep winter stage. The highest loss rate of mass (19.2%) and lignin (16.4%) but the lowest N loss (47.9%) was at the highest 3600 m altitude. Soil freeze-thaw cycle resulted in significant losses of mass, while mass loss rate did not increase under the higher mean soil temperature during each stage. Our results confirmed that the physical process seemed to be the most important process for cold season decomposition in the cold biome.

D. jiajiangense is pollinator-specific, being pollinated by Andrena parvula. There exists considerable mechanical fit between the floral morphology of D. jiajiangense and A. parvula. Importantly, A. parvula uses D. jiajiangense flowers as shelter both during rainy weather and at night during sunny weather. This significantly increase the pollination success of D. jiajiangens. D. jiajiangense is self-compatible but pollinator-dependent for fruit set. Fruit set of D. jiajiangens was 100% after hand-self-pollination, but seed viability was normally greatly reduced.

Although not significant, there was a trend towards reduced interferon-gamma concentration in the challenged pigs compared to the controls, especially at 14 and 21 days postinoculation (dpi). Biotin supplementation with 50 or 200 mu g/kg biotin improved these levels, with higher doses producing an earlier and stronger response. Although the magnitude of the immune response was small and inconsistent, diet supplementation with 50 or 200 mu g/kg biotin appeared to increase serum immunoglobulin G levels. We conclude that PCV2 inoculation depressed, while biotin supplementation increased, the immune response of weanling piglets.

However, the sequence polymorphisms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and association with milk production traits in Holstein cows have remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of mtDNA ATPase 8/6 genes and association with four milk production traits of interest in 303 Holstein cows. A total of 18 SNPs were detected among the 842 bp fragment of ATPase 8/6 genes, which determined six haplotypes of B. taurus (H1-H4) and B. indicus (H5-H6). The mixed model analysis revealed that there was significant association between haplotype and 305-day milk yield (MY). The highest MY was observed in haplotype H4. However, we did not detect statistically significant differences among haplotypes for the traits of milk fat (MF), milk protein (MP), and somatic cell count (SC). The overall haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity of ATPase 8/6 genes were 0.563 +/- 0.030 and 0.00609 +/- 0.00043, respectively. The results suggested that mitochondrial ATPase 8/6 genes could be potentially used as molecular marker to genetically improve milk production in Holstein cows.

In the present study, we established a reliable and cost-effective molecular method of species identification for common farm animals. We first (re-)analyzed 179 mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene sequences of ten farm animal species to determine the intra-species and species-specific variations. The PCR-RFLP method was subsequently designed to identify these species by using endonucleases BshNI, ScaI, AluI, and BfaI. The poultry and livestock species were first discriminated by one double-digestion of both BshNI and ScaI, which generated different fragment patterns (325 bp and 115 bp for poultry vs. 364 bp and 76 bp for livestock). The ten species could be further discerned according to species-specific restriction pattern by subjecting to digestion of AluI and BfaI, respectively. Our approach would be more reliable by taking the intra-species variations into consideration and could be applied to species identity test, commercial fraud, and wildlife crime.

The results showed: CDS length of MT1, MT2 and MT3 was 186, 186 and 201 bp, respectively encoded 61, 61 and 66 amino acids, respectively. Amino acid sequence of MTs includes 7 typical Cys-Xaa-Cys motifs and 20 cysteines which form 10 disulfide-bonds. Similarity analysis showed that the similarity of MT1 and MT2 reached to 87.6%; the similarity of MT2 and MT3 was 78.0%; the similarity of MT3 and MT1 was 76.3%. Alignment and cluster analysis of MTs genes from different species suggest MTs are high conserved but different subtype of MTs genes have separated and formed in the early stages of the evolution of species and then they individually evolve.

Various leaf parts were used as explants to regenerate planners, the stem segments of which were cultured for shoot proliferation and plantlet multiplication. The results showed that the leaf base was the optimal explant, as compared to both the middle and the top of leaves, for shoot formation. The highest shoot induction of 88.9% was observed on MS medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/l TDZ and 0.1 mg/l NAA. Hyperhydric leaves obtained in primary culture developed first into abnormal somatic embryos 10 days after subculture, and then into hyperhydric planners after an additional 10 days. The hyperhydric planners reversed to normal planners when plant growth regulators were removed from culture medium. Further, stem segments from reversed plantlets were used for shoot regeneration and root induction. Optimal shoot regeneration was obtained in MS medium containing 0.6 mg/l TDZ with 0.1 mg/l NAA. Root induction and root mean number were all higher on auxin-free medium than on medium containing auxins.

Previously, Heart Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) gene was studied as a candidate gene which having effect on Intramuscular Fat content (IMF). In current study, we chose four SNPs loci (g.260T>C, g.675G>A, g.783C>T and g.1198T>C) of H-FABP which have been proved to have distinct correlation with IMF as molecular markers to scan SNPs in a new breeding Chinese yellow-feather broiler population. Researchers allocated adaptive individuals into high-IMF group and low-IMF group according to the haplotypes which were constructed of genotypes at four SNP sites of each individual in F, generation and these haplotypes had been proved to be the preponderant or recessive haplotype. The core group was chose from the F, generation based on the traditional breeding method. And then, we detected the genotypes of the four loci by SNPs screening and analyzed the selection effect in F, generation which were obtained from mating and crossing within each group. Results indicated that the preponderance alleles were changed at Locus 1, 3 and 4 in the three groups of F, and there were no significant differences in IMF among the three groups (p>0.05). However, the IMF of the core group and the low fat group was higher than which of high fat group. The result of variance analysis showed that there were no significant difference in the effect of the different genotypes of the four SNPs on IMF (p>0.05). The four loci on the H-FABP gene in the research were not suitable as candidate markers to select IMF in this yellow-feather broiler strain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effect of JKM on immune functions in young broilers. A total of 875; 1 day old male Arbor Acres chickens were fed diets containing 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12% JKM for 21 days, respectively. In the entire experimental period, the level of serum lysozyme showed no significant difference compared with control (p>0.05). Dietary JKM linearly decreased the contents of serum IgA and IgG (p <= 0.05) and markedly increased the contents of serum IgM (p<0.05) and also significantly decreased the percentage of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ in blood (p<0.01) on day 7, 14 and 21. Histopathological studies on 21 days old broilers showed that dietary JKM caused the lesions of thymus, spleen and bursa of Fabricius, exhibiting widely diffuse hemorrhages. These results suggest that dietary JKM at 3-12% could result in immunosuppression or immunodepression in young broilers and the responses followed a dose dependent manner.

The antioxidant activities of the CTCPs were evaluated by reducing power, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical free radical-scavenging assay. As the results, the polysaccharide (W-CTCP, A-CTCPI and A-CTCPII) content was 46.76, 74.05 and 57.68%, respectively. The polysaccharides all exhibited antioxidant activities in vitro and W-CTCP showed the strongest activity. It can be concluded that the polysaccharides extracted from CT should be explored as a potential natural antioxidant agent for use in functional foods or medicine.

A Box-Behnken design was used for experimental design and analysis of the results to obtain the optimal processing parameters. The optimal conditions were extraction temperature 94.75 degrees C, ratio of water to raw material 16.41:1, extraction time 2.67 h. According to analysis, extraction temperature was the most significant factor to affect the yield of polysaccharides from Chinese truffle Tuber sinense. Pharmacological experiments indicated that CTP had potent immunomodulatory effects in immunosuppression mice model. At the dose of 50, 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) body weight, a significant increase (p<0.01) in phagocytosis of macrophage was observed.

Since emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the aetiology of obesity, we conducted a genome-wide methylation analysis on eight different adipose depots of three pig breeds living within comparable environments but displaying distinct fat level using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. We aimed to investigate the systematic association between anatomical location-specific DNA methylation status of different adipose depots and obesity-related phenotypes. We show here that compared to subcutaneous adipose tissues which primarily modulate metabolic indicators, visceral adipose tissues and intermuscular adipose tissue, which are the metabolic risk factors of obesity, are primarily associated with impaired inflammatory and immune responses. This study presents epigenetic evidence for functionally relevant methylation differences between different adipose depots.

Genome-wide significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) provide important information for use in breeding programs of animals such as pigs. QTLs for hematological parameters (hematological traits) have been detected in pig chromosomes, although these are often mapped by linkage analysis to large intervals making identification of the underlying mutation problematic. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the common form of genetic variation among individuals and are thought to account for the majority of inherited traits. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to detect regions of association with hematological traits in a three-generation resource population produced by intercrossing Large White boars and Minzhu sows during the period from 2007 to 2011. Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip technology was used to genotype each animal and seven hematological parameters were measured (hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell count (RBC) and red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW)). Data were analyzed in a three step Genome-wide Rapid Association using the Mixed Model and Regression-Genomic Control (GRAMMAR-GC) method. A total of 62 genome-wide significant and three chromosome-wide significant SNPs associated with hematological parameters were detected in this GWAS. Seven and five SNPs were associated with HCT and HGB, respectively. These SNPs were all located within the region of 34.6-36.5 Mb on SSC7. Four SNPs within the region of 43.7-47.0 Mb and fifty-five SNPs within the region of 42.2-73.8 Mb on SSC8 showed significant association with MCH and MCV, respectively. At chromosome-wide significant level, one SNP at 29.2 Mb on SSC1 and two SNPs within the region of 26.0-26.2 Mb were found to be significantly associated with RBC and RDW, respectively. Many of the SNPs were located within previously reported QTL regions and appeared to narrow down the regions compared with previously described QTL intervals. In current research, a total of seven significant SNPs were found within six candidate genes SCUBE3, KDR, TDO, IGFBP7, ADAMTS3 and AFP. In addition, the KIT gene, which has been previously reported to relate to hematological parameters, was located within the region significantly associated with MCH and MCV and could be a candidate gene. These results of this study may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of hematological parameters in pigs.

Characterization of the FaVRT-2 gene encoding a MADS-box transcription factor responsive to vernalization in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						MADS-box; induction kinetics; subcellular localization; tall fescue; vernalization	FLORAL MERISTEM IDENTITY; FLOWERING REPRESSOR; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS; WHEAT; ARABIDOPSIS; EXPRESSION; TRANSITION; SVP; AGAMOUS-LIKE-24; CEREALS	Delay of floral transition is a valuable trait in commercially important turfgrass species. It has been reported that short vegetative phase (SVP)-like proteins, potential repressors of the floral inductive pathway, control the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase. A homolog of SVP-like genes was isolated from tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) by 50-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3'-RACE and designated as F. arundinacea VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION gene-2 (FaVRT-2). It encodes a putative protein of 226 amino acids with a conserved MADS (M) domain, a Keratin-like (K) domain, and a C-terminal (C) domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that FaVRT-2 is most closely related to VRT-2 proteins from ryegrass, barley, and wheat and belongs to the StMADS11 subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors. Subcellular localization showed that the FaVRT-2 protein accumulates in the nucleus suggesting a role as trans acting factor. FaVRT-2 transcripts accumulate abundantly in roots and stems and is moderately present in leaves under normal conditions (without non-vernalization treatment). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed similar transcriptional patterns of FaVRT-2 under both vernalization and non-vernalization conditions. However, the peak of FaVRT-2 transcripts under vernalization condition occurred 14 days earlier than that found under non-vernalization condition. These results support the hypothesis that FaVRT-2, a putative repressor of floral transition, is regulated by vernalization in tall fescue.

Effects of Zearalenone on IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma mRNA Levels in the Splenic Lymphocytes of Chickens	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							IN-VITRO; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; ALPHA-ZEARALENOL; FUMONISIN B-1; OCHRATOXIN-A; MYCOTOXINS; EXPRESSION; CELLS; DEOXYNIVALENOL; PROLIFERATION	Zearalenone (ZEN) is an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species, which can contaminate food and feed. These compounds elicit a wide spectrum of toxic effects, including the capacity to alter normal immune function. In this study, the in vitro effects of the treatment of ConA-stimulated splenic lymphocytes with ZEN (0-25 mu g/mL) were examined. ZEN modulates the expression of IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. The IL-2 levels were up to fourfold higher (P < 0.05) compared with the levels in the control at toxin concentrations of 25 mu g/mL after 48 h of treatment. The IL-6 levels were critically suppressed at this concentration; these changes were very statistically significant (P < 0.05). At lower ZEN concentrations (0.1, 0.4 and 1.6 mu g/mL), the IFN-gamma levels changed slightly; however at 6.25 and 25 mu g/mL, the IFN-gamma results reached statistical significance compared with the control levels (P < 0.05). These data suggest that ZEN has potent effects on the expression of chicken splenic lymphocytes cytokines at the mRNA level.	[Wang, Y. C.; Deng, J.

QTLs for days to silking in a recombinant inbred line maize population subjected to high and low nitrogen regimes	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Maize (Zea mays L.); Days to silking; Nitrogen regime; Quantitative trait locus; Recombinant inbred line	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; TROPICAL MAIZE; RIL POPULATION; YIELD; IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; RESISTANCE; EFFICIENCY; INTERVAL	Days to silking (DTS) is one of the most important traits in maize (Zea mays). To investigate its genetic basis, a recombinant inbred line population was subjected to high and low nitrogen (N) regimes to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with DTS. Three QTLs were identified under the high N regime; these explained 25.4% of the phenotypic variance. Due to additive effects, the QTL on chromosome 6 increased DTS up to 0.66 days; while the other two QTLs mapped on chromosome 9 (one linked with Phi061 and the other linked with Nc134) decreased DTS 0.89 and 0.91 days, respectively. Under low N regime, two QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 6 and 9, which accounted for 25.9% of the phenotypic variance. Owing to additive effects, the QTL on chromosome 6 increased DTS 0.67 days, while the other QTL on chromosome 9 decreased it 1.48 days. The QTL on chromosome 6, flanked by microsatellite markers Bnlg1600 and Phi077, was detected under both N regimes. In conclusion, we identified four QTLs, one on chromosome 6 and three on chromosome 9. These results contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of DTS and will be useful for developing marker-assisted selection in maize breeding programs.	[Liu, X.

Variation of genomic DNA methylation in the nitrate reductase gene of sibling tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cultivars	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Tobacco; Sibling cultivars; Methylation; NR gene; Intron variation	STRUCTURAL GENE; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; MOLECULAR-CLONING; ARABIDOPSIS; EVOLUTION; PLANTS; WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM	To better understand genomic DNA methylation in sibling plant cultivars, methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism analysis was used to investigate two sibling tobacco cultivars, Yunyan85 and Yunyan87, and their two parents, K326 and Yunyan No. 2. Differences in the degree of genomic DNA methylation were found among the four tobacco cultivars. Compared with parents, the two sibling cultivars had fewer methylated sites. Twenty-nine methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism fragments that exhibited methylation alteration in the four tobacco cultivars were recovered and sequenced. BLAST (nucleotide BLAST) searches showed that two of the 29 sequences have 99% similarity with nucleotides 1442-1694 of the nia-1 gene and the other 27 sequences contain GC, CAAT or TATA box. The nitrate reductase genes from Yunyan87, K326 and Yunyan No. 2 were found to be identical; however, the third intron of the nitrate reductase gene from Yunyan85 was different compared to the third introns of Yunyan87, K326 and Yunyan No. 2. We conclude that methylation alteration of promoter regions could be responsible for the different phenotypes in tobacco and that introns of the nitrate reductase gene can vary as a result of intra-species crossing in tobacco.

SRAP analysis of genetic diversity of nine native populations of wild sugarcane, Saccharum spontaneum, from Sichuan, China	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Saccharum spontaneum; SRAP; Genetic diversity; Diversity index; Genetic structure	PCR; L.	Saccharum spontaneum is a wild sugarcane species that is native to and widely distributed in China. It has been extensively used in sugarcane breeding programs, and is being tested for the development of bioenergy cultivars. In order to provide basic information for the exploitation of this species, we analyzed genetic variation among and within native S. spontaneum populations collected from Sichuan, China. Eighty plants from nine native populations were sampled. Twenty-one sequence-related amplified polymorphism primer pairs generated 235 clearly scorable bands, of which 185 were polymorphic (78.7%). Nei's genetic diversity was 0.2801 and Shannon's information index was 0.4155 across the populations. Genetic diversity parameters, G(ST) value (0.2088) and N-m value (1.8944), showed that the genetic variation within populations was greater than that among populations. In the cluster analysis, one major grouping was formed by populations from Ya'an and another one by populations from Sichuan basin; a population from Baoxing formed a single cluster. In order to fully comprehend the genetic diversity of cold-tolerant local germplasm in this species, germplasm should be collected from the heterogeneous environments along the northern regions of this species' distribution. The germplasm that we collected should be a valuable resource for Saccharum breeding.	[Chang, D.; Yan, J. J.; Bai, S. Q.; Liang, X.

Differential expression analysis of porcine MDH1, MDH2 and ME1 genes in adipose tissues	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Pig; MDH1; MDH2; ME1; mRNA; Adipose; qRT-PCR	HIGH-FAT DIET; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; PCR DATA; LIVER; PROTEINS; BACKFAT; MUSCLE	Malate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (MDH1 and MDH2), and malic enzyme 1 (ME1) play important roles in the Krebs cycle for energy metabolism. The mRNA abundance changes of MDH1, MDH2 and ME1 genes were measured across six different adipose tissues from the leaner Landrace and fatty Rongchang pig breeds using quantitative real-time PCR. The mRNA of MDH1, MDH2 and ME1 was more abundant in fatty Rongchang pigs than in leaner Landrace pigs. In both breeds, females exhibited higher adipocyte volume and mRNA abundance of MDH1, MDH2 and ME1 compared with males. These values were higher in the subcutaneous adipose tissue compared with visceral adipose tissue. Furthermore, mRNA abundance changes of MDH1, MDH2 and ME1 have the remarked significant positive correlation with adipocyte volume across the six adipose tissue types. We conclude that there are breed-, gender- and tissue-specific expression patterns of ME1, MDH1 and MDH2, which highlight their potential as candidate genes for selecting for fat volume in pigs.

Lesions were observed in experiment. Histopathologically, lymphopenia and congestion were observed in the medulla of thymic lobule. Ultrastructurally, there were more apoptosis lymphocytes, and the mitochondria of lymphocytes were swelled in thymus of methionine deficiency. The G(0)/G(1), phase of the cell cycle of the thymus was much higher (P<0.01), and the S, G(2)+M phases and proliferating index (PI) were lower (P<0.01) in methionine deficiency than in control group. And the percentage of apoptotic cells in the thymus was significantly increased in methionine deficiency (P<0.01). The percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells was decreased in methionine deficiency compared with control group. Meanwhile, the proliferation function of peripheral blood T-cell was decreased in methionine deficiency. Also, the serum IL-2 contents were decreased in methionine deficiency. It was concluded that methionine deficiency could cause pathological and ultrastructural changes of thymus, reduce the T-cell population, serum IL-2 contents and the proliferation function of T-cells, and induce increased percentage of apoptotic cells. The cellular immune function was finally impaired in broilers.

In this study, 19 representative elite maize inbred lines and 3 hybrid varieties were investigated at the seedling stage, which can accumulate Pb and Cd in the stems and leaves, respectively. The results demonstrated that significant differences are among inbred lines for accumulation of heavy metals, implying that the Cd accumulation is significant correlation between the male parents and their hybrids and some inbred lines have been selected for cross-breeding with low Pb or Cd accumulation, such as S37, 9782, and ES40; Moreover, some inbred lines could be suitable for phytoremediation species for soil bioremediation with high levels of Pb and Cd accumulation, including 178, R08, 48-2, and Mo17ht.

The results showed that malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly higher (p<0.01) in high F groups ll and III than in the control group. In contrast, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione (GSH) contents, and ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical were significantly decreased (p<0.01) in high F groups II and III in comparison with those in the control group. In conclusion, dietary F, in the range of 800-1200 mg/kg, could induce oxidative damage and impair the antioxidation and immune function of the cecal tonsil in broilers.

There were 257 variation sites amounting to 40.8% of the total base pairs. All of the data revealed abundant genetic diversity in the genus Salvia. The results showed that the tested materials could be grouped into 3 clusters, and the 3 different occasions in Salvia were clustered into 1 clade, which suggests that the species from different occasions form independent lineages. We can easily distinguish S. miltiorrhiza from a variety of Salvia species in this manner. Moreover, according to cluster analysis, S. bowleyana, S. yunnanensis, and S. cavaleriei var. simplelefolia are good or potential germplasm resources for S. miltiorrhiza.

Chromosome preparations were obtained from the mitotic metaphase of early embryonic cells in the egg mass using the air-drying method (splash technique) and Giemsa staining. The results of the study suggest that the bisexual race has a typical haemaphysalid karyotype. The chromosome number of the bisexual female diploid was 2n = 22 (20 + XX). They had a karyotype formula of 2n = 10m + 2sm + 2st + 8t. X chromosomes were prominent by their large size.

High fertility rates depend on completion of successful pregnancies. To understand the molecular signals associated with pregnancy in sows, expression profiling experiments were conducted to identify differentially expressed genes in ovary and myometrium at different pregnancy periods using the Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip (TM). A total of 974, 1800, 335 and 710 differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the myometrium during early pregnancy (EP) and late pregnancy (LP), and in the ovary during EP and LP, respectively. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clusters indicated the differentially expressed genes belonged to 7 different functional groups. Based on BLASTX searches and Gene Ontology (GO) classifications, 129 unique genes closely related to pregnancy showed differential expression patterns. GO analysis also indicated that there were 21 different molecular function categories, 20 different biological process categories, and 8 different cellular component categories of genes differentially expressed during sow pregnancy. Gene regulatory network reconstruction provided us with an interaction model of known genes such as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, estrogen receptor (ESR) gene, retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) gene, and several unknown candidate genes related to reproduction. Several pitch point genes were selected for association study with reproduction traits. For instance, DPPA5 g.363 T>C was found to associate with litter born weight at later parities in Beijing Black pigs significantly (p < 0.05). Overall, this study contributes to elucidating the mechanism underlying pregnancy processes, which maybe provide valuable information for pig reproduction improvement.

In this genome-wide association study (GWAS), 455 pigs from a porcine Large White x Minzhu intercross population were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60K Beadchip, and phenotyped for intramuscular fat content (IMF), marbling, moisture, color L*, color a*, color b* and color score in the longissimus muscle (LM). Association tests between each trait and the SNPs were performed via the Genome Wide Rapid Association using the Mixed Model and Regression-Genomic Control (GRAMMAR-GC) approach. From the Ensembl porcine database, SNP annotation was implemented using Sus scrofa Build 9. A total of 45 SNPs showed significant association with one or multiple meat quality traits. Of the 45 SNPs, 36 were located on SSC12. These significantly associated SNPs aligned to or were in close approximation to previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) and some were located within introns of previously reported candidate genes. Two haplotype blocks ASGA0100525-ASGA0055225-ALGA0067099-MARC0004712-DIAS0000861, and ASGA0085522-H3GA0056170 were detected in the significant region. The first block contained the genes MYH1, MYH2 and MYH4. A SNP (ASGA0094812) within an intron of the USP43 gene was significantly associated with five meat quality traits. The present results effectively narrowed down the associated regions compared to previous QTL studies and revealed haplotypes and candidate genes on SSC12 for meat quality traits in pigs.

In this study, the porcine Akirin2 gene was cloned. The full-length coding sequence (CDS) of porcine Akirin2 consists of 612 bp and encodes 203 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22493 kD. The homology tree analysis showed that the pig Akirin2 has closer genetic relationships and distance with the known mammalian Akirin2. Real time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the porcine Akirin2 transcript was most abundant in the lung, followed by the skeletal muscle, heart, liver, fat, thymus, lymph node, small intestine, kidney, and spleen. Overexpression of porcine Akirin2 increased expression of IL-6 in porcine jejunal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 cells. Our data suggest that porcine Akirin2 could play an important role in intestinal immune regulation.

To evaluate carcass characteristics and meat quality of the YN pig, we compared carcass and meat quality of YN pigs and Landrace x Yanan (CY) hybrid pigs; 30 YN pigs and 30 CY pigs weighing 20 +/- 2 kg were reared and slaughtered at the normal slaughter weight (100-120 kg). The carcasses were chilled and the left carcass side was dissected into bone, lean meat, fat, and skin; meat quality parameters were measured. Carcasses of YN pigs were lighter (88.85 vs 90.05 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter (71.88 vs 77.61 cm, P < 0.001); they contained less lean meat (41.60 vs 49.25%, P < 0.001), less ham and breech (25.93 vs 27.53%, P < 0.001) and less carcass bone (9.83 vs 10.53%, P < 0.01) than did carcasses of CY pigs. On the other hand, YN pigs had more carcass subcutaneous fat and skin (48.58 vs 40.23%, P < 0.001), thicker backfat (3.67 vs 3.43 cm, P < 0.001) and smaller loin muscle area (9.83 vs 26.91 cm(2), P < 0.001) compared with CY pigs. Among meat quality parameters, YN pigs had higher pH(1) (6.41 vs 6.17, P < 0.001), higher color score(u) (3.86 vs 3.36, P < 0.001) and lower Minolta L-u values (40.89 vs 45.32, P < 0.01) than CY pigs. On the other hand, YN pigs had lower drip loss (1.31 vs 2.26%, P < 0.05) and lesser fiber area (2351.34 vs 3025.43 mu m(2), P < 0.01) than CY pigs. Both breeds had high intramuscular fat (4.46% in YN and 4.45% in CY). No significant differences in other carcass traits and meat quality were found in the two populations. We conclude that YN pigs could be used in commercial pig production to provide good tasting and high-quality niche products.

Genetic variation and comparison of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) cultivars and wild accessions as revealed by SSR markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Dactylis glomerata L.; Cultivar; Simple sequence repeats; AMOVA	AFLP MARKERS; DIVERSITY	Orchardgrass is a highly variable, perennial forage grass that is cultivated throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world. Despite its economic importance, the genetic relationship and distance among and within cultivars are largely unknown but would be of great interest for breeding programs. We investigated the molecular variation and structure of cultivar populations, compared the level of genetic diversity among cultivars (Baoxing, Anba, Bote, and Kaimo), subspecies (Dactylis glomerata ssp Woronowii) and advanced breeding line (YA02-116) to determine whether there is still sufficient genetic diversity within presently used cultivars for future breeding progress in China. Twenty individuals were analyzed from each of six accessions using SSR markers; 114 easily scored bands were generated from 15 SSR primer pairs, with an average of 7.6 alleles per locus. The polymorphic rate was 100% among the 120 individuals, reflecting a high degree of genetic diversity. Among the six accessions, the highest genetic diversity was observed in Kaimo (H = 0.2518; I = 0.3916; P = 87.3%) and 02-116 had a lower level of genetic diversity (H = 0.1806; I = 0.2788; P = 58.73%) compared with other cultivars tested. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a much larger genetic variation within accessions (65%) than between them (35%). This observation suggests that these cultivars have potential for providing rich genetic resource for further breeding program. Furthermore, the study also indicated that Chinese orchardgrass breeding has involved strong selection for adaptation to forage production, which may result in restricted genetic base of orchardgrass cultivar.

Soil physicochemical and microbiological properties were measured across a range of E. grandis plantation ages (1-10 years) in south-western China to determine whether and how eucalypt afforestation of agricultural land affected the soil fertility. The results indicate that afforestation with E. grandis caused changes in soil properties with soil depth, and the changes were dependent on the stand age. Soil bulk density decreased significantly, but water-holding capacity increased significantly with time. Soil organic matter content, C:N ratio, and soil microbial biomass C and N concentrations showed an initial phase of decline and then increased significantly over time in the upper soil layers of E. grandis plantations aged from 1 to 4 or 5 years. Soil pH in E. grandis plantations did not change significantly with stand age or soil layer. Cation exchange capacity in the upper soil layer of E. grandis plantations increased significantly over time. Total exchangeable bases and base saturation in the soil decreased significantly with depth and with increasing plantation age. Furthermore, E. grandis afforestation of arable soils had no significant effects on total N, total P, and available P contents. The requirements of the trees, understory microenvironmental conditions, and allelopathic effects might play important roles in the dynamic changes of soil physicochemical and microbiological properties. The results demonstrate the progressive development of processes that lead to the restoration of soil fertility following E. grandis afforestation of arable soils. However, most of the properties measured for the afforested soils resembled the properties of arable soils and did not resemble those of the soil of control forests. Thus, reversion of soil properties in the study plantations is likely to require a considerable period of time. Long-term research is needed to understand changes in the soil properties resulting from afforestation with Eucalyptus and to predict future trends.

In this work, we cloned the duck MEF2A cDNA sequence (GenBank accession no. HM460752) and examined its developmental expression profiles in cardiac muscle, non-vascular smooth muscle and skeletal muscle. Duck MEF2A cDNA comprised 1479 bp encoding 492 amino acid residues. In silico analysis showed that MEF2A contained MADS (MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS and SRF - serum response factor), MEF2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) transcription domains with high homology to related proteins in other species. Modified sites in these domains were conserved among species and several variants were found. Quantitative PCR showed that MEF2A was expressed in all three muscles at each developmental stage examined, with the expression in smooth muscle being higher than in the other muscles. These results indicate that the conserved domains of duck MEF2A, including the MADS and MEF2 domains, are important for MEF2A transcription factor function. The expression of MEF2A in duck smooth muscle and cardiac muscle suggests that MEF2A plays a role in these two tissues.

Exosomes are membranous vesicles of endocytic origin that are found in various body fluids and that can mediate intercellular communication. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a well-defined group of non-coding small RNAs, are packaged inside exosomes in human breast milk. Here, we identified 602 unique miRNAs originating from 452 miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) in human breast milk exosomes using deep sequencing technology. We found that, out of 87 well-characterized immune-related pre-miRNAs, 59 (67.82%) are presented and enriched in breast milk exosomes (P < 10(-16), chi(2) test). In addition, compared with exogenous synthetic miRNAs, these endogenous immune-related miRNAs are more resistant to relatively harsh conditions. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that these exosomal miRNAs are transferred from the mother's milk to the infant via the digestive tract, and that they play a critical role in the development of the infant immune system.

Thirty finishing Simmental cross cattle (Simmental x local cattle) with body weight (BW, 382.6 +/- 30.5 kg) were selected and randomly assigned into three dietary treatment groups with 10 cattles in each. The three dietary energy levels were: high energy group (HE, 6.64 MJ NE/kg), medium energy group (ME, 6.31 MJ NE/kg) and low energy group (LE, 5.98 MJ NE/kg). There was no significant difference among the three treatments for the cattle growth performance. Though, compared with LE group, HE group increased average daily gain (ADG) by 10.79%, increased feed conversion efficiency by 6.32%. While the dietary energy density increased, intramuscular fat (IMF) of ME group and HE group increased by 47.5% (P<0.05) and 100% (P<0.01), compared with LE group, respectively. As the dietary energy density increased, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) (P<0.05) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (P<0.05) mRNA concentration increased, while the heart fatty acid-binding proteins (H-FABP) (P<0.05) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA concentration decreased (P<0.05). The results obtained above suggested that high energy density diet incorporated with DDGS increase cattle IMF content by three different pathways, increasing fatty acids de novo synthesis, depressing fatty acid hydrolyzation and promoting differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.

Oviduct epithelial cells (OEC), ear fibroblast cells (EFC) and cumulus cells (CC) derived from mini-pigs were treated with serum starvation only or serum starvation followed by treatment of 0.1 mu g/mL APC. The reconstructed embryos were cultured for 7 days to evaluate their developmental competency. Cleavage and blastocyst formation rates of reconstructed embryos derived from the OEC by APC treatment were significantly higher than the serum starvation (61.82% vs. 56.25%, 24.55% vs. 17.86%; P < 0.05). The cleavage rate from the EFC was significantly increased by APC treatment compared to serum starvation only (63.36% vs. 57.01%; P < 0.05). In the ooctyes with the CC, the reconstructed embryos could yield high blastocyst formation rate by APC treatment (29.63%; P < 0.05). In the presence of APC, CC gave rise to the highest cleavage and blastocyst formation rates among the three cell types. Therefore, our results suggest that treatment of CC with serum starvation plus APC prior to nuclear transfer is more suitable in SCNT of mini-pigs.

The molecular descriptors used for DNA adduct prediction were selected from a pool of 548 descriptors by using a multi-step hybrid feature selection method combining Fischer-score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing method. Some of the selected descriptors are consistent with the structural and physicochemical properties reported to be important for DNA adduct formation. The y-scrambling method was used to test whether there is a chance correlation in the developed SVM model. In the meantime, fivefold cross-validation of these machine learning methods results in the prediction accuracies of 64.1-82.5% for DNA adducts and 95.1-97.6% for non-DNA adducts, and the prediction accuracies for external test set are 78.2-100% for DNA adducts and 92.6-98.4% for non-DNA adducts. Our study suggested that the tested machine learning methods are potentially useful for DNA adducts identification.

However, little is known about the molecular basis of its strong resistance to disease. Stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), also known as MPYS/MITA/ERIS/TMEM173, is an adaptor that functions downstream of RIG-I and MAVS and upstream of TBK1 and plays a critical role in type I IFN induction. Here we report the first cloning and characterization of STING gene from Tibetan pig. The entire open reading frame (ORF) of the Tibetan porcine STING is 1137 bp, with a higher degree of sequence similarity with Landrace pig (98%) and cattle (88%) than with chimpanzee (84%), human (83%) or mouse (77%). The predicted protein is composed of 378 amino acids and has 4 putative transmembrane domains. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that Tibetan pig STING mRNA was most abundant in the lung and heart. Overexpression of Tibetan porcine STING led to upregulation of IFN-beta and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in porcine jejunal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 cells. This is the first study investigating the biological role of STING in intestinal epithelial cells, which lays a foundation for the further study of STING in intestinal innate immunity.

The MEL was found in residue of plasma, liver, kidney, breast, and leg muscle with the highest level in kidney and in dose response manner (except in kidney), but no time response (except in plasma). The MEL residue in organ tissue was below the safe level of 50 mu g mL(-1) in blood or 50 mu g kg(-1) in tissues proposed by the US FSIS when MEL in diet was lower (2 mg kg(-1)). The MEL in tissues was eliminated by withdrawal MEL from diets. The elimination half-life of MEL was from 3.2 to 6.6 h, and the clearance time, when MEL residue concentration under limit detection, was from 18.0 to 31.4 h.

This paper put forward several indicators to quantify the relationships among economic growth and energy consumption and CO2 emission. As an example, these indicators were applied to evaluate the comprehensive performances of China during 1990-2007. The results show that Chinese people has been living a better life with Chinese rapid economic growth but not synchronously in urban and rural areas. Non-carbon energy resources share has increased; however, fossil energy resources have still acted as the main driver for Chinese economic growth during this period. Technical progress has improved the fossil energy efficiency of Chinese economic activity, which leads to CO2 emission per unit GDP and CO2 emission per capita unit GDP dropping simultaneously; however, the two indicators' annual decline rates become smaller and smaller, which reflects that technical progress' role is dropping and economic scale's effect is climbing. People's survival has a rising contribution to CO2 emission. CO2 emission per capita has increased, which shows that economic scale has greater impact on CO2 emission than technical progress does. Relatively speaking, Chinese development patterns have become more and more sustainable during this period. Finally, based on the related issues being discussed, some corresponding suggestions are put forward for Chinese government to further coordinate the relationship among economic development and energy consumption and CO2 emission. The proposed indicators can form a set of useful tool for policy-makers to promote the harmonious development of economy and energy and environment in different regions and countries.

In comparison with those of 0.2 mg/kg selenium group, the percentages of annexin V-positive splenocytes were increased in 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg selenium groups. TUNEL assay revealed that apoptotic cells with brown-stained nuclei distributed within the red pulp and white pulp of the spleens with increased frequency of occurrence in 10 and 15 mg/kg selenium groups in comparison with that of 0.2 mg/kg Se group. Sodium selenite-induced oxidative stress in spleens of chickens was evidenced by decrease in glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities and increase in malondialdehyde contents. The results indicate that excess dietary selenium in the range of 5-15 mg/kg of feed causes oxidative stress, which may be mainly responsible for the increased apoptosis of splenocytes in chickens.

A total of 420 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg vanadium as ammonium metavanadate. During the experimental period of 42 days, oxidative stress parameters were determined for both control and experimental groups. The results showed that malondialdehyde content was significantly higher (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg groups than in control group. In contrast, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical, and glutathione hormone content were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) mainly in 45 and 60 mg/kg groups in comparison with those of control group. However, the abovementioned oxidative stress parameters were not significantly changed (p > 0.05) in 5 and 15 mg/kg groups. It was concluded that dietary vanadium in excess of 30 mg/kg could cause obvious oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa, which could impact the antioxidant function of intestinal tract in broilers.

To investigate the time line of gene expression of several potential genes and make a observation, we isolated preadipocytes from subcutaneous adipose tissue of 2-d old piglets by collagenase digestion approach and extracted total RNA from the cells, then measured mRNA expression level of AdipoR1, IGFBP3, PPAR gamma, PPARGC1, FASN, FABP4, and C/EBP alpha at 10 different time points via real-time quantitative RT-PCR method. The results revealed that the expression of AdipoR1 and IGFBP3 was both upregulated to the maximum at 8 h, the expression of PPAR gamma, PPARGC1, FASN, FABP4, and C/EBP alpha was all upregulated to the maximum at 9 d, and these genes were in significant correlation. We present tentatively conclusions that, the gene expression of AdipoR1 and IGFBP3 is upregulated in the early stage of preadipocyte differentiation, and the gene PPAR gamma, PPARGC1, FASN, FABP4, and C/EBP alpha reached a high expression in the later period. The expression variation tendency of these genes suggests that they may influence on each other in a sort of way. However, the specific mechanism that AdipoR1, IGFBP3, PPAR gamma, and the related genes how to cooperate or interact with each other still remains to be further explored.

In this study, two different combinations of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.), including F-1 hybrids and the first and second allopolyploid generations, were analyzed by PCR and sequencing using 60 wheat expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived single-sequence repeat markers and EST-derived sequence-tagged site markers. Thirty markers produced the same bands from parental plants, F-1 plants, and amphiploids. Seven of the 30 markers amplified identical sequences from wheat and rye parents. Most of these sequences have high similarity between the two parental plants. The variation patterns of sequences in the bands produced by the seven markers were observed. In the F-1 hybrids and amphiploids, loss of parental sequences was observed and the frequency of losing rye sequences was higher than that of losing wheat sequences. In addition, a few sequences in these bands exhibited significant differences, indicating that parental sequences changed drastically during allopolyploidization. Therefore, the fact that the parents and progeny contained the same bands should not be regarded as conservation. The results in this study add to the investigations dealing with variation patterns of coding sequences during wheat-rye allopolyploidization.

Seeds are the primary organs for harvesting, and therefore spikelet fertility is especially vital for rice yield. Here, we report the characterization and genetic mapping of a novel rice male and female sterile mutant, mfs1, which was generated from a transgenic line of japonica rice variety Zhonghua 9. Anther transverse sections indicate that the microspores in these plants were abnormally degenerated at the meiotic leptotene stage, while the tapetum layer was not degenerated and remained present; therefore, no functional pollen grains formed in the mutant anther locules. In addition, the majority of mutant embryo sacs did not undergo differentiation or the differentiation was incomplete, resulting in the absence of functional embryo sac formation. Genetic analysis of three F(2) populations indicated that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene. The mutant phenotype was confirmed by linkage analysis to be not due to a foreign T-DNA insertion. A map-based cloning strategy was employed to map the mutant gene, and, finally, the mfs1 locus was mapped to a 99-kb physical interval between simple sequence repeat markers RM12585 and D051 on rice chromosome 2. Sequence analysis indicates that 11 rice candidate genes are located in this region, including three encoded putative proteins and eight encoded known proteins, such as transcription factors having WRKY and zinc finger domains, a ubiquitin fusion degradation protein, chaperone protein clpB 1, a two-component response regulator, the ZOS2-04-C2H2 zinc finger protein, a peptidase of the T1 family and a protein kinase.

Additional multiple alignment adjustments were performed manually to facilitate discovery of putative chromosome 6D-specific point mutations. A total of 85 PM primers were designed to detect 68 candidate chromosome 6D-specific point mutations. Experimental tests revealed 11 chromosome 6D-specific PM markers by using genomic DNA from homoeologous group 6 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of Chinese Spring and putative diploid and tetraploid ancestors of hexaploid wheat as PCR templates. Detection of PM markers in one synthetic hexaploid wheat and its parental lines indicated that some alpha-gliadin genes were lost from Gli-2 loci during the formation of hexaploid wheat by amphidiploidization of the genomes of Triticum turgidum and Ae. tauschii. Detection of these PM markers in Ae. tauschii, T. aestivum and its four subspecies indicated that at least two genetically distinct sources of Ae. tauschii contributed germplasm to the D genome of T. aestivum.

A completely randomized design was subjected to three water regimes (80%, 40% and 20% water field capacity (FC)) and three N supply regimes (control, N0: 0 mg N kg(-1) soil; low N supply, Nl: 92 mg N kg(-1) soil; and high N supply, Nh: 184 mg N kg(-1) soil) by potting with 2-month-old Sophora davidii seedlings. Water stress decreased the content of soil organic carbon (C), available N and phosphorus (P), the ratio of C/N, the ratio of C/P, as well as activities of soil invertase, urease and alkaline phosphatase, but not reduced microbial biomass C, N and P contents. Soil microbial and chemical characteristics also exhibited strong responses to N supply, and these responses were inconsistent among N supply levels. The contents of soil organic C and available P showed stronger positive responses to Nl than to Nh, while the available N content increased with increasing N supply. Additionally, Nl rather than the other two N treatments led to increased microbial biomass N and invertase activity under 20% FC treatment, even though the invertase activity increased in Nh treatment under 40% FC and 80% FC treatments. Nl treatment also increased the C/P ratio and alkaline phosphatase activity. These results suggest that water and N co-limited nutrient mineralization and microbial activity, and that these characteristics responded positively to Nl.

The key steps of the synthesis include the direct acetylation of the secondary hydroxyl group at C-5 and D-ring opening and intramolecular aldol reaction to form the gamma-lactone. In MTT assays, this analogue proved to have equipotent cytotoxicity relative to paclitaxel towards HCT8, HePG2 and BGC23 cancer cell lines, and be more potent than paclitaxel against A549 and A375. It represents the first example of D-ring modified taxoids with significant cytotoxicity.

No significant differences in seed setting rate were observed among the clones following unbagged treatment, but significant differences in seed setting rate were observed among the clones following bagged treatment. Breeding experiments indicated that both reproductive systems (selfing and outcrossing) coexisted in each tested C. tinctorius clone. It exhibited reproductive assurance through automatic self-pollination, which might be an important factor in enhancing the amount of seeds. Among 17 species of visitors, the main effective pollinators were Apis cerana Fabricius, Apis mellifera Linnaeus and Eristalis tenax Linnaeus. All floral morphology traits (corolla length, corolla diameter, pistil length, anther length, stigma length, and stigma-anther separation) showed significant variations among the clones. However, only corolla diameter showed a significant negative correlation with the frequency of pollinator visits and a positive correlation with seed set following unbagged treatment. There was a negative correlation between stigma-anther separation and seed set, and although this was not significant, it could be argued that if a pistil developed that was too long, seed set would decline under natural conditions. Corolla length was significantly positively correlated with stamen and anther length, and corolla diameter was significantly negatively correlated with pistil length. Stigma length was also significantly positively correlated with stamen length. These findings indicate that corolla diameter could significantly affect seed set in C. tinctorius under the conditions in Ya'an, China, and corolla diameter affects seed set by the combined effect of multiple traits.

Incw2 protein is the enzyme in the metabolic pathway that mobilizes photoassimilated sucrose into numerous reactions of the developing plant seeds, associated with grain yield. In the research, an Incw2 gene driven by 27 kD zein promoter was specifically over-expressed in the endosperm cells of maize inbred line 18-599R by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. PCR assay displayed that ten of the regenerated plants were integrated with the target gene. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR and invertase activity analysis, five of them showed significantly higher expression of Incw2 transcripts and enzyme activity compared to the wild type. Among them, line 1 stood out because it possessed the highest level of Incw2 mRNA and enzyme activity. The effects of Incw2 over-expression were reflected in the increased chlorophyll content, improved photosynthesis and delay of leaf senility. In addition, yield-related traits such as ear length, ear diameter, ear weight, grain weight per ear, and hundred-kernel weight appeared to be improved in three of the transformants compared with the wild type. The grain weight per plant of line1 was increased by nearly 10%. The results collectively indicate that it is potentially practical to enhance kernel yield of maize by overexpression of Incw2 in endosperm.

The effects of different wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genetic backgrounds and rye (Secale cereale L.) sources have been addressed as major factors for inconsistent agronomic performance and end-use-quality traits of 1BL.1RS translocation wheats. However, all these studies were accomplished by using 1BL.1RS translocations with impure wheat genetic bases and narrow rye origins. The objective of this study was to test the genetic effects of centric fusion translocations by using primary 1BL.1RS lines derived from various pure wheat lines and rye sources. Twenty-one primary 1BL.1RS translocation lines were created from crosses between two pure wheat lines and three Chinese local rye varieties. These translocation lines and their wheat parents were then evaluated in southwestern China. The results provide direct evidence of the diverse effects of the different wheat parents and rye sources, taking part in 1BL.1RS translocations, on resistance to diseases, agronomic performance, and end-use quality traits. The highest amount of genetic diversity was observed in 1BL.1RS translocations derived from the same wheat lines and diverse rye varieties. The results suggest that the genetic diversity of 1BL.1RS translocation lines may originate from the different wheat genetic backgrounds, from different rye sources, from their interaction, and from the translocation itself. Creation of diverse 1BL.1RS translocations offers ample possibilities to introduce more variation into wheat for improved performance.

Grain moisture content (GM) is an important factor which impacts the fungal development of ER species. Our purpose was to identify the genomic regions of maize in the control of GM and ER resistance, and the correlations between two traits. A meta-analysis was carried out using 241 quantitative trait loci (QTL) from 29 studies to propose meta-QTL (MQTL) on a high-density genetic linkage map (IBM 2 neighbors 2008). For GM content, 44 MQTL were identified on all chromosomes except for chromosome 9, while 29 MQTL were found for ER resistance, mainly located on chromosomes 3, 6 and 7. Moreover, 14 overlapping domains for GM MQTL and ER MQTL were observed on chromosomes 2, 3, 6 and 7, mainly focused on five active regions (bins 2.08-2.09, 3.04, 3.06, 6.04-6.06 and 7.03-7.03). There were 13 genes in the overlapping domain which could be divided into five classes: stress-related gene, photosystem-related gene, architecture-related gene, dynamic-related gene and seminal-related gene. It was possibly that the five-class genes were simultaneously related with GM and ER.

In this study, the reseachers investigated whether the mRNA expression pattern of CAR in porcine preadipocyte is changed during the process of induced differentiation. Preadipocytes were aseptically taken from 3 days old piglet under general anesthesia and grown to near confluence. Postconfluent cells (Day 0) were further cultured in differentiation medium for 3 days. From day 3 onward, the cells were cultured in maintain-medium based on differentiation medium without roglitazone and IBMX until day 15. The total RNA was isolated on seven time points (i.e., days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15). The mRNA expression changes of the CAR before and after porcine primary preadipocytes differentiation that acorss seven time points (i.e., days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15) were measured using the quantitative RT-PCR method. In addition, the researchers also examined lipid accumulation and the mRNA expression of adpocyte differentiation markers (Such as PPAR gamma and RXR alpha) which confirmed the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. The results showed that the mRNA expression of CAR was upregulated during porcine primary preadipocyte differentiation. There is the reason that the CAR may be involved in the process of preadipocyte differentiation and is a potential drug target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

In this study, we cloned the cDNA and promoter sequences of porcine glycogen synthesis genes (GYS1 and GYS2). Expression analysis revealed that porcine GYS1 was highly expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart. GYS2 was expressed specifically in liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The expression level of GYS1 was up-regulated from proliferation to differentiation in the porcine satellite cells, and insulin did not significantly affect the transcription of GYS1. Insulin stimulated 72-h-differentiated satellite cells as indicated by decrease in phosphorylation of GS, but did not affect GYS1 transcription and total GS protein level, suggesting that the effect of insulin is primarily mediated via posttranscriptional control rather than regulated at the transcriptional level. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the promoter and cDNA sequences of porcine GYS1. Association analyses revealed that the GYS1 Hin6I and MvaI polymorphisms both had significant associations (P < 0.05) with pH of M. longissimus dorsi (pHLD), M. biceps femoris (pHBF) and M. semipinalis capitis (pHSC) at 45 min postmortem.

There was a quadratic increase in average daily gain and a linear decrease in the ratio of feed intake and gain as dietary DE increased (P<0.05). Increasing dietary DE resulted in a linear increase of back fat thickness and intramuscular fat content (P<0.05). A significant linear or quadratic effect (P<0.01) was detected for shearing force. Increasing dietary DE linearly enhanced the expression of PPAR gamma in adipose tissues (P<0.01). These data suggest that dietary DE had an impact on carcass and meat quality of Rongchang piglets. This could be partly due to the increased gene expression of PPAR gamma in adipose tissues, which may regulate the fat deposition of whole body. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The research and development of practical applications in the field of biopesticides greatly mitigate environmental pollution caused by chemical pesticide residues and promotes sustainable development of agriculture. Since the advent of biopesticides, a large number of products have been released, several of which have already played dominant roles in the market. The development of biopesticides stimulates modernization of agriculture and will, without doubt, gradually replace chemical pesticides. Many biopesticides are ideal substitutes for their traditional chemical counterparts in pollution-free agricultural production, but some of them display certain toxicity; this should be taken into consideration by the researchers in the field. In this paper, we discuss the current development and application of biopesticides from various categories, the problems occurring in the process of their development and proposing the introduction of various constraints. We review various studies and analyze the development trends in biopesticides in agriculture, demand, market and other fields.

They were planted at three independent ecological locations in 2008 and 2009, and then the data of phenotypic traits (such as growth period, plant height, ear height, plant yield.) were collected. The results showed that leaf number and growth period were stably inherited within cluster Huangzaosi. And, within cluster Mo17, the traits of ear diameter, 100-kernel weight and kernel depth could be stably inherited. Lov, 100-kernel weight and ear length could be inherited within cluster 478. Rows per ear might be inherited within cluster Dan340. To efficiently utilize these key inbred lines, we should pay more attention to early growth period of Huangzaosi, high kernel weight of Mo17, rows per ear of Dan340 and some important traits of 478, or improve some other lines with those excellent traits within each cluster.

A field experiment was conducted to investigate soil microbial biomass and bacterial diversity by PCR-DGGE in the primary fir (Abies faxoniana) forest (PF), fir and birch (Betula albosinensis) mixed forest (MF) and secondary fir forest (SF) in western China. Soil samples were collected in March, April, May and August, 2009. The microbial biomass C (MBC) in soil organic layer (OL) increased from winter to growing season, but insignificant changes were observed in soil thawing period (April and May). In contrast, MBC in soil mineral layer (ML) displayed an obvious decrease at the end of soil thawing (May) and then increased. Rich DGGE bands indicating rich bacteria populations have been detected even under completely soil frozen condition. The richness of bacteria community significantly decreased during soil thawing period and then increased to growing season, except for which in OL of MF. The similarity of bacterial communities implied significant community changes during the transition, showing more sensitivity to temperature than forest type and soil layer. The results here are of ecological significance in explaining the adaptation of microorganisms in the high-frigid areas.

The Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network reported that overall 45% of diarrhoea admissions in Asian region were positive for rotavirus in nine countries and regions of Asia (2008). But very limited knowledge about animal diarrhoea diseases caused by rotavirus was published until now. Valuation of genetic relations between human and animal rotavirus isolates is very limited. To better understand the rotavirus CH-1 strain isolated from diarrheic faeces of giant panda in 2008, we cloned the non-structural protein (NSP) 1 similar to 5 complete coding sequence of the giant panda rotavirus (GPRV), and sequenced NSP1 similar to 5 genes (GenBank accession number: NSP1, GU205762; NSP2, GU188281; NSP3, GU329525; NSP4, GU188282; NSP5, GU329526). Based on these information and data from GenBank of other genus of RV NSP1 similar to 5 genes, phylogenetic analysis were realized. The phylogenetic tree revealed that GPRV NSP1 similar to 5 genes were close to that of porcine rotavirus, bovine rotavirus and human rotavirus. This research may provide some useful information helping us understanding giant panda rotavirus.

Molecular and bioinformatic analyses of ZmPR5 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 525 bp, encoding a protein of 175 amino acids (aa) and a deduced molecular mass of 17.5 KDa. Homology analysis of the Zea mays L. deduced amino acid sequence, indicated homology between 40 and 74% with Oryza sativa, Hordeum vulgare, and Triticum aestivum, among others. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of ZmPR5 is constantly higher in the maize resistant inbred line R15 compared with that in the susceptible inbred line 478. Moreover, the ZmPR5 gene was up-regulated after it was challenged by Rhizoctonia solani. We subsequently purified the recombinant protein and analyzed its antimicrobial activities in vitro. The results obtained show that the recombinant protein inhibited hyphal growth of R. solani. This study suggests that the expression of ZmPR5 is closely related to maize sheath blight resistance caused by R. solani. Further, the antifungal activity of ZmPR5 showed that ZmPR5 plays an important role in the disease resistance response.

The sequences were analyzed by means of Neighbor-Joining to improve the phylogenetic resolution of these three Curcuma species. The genetic diversity of these three species is 0.009 to 0.014 (< 0.05). The results show that partial population specimens of C. sichuanensis originate from the cultivated mutation of C. longa; and retain the C. chuanhuangjiang as an individual species. The differentiation is engendered between the wildness and cultivated specimens within C. longa species.

Viral DNA of both porcine TTSuV species has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species has been documented in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, there exists no information about histopathological lesions caused by infection with porcine TTSuV2. Methods: Porcine liver tissue homogenate with 1 ml of 6.91 x 10(7) genomic copies viral loads of porcine TTSuV2 that had positive result for torque teno sus virus type 2 and negative result for torque teno sus virus type 1 and porcine pseudorabies virus type 2 were used to inoculate specific pathogen-free piglets by intramuscular route and humanely killed at 3,7,10,14,17,21 and 24 days post inoculation (dpi), the control pigs were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of sterile DMEM and humanely killed the end of the study for histopathological examination routinely processed, respectively. Results: All porcine TTSuV2 inoculated piglets were clinic asymptomatic but developed myocardial fibroklasts and endocardium, interstitial pneumonia, membranous glomerular nephropathy, and modest inflammatory cells infiltration in portal areas in the liver, foci of hemorrhage in some pancreas islet, a tiny amount red blood cells in venule of muscularis mucosae and outer longitudinal muscle, rarely red blood cells in the microvasculation and infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and eosinophils) of tonsil and hilar lymph nodes, infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes and necrosis or degeneration and focal gliosis of lymphocytes in the paracortical zone after inoculation with porcine TTSuV2-containing tissue homogenate. Conclusions: Analysis of these presentations revealed that porcine TTSuV2 was readily transmitted to TTSuV-negative swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in specific pathogen-free piglets inoculated with porcine TTSuV2. Those results indicated no markedly histopathological changes happened in those parenchymatous organs, especially the digestive system and immune system when the specific pathogen-free pigs were infected with porcine TTSuV2, hence, to some extent, it was not remarkable pathological agent for domestic pigs at least. So, porcine TTSuV2 could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious etiology of swine. This study indicated a directly related description of lesions responsible for TTSuV2 infection in swine.

In this study, we detected five coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) of the TLR4 gene in New Zealand White rabbits and analyzed their associations with genetic resistance against digestive disorders based on case-control study (125 cases and 147 controls). The five cSNPs included two synonymous mutations (c.57 C>T and c.1098 G>A) and three non-synonymous mutations (c.566 G>A, c.760 G>A, and c.923 A>G), which totally determined two alleles (haplotypes) H1 (the five cSNPs: CGGAG) and H2 (the five cSNPs: TAAGA) with pair-wise LD (D') estimates of 1.0. The frequencies of alleles and genotypes significantly differed between case group and control group (P<0.05). The association analyses revealed that allele H2 carried a potential protective role with an odds ratio (OR) value of 0.521 (95% confidence interval 0.324-0.837, P=0.0064). To our knowledge, this is first report to study the genetic polymorphism of TLR4 gene and association with incidence of digestive disorders in rabbits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that because of the relative light intensity increased, the dwarf phenomenon was occurred in Cultivated E. pubescens and E. wushanense, but the number of branches and leaf number per plant in cultivated were more than wild, and increased the output of two kinds of Epimedium. According to the standard of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, both wild and cultivated leaves the icariin contents of E. pubescens can meet the standard. Insignificant difference in flavonoid contents between the cultivated and wild leaves of E. wushanense, but both can meet the standard, both wild and cultivated all other parts of E. wushanense cannot meet the standard of icariin contents, which may be related to harvesting time.

To gain further insight into the function of Sub1A in other species, we transformed tobacco plants with the gene under the control of the ubiquitin promoter. Compared to the wild-type plants, transgenic plants over-expressing Sub1A exhibited a greater ability to adapt to hypoxia, as evidenced by the highly induced activities of enzymes (pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase) regulating ethanolic fermentation. Furthermore, Sub1A upregulated activities of the main antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase, making the transgenic plants scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) more effectively. This was further confirmed by the less accumulation of malondialdehyde, an end product of lipid peroxidation. Taken together, our results suggest that Sub1A promotes plants hypoxic stress tolerance by regulating genes involved in anaerobic metabolism as well as ROS amelioration. In addition, it also suggests that Sub1A can be used potentially to improve hypoxic stress tolerance in plant breeding.

However, studies on soil respiration in these plantation forests are rather scarce and their soil carbon flux remains an uncertainty. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure soil surface flux of a 50-year-old mature plantation of Platycladus orientalis at Jiufeng Mountain, Beijing, China. Mean daily soil respiration rates (R(s)) ranged from 0.09 to 4.87 mmol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1), with the highest values observed in August and the lowest in the winter months. A logistic model gave the best fit to the relationship between hourly R(s) and soil temperature (T(s)), explaining 82% of the variation in R(s) over the annual cycle. The annual total of soil respiration estimated from the logistic model was 645 +/- 5 g C m(-2) year(-1). The performance of the logistic model was poorest during periods of high soil temperature or low soil volumetric water content (VWC), which limits the model's ability to predict the seasonal dynamics of R(s). The logistic model will potentially overestimate R(s) at high T(s) and low VWC. Seasonally, R(s) increased significantly and linearly with increasing VWC in May and July, in which VWC was low. In the months from August to November, inclusive, in which VWC was not limiting, R(s) showed a positively exponential relationship with T(s). The seasonal sensitivity of soil respiration to T(s) (Q(10)) ranged from 0.76 in May to 4.38 in October. It was suggested that soil temperature was the main determinant of soil respiration when soil water was not limiting.

Serum dilutions of 1: 6400 (0.025 mu g) are the maximum detection limits of the pUL55-ELISA, according to the determined cut-off value of 0.330. Antigenic cross-reactivity investigation in heterologous sera of ducks failed to provide evidence that other viruses of ducks could hamper the serodiagnosis of DEV, and the inhibition assay revealed that the specific binding of antigen and antibody can be inhibited by pUL55, both of which demonstrated a good specificity of the established pUL55-ELISA. This assay was further validated by comparison with a commercial I-ELISA based on DEV (DEV-ELISA) and a neutralization test (NT). The results suggested that the sensitivity of pUL55-ELISA was almost as good as DEV-ELISA but was much higher than NT. The established pUL55-ELISA is a rapid, simple, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive serodiagnosis for detecting antibodies against DEV and has a potential to complement the traditional assays for serodiagnosis of DEV; it can be used as a diagnosis alternative candidate for serologic surveillance of DEV infection.

Four hundred twenty 1-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate. In comparison with those of control group, lymphocytes in the lymphatic nodule of cecal tonsil were apparently decreased in 45 and 60 mg/kg groups. The percentage of CD (3) (+) T cells was decreased (p < 0.05) in 45 mg/kg group at 28 and 42 days of age and significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in 60 mg/kg group at 28 and 42 days of age. The percentages of CD (3) (+) CD (4) (+) and CD (3) (+) CD (8) (+) T cells were markedly decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in 60 mg/kg group from 14 to 28 days of age and were decreased (p < 0.05) in 45 mg/kg group at 28 and 42 days of age. However, changes of the CD (4) (+) /CD (8) (+) ratio were not significant. Meanwhile, the cecal tonsil interleukin-2 (IL-2) contents were decreased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in 45 and 60 mg/kg groups from 14 to 42 days of age. It was concluded that dietary vanadium in excess of 30 mg/kg reduced the percentages of cecal tonsil T cells subsets and IL-2 contents, and caused cecal tonsil lesions, which impaired cecal tonsil function and impacted the local mucosal immune function of the intestines in broilers.

One hundred twenty 1-day-old Avian broilers were randomly assigned to two groups of 60 each and were fed on a low-Se diet (0.0342 mg/kg Se) or a control diet (0.2 mg/kg Se), respectively. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that low-Se diet caused an increase in G(0)G(1) phase cells that corresponded to a decrease in S-phase cells in thymus. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria injury and increased apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were observed. Low-Se diet decreased the serum IL-2 contents and mitogenesis of peripheral blood lymphocytes to concanavalin A in comparison with those of control group. These data indicate that low-Se diet inhibits the development of thymus by arresting the cell cycle and decreasing the IL-2 content.

In order to explore the specific mechanism of the MnSOD expression induced by manganese, a model of MnSOD expression was developed with primary cultured broiler myocardial cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the model was working or not and to determine how manganese affects the expression of the enzyme in broiler myocardial cells in vitro. In experiment 1, various amount of manganese (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mM) were added into the cultures for 24-h incubation to investigate MnSOD expression and for 0-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-h incubation to measure the cell viability. In experiment 2, the most suitable Mn supplementation based on the results of experiment 1 was added into cultures for 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-h incubation. The results showed that MnSOD mRNA, MnSOD protein, and MnSOD activity were induced by manganese in dose- and time-dependent manner. Manganese regulates MnSOD expression not only at transcriptional level but also at translational and/or posttranslational levels.

In the present study, meiotic phenotypic differences on homoeologous chromosome pairing at metaphase I between hybrids of wheat genotypes Chinese Spring ph1b (CSph1b) and KL with rye were studied by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The frequency of wheat-wheat associations was higher in CSph1b x rye than in KL x rye. However, frequencies of wheat-rye and rye-rye associations were higher in KL x rye than in CSph1b x rye. These differences may be the result of different mechanisms of control between the ph-like gene(s) controlling homoeologous chromosome pairing in KL and CSph1b. Wheat-wheat associations were much more frequent than wheat-rye pairing in both hybriods. This may be caused by lower overall affinity, or homoeology, between wheat and rye chromosomes than between wheat chromosomes.

The RSCU values of each codon of 144 HCV ORFs indicated that all abundant codons were C/G-ended codons. The plots of principal component analysis based on sub-genotype of HCV indicated that sub-genotype 1a and 1b separated clearly on the axis of f2 suggesting that the codon usage bias between sub-genotype I a and lb strains was different. By comparing the codon usage between HCV and human cells, we found that the synonymous codon usage pattern of HCV was a mixture of coincidence and antagonism to that of host cells. The characteristics of the synonymous codon usage patterns and nucleotide contents of HCV, and the correlation analysis between GC(3s), GC(1,2s), GC% (ORF), GC% (5'-UTR), GC% (3'-UTR), aromaticity, hydrophobicity and ENC value, respectively, indicated that mutational pressure was the dominant factor accounting for the codon usage variation and selection pressure also accounted for HCV codon usage pattern.

In ovo administration of rhIGF-1 to duck eggs affects the expression of myogenic transcription factors and muscle mass during late embryo development. J Appl Physiol 111: 1789-1797, 2011. First published September 1, 2011; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00551.2011.-In ovo administration of IGF-1 to poultry eggs has effective roles on post hatching muscle development. However, the secondary muscle development stages at the late embryo development stage are important for muscle fiber formation and differentiation. To investigate the roles of in ovo administration of IGF-1 on duck secondary muscle development, we injected rhIGF-1 into duck eggs in hatching at day 12. After administration on days 18, 21, 24, and 27 in hatching (E18d, E21d, E24d, and E27d, respectively), muscle samples were isolated, and the muscle tissue weight, muscle fiber parameters, and myoblast proliferation rate in leg and breast muscle were analyzed. Additionally, the expression levels of the transcription factors MyoG and MRF4 were detected using qPCR. Results show that embryo body weight and muscle fiber parameters, including muscle fiber diameter (MFD) and the number of myofibers per unit area, are upregulated in IGF-1-treated groups. Moreover, the transcription factors MyoG and MRF4 are expressed at higher levels in the experimental groups compared with the control groups. These results suggest that in ovo administration of IGF-1 to poultry eggs can mediate the expression of MyoG and MRF4, induce myoblast proliferation, and finally influence muscle development during the secondary muscle development stages.

J	Sun, X; Wen, T				Sun, Xin; Wen, Tao			Physiological roles of plastid terminal oxidase in plant stress responses	JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES			English	Review						Carotenoid synthesis; Chlororespiration; environmental stresses; photoprotection; photosynthesis; plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX)	HIGH LIGHT-INTENSITY; PHOTOSYNTHETIC ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; CAROTENOID BIOSYNTHESIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SALT STRESS; CHLORORESPIRATION; ARABIDOPSIS; TOBACCO; EXPRESSION; IMMUTANS	The plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) is a plastoquinol oxidase localized in the plastids of plants. It is able to transfer electrons from plastoquinone (PQ) to molecular oxygen with the formation of water. Recent studies have suggested that PTOX is beneficial for plants under environmental stresses, since it is involved in the synthesis of photoprotective carotenoids and chlororespiration, which could potentially protect the chloroplast electron transport chain (ETC) from over-reduction. The absence of PTOX in plants usually results in photo-bleached variegated leaves and impaired adaptation to environment alteration. Although PTOX level and activity has been found to increase under a wide range of stress conditions, the functions of plant PTOX in stress responses are still disputed now. In this paper, the possible physiological roles of PTOX in plant stress responses are discussed based on the recent progress.

After 3-day-old goslings were orally inoculated with a NGVEV-CN strain suspension, the time course of NGVEV effects on apoptotic morphological changes of the internal tissues was evaluated. These changes were observed by histological analysis with light microscopy and ultrastructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy. DNA fragmentation was assessed with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA ladder analysis. A series of characteristic apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies were noted. Apoptosis was readily observed in the lymphoid and gastrointestinal organs, and sporadically occurred in other organs after 3 days post-infection (PI). The presence and quantity of TUNEL-positive cells increased with infection time until 9 days PI. DNA extracted from the NGVEV-infected gosling cells displayed characteristic 180 similar to 200 bp ladders. Apoptotie cells were ubiquitously distributed, especially among lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial and intestinal cells. Necrosis was subsequently detected during the late NGVEV-infection phase, which was characterized by cell swelling, plasma membrane collapse, and rapidly lysis. Our results suggested that apoptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NGVE disease.

We hypothesized that different, litter fractions derived from a single tree species may respond to N deposition differently depending on the quality of the litter substrate. To test the hypothesis, a two-year field experiment was conducted using the litterbag method in a Pleioblastus amarus plantation in the rainy region of Southwest China. Four N treatment levels were applied: control (no N added), low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). We observed different patterns of mass loss for the three P. arnarus litter fractions (leaves, sheaths, and twigs) of varying substrate quality in the control plots. There were two decomposition stages with different decay rates (fast rate in early stages and slow rate in the later stages) for leaves and sheaths, while we did not observe a slower phase for the decay of twigs during the 2-year study period. The annual decompoition rate (k) of twigs was significantly lower than that of leaves or sheaths. Addition of N slowed the decomposition of leaves and twigs in the later stages of decomposition by inhibiting the decay of lignin and cellulose, while addition of N did not affect the mass loss of sheaths during the study period. In the decomposition of all three litter fractions, experimental N deposition reduced the net N accumulation in the early stages and also decreased the net N release in the later stages. The results of this study suggest that litter substrate quality may be an important factor affecting litter decomposition in a bamboo ecosystem affected by N deposition.

Effect of Dietary Fibre on Reproductive Performance of Sows During the First Two Parities	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article							FED AD-LIBITUM; GESTATING SOWS; EMBRYO SURVIVAL; BODY RESERVES; PREGNANT SOWS; GROWING PIGS; BEHAVIOR; LACTATION; DIGESTIBILITY; LITTER	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary fibre on reproductive performance during the first two parities. Gilts were randomly allocated to receive three fibrous diets from days 1-90 of gestation, including low fibre [low fiber (LF), 10.8% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), n = 132], middle fibre [middle fiber (MF), 15.8% NDF, n = 132] and high fibre diet (HF, 20.8% NDF, n = 135), until completion of the second parity. Response criteria included backfat measurements, litter size and pig weight at parturition and day 22 of lactation, weaning-oestrus-interval, oestrus rate, sow farrowing and culling rate, uniformity of newborns and relative organ weights. The results showed sows fed LF diet in parity 1 gained more backfat (p < 0.05) during gestation but lost more (p < 0.05) during lactation than sows fed HF diet. Furthermore, sows fed LF diet farrowed more pigs (+ 0.7-1.1 pigs, p < 0.05) and pigs born alive (+ 1.0 pigs, p < 0.05) relative to sows fed HF diet. Likewise, sows fed LF and MF diets had greater litter weights at parturition (both p = 0.06) and day 22 after lactation (both p < 0.05). In parity 2, yet, it was MF diet to increase both total pigs born and pigs born alive (+ 0.9-1.1 pigs, p < 0.05) and litter weight (p = 0.05) relative to other diets. After 22 d of lactation, intriguingly, sows fed HF diet had most pigs alive (p < 0.01-0.07) and heavier litter weight (p = 0.07 or 0.2). Feeding HF diet also increased internal organs weight of newborns (p < 0.05). Collectively, feeding LF and MF diets had beneficial effects on litter weight at parturition and day 22 of lactation in parity 1, and feeding MF diet until parity 2 was able to improve litter size and weight at parturition, but this positive effect disappeared after 22 days of lactation, instead feeding HF diet showed the optimal litter performance.

Their ammonia gas-sensitive characteristics were detected at different temperature. It is revealed that the SWNTs based mass sensitive gas sensor has good sensing properties at room temperature. However, the SWNTs based resistance sensitive gas sensor has irreversible response for ammonia gas. When the temperature increases, the noise of SWNTs based mass sensitive gas sensor increases and the gas sensitive characteristic decreases. Meanwhile, the humidity effect is also discussed. It is important to optimize gas sensor by making it work at an appropriate external environment.

Although traditional approaches, e.g. vaccination and bio-security measures, have played an indispensable role in diagnosing, treating and preventing diseases, poultry are still threatened by various diseases. Nowadays, with the development of molecular and quantitative genetics, some poultry diseases can be addressed by breeding for disease resistance. In this paper, the research progress of resistance breeding in poultry is reviewed, including genetics, methods, challenges and opportunities for the poultry industry.	[Jie, H.; Liu, Y.

Four hundred and twenty one-day-old avian broilers were divided into six groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same diet amended to contain 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg vanadium supplied as ammonium metavanadate for 42 days. As tested by flow cytometry, hepatocytes in G (0)/G (1) phase were significantly increased in number in 45 and 60 mg/kg groups, and hepatocytes in S, G (2) + M phases in 45 and 60 mg/kg groups and the proliferation index of hepatocytes in 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg were markedly decreased when compared with those of control group. At the same time, the percentage of hepatocyte apoptosis was markedly increased in both 45 and 60 mg/kg groups. The results showed that dietary vanadium in the range of 45 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 60 mg/kg caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of hepatocytes in broilers.

PCR products were digested with endonuclease AciI, and four known vip1-type genes were identified. Vip1Ac and vip1Aa-type genes appeared in 17 of 26 B. cereus strains. A novel vip1-type gene, vip1Ac1, was identified from B. cereus strain HL12. The vip1Ac1 and vip2Ae3 genes were co-expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 by vector pCOLADuet-1. The binary toxin showed activity only against Aphis gossypii (Homoptera), but not for Coleptera (Tenebrio molitor, Holotrichia oblita), Lepidoptera (Spodoptera exigua, Helicoverpa armigera, and Chilo suppressalis), Diptera (Culex quinquefasciatus). The LC50 of this binary toxin for A. gossypii is 87.5 (34.2145.3) ng mL-1. This is probably only the second report that Vip1 and Vip2 binary toxin shows toxicity against homopteran pests. The PCRRFLP method developed could be very useful for identifying novel Vip1Vip2-type binary toxins, and the novel binary toxins, Vip1Ac1 and Vip2Ae3, identified in this study may have applications in biological control of insects, thus avoiding potential problems of resistance.

A maize (Zea mays L.) association mapping panel including 527 inbred lines with tropical, subtropical and temperate backgrounds, representing the global maize diversity, was genotyped using 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, 926 SNPs with minor allele frequencies of a parts per thousand yen0.1 were used to estimate the pattern of genetic diversity and relatedness among individuals. The analysis revealed broad phenotypic diversity and complex genetic relatedness in the maize panel. Two different Bayesian approaches identified three specific subpopulations, which were then reconfirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) and tree-based analyses. Marker-trait associations were performed to assess the suitability of different models for false-positive correction by population structure (Q matrix/PCA) and familial kinship (K matrix) alone or in combination in this panel. The K, Q + K and PCA + K models could reduce the false positives, and the Q + K model performed slightly better for flowering time, ear height and ear diameter. Our findings suggest that this maize panel is suitable for association mapping in order to understand the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variations for agriculturally complex quantitative traits using optimal statistical methods.

Developmental Changes in Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis in the Normal Duck Thymus	ANATOMIA HISTOLOGIA EMBRYOLOGIA			English	Article							IN-SITU DETECTION; THYMOCYTE APOPTOSIS; NEGATIVE SELECTION; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; RAT THYMUS; EXPRESSION; CYCLE; MICE; DIFFERENTIATION; VIVO	Cell proliferation and apoptosis in the normal duck thymus during embryonic and post-embryonic development were studied. The flow cytometry assay shows that the level of G(0)/G(1) thymic cell population and the proportion of apoptotic cells increased with age, while the levels of S phase, G(2) + M phase and the proliferating index decreased with age. Proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was mainly detected in the nuclei of lymphocytes. The number of PCNA-positive cells in the cortex and medulla significantly decreased with age. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) reaction stained apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of macrophages and free apoptotic bodies or nuclei with condensed chromatin in lymphocytes. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cortex and medulla markedly increased with age. The amount of proliferation and apoptotic cells in the thymic cortex was higher than that in the medulla. The balance between proliferation and apoptosis in the duck thymus may account for the process of thymic development and involution.

The purpose of this 42-day study was to investigate the effects of excess dietary selenium on cellular immune function by determining morphological changes of thymus and peripheral blood T-cell subset. Three hundred I-day-old avian broilers were fed on a basic diet (0.2 mg/kg selenium) or the same diet amended to contain 1, 5, 10, 15 mg/kg selenium supplied as sodium selenite (n = 60/group). Pathological lesions were progressed with the dietary Se level increased. Grossly, the volume of thymus was decreased. Histopathologically, lymphopenia and congestion were observed. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria injury was observed. In comparison with that of control group, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg dietary Se decreased the percentage of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells of the peripheral blood, as measured by flow cytometry. The results showed that excess selenium (more than 5 mg/kg) intake could cause lesions of thymus and decrease of T-cell subsets. The cellular immune function was finally impaired in broilers.

Jian; lipid peroxidation; MHA; oxygen radicals; protein oxidation	CONTAINING AMINO-ACIDS; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; BODY-COMPOSITION; MOUSE MODEL; PROTEIN; GROWTH; REQUIREMENT; GLUTAMINE; CAPACITY; LIVER	Oxidative damage and antioxidant status of intestine and hepatopancreas for juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) fed graded levels of methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA: 0, 5.1, 7.6, 10.2, 12.7, 15.3 g kg(-1) diet) for 60 days were studied. Radical scavenging ability, antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reducase (GR), as well as glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were assayed in these tissues. Results indicated that anti-superoxide anion capacity in intestine and anti-hydroxyl radical capacity in hepatopancreas significantly improved with dietary MHA levels up to 7.6 and 10.2 g kg(-1) diet respectively, whereupon they decreased (P < 0.05). SOD, CAT, GST, GPX, GR activities in intestine and hepatopancreas, as well as GSH content in hepatopancreas significantly increased with optimal MHA levels which were in the range of 5.1-10.2 g kg(-1) diet, and thereafter decreased (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, MDA and PC contents in these tissues together with GOT and GPT activities in plasma significantly decreased with optimal MHA levels which were in the range of 5.1-7.6 g kg(-1) diet, and thereafter increased (P < 0.05). These results suggested that MHA improved antioxidant status and depressed lipid and protein oxidation in intestine and hepatopancreas.

Jian) to study the effects of dietary phosphorus on growth, body composition, intestinal enzyme activities and microflora. Quadruple groups of juvenile Jian carp (7.17 +/- 0.01 g) were fed practical diets containing available phosphorus 1.7 (unsupplemented control), 3.6, 5.5, 7.3, 9.2 and 11.0 g kg(-1) diet to satiation. Feed intake, specific growth ratio and feed efficiency were the lowest in fish fed the basal diet (P < 0.05). Body moisture, protein, lipid content and ash were all significantly affected by dietary available phosphorus levels (P < 0.05). Activities of trypsin, amylase, Na+, K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were improved with increasing dietary phosphorus levels. Intestinal Aeromonas and Escherichia coli decreased with increasing dietary phosphorus up to 3.6 and 5.5 g kg(-1) diet respectively (P < 0.05), while Lactobacillus increased with the increasing dietary phosphorus up to 9.2 g kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). These results suggested that phosphorus could enhance intestinal enzyme activities of juvenile Jian carp and the minimum dietary available phosphorus requirement for SGR of juvenile Jian carp (7.2-63.8 g) was 5.2 g kg(-1) diet.
