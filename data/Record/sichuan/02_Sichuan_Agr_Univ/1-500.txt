Drought stress can affect the growth and secondary metabolites of plants, thus, the current study was performed to investigate the changes on basic physiological processes and accumulation of secondary metabolite by drought and re-water in dendrobium moniliforme. Dendrobiurri moniliforme was grown in four kinds of drought intensity and was exposed for 20 days, then gave it a re-water operation in different stages (day 0,5,10,15,20). Results indicated that the leaf water content was significantly decreased under drought stress, and it was increased under the mild and moderate drought stress upon re-watering. And the carotenoids content was increased the most under severe drought stress, the total chlorophyll content at the early stage was increased under drought stress. The CAT (catalase) activity was decreased significantly and it was increased upon re-watering at the early stage of the drought stress. However, it did increase the polysaccharide, fiavonoids, and alkaloids contents in stems. Additionally, POD (peroxidase) activity and MDA (Malondialdehyde) content were significantly increased in leaves of dendrobium moniliforme under some treatments. These results demonstrate that dendrobium moniliforme can adapt to the drought stress by changing the physiology, and the secondary metabolites were improved under drought stress or re-watering.

We processed 140 morbid Chinese giant salamanders from seven captive breeding populations over five years, and describe the disease associated with CGSRV infection. The most common gross signs were significant swelling of the legs and coelomic cavity, erythema of the legs and ventrum in juveniles; cutaneous erosions and ulcerations in adults, particularly the limbs and the head; and marked petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages of the internal organs, particularly the liver, spleen and kidney. Histological examination showed degeneration, necrosis, and inflammation in many organs, particularly in the organs where hemorrhage was observed. There was evidence of eosinophilic inclusion bodies in degenerated and necrotic cells. We identified virus particles and empty capsids without viral nucleoid in the inclusion bodies using electron microscopy. Virus particles were hexagonal or round shape, and appeared in paracrystalline arrays, aggregates, or singly. All enveloped viral particles were 140-160 nm. Polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing verified that the virus particles were CGSRV. These results collectively support that CGSRV was the etiologic agent responsible for these mass die-offs of the Chinese giant salamander. The pathology described herein will be useful in diagnosing cases of ranaviral disease caused by CGSRV, and provide evidence that this pathogen is a significant threat to the Chinese giant salamander.

A total of 320 healthy common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were randomized into four groups; the control group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 100 IUkg(-1) of vitamin E, while the three experimental groups were fed the same basal diet with reduced vitamin E content (0, 25, or 50 IUkg(-1)). Findings showed that fish in the experimental groups mainly presented with sekoke disease, exophthalmia, leprnorthsis, and ascites. Histopathological and ultrastructural changes comprised nutritional myopathy with muscle fiber denaturation and necrosis, and multi-tissue organ swelling, degeneration, and necrosis. Compared with the control group, RBC count, hemoglobin content, vitamin E concentration, and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly lower in all three experimental groups. However, malondialdehyde content was considerably higher in experimental groups than in the control group. However, there was no difference in glutathione peroxidase activity among groups. In conclusion, dietary vitamin E deficiency (< 100 IUkg(-1)) can cause severe injury and, in particular, oxidative damage in common carp. The oxidative damage might be a main influence caused by vitamin E deficiency in fish. These findings reveal the complete systematic pathological effect of vitamin E deficiency in common carp, which may be applicable to other fish and animals.

Interleukin-8(IL-8) as one of the CXC chemokines, its immunological role and adjuvant potential which had been proved in mammals were rarely reported in fish species. In this study, recombination plasmid pcDNA3.1/IL-8(pcIL-8) was conducted and the capacity of IL-8 as molecular adjuvant was explored from several aspects by co-injecting with a DNA vaccine encoding a-enolase(pcENO) against Streptococcus iniae infection in channel catfish. The results suggested that co-injection of pcIL-8 with DNA vaccine increased the innate immunity and specific antibody levels, as well as increased the immune-related genes involving in pro-inflammatory response, humoral and cellular immunity. Moreover, pcIL-8 enhanced the immunoprotection of pcENO with the relative percent survival(RPS) of 60% to 80% against S. iniae infection at 4 week post vaccination(p.v.), with the significantly higher RPS of 73.33% in pcENO+pcIL-8 group compared with that of pcENO alone(53.33%) at challenge test of 8 weeks p.v. Taken together, these results indicate pcIL-8 as a molecular adjuvant co-injected with DNA vaccine not only improves the immunoprotection but also maintains long period of immunity for channel catfish against S. iniae infection. Our study signifies that IL-8 holds promise to serve as a potential adjuvant in DNA vaccines against bacterial infections for long time.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of AFB(2) on apoptosis and autophagy to provide an experimental basis for understanding the mechanism of aflatoxin-induced hepatotoxicity. One hundred-twenty Cobb500 broilers were allocated to four groups and exposed to 0 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg of AFB(2) per day for 21 d. AFB(2) exerted potent proapoptotic and proautophagic effects on hepatocytes, with increased numbers of apoptotic and autophagic hepatocytes. Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) was cleaved and caspase-3 was activated in experimental groups, showing that the apoptosis of hepatocytes was triggered by AFB2. Increased levels of the autophagy factors Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I, as well as down-regulation of p62, a marker of autophagic flux, provided additional evidence for AFB(2)-triggered autophagy. AFB(2) induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotion of the translocation of Bax and cytochrome c (cyt c) between mitochondria and the cytosol, triggering the formation of apoptosomes. AFB(2) also inhibited the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/ mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway by activating PI3K, Akt, and mTOR and inhibiting their phosphorylation, contributing to the proautophagic activity of AFB(2). These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in AFB(2)-induced hepatotoxicity in broilers.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool to silence gene expression and a potential therapy for virus infection. In this study, the antiviral ability of eight shRNA expression plasmids targeting different sites of the NS3 and NS4A genes of JEV was determined in BHK21 cells and mice. The pGP-NS3-3 and pGP-NS4A-4 suppressed 93.9% and 82.0% of JEV mRNA in cells, respectively. The virus titer in cells was reduced approximately 950-fold by pretreating with pGP-NS3-4, and 640-fold by pretreating with pGP-NS4A-4. The results of western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed JEV E protein and viral load in cells were remarkably inhibited by shRNA expression plasmids. The viral load in brains of mice pretreated with pGP-NS3-4 or pGP-NS4A-4 were reduced approximately 2400-fold and 800-fold, respectively, and the survival rate of mice challenged with JEV were 70% and 50%, respectively. However, the antiviral ability of shRNA expression plasmids was decreased over time. This study indicates that RNAi targeting of the NS3 and NS4A genes of JEV can sufficiently inhibit the replication of JEV in vitro and in vivo, and NS3 and NS4A genes might be potential targets of molecular therapy for JEV infection.

Here, we generated medium-coverage (9-13x) sequences from eight domesticated goat breeds, representing morphologically or geographically specific populations, to identify genomic regions representing selection signatures. We discovered similar to 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each breed. By combining two approaches, ZHp and di values, we identified 22 genomic regions that may have contributed to the phenotypes in coat color patterns, body size, cashmere traits, as well as high altitude adaptation in goat populations. Candidate genes underlying strong selection signatures including coloration (ASIP, KITLG, HTT, GNA11, and OSTM1), body size (TBX15, DGCR8, CDC25A, and RDH16), cashmere traits (LHX2, FGF9, and WNT2), and hypoxia adaptation (CDK2, SOCS2, NOXA1, and ENPEP) were identified. We also identified candidate functional SNPs within selected genes that may be important for each trait. Our results demonstrated the potential of using sequence data in identifying genomic regions that are responsible for agriculturally significant phenotypes in goats, which in turn can be used in the selection of goat breeds for environmental adaptation and domestication.

However, it has long been relied on antibiotics to deal with mastitis, leading to a potential threat to food safety. This study was aimed to investigate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mammary glands of sows around parturition when mastitis and oxidative stress usually occur, and evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) in porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMEC) challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: Mammary tissues and blood samples were collected from seven pregnant sows at different reproductive stages. Primarily cultured PMEC at passage 4 were assigned to four treatments: basal medium (control), basal medium with LPS (10 mu g/mL) (LPS treatment), basal medium with LPS (10 mu g/mL) and DHA (100 or 200 mu M) (LPS + DHA treatments), and cell samples were harvested after 24 h incubation. The measurements included oxidative stress markers in blood samples and gene expression in mammary tissues and PMEC samples. Results: Serum a-tocopherol concentration was lower at parturition than at day 90 of gestation and day 28 post parturition, while serum malondialdehyde concentration was higher at day 28 post parturition than at day 90 of gestation. Higher interleukin (IL)-1 beta mRNA abundance while lower LPS binding protein mRNA abundance in mammary tissues were observed at day 90 of gestation compared with that at parturition and at day 28 and 35 post parturition. Mammary tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA abundance were lower at parturition than at day 90 of gestation and day 28 and 35 post parturition, whereas mammary IL-8 mRNA abundance were lower at parturition than at day 35 post parturition. In the PMEC experiment, compared with the control, increased mRNA abundances of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 downstream target, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), IL-6 and IL-8 were observed in LPS treatment, whereas DHA appeared to decrease mRNA abundances of MyD88, IL-6 and IL-8 induced by LPS. Conclusions: The down-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mammary tissues and aggravated systemic oxidative stress at parturition suggest that sows are in a vulnerable status during periparturient period. DHA appears to attenuate inflammatory responses in LPS-challenged PMEC through modulation of TLR4 signalling pathway.

To understand the molecular basis for placental nutritional transport during the late stages of gestation in LW and MS, we employed the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) method to investigate alterations in the placental proteomes of LW and MS gilts on gestational day 90. Investigation of foetal weight at different uterine positions revealed that the foetal and placental weights as well as the foetal concentration of glucose were significantly higher in LW gilts positioned towards the utero-tubal junction than in those positioned toward the cervix; however, no such differences were observed in MS gilts, and MS gilts had a greater uniformity in foetal weight on day 90 of gestation. Comparisons of the proteomes between placentas positioned toward the cervix and those positioned toward the utero-tubal junction identified 38 differentially expressed proteins in the two breeds. These proteins play a central role in nutrient transport and metabolism, as well as in transcriptional and translational regulation. Of particular interest is the finding that the placentas of LW gilts showed 14 differential expression of proteins mainly related to lipid transport and energy metabolism (including solute carrier family 27, mitochondrial trifunctional protein, and NADH dehydrogenase [ ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2), but only 2 proteins in MS gilts. In contrast, the differentially expressed proteins in MS gilts were primarily involved in transcriptional and translational regulation (such as ribosome-sec61 and 40S ribosomal protein S23), with a few related to glucose and coenzyme transport and metabolism (including glucose transport protein and ferrochelatase). Our results revealed that placental lipid and energy metabolism might play a crucial role in the regulation of foetal weight, based on uterine position in two distinct pig breeds. These findings provide a deeper understanding of placental efficiency that can be utilized to provide a new method to enhance the efficiency of livestock production.

J	Tang, JS; Ning, RH; Zeng, B; Li, Y				Tang, Jingsi; Ning, Ruihong; Zeng, Bo; Li, Ying			Molecular Evolution of PTEN Pseudogenes in Mammals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CANCER RESISTANCE; MESSENGER-RNAS; PATHWAY; CERNA	Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor-suppressor gene. PTEN pseudogene (PTENp) acts as an endogenous RNA, which regulates its parental gene by competitively binding to the 3' UTR of PTEN gene in the human. Despite the importance of this pseudogene, little is known about the molecular evolution of PTENp in mammals. In this study, we identified 37 pseudogenes from 65 mammalian genomes. Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1. Most interestingly, the naked mole rat (NMR), an anticancer model organism, possessed 17 copies of PTENps, which were classified into four clades based on the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, we found that all the 3' UTR of PTEN and PTENps shared common microRNA (MicroRNA) binding sites in NMR, based on our prediction of specific MicroRNA binding sites. Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species-specific gene duplications. PTENps in NMR may function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate their counterpart genes by competing for common MicroRNAs, which may be one of the interpretations for the cancer resistance in NMR.

The symbiotic efficiency and phylogeny of these strains were studied. Effectively nitrogen fixing strains were isolated from both winter type and spring type cultivars. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene and concatenated sequence of atpD, glnII and recA genes, the isolates were assigned as Rhizobium anhuiense and a potential new Rhizobium species. The isolates were diverse on symbiosis related gene level, carrying five, four and three variants of nifH, nodC and nodD, respectively. Strains carrying similar gene combinations were trapped by both winter and spring cultivars, disagreeing with the specificity of symbiotic genotypes to reported earlier faba bean ecotypes.

In the present study, a mildew-index-model-based cluster analysis was used to evaluate and identify groups of soybean genotypes with different organ-specific resistance against field mold. The constituents of soybean pods, including proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and isoflavones, were analyzed. Linear regression and correlation analyses were also conducted between these main pod constituents and the organ-specific mildew indexes of seed (MIS) and pod (MIP). With increases in the contents of infection constituents, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, the MIP increased and the MIS decreased. The MIS decreased with increases in the contents of glycitein (GLE)-type isoflavonoids, which act as antibiotic constituents. Although the infection constituents in the soybean pods caused pod mildew, they also helped mitigate the corresponding seed mildew to a certain extent.

In negative control group, chickens were given orally equal volume of physiological saline. On day 14, 21 and 28, the serum antibody titer, erythrocyte-C3b receptor rosette rate (E-C3bRR), erythrocyte-C3b immune complex rosette rate (E-ICRR) and peripheral lymphocyte proliferation were measured. The results showed that at most time points, the antibody titer, peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, E-C3bRR and elimination rate of immune complex of three OJPS administrating groups were significantly higher (P< 0.05) than those in negative control group. It indicated that OJPS could significantly improve the immune efficacy of Newcastle disease live vaccine, Ophiopogon japonicus polysaccharide possessed synergistical immunoenhancement.

The strain was aerobic, Gram-stain-positive and the optimum NaCL concentration for growth was 1-3% (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain XHU 50891 showed that the organism was related most closely to Glycomyces albus TRM 49136(T) (97.7% similarity). However, it had a relatively low mean DNA DNA relatedness value with G. albus TRM 49136(T) (18.9 +/- 5.8%). The whole-cell sugar pattern consisted of glucose and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H-4) and MK-9 (H-4). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 iSO-C-16:1 and anteiso-C-17:0. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified glycolipids and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.6 mol%. A novel species, Glycomyces lacisalsi sp. nov., is proposed, with XHU 50891 (=CCTCC AA 2015034(T)=KCTC 39688(T)) as the type strain.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to define sodium fluoride (NaF)-induced apoptosis mediated by ER stress in the spleen of mice in vivo and in vitro. Apoptosis and expression levels of the ER stress-related proteins were detected by flow cytometry and western blot, respectively. The results showed that NaF treatment increased lymphocytes apoptosis, which was consistent with NaF-caused ER Stress. NaF-caused ER stress was characterized by upregulating protein expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (BiP) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), and by activating unfolded protein response (UPR). The signaling pathway of ER stress-associated apoptosis was activated by up-regulating protein expression levels of cleaved cysteine aspartate specific protease-12 (cleaved caspase-12), growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (Gadd153/CHOP) and phosphorylation of JUN N-terminal kinase (p-JNK). Additionally, our in vitro study found that apoptotic rate was decreased with remarkable down-regulation of the cleaved caspase-12, CHOP, p-JNK after ER stress was inhibited by 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) treatment. In conclusion, NaF-induced apoptosis may mediated by ER stress in the spleen.

The UV-B stress significantly decreased plant height, shoot dry mass, pigment content, net photosynthetic rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (F-v/F-m) in all plants, but less in the presence of SA, SNP, and their combination. On the other hand, there were considerable increases in malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, O-2 (aEuro cent-), and H2O2 content under the UV-B stress. When SA, SNP, and their combination were applied, content of MDA, proline, H2O2, and O-2 (aEuro cent-) were less increased. Moreover, there were considerable increases in activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase under the UV-B stress and more in the presence of SA, SNP, and their combination. Therefore, it is considered that SA, SNP, and especially their combination could alleviate UV-B stress in dwarf polish wheat.

New oligonucleotide probes, Oligo-HvT01, Oligo-pTa71-1, Oligo-s120.1, Oligo-s120.2, Oligo-s120.3, Oligo-275.1, Oligo-275.2, Oligo-k566 and Oligo-713, were designed based on the repetitive sequences HVT01, pTa71, pTa-s120, pTa-275, pTa-k566 and pTa-713. All these probes can be used for ND-FISH analysis and some of them can be used to detect polymorphisms of wheat chromosomes. Probes Oligo-HvT01, Oligo-pTa71-1, Oligo-s120.3, Oligo-275.1, Oligo-k566 and Oligo-713 can, respectively, replace the roles of their original sequences to identify chromosomes of some barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) and the common wheat variety Chinese Spring. Oligo-s120.1, Oligo-s120.2 and Oligo-275.2 produced different hybridization patterns from the ones generated by their original sequences. In addition, Oligo-s120.1, Oligo-s120.2 and Oligo-s120.3, which were derived from pTa-s120, revealed different signal patterns. Likewise, Oligo-275.1 and Oligo-275.2, which were derived from pTa-275, also displayed different hybridization patterns.

These new oligonucleotide probes provide extra convenience for identifying some wheat and barley chromosomes, and they can display polymorphisms of wheat chromosomes.

To explore the comprehensive transcriptome of GPV- or H9N2-infected goose spleens and to understand the immune responses induced by a DNA virus (GPV) or a RNA virus (H9N2), RNA-seq was performed on the spleens of goslings at the fifth day post infection. In the present study, 2604 and 2409 differentially expressed unigenes were identified in the GPV- and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Through KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, the up-regulated transcripts in the two virus-infected groups were mainly involved in immune-related pathways. In addition, the two virus-infected groups displayed similar expression patterns in the immune response pathways, including pattern-recognition receptor signaling pathways, the antigen processing and presentation pathway, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, as well as cytokines. Furthermore, most of the immune-related genes, particularly TLR7, TRAF3, Mx, TRIM25, CD4, and CD8 alpha, increased in response to GPV and H9N2 infection. However, the depression of NF-kappa B signaling may be a mechanism by which the viruses evade the host immune system or a strategy to achieve immune homeostasis.

However, its role in porcine intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation remains unclear. In the present study, a 789-bp fragment covering the complete coding region of porcine FIT2 (pFIT2) was obtained. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that pFIT2 mRNA was highly expressed in fat tissue. Overexpression of pFIT2 in porcine intramuscular preadipocytes led to an increase in lipid accumulation, which was detected by triglyceride content analysis. Overexpression of pFIT2 also significantly increased the protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-a (C/EBPa), but decreased the protein expression of beta-catenin. We also found that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling specific activator LiCl attenuated the pFIT2-induced upregulation of PPAR gamma and downregulation of beta-catenin. These findings implied that FIT2 promotes porcine intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation by repressing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Forest gaps and the surrounding crown canopies may locally influence the microenvironmental factors, thus affecting the losses of CTs from litter. However, little information is available about the dynamics of CTs loss in forest gaps. In this study, litterbags containing foliar litter of Minjiang fir (Abies faxoniana), red birch (Betula albosinensis), Masters larch (Larix mastersiana), cypress (Sabina saltuaria), Kangding willow (Salix paraplesia), and Lapland azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), were placed on the forest floor at differet positions from the gap center to the closed canopy in the alpine Minjiang fir forest located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the eastern Tibetan Plateau (China). The samples were retrieved during the periods of snow formation, snow cover, snow melt and in the growing season, and the CTs content was measured at each time point. During the first year, all six types of foliar litter experienced high losses of CTs with values ranging from 70.18% to 96.67%. Forest gaps accelerated litter CTs losses in the winter but inhibited CTs losses in the growing season, which demonstrated significant seasonal differences. Additionally, the litter of conifers exhibited greater CTs losses in the winter, especially during the snow formation period, whereas the litter of broadleaved trees showed greater CTs losses during the growing season. These results indicate that the predicted reductions in snow depth resulting from future winter warming and the loss of forest gaps due to forest regeneration will inhibit the decomposition of CTs in the litter of alpine forest ecosystems, which will slow soil carbon sequestration from foliar litter in cold biomes.

Br. is a genus which includes important forage grasses. However, there is currently a lack of data analysis on the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) of Hemarthria species. This study is to use three cpDNA intergenic spacers (trnL-F, trnC-ycf6 and psbC-trnS) to obtain phylogenetic information in 36 Hemarthria samples including four Hemarthria species: Hemarthria altissima (Poir.) Stapf et C. E. Hubb., Hemarthria compressa (L. f.) R. Br., Hemarthria uncinata R. Br., and Hemarthria japonica (Hack.) Roshev. Data analysis revealed that non-significant genetic diversity existed in our samples, which was implied by nucleotide sequences information and the results of haplotypic and nucleotide diversity. The results of phylogenetic trees based on maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) revealed that H. altissima and H. compressa samples were not entirely distinct, suggesting that the two species share an intimate genetic relationship. A haplotype median-joining (MJ) network revealed broadly similar results to those derived from the ML and BI trees and implied that haplotype H3 may represent an ancient haplotype. Analysis of the population statistic Fgr revealed little genetic differentiation among the seven populations of H. altissima in Africa. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little White Lies: Pericarp Color Provides Insights into the Origins and Evolution of Southeast Asian Weedy Rice	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS			English	Article						adaptive introgression; seed dormancy; targeted genome sequencing; Rc gene; weedy crop relatives	PHASEOLUS-LUNATUS L.; LOOP-HELIX PROTEIN; ORYZA-SATIVA; SEED DORMANCY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; DNA POLYMORPHISM; CULTIVATED RICE; CROP ALLELES; RED RICE	Weedy rice is a conspecific form of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) that infests rice fields and results in severe crop losses. Weed strains in different world regions appear to have originated multiple times from different domesticated and/or wild rice progenitors. In the case of Malaysian weedy rice, a multiple-origin model has been proposed based on neutral markers and analyses of domestication genes for hull color and seed shattering. Here, we examined variation in pericarp (bran) color and its molecular basis to address how this trait evolved in Malaysian weeds and its possible role in weed adaptation. Functional alleles of the Rc gene confer proanthocyanidin pigmentation of the pericarp, a trait found in most wild and weedy Oryzas and associated with seed dormancy; nonfunctional rc alleles were strongly favored during rice domestication, and most cultivated varieties have nonpigmented pericarps. Phenotypic characterizations of 52 Malaysian weeds revealed that most strains are characterized by the pigmented pericarp; however, some weeds have white pericarps, suggesting close relationships to cultivated rice. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Rc haplotypes present in Malaysian weeds likely have at least three distinct origins: wild O. rufipogon, white-pericarp cultivated rice, and red-pericarp cultivated rice. These diverse origins contribute to high Rc nucleotide diversity in the Malaysian weeds. Comparison of Rc allelic distributions with other rice domestication genes suggests that functional Rc alleles may confer particular fitness benefits in weedy rice populations, for example, by conferring seed dormancy. This may promote functional Rc introgression from local wild Oryza populations.

Vaccines that are cross-protective against multiple serovars could provide effective control of Salmonella mediated diseases. Bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic and are capable of eliciting protective immune responses. Alterations in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) length can result in outer membrane remodeling and composition of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) changing. In this study, we investigated the impact of truncated LPS on both the production and immunogenicity of Salmonella OMVs, including the ability of OMVs to elicit cross-protection against challenge by heterologous Salmonella strains. We found that mutations in waaJ and rjbP enhanced vesiculation, while mutations in waaC, waaF and waaG inhibited this process. Animal experiments indicated that OMVs from waaC, rfaH and rJbP mutants induced stronger serum immune responses compared to OMVs from the parent strain, while all elicited protective responses against the wild-type S. Typhimurium challenge. Furthermore, intranasal or intraperitoneal immunization with OMVs derived from the waaC and rfbP mutants elicited significantly higher cross-reactive IgG responses and provided enhanced cross protection against S. Choleraesuis and S. Enteritidis challenge than the wild-type OMVs. These results indicate that truncated-LPS OMVs are capable of conferring cross protection against multiple serotypes of Salmonella infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Forty-four LandracexYorkshire gilts were randomly assigned to receive one of four dietary energy allowances (n=11): low (L), medium (M), high (H), and extremely high (EH). The gilts in L, M, H, and EH treatments were provided 75, 100, 125, and 150% of the energy requirement for maintenance from 0 to 30 d of gestation, respectively. Compared to d 0-30 of gestation, dietary energy allowances in each group increased by 20% from d 30-90 of gestation and increased by 50% from d 90 of gestation to parturition. After parturition, all primiparous sows received the same diet and fed ad libitum during lactation. The results showed that dietary energy linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.01) sow body weight and backfat thickness at d 0 and 28 of lactation. Dietary energy linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.01) sow body weight gain and backfat gain from d 0 of gestation to d 0 of lactation. With increasing dietary energy allowance, there were linear and quadratic increases (P < 0.01) in sow body weight loss and backfat loss during lactation, and linear and quadratic decreases (P < 0.01) in average daily feed intake during lactation. However, with increasing dietary energy allowance, individual birth and weaning weight linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05), and litter weight quadratically increased at birth (P < 0.05) and tended to increase at weaning (quadratic, P=0.06). The greatest litter weight at birth and weaning was observed when sows were provided the H energy allowance. The number of total born and born alive was not influenced by dietary energy. With increasing dietary energy allowance, the fat and protein content linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.01) in colostrum, and the fat and protein content quadratically increased (P=0.01) in mature milk. The greatest fat and protein content in mature milk was observed when sows were provided the H energy allowance. The results indicated that providing 125, 150, and 187.5% of the energy requirement for maintenance during early, mid, and late gestation was beneficial in maintaining optimal body condition of primiparous sows, as well as improving piglet growth performance and milk fat and protein output.

However, the evolutionarily conserved function of ObgC in plants remains elusive and requires further investigation. In this study, we identified DoObgC from an epiphytic plant Dendrobium officinale and demonstrated the characteristics of DoObgC. Sequence analysis indicated that DoObgC is highly conserved with other plant ObgCs, which contain the chloroplast transit peptide (cTP), Obg fold, G domain, and OCT regions. The C terminus of DoObgC lacking the chloroplast-targeting cTP region, DoObgC(1-160), showed strong similarity to ObgE and other bacterial Obgs. Overexpression of DoObgC(1-160) in Escherichia coli caused slow cell growth and an increased number of elongated cells. This phenotype was consistent with the phenotype of cells overexpressing ObgE. Furthermore, the expression of recombinant DoObgC(1-160) enhanced the cell persistence of E. coli to streptomycin. Results of transient expression assays revealed that DoObgC was localized to chloroplasts. Moreover, we demonstrated that DoObgC could rescue the embryotic lethal phenotype of the Arabidopsis obgc-t mutant, suggesting that DoObgC is a functional homolog to Arabidopsis AtObgC in D. officinale. Gene expression profiles showed that DoObgC was expressed in leaf-specific and light-dependent patterns and that DoObgC responded to wounding treatments. Our previous and present studies reveal that ObgC has an evolutionarily conserved role in ribosome biogenesis to adapt chloroplast development to the environment.

The host mechanism of defense against enteric nematode infection remains to be fully understood, but it involves a polarized type 2 immunity leading to alterations in intestinal function that facilitate worm expulsion. We investigated the role of interleukin-25 (IL-25) in host protection against Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri infection in mice. Our results showed that Il25 and its receptor subunit, Il17rb, were upregulated during a primary infection and a secondary challenge infection with H. polygyrus bakeri. Genetic deletion of IL-25 (IL-25(-/-)) led to an attenuated type 2 cytokine response and increased worm fecundity in mice with a primary H. polygyrus bakeri infection. In addition, the full spectrum of the host memory response against a secondary infection with H. polygyrus bakeri was severely impaired in IL-25(-/-) mice, including delayed type 2 cytokine responses, an attenuated functional response of the intestinal smooth muscle and epithelium, diminished intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy/ hyperplasia, and impaired worm expulsion. Furthermore, exogenous administration of IL-25 restored the host protective memory response against H. polygyrus bakeri infection in IL-25(-/-) mice. These data demonstrate that IL-25 is critical for host protective immunity against H. polygyrus bakeri infection, highlighting its potential application as a therapeutic agent against parasitic nematode infection worldwide.

MYB transcription factors play key roles in various physiological, biochemical and molecular responses, which can both positively and negatively regulate the stress tolerance of plants. In this study, we report that the expression of FtMYB10, a R2R3-MYB gene from Tartary buckwheat, was induced significantly by ABA and drought treatments. A seed germination test under ABA treatment indicated that transgenic lines were less sensitive to ABA. The overexpression of FtMYB10 in Arabidopsis reduced drought and salt tolerance. Further studies showed that the proline contents in the transgenic plants are markedly decreased associated with reduced expression of the P5CS1 gene under both normal and stress conditions. Furthermore, the expression of some stress-responsive genes, including DREB1/CBFs, RD29B, RD22, and several genes of the DRE/CRT class, decreased in response to FtMYB10 over expression in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that FtMYB10 may play a key role in ABA signaling feedback regulation and act as a novel negative regulator of salt and drought stress tolerance in plants.

In the present study, the ricefield eel scp3 cDNA was cloned, and a fragment encoding amino acids 49 to 244 was overexpressed. The recombinant Scp3 polypeptide was purified and used to generate a rabbit anti-Scp3 polyclonal antiserum. In adult ricefield eels, scp3 mRNA was predominantly detected in the gonads and faintly detected in discrete brain areas. In the gonads, Scp3 immunoreactivities were shown to be localized to the germ cells, including meiotic primary growth oocytes, spermatocytes, and pre-meiotic spermatogonia. During early ovarian differentiation, immunoreactive Scp3 was not detected in the gonads of ricefield eels at 6 days post-hatching (dph) but was found to be abundantly localized in the cytoplasm of some oogonia at 7 dph, coinciding with the appearance of the ovarian cavity and ovarian differentiation. At 14 dph, strong Scp3 immunostaining was detected on one side of the nucleus with a distinct polarity in some germ cells, presumably at the leptotene stage. Consistent with these results, the expression of scp3 mRNA was faintly detected in the gonads of ricefield eels at 6 dph, increased at 8 dph, and then remained relatively high thereafter. Taken together, these results suggest that the appearance of immunoreactive Scp3 in oogonia could be a marker for early ovarian differentiation in ricefield eels. The translocation of the Scp3 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the oogonium of ricefield eels appears to be a controlled process that warrants further study.

The present study investigated the effect of three PPS; Ficus carica polysaccharides (FCPS), Radix isatidis polysaccharides (RIPS), and Schisandra chinensis polysaccharides (SCPS), used as feed additives, on innate immune responses and disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila in crucian carp. Results show that crucian carp fed with these PPS showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of their innate immune response including leukocyte phagocytosis activity, serum bactericidal activity, lysozyme activity, total protein level, complement C3, and superoxide dismutase activity compared with the control group. Their degree of influence on these immune parameters was in the order of FCPS > RIPS > SCPS, except for lysozyme activity (RIPS > FCPS > SCPS). In addition, fish cumulative mortalities in the three treatment groups were remarkably lower than in the control group (95%) when challenged with A. hydrophila, relative percent survivals were 57.9%, 47.4%, and 42.1% in FCPS, RIPS, and SCPS groups, respectively. These results suggest that FCPS, RIPS, and SCPS used as immunostimulants are capable of enhancing immune responses and disease resistance against A. hydrophila in crucian carp, and that FCPS was the most effective. The findings from this study will help accelerate research of this topic, and promote the application and development of immunostimulants, such as Chinese herbs, in aquaculture.

Information on CCRs in plants is limited. In the present study, a plant (26-4) harboring translocation chromosomes 1RS.1BL and 4RS.4DL was selected from a double monosomic (1R and 4R) addition line, which was derived from the hybrid between wheat cultivar MY11 and a Chinese local rye variety. The genome of the plant with double alien translocation chromosomes in the monosomic form showed more instability than that harboring a single translocation. The CCRs involving chromosomes 1RS.1BL and 3B, which were generated de novo in this plant, showed double monosomic translocation chromosomes. A new CCR line with balanced reciprocal translocations 1RS.3BL and 3BS.1BL was developed, which presented normal morphological traits of wheat and underwent rapid growth in the field. A new 1RS.1BL translocation line was also selected from the progeny of plant 26-4. The CCRs and simple 1RS.1BL translocation lines showed significant improvement in grain yield, number of spikes per square meter, kernel number per spike, and resistance to stripe rust and powdery mildew. The CCR line exhibited better agronomic traits and adult plant resistance in the field than its sister line, which harbored a simple 1RS.1BL translocation. The CCRs are remarkable genetic resources for crop improvement.

However, our understanding of Gro/Tup1 protein functions in plants is confined to the model plant Arabidopsis. Here, 11 Gro/Tup1 genes, which were characterized by the typical LisH and WD40 repeat domains, were identified in maize through a genome-wide survey. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that maize Gro/Tup1 proteins could be divided into three subfamilies, in which members shared similar protein and gene structures. The predicted maize Gro/Tup1 genes were distributed on seven chromosomes and segmental duplication contributed to their expansion. Many predicted cis-elements associated with hormones, biotic- or abioticstress responses, meristem and seed development, and circadian rhythms, were found in their putative promoter regions. A potential associated protein analysis identified a large number of candidates, including transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, protein kinases, and ubiquitinconjugating enzymes. An expression profile derived from the RNA-seq data indicated that Gro/Tup1 genes in maize were widely expressed in various organs and tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that these genes responded to at least one hormone or abiotic stress, either in roots or in shoots. Our study provides useful information on the Gro/Tup1 genes in maize and will facilitate the further functional validation of these genes in growth and development, hormone responses, and biotic- or abiotic-stress resistance.

Results indicated that percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake and feed efficiency were the lowest in basal group (P<0.05). Similarly, niacin deficiency decreased hepatopancreas trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase activities (P<0.05), intestinal Na+, K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, -glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase (CK) activities, the cholecystokinin (CCK) content in proximal intestine (PI) and growth hormone content in serum (P<0.05). Furthermore, niacin deficiency downregulated gene expression of hepatopancreas trypsinogen 1, trypsinogen 2, chymotrypsinogen and amylase, intestinal Na+, K+-ATPase alpha subunit isoform 1, Na+, K+-ATPase alpha subunit isoform 8 and CK, and target of rapamycin (TOR) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) of hepatopancreas and intestine (P<0.05), whereas upregulated eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP) gene expression (P<0.05). The niacinrequirement for young grass carp (256-689g) based on PWG, hepatopancreas trypsin activity and Na+, K+-ATPase in PI was 34.01, 35.10 and 42.08mgkg(-1) diet, respectively.

Mouse MII oocytes were subjected first to vitrification/warming and 2 h of in vitro culture (phase 1), then to parthenogenetic activation (PA) followed by in vitro culture of parthenogenetic embryos (phase 2). Different concentrations of melatonin (0,10(-9),10(-6) mol/L) were added to the medium during either phase 1, phase 2 or both phases. The fresh oocytes were used as control. When melatonin was used during both phases, 10(-9) mol/L melatonin-treated group showed similar rates of cleavage and 4-cell embryo development compared with control, which were significantly higher than those of melatonin-free group, while the rates in either 10(-6) mol/L melatonin-treated or melatonin-free groups were significantly lower than that in control. When 10(-9) mol/L melatonin was added during either phase 1 or phase 2, both cleavage and 4-cell embryo development rates of either group were significantly lower than those of control. After oocyte vitrification/warming and PA, the ROS levels increased significantly and maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) related genes (Dcp1a, Dcp2, Hspa1a, Eif1ax, Pou5f1, Sox2) expression were disorganized. However, after 10(-9) mol/L melatonin supplementation, the ROS levels decreased significantly compared with melatonin-free group, and the gene expressions were almost recovered to normal level of control group. These results demonstrated that 10(-9) mol/L melatonin supplementation could increase the developmental potential of vitrified-warmed mouse MII oocytes, which may result from ROS scavenging activities and recovery of normal levels of the expressions of MZT-related genes.

Previously, we showed that sucrose could regulate starch biosynthesis in maize via transcription factors. To better understand the complex regulation of starch biosynthesis, the 10 days after pollination endosperm from Zea mays L. B73 inbred line was collected and treated with sucrose for small RNA sequencing. The sequencing results revealed that 24 known miRNAs and 190 novel miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in response to sucrose. In addition, most of target mRNAs were characterized as transcription factors, mainly including, MYB, ARF, NAC, AP2/ERF, WRKY, and GRAS, which play important roles in starch biosynthesis and seed development inmaize endosperm. The expression profiles of miR398a/b and miR159b/j/k followed opposite expression trends to their target genes when analyzed by qPCR. In conclusion, these results show that sucrose regulates the expression of starch synthetic genes through miRNAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that the yield of the polysaccharides (34.59%) obtained by MAE was higher than those obtained by other methods. Polysaccharides extracted by all three methods had similar physicochemical characteristics and FT-IR spectra. However, SEM images of particles of Chuanminshen violaceum treated by the three different methods were significantly different. Compared with HRE, UAE and MAE resulted in CVPs with lower molecular weight distributions and higher reducing power and scavenging abilities for ABTS(+center dot) and DPPH center dot. CVPs obtained by UAE had reduced scavenging abilities for DPPH center dot compared to those obtained by MAE. These data indicated that MAE resulted in better extraction yields for CVPs and also resulted in CVPs with higher bioactivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent reports have revealed some interesting aspects of the enigmatic pathogen to address the question of why it specifically infects rice flowers and converts a grain into a false smut ball. Comparative and functional genomics have suggested specific adaptation of Vv in the colonization of rice flowers. Anatomical studies have disclosed that Vv specifically infects rice stamen filaments before heading and intercepts seed formation. In addition, Vv can occupy the whole inner space of a spikelet embracing all floral organs and activate the rice grain-filling network, presumably for nutrient acquisition to support the development of the false smut ball. This profile provides a general overview of the rice false smut pathogen, and summarizes advances in the Vv life cycle, genomics and genetics, and the molecular Vv-rice interaction. Current understandings of the Vv-rice pathosystem indicate that it is a unique and interesting system which can enrich the study of plant-pathogen interactions. Taxonomy: Ustilaginoidea virens is the anamorph form of the pathogen (Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota; Class Ascomycetes; Subclass Incertae sedis; Order Incertae sedis; Family Incertae sedis; Genus Ustilaginoidea). The teleomorph form is Villosiclava virens (Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota; Class Ascomycetes; Subclass Sordariomycetes; Order Hypocreales; Family Clavicipitaceae; Genus Villosiclava). Disease symptoms: The only visible symptom is the replacement of rice grains by ball-shaped fungal mycelia, namely false smut balls. When maturing, the false smut ball is covered with powdery chlamydospores, and the colour changes to yellowish, yellowish orange, green, olive green and, finally, to greenish black. Sclerotia are often formed on the false smut balls in autumn. Identification and detection: Vv conidia are round to elliptical, measuring 3-5 mu m in diameter. Chlamydospores are ornamented with prominent irregularly curved spines, which are 200-500 nm in length. The sclerotia are black, horseshoe-shaped and irregular oblong or flat, ranging from 2 to 20 mm. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR have been developed to specifically detect Vv presence in rice tissues and other biotic and abiotic samples in fields. Host range: Rice is the primary host for Vv. Natural infection by Vv has been found on several paddy field weeds, including Digitaria marginata, Panicum trypheron, Echinochloa crusgalli and Imperata cylindrica. However, the occurrence of infection in these potential alternative hosts is very rare. Life cycle: Vv infects rice spikelets at the late rice booting stage, and produces false smut balls covered with dark-green chlamydospores. Occasionally, sclerotia form on the surface of false smut balls in late autumn when the temperature fluctuates greatly between day and night. Both chlamydospores and sclerotia may serve as primary infection sources. Rainfall at the rice booting stage is a major environmental factor resulting in epidemics of rice false smut disease. Disease control: The use of fungicides is the major approach for the control of Vv. Several fungicides, such as cuproxat SC, copper oxychloride, tebuconazole, propiconazole, difenoconazole and validamycin, are often applied. However, the employment of resistant rice cultivars and genes has been limited, because of the poor understanding of rice resistance to Vv.

The results indicate that the probable origin of T. petropavlovskyi is divergence from a natural cross between T. aestivum and T. polonicum, via either spontaneous introgression or breeding effort.

J	Liu, SL; Yang, RJ; Ren, B; Wang, MH; Ma, MD				Liu, Shi-Liang; Yang, Rong-Jie; Ren, Bo; Wang, Mao-Hua; Ma, Ming-Dong			Differences in photosynthetic capacity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and antioxidant system between invasive Alnus formosana and its native congener in response to different irradiance levels	BOTANY			English	Article						invasiveness; irradiance acclimation; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; plasticity	EUPATORIUM-ADENOPHORUM; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; LEAF-AREA; PLANTS; LIGHT; ACCLIMATION; TOLERANCE	We compared the invasive Alnus formosana (Burk.) Makino with its native congener (Alnus cremastogyne Burk.) at three irradiances in terms of photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, and antioxidant system. The increased light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) and light saturation point (LSP) contributed directly to the increased performance of the invasive. The invasive species had also higher plasticity in carotenoid and total chlorophyll than the native species at 100% irradiance, potentially contributing to invasion success in high-irradiance locations via photoprotection. Moreover, the diurnal photoinhibition of photosynthesis, as judged by the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) of dark-adapted leaves, was more severe in the native species than in the invasive species. With increasing irradiance, the invasive exhibited increased antioxidant activities and higher antioxidant levels to support the adverse conditions of both low-and high-irradiance acclimation. In contrast, the intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) and stomatal limitation (L-s) decreased with increases in the net photosynthetic rate (A(n)), stomatal conductance (G(s)), and transpiration rate (T-r). Wespeculated that L-s was the main factor inhibiting the A(n) for both studied species. These results first indicated that the invasive may occupy new habitats successfully through tolerating shading at low irradiance and out-compete native species through higher A(max) and antioxidant levels when irradiance is increased.

The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the reduction degree of graphene products increased with the increase in the volume ratio of DMAc and water (V-DmAc/V-H2o), and kept constant when the V-DmAc/V-H2O ratio was equal or greater than 1. A reduction mechanism from graphite oxide to graphene was proposed. The epoxy groups and hydroxyl on the graphite oxide (GO) surface could be eliminated in the reduction process, whereas the carbonyl was converted to a hydroquinone structure.

However, at present, very little is known about the contribution of social effect to the selection efficiency of long-term response. In this study, the selection efficiency of a socially affected trait with different social effect was investigated in a closed nucleus population using stochastic simulation. Some key factors that affect selection efficiency of genetic social effect were also compared. The results showed social effect played an important role in a longer term breeding programme even though social effect had a small effect on the trait of interest. The percentage of expected total response contributed by social effect was up to 15.27 at the end generation under a very low level of social effect (0.3% direct phenotypic variance). The full model with direct and social genetic effect, improved the selection efficiency of social effect and resulted in 4.89, 5.21 and 2.70% more total cumulative selection response than the reduced model, without social effect, under the social effect size of 0.3, 1 and 10% direct phenotypic variance, respectively. The social effect size and group member number showed more effect on the selection efficiency of social effect than other factors.

To date, no widely-approved methods are available to identify early coenurus infection. Methods: In this study, we identified a full-length cDNA that encodes GP50 (TmGP50) from the transcriptome of T. multiceps, and then cloned and expressed in E. coli. The native proteins in adult stage and coenurus were located via immunofluorescence assays, while the potential of recombinant TmGP50 protein (rTmGP50) for indirect ELISAbased serodiagnostics was assessed using native goat sera. In addition, we orally infected 20 goats with mature T. multiceps eggs. Praziquantel (10%) was given to 10 of the goats 45 days post-infection (p.i.). Blood samples were collected for 17 weeks p.i. from the 20 goats and anti-rTmGP50 antibodies were evaluated using the indirect ELISA established here. Results: The TmGP50 contains an 897 bp open reading frame, in which signal sequence resides in 1 similar to 48 sites and mature polypeptide consists of 282 amino acid residues. Immunofluorescence staining showed that native TmGP50 was localized to the microthrix and parenchymatous zone of the adult parasite and coenurus, and the coenurus cystic wall. The indirect ELISA based on rTmGP50 exhibited a sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 92.6% when detecting GP50 antibodies in sera of naturally infected goats and sheep. In goats experimentally infected with T. multiceps, anti-TmGP50 antibody was detectable from 2 to 17 weeks p.i. in the control group, while the antibody fell below the cut-off value about 3 weeks after praziquantel treatment. Conclusion: Our results indicate that recombinant TmGP50 is a suitable early diagnostic antigen for coenurus infection in goats.

In the incubation process, temperature is the most important factor for the egg hatching rate, the growth performance and offspring phenotype. This not only affects the early development of the offspring, but also has a continued influence on the physical characteristics of the birds, such as final body weight and meat quality. This article reviews the importance of incubation temperature on offspring phenotype, sex differentiation, organism immunity and the development of muscle fibre in poultry.

RFS is an emerging panicle disease, concerning rice production worldwide. However, the biology and pathogenicity of V. virens are still not well-understood. In this study, we investigated the sugar preference of V. virens and the underlying mechanism on how the favored sugar promoted the fungal growth. The results demonstrated that V. virens preferentially utilized stachyose over sucrose that is previously reported to be the best carbon source for V. virens. Stachyose could promote conidia germination, hyphae elongation and mycelium growth of V. virens. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses showed that genes involved in transporting carbohydrate, amino acid, inorganic ion and secondary metabolites were mostly up-regulated by stachyose than by sucrose. Moreover, Uv8b_6977 encoding a putative major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter was highly and specifically induced by stachyose, indicating that it may be a stachyose transporter. Expression levels of several stachyose-inducible MFS genes were also highly induced in V. virens-infected rice spikelets especially when early false smut balls appeared, implicating that these genes may play important roles in the formation of false smut balls. Collectively, this work identifies stachyose as a preferential carbon source for V. virens, and provides gene candidates for investigation of the sugar utilization mechanism of V. virens.

A total of 1180 transcription factors were found to be expressed during three key stages of callus induction. Of these, compared with control, 361, 346 and 328 transcription factors were significantly downregulated during stages I, II and III, respectively. In contrast, 355, 372 and 401 transcription factors (TFs) were upregulated during the respective stages. We constructed a transcription factor-mediated regulatory network and found that plant hormone signal transduction was the pathway most significantly enriched among TFs. This pathway includes 48 TFs regulating cell enlargement, cell differentiation, cell division and cell dedifferentiation via the response to plant hormones. Through real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and degradome sequencing, we identified 23 transcription factors that are regulated by miRNA. Through further analysis, ZmMYB138, a member of the MYB transcription factor family localized in the nucleus, was verified to promote embryonic callus formation in the maize embryo through GA signal transduction.

Pb translocation from lower- to higher-order roots was correlated closely with the structural heterogeneity in fine-root architecture. Growing evidence has revealed sexual dimorphism in the aboveground processes of poplars under environmental stresses. However, the belowground performance of poplars has not been well studied to date. Moreover, both structure and function differ markedly among different fine-root orders. Nevertheless, little information is available concerning root branch-specific responses to environmental stresses. In this study, Populus deltoides was employed as a model species to detect sexual differences in root morphology, architecture and metal accumulation under Pb stress. Compared with plants in control conditions, Pb decreased total root length, total surface area, root diameter and biomass, but markedly increased the Pb concentration and accumulation in both sexes. In general, Pb-induced changes in the measured parameters were greater in females than these in males. In contrast to changes resulting from the Pb concentration, root Pb storage was lowest in middle-order roots. Compared to higher root orders, Pb often caused more significant effects on root length, surface area and Pb concentration in lower orders, except for root diameter. The results demonstrate that females are more sensitive to Pb stress than males. In conclusion, males of P. deltoides could concentrate Pb in the roots of lower orders, and suppress transportation of Pb to high order of root. Moreover, negative effects of Pb were generally branch-order specific and Pb translocation was correlated closely with structural heterogeneity in fine-root architecture.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of tea polyphenols (TP) on intestinal morphology, microflora, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile of laying hens fed vanadium containing diets. A total of 120 Lohman laying hens (67-week-old) were randomly divided into 4 groups with 6 replicates and 5 birds each for a 35-day feeding trial. The dietary treatments were as follows: (1) control (CON), fed a basal diet; (2) vanadium treatment (V10), CON +10 mg V/kg; (3) TP treatment 1 (TP1): V10 + 600 mg TP/kg; (4) TP treatment 2 (TP2): V10 + 1000 mg TP/kg. Fed 10 mg V/kg diets to laying hens did not affect the cecum flora diversity index (H), degree of homogeneity (EH), and richness (S), but hens fed TP2 diet decreased the H, EH, and S (P < 0.05). The cecum butyrate acid concentration was lower in V10 treatment and higher in TP2 treatment (P < 0.05). Addition of 10 mg/kg V resulted in an increased (P < 0.01) duodenal cell apoptosis rate, and 1000 mg/kg TP supplementation overcame (P < 0.01) this reduction effect induced by vanadium. The results indicated that supplementation of 10 mg/kg vanadium increased duodenal cell apoptosis and reduced cecum butyrate acid content.

However, how CPV-2 participates in cell regulation and immune response remains unknown. In this study, persistently infected MDCK cells were generated through culture passage of the CPV-2a-infected cells for ten generations. Our study showed that CPV-2a induces cell proliferation arrest and cell morphology alternation before the fourth generation, whereas, the cell morphology returns to normal after five times of passages. PCR detection of viral VP2 gene demonstrated that CPV-2a proliferate with cell passage. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that CPV-2a particles were mainly located in the cell nuclei of MDCK cell. Then transcriptome microarray revealed that gene expression pattern of MDCK with CPV-2a persistent infection is distinct compared with normal cells. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis demonstrated that CPV-2a infection induces a series of membrane-associated genes expression, including many MHC protein or MHC-related complexes. These genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virus-host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graft-versus-host disease, and RIG-I-like helicases signaling pathway. In contrast, the suppressed genes mediated by CPV-2a showed low enrichment in any category, and were only involved in pathways linking to synthesis and metabolism of amino acids, which was confirmed by qPCR analysis. Our studies indicated that CPV-2a is a natural immune activator and has the capacity to activate host immune responses, which could be used for the development of antiviral strategy and biomaterial for medicine.

However, its effect on host cells is unclear. We predicted that DHAV-1 2A2(pro) was a GTPase-like protein based on the results of multiple sequence alignment and homologous modeling analysis. Upon transfection of a recombinant plasmid expressing DHAV-1 2A2, cells displayed fragmented nuclei, chromatin condensation, oligonucleosome-sized DNA ladder, and positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining; hence, cell death has the characteristics of apoptosis. By staining cells with fluorescein Annexin V-FITC and PI, it is possible to distinguish and quantitatively analyze nonapoptotic cells, early apoptotic cells, late apoptotic/necrotic cells, and dead cells through flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells gradually increased and reached a maximum after 48 h of transfection. In conclusion, apoptosis induced by this GTPase-like protein may contribute to DHAV-1 pathogenesis.

We added root exudate mimics of varying chemical quality to soils collected from two adjacent forest stands (one a similar to 70 year-old spruce plantation, the other a similar to 200 year-old spruce-fir forest) that differ strongly in N availability. The exudate treatments were added for 50 consecutive days, and included water (control), C alone, N alone, and three combinations of C and N that varied stoichiometrically (i.e., C:N ratio of 10, 50 and 100). Exudate additions containing little or no N promoted the greatest losses of soil C in two soils, with the greatest losses occurring in the moderately labile (i.e., acid-extractable) fraction of the low N plantation soils. However, despite the uniformity of priming effects between sites (similar to 7% loss of soil C for both), there was little congruence in exudate-induced effects on microbial biomass and activity. In the plantation soils, exudates generally increased microbial biomass (especially fungi), accelerated N cycling and increased lignin-degrading enzyme activities relative to controls. In contrast, exudate additions to spruce-fir soils mostly decreased microbial biomass, decelerated N cycling, and had variable impacts on lignin degrading enzyme activities (decreased phenol oxidase but increased peroxidase). Collectively, this study suggests that while root exudates with low C and N have the potential to accelerate soil C losses by stimulating microbes to mine N from soil organic matter, the consequences of exudate inputs on nutrient fluxes are less predictable, and may hinge on the recalcitrance of (soil organic matter) SOM, N availability and microbial communities.

During ejaculation, mixing of spermatozoa with the secretions of accessory sex glands leads to their dilution and changes in their function. Although remarkable progress has been made toward the understanding of changes in spermatozoa biochemistry and function before and after ejaculation, it is unknown whether microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in regulating the function of spermatozoa during the transition between the cauda epididymis and ejaculation. In this study, 48 miRNAs were selected for analysis on the basis of their potential involvement in spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, and quality parameters markers. The differential expression levels of these 48 miRNAs between the caudal epididymis and fresh ejaculates of boar spermatozoa were determined. We found that 15 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (eight downregulated and seven upregulated) between boar cauda epididymal and fresh spermatozoa. Five miRNAs hypothesized to be involved in sperm apoptosis were further tested to demonstrate their influence over the expression of their target mRNAs using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Together, our findings suggest that these differentially expressed miRNAs are associated with the functional regulation of spermatozoa between cauda epididymis and ejaculation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Aligned and conductive scaffolds have been fabricated as synthetic microenvironments to improve the function of cardiomyocytes. However, up to now, the influence of conductive capability and inner structure of fibrous scaffolds have not been determined on the cardiomyocyte morphologies and beating patterns. In the current study, highly aligned fibers were fabricated with loaded up to 6% of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to modulate the electrical conductivity, while blend and coaxial electrospinning were utilized to create a bulk distribution of CNTs in fiber matrices and a spatial embedment in fiber cores, respectively. Conductive networks were formed in the fibrous scaffolds after the inoculation of over 3% CNTs, and the increase in the conductivity could maintain the cell viabilities, induce the cell elongation, enhance the production of sarcomeric alpha-actinin and troponin I, and promote the synchronous beating of cardiomyocytes. Although the conductivity of blend fibers is slightly higher than that of coaxial fibers with the same CNT loadings, the lower exposures to CNTs resulted in higher cell viability, elongation, extracellular matrix secretion and beating rates for cardiomyocytes on coaxial fibers. Taken altogether, core-sheath fibers with loaded 5% of CNTs in the fiber cores facilitated the cardiomyocyte growth with a production of organized contractile proteins and a pulsation frequency close to that of the atrium. It is suggested that electrospun scaffolds that couple conductivity and fibrous structure considerations may provide optimal stimuli to foster cell morphology and functions for myocardial regeneration or establishment of in vitro cardiomyocyte culture platform for drug screening.

In the present study, we used flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to investigate the mechanisms of NiCl2-induced apoptosis in kidney cells. After treating 280 broiler chickens with 0, 300, 600 or 900 mg/kg NiCl2 for 42 days, we found that two caspase-dependent pathways were involved in the induced renal tubular cell apoptosis. In the mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, cyt-c, HtrA(2)/Omi, Smac/Diablo, apaf-1, PARP, and caspase-9, 3, 6 and 7 were all increased, while. XIAP transcription was decreased. Concurrently, in the Fas-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, Fas, FasL, caspase-8, caspase-10 and Bid levels were all increased. These results indicate that dietary NiCl2 at 300+ mg/kg induces renal tubular cell apoptosis in broiler chickens, involving both mitochondrial and Fas-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. Our results provide novel insight into Ni and Ni-compound toxicology evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we compared R-S, R-H, R-R, and their responses to soil temperature (T-5) and moisture (theta(5)) in daytime vs. nighttime and GS vs. DS in a subalpine forest in 2011. In GS, nighttime R-S and R-H rates were 30.5 +/- 4.4% (mean +/- SE) and 30.2 +/- 6.5% lower than in daytime, while in DS, they were 35.5 +/- 5.5% and 37.3 +/- 8.5% lower, respectively. DS R-S and R-H accounted for 27.3 +/- 2.5% and 27.6 +/- 2.6% of GS R-S and R-H, respectively. The temperature sensitivities (Q(10)) of R-S and R-H were higher in nighttime than daytime, and in DS than GS, while they all decreased with increase of T-5. Soil C fluxes were more responsive to theta(5) in nighttime than daytime, and in DS than GS. Our results suggest that the DS and nighttime R-S play an important role in regulating carbon cycle and its response to climate change in alpine forests, and therefore, they should be taken into consideration in order to make accurate predictions of R-S and ecosystem carbon cycle under climate change scenarios.

Such metabolites include volatile and semivolatile terpenes, which have been associated with direct and indirect defensive activities in flowers and leaves. In comparison, the structural diversity and function of terpenes in Arabidopsis roots has remained largely unexplored despite a substantial number of root-expressed genes in the Arabidopsis terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. We show that five root-expressed TPSs of an expanded subfamily-a type clade in the Arabidopsis TPS family function as class I diterpene synthases that predominantly convert geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to different semi-volatile diterpene products, which are in part detectable at low levels in the ecotypes Columbia (Col) and Cape Verde Island (Cvi). The enzyme TPS20 produces a macrocyclic dolabellane diterpene alcohol and a dolabellane-related diterpene olefin named dolathaliatriene with a so far unknown C6-C11 bicyclic scaffold besides several minor olefin products. The TPS20 compounds occur in all tissues of Cvi but are absent in the Col ecotype because of deletion and substitution mutations in the Col TPS20 sequence. The primary TPS20 diterpene products retard the growth of the root rot pathogen Pythium irregulare but only at concentrations exceeding those in planta. Together, our results demonstrate that divergence and pseudogenization in the Arabidopsis TPS gene family allow for structural plasticity in diterpene profiles of above- and belowground tissues.

Whereas little information is available on P-efficient soybean genotypes in this region, even though using P-efficient soybean genotypes is a sustainable P management strategy for enhancing yield and P use efficiency. To assess the genetic variation on P use efficiency, 274 soybean genotypes were employed to compare the yields and P acquisition potentials in the field. Additionally, 10 representational genotypes (5 P-efficient genotypes and 5 P-inefficient genotypes) were grown in hydroponic media containing low P treatment (0.05 mM L-1) and high P treatment (0.25 mM L-1) to further investigate P assimilation characteristics and the related mechanisms of P-efficient soybean genotypes. In the field trial, the models described the relationships between yield and seed P concentration (R-2 = 0.85), shoot P accumulation (R-2 = 0.84), HI (R-2 = 0.82) well. The yield, seed P concentration and shoot P accumulation ranged from 5.5 to 36.0 g plant(-1), from 0.045 to 0.93% and from 0.065 to 0.278 mg plant-1, respectively. In the hydroponic trial, P-efficient genotypes under low P treatment showed significantly better plant growth. P accumulation and root: shoot ratio than P-inefficient genotypes. Simultaneously, total root length, specific root length, root surface area and root volume of P-efficient were significantly greater than P-inefficient under low P treatment. Higher rate of organic acid exudation and acid phosphatase activities was observed in the P-efficient soybean genotypes under low P condition when compared to the P-inefficient soybean genotypes. It indicated that significant genetic variation for P use efficiency existed in this region, and the P-efficient soybean genotypes, especially E311 and E141, demonstrated great tolerance to P deficiency, which could be potential materials using in improving production and P use efficiency in low availability of soil P region.

In the study, fourteen different agricultural soils from the southern subtropical to the northern temperate zones in China were analyzed by both chemical extraction methods and exhaustive cropping techniques. Based on the change trends in plant growth indices, relative biomass yields of 70% and 50%, K-deficient coefficients of 35 and 22 under conventional exhaustive experiments, and tissue K concentrations of 40 g kg(-1) and 15 g kg(-1) under intensive exhaustive experiments were obtained as critical values that represent different change trends. In addition, the extraction method using 0.2 mol L-1 sodium tetraphenylboron (NaTPB) suggested soil K release rates of 12 mg kg(-1) min(-1) and 0.4 mg kg(-1) min(-1) as turning points that illustrated three different release trends. Thus, plant-available K in soils was classified into three categories: high available K, medium available K and low available K, and grading criteria and measurement methods were also proposed. This work has increased our understanding of soil K bioavailability and has direct application in terms of routine assessment of agriculture soils.

Liver transcriptome response to hyperthermic stress in three distinct chicken lines	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Heat stress; Chicken; Liver; Transcriptome	HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; ADVANCED INTERCROSS LINE; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; BROILER-CHICKENS; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; OXIDATIVE DAMAGE; TUMOR-CELLS; TEMPERATURE	Background: High ambient temperatures cause stress in poultry, especially for broiler lines, which are genetically selected for rapid muscle growth. RNA-seq technology provides powerful insights into environmental response from a highly metabolic tissue, the liver. We investigated the effects of acute (3 h, 35 degrees C) and chronic (7d of 35 degrees C for 7 h/d) heat stress on the liver transcriptome of 3-week-old chicks of a heat-susceptible broiler line, a heat-resistant Fayoumi line, and their advanced intercross line (AIL). Results: Transcriptome sequencing of 48 male chickens using Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology yielded an average of 33.9 million, 100 base-pair, single-end reads per sample. There were 8 times more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR < 0.05) in broilers (n = 627) than Fayoumis (n = 78) when comparing the acute-heat samples to the control (25 degrees C) samples. Contrasting genetic lines under similar heat treatments, the highest number of DEGs appeared between Fayoumi and broiler lines. Principal component analysis of gene expression and analysis of the number of DEGs suggested that the AIL had a transcriptomic response more similar to the Fayoumi than the broiler line during acute heat stress. The number of DEGs also suggested that acute heat stress had greater impact on the broiler liver transcriptome than chronic heat stress. The angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) gene was identified as differentially expressed among all 6 contrasts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) created a novel network that combines the heat shock protein family with immune response genes. Conclusions: This study extends our understanding of the liver transcriptome response to different heat exposure treatments in distinct genetic chicken lines and provides information necessary for breeding birds to be more resilient to the negative impacts of heat. The data strongly suggest ANGPTL4 as a candidate gene for improvement of heat tolerance in chickens.

PEERJ			English	Article						Cytoplasmic male sterility; Restorer gene; Fertility restoration; Gene targeted marker; Maize	CYTOPLASMIC MALE-STERILITY	C-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS-C) is widely utilized for hybrid maize seed production. However, genetic mechanisms underlying the fertility restoration are very complicated. At present, there is a divergence on the number of fertility restorer genes in maize inbred line A619 for CMS-C. To further elucidate the restoring mechanism of A619, we used genetic analysis and molecular markers to confirm the restorer genes of maize inbred line A619 for C-type male sterile line C48-2 in this study. Firstly, the fertility segregations of (C48-2 x A619) F-2 populations were investigated under three environments during 2013 - 2015. The segregation ratio of fertile and sterile plants in the F-2 population fit to 15:1 via chi-square test and this result suggested that there are two dominant restorer genes in A619 for CMS-C, i.e., Rf4 and a novel gene named Rf* -A619. Next, based on the sequence differences between Rf4 and its recessive allelic rf4, a novel dominant marker F2/R2 was developed and validated to genotyping Rf4 in the F2 population. Through genotypic analysis, we found that there were a certain amount of fertile individuals without Rf4 which accounted for 3/16 in the F-2 population via chi-square test at the 0.05 level. These results provided another proof to sustain that the inbred line A619 contains one additional restorer gene for CMS-C fertility restoration except Rf4. At last, we used one SSR marker which is tightly linked with the dominant restorer gene Rf5 to analyze those fertile plants without Rf4 in the F-2 population. The PCR amplification results showed that Rf* -A619 is not allelic to Rf5 but a novel restorer gene for CMS-C. These results not only provide a basis for the mapping and characterization of a novel restorer gene but also give a new insight into the mechanism of CMS-C fertility restoration.

G. Don), native to China, is a commercially valuable fruit crop with extensive morphological diversity along Longmenshan Fault Zones, a region adjacent to the Qinling and Hengduan Mountains. In this study, we developed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from its own genome to comprehensively investigate the genetic variation of Chinese cherry in this center which is well-known by frequent geological activities and high levels of biodiversity. A total of 33,263 microsatellite sites were identified from the C. pseudocerasus genome, among which 30,148 SSR markers were designed. Of these markers, two hundred primer pairs were evaluated, and finally 20 polymorphic markers were selected to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of 15 representative natural populations (214 total individuals) in the region. The results revealed a moderately high genetic diversity in C. pseudocerasus (Na = 7.00, He = 0.62, PIC = 0.59, I= 1.26). A reduction of genetic variation, heterozygote excess and domestication bottleneck were detected in landrace populations (Na =4.00, He = 0.41,Ar= 1.87, F-IS = -0.11) when compared with the wild ones (Na = 6.95, He = 0.65, Ar =2.49, F-IS = 0.35).The mantel test showed no significant correlation between geographic and genetic distance (r= 0.581, P= 0.08). Moderate differentiation and frequent gene flow were detected among all populations (F-ST = 0.0659, P= 0000, Nm =3.5436). Nevertheless, a clear structure and relatively high differentiation (F-ST = 0.1173, P=0000, Nm = 1.8813) were observed between most wild and landrace populations according to the STRUCTURE clustering and AMOVA analyses. The newly-developed SSR markers in our study exhibited high efficiency and can be utilized in further studies on this species and relatives. Meantime, the comprehensive assessments of genetic diversity of Chinese cherry resources in the biodiversity center have provided us basic genetic knowledge of this species, and this information will be very useful to policy makers on cherry breeding plan and species conservation.

Despite this, there are few reported studies of the physiological and pathogenic mechanisms of Riemerella anatipestifer infection. In previous study, we have shown that TonB1 and TonB2 were involved in hemin uptake. TonB family protein (TbfA) was not investigated, since knockout of this gene was not successful at that time. Here, we used a plasmid based gene over-expression and knockdown to investigate its function. First, we constructed three Escherichia-Riemerella anatipestifer shuttle vectors containing three different native Riemerella anatipestifer promoters. The shuttle plasmids were introduced into Riemerella anatipestifer ATCC11845 by conjugation at an efficiency of 5 x 10(-5) antibiotic-resistant transconjugants per recipient cell. Based on the high-expression shuttle vector pLMF03, a method for gene knockdown was established. Knockdown of TbfA in Riemerella anatipestifer ATCC11845 decreased the organism's growth ability in TSB medium but did not affect its hemin utilization. In contrast, over-expression of TbfA in Riemerella anatipestifer ATCC11845 Delta tonB1 Delta tonB2. Significantly promoted the organism's growth in TSB medium but significantly inhibited its hemin utilization. Collectively, these findings suggest that TbfA is not involved in hemin utilization by Riemerella anatipestifer.

These extreme climate events can change ecosystem functions through driving plant growth and mortality, as well as ecological and evolutionary processes into different directions. We simulated a 1-in-100-year extreme precipitation event in different plant growth seasons (i.e. spring, summer, or autumn) to investigate the functional responses of a mesophytic alpine grassland ecosystem to climate change in the Tibetan plateau. The results demonstrated that the seasonal distribution of extreme precipitation is a critical factor in determining soil microbial- and plant-productivity. The response of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) to extreme precipitation depends on the growth seasons and plant types. Total NPP in the treatments experienced extreme precipitation in the early (spring), mid- (summer) and late (autumn) plant growth seasons were significant lower, higher, and no difference, respectively, compared with the control. Soil temperature and moisture were the key abiotic factors that affected ecosystem functions. For example, in the early plant growth season, no changes of soil moisture and the decreased temperature in response to the extreme precipitation resulted in a substantial decline in NPP. By contrast, in the mid-plant growth season, higher temperature and soil moisture elicited positive synergistic effects on plant growth and soil microbial processes. The increased sensitivity of above-ground NPP and the shift of dominant species from sedges to less palatable forbs might inevitably exaggerate the degradation of this grassland. Nevertheless, a high resilience index in the related ecological processes could potentially contribute to the grassland acclimation and stability, as most parameters returned to the similar levels as in the control after the extreme events ceased. Therefore, several synergistic or antagonistic mechanisms are hypothesized to operate in parallel or at different levels of organization and timescales. Further studies involving a range of different potential scenarios and longer periods are needed to predict the future climate change impacts on mesophytic grassland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These mushrooms had high crude protein (21.72-30.59 g/100 g dw) and total carbohydrate (49.18-62.58 g/100 g dw) contents, but low crude fat contents (1.96-7.87 g/100 g dw). They also accumulated notable quantities of potassium, zinc, sodium, magnesium and copper from the soil. The potassium content, in particular, was 18.75-39.21 times that found in the soil at the collection site. The natural habitat of these mushrooms, especially the mineral content of the soil, seems to have more influence on the mineral content of these mushrooms than their species. Most of the samples possessed antihyperglycemic and antioxidant activities. Suillellus luridus showed the highest antioxidant activity and antihyperglycemic activities, suggesting that S. luridus shows potential for development as a dietary nutritional supplement.

However, the impact of PL on intestinal physiology is largely unknown. In this study, we identified 5275 quantitative proteins using a porcine model in which pigs suffered PL. A total of 202 proteins vertical bar log2 fold-change vertical bar > 1 were taken as differentially expressed proteins and subjected to functional and pathway enrichment analysis to reveal proteomic alterations of the jejunal mucosa. Combining with the results of western blotting analysis, we found that protein/carbohydrate digestion, intestinal mucosal tight junction and cell adhesion molecules, and the immune response to foreign antigens were increased in the jejunal mucosa of the pigs upon PL. In contrast, amino acid transport, innate and auto immunity, as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis were reduced. In addition, the expression of functional proteins that involved in DNA replication, transcription and mRNA splicing as well as translation were altered in the jejunal mucosa in response to PL. Furthermore, PL may reduce amino acid transport and cell proliferation through the depression of mTOR pathway. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the small intestinal response to PL.

Over the last decade, targeting therapies to renal cancer cells have transformed clinical care for RCC. Recently, it was proposed that renal cancer stem cells (CSCs) isolated from renal carcinomas were responsible for driving tumor growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, according to the theory of CSCs; this has provided the rationale for therapies targeting this aggressive cell population. Precise identification of renal CSC populations and the complete cell hierarchy will accurately inform characterization of disease subtypes. This will ultimately contribute to more personalized and targeted therapies. Here, we summarize potential targeting strategies for renal cancer cells and renal CSCs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR), interleukins, CSC marker inhibitors, bone morphogenetic protein-2, antibody drug conjugates, and nanomedicine. In conclusion, targeting therapies for RCC represent new directions for exploration and clinical investigation and they plant a seed of hope for advanced clinical care.

In this study, we performed genome-wide identification of LEA proteins and their coding genes in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) of Poaceae. A total of 23 genes encoding LEA proteins (PeLEAs) were found in P. edulis that could be classified to six groups based on Pfam protein family and homologous analysis. Further in silico analyses of the structures, gene amount, and biochemical characteristics were conducted and compared with those of O. sativa (OsLEAs), B. distachyon (BdLEAs), Z. mays (ZmLEAs), S. bicolor (SbLEAs), Arabidopsis, and Populus trichocarpa. The less number of PeLEAs was found. Evolutionary analysis revealed orthologous relationship and colinearity between P. edulis, O. sativa, B. distachyon, Z. mays, and S. bicolor. Analyses of the non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates and their ratios indicated that the duplication of PeLEAs may have occurred around 18.8 million years ago (MYA), and divergence time of LEA family among the P. edulis-O. sativa and P. edulis-B. distachyon, P. edulis-S. bicolor, and P. edulis-Z. mays was approximately 30 MYA, 36 MYA, 48 MYA, and 53 MYA, respectively. Almost all PeLEAs contain ABA-and (or) stress-responsive regulatory elements. Further RNA-seq analysis revealed approximately 78% of PeLEAs could be up-regulated by dehydration and cold stresses. The present study makes insights into the LEA family in P. edulis and provides inventory of stress-responsive genes for further functional validation and transgenic research aiming to plant genetic improvement of abiotic stress tolerance.

By sequencing flow-sorted 3B chromosome from a hexaploid wheat genotype CRNIL1A and comparing the obtained sequences with those available for CS, we detected that a large number of sequences in the former were missing in the latter. If the distribution of such sequences in the hexaploid wheat genome is random, CRNILA sequences missing in CS could be as much as 159.3 Mb even if only fragments of 50 bp or longer were considered. Analysing RNA sequences available in the public domains also revealed that dispensable genes are common in hexaploid wheat. Together with those extensive intra-and interchromosomal rearrangements in CS, the existence of such dispensable genes is another factor highlighting potential issues with the use of reference genomes in various studies. Strong deviation in distributions of these dispensable sequences among genotypes with different geographical origins provided the first evidence indicating that they could be associated with adaptation in wheat.

Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA), an epithelial tumor induced in goats and sheep by enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), is a chronic, progressive, contact transmitted disease. Methods: In this work, small RNA Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to construct a goat nasal miRNA library. This study aimed to identify novel and differentially expressed miRNAs in the tumor and para-carcinoma nasal tissues of Nanjiang yellow goats with ENA. Results: Four hundred six known miRNAs and 29 novel miRNAs were identified. A total of 116 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in para-carcinoma nasal tissues and ENA (54 downregulated; 60 upregulated; two only expressed in control group); Target gene prediction and functional analysis revealed that 6176 non-redundancy target genes, 1792 significant GO and 97 significant KEGG pathway for 121 miRNAs (116 significant expression miRNAs and five star sequence) were predicted. GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed the majority of target genes in ENA are involved in cell proliferation, signal transduction and other processes associated with cancer. Conclusions: This is the first large-scale identification of miRNAs in Capra hircus ENA and provides a theoretical basis for investigating the complicated miRNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ENA.

"Living fossil" giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is well-known for its special bamboo diet. In an effort to explore functional variation of COX1 in the energy metabolism behind giant panda's low-energy bamboo diet, we looked at genetic variation of COX1 gene in giant panda, and tested for its selection effect. In 1545 base pairs of the gene from 15 samples, 9 positions were variable and 1 mutation leaded to an amino acid sequence change. COX1 gene produces six haplotypes, nucleotide (pi), haplotype diversity (Hd). In addition, the average number of nucleotide differences (k) is 0.001629 +/- 0.001036, 0.8083 +/- 0.0694 and 2.517, respectively. Also, dN/dS ratio is significantly below 1. These results indicated that giant panda had a low population genetic diversity, and an obvious purifying selection of the COX1 gene which reduces synthesis of ATP determines giant panda's low-energy bamboo diet. Phylogenetic trees based on the COX1 gene were constructed to demonstrate that giant panda is the sister group of other Ursidae. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Th9 cells can protect against tumors and provide resistance against helminth infections. Given their pivotal role in the adaptive immune system, understanding Th9 cell development and the regulation of IL-9 production could open novel immunotherapeutic opportunities. The Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1; gene name Slc91)) is critically important for regulating intracellular pH (pH(i)), cell volume, migration, and cell survival. The pH(i) influences cytokine secretion, activities of membrane-associated enzymes, ion transport, and other effector signaling molecules such as ATP and Ca2+ levels. However, whether NHE1 regulates Th9 cell development or IL-9 secretion has not yet been defined. The present study explored the role of NHE1 in Th9 cell development and function. Th cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and pH(i) was measured using 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) dye. NHE1 functional activity was estimated from the rate of realkalinization following an ammonium pulse. Surprisingly, in Th9 cells pH(i) and NHE1 activity were significantly higher than in all other Th cell subsets (Th1/Th2/Th17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTregs)). NHE1 transcript levels and protein abundance were significantly higher in Th9 cells than in other Th cell subsets. Inhibition of NHE1 by siRNA-NHE1 or with cariporide in Th9 cells down-regulated IL-9 and ATP production. NHE1 activity, Th9 cell development, and IL-9 production were further blunted by pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase Akt1/Akt2. Our findings reveal that Akt1/Akt2 control of NHE1 could be an important physiological regulator of Th9 cell differentiation, IL-9 secretion, and ATP production.

Features of the disease include intense pruritus and dermatitis, depilation and hyperkeratosis, which ultimately result in emaciation or death caused by secondary bacterial infections. The infestation is usually transmitted by close contact between animals. Psoroptic mange is widespread in the world. In this paper, the transcriptome of P. ovis is described following sequencing and analysis of transcripts from samples of larvae (i.e. the Pso_L group) and nymphs and adults (i.e. the Pso_N_A group). The study describes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and genes encoding allergens, which help understanding the biology of P. ovis and lay foundations for the development of vaccine antigens and drug target screening. Methods: The transcriptome of P. ovis was assembled and analyzed using bioinformatic tools. The unigenes of P. ovis from each developmental stage and the unigenes differentially between developmental stages were compared with allergen protein sequences contained in the allergen database website to predict potential allergens. Results: We identified 38,836 unigenes, whose mean length was 825 bp. On the basis of sequence similarity with seven databases, a total of 17,366 unigenes were annotated. A total of 1,316 DEGs were identified, including 496 upregulated and 820 downregulated in the Pso_L group compared with the Pso_N_A group. We predicted 205 allergens genes in the two developmental stages similar to genes from other mites and ticks, of these, 14 were among the upregulated DEGs and 26 among the downregulated DEGs. Conclusion: This study provides a reference transcriptome of P. ovis in absence of a reference genome. The analysis of DEGs and putative allergen genes may lay the foundation for studies of functional genomics, immunity and gene expression profiles of this parasitic mite species.

To identify the genomic footprints left by selection during domestication of the Enshi black pig, a typical native and meat-lard breed in China, we generated about 72-fold coverage of the pig genome using pools of genomic DNA representing three different populations of Enshi black pigs from three different locations. Combining this data with the available whole genomes of 13 Chinese wild boars, we identified 417 protein-coding genes embedded in the selected regions of Enshi black pigs. These genes are mainly involved in developmental and metabolic processes, response to stimulus, and other biological processes. Signatures of selection were detected in genes involved in body size and immunity (RPS10 and VASN), lipid metabolism (GSK3), male fertility (INSL6) and developmental processes (TBX19). These findings provide a window into the potential genetic mechanism underlying development of desirable phenotypes in Enshi black pigs during domestication and subsequent artificial selection. Thus, our results illustrate how domestication has shaped patterns of genetic variation in Enshi black pigs and provide valuable genetic resources that enable effective use of pigs in agricultural production.

Impact of neonatal iron deficiency on hippocampal DNA methylation and gene transcription in a porcine biomedical model of cognitive development	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Neonatal iron deficiency; Porcine biomedical model; DNA methylation; Gene expression; Angiogenesis; Neurodevelopment; Hypoxia; RRBS; RNA-seq	HYPOXIA-INDUCED INCREASE; MENTAL-RETARDATION GENE; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; MICE LACKING; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; SEQUENCING DATA; PROTEIN; EXPRESSION	Background: Iron deficiency is a common childhood micronutrient deficiency that results in altered hippocampal function and cognitive disorders. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which neonatal iron deficiency results in long lasting alterations in hippocampal gene expression and function. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark involved in gene regulation and altered by environmental factors. In this study, hippocampal DNA methylation and gene expression were assessed via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq on samples from a previous study reporting reduced hippocampal-based learning and memory in a porcine biomedical model of neonatal iron deficiency. Results: In total 192 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the iron deficient and control groups. GO term and pathway enrichment analysis identified DEGs associated with hypoxia, angiogenesis, increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and altered neurodevelopment and function. Of particular interest are genes previously implicated in cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders in humans and mice, including HTR2A, HTR2C, PAK3, PRSS12, and NETO1. Altered genome-wide DNA methylation was observed across 0.5 million CpG and 2.4 million non-CpG sites. In total 853 differentially methylated (DM) CpG and 99 DM non-CpG sites were identified between groups. Samples clustered by group when comparing DM non-CpG sites, suggesting high conservation of non-CpG methylation in response to neonatal environment. In total 12 DM sites were associated with 9 DEGs, including genes involved in angiogenesis, neurodevelopment, and neuronal function. Conclusions: Neonatal iron deficiency leads to altered hippocampal DNA methylation and gene regulation involved in hypoxia, angiogenesis, increased BBB permeability, and altered neurodevelopment and function. Together, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms through which neonatal iron deficiency results in long lasting reductions in cognitive development in humans.

The root, stolon and leaf aqueous extracts of bermudagrass cv., Chuannan. at all concentrations inhibited the seed germination, seedling growth and root number per seedling of both perennial ryegrass and Kentucky bluegrass than control, and the degree of inhibition increased with the increase in extracts concentrations. The degree of toxicity of bermudagrass cv., Chuannan. plant parts followed the inhibition order : leaf > stolon > root. This suggested that root, stolon and leaf extracts of bermudagrass cv., Chuannan. contain water soluble phytotoxins, which inhibited the seed germination and seedling growth of both perennial ryegrass and Kentucky bluegrass. Hence, the root and the residues (mainly stolons and leaves) of, bermudagrass. plant should be removed from the turf, after mowing to decrease its phytotoxicity on over-seeded turf-grasses. Our results suggest that bermudagrass cv., Chuannan. phytotoxins are heterotoxic, hence, its over-seeding on turf-grass should be avoided.	[Li, C. L.; Han, C. M.; Ye, S. P.; Ou, J.; Zhang, X.

The influence of the BC content and size on the water absorption, contact angle, density, and mechanical properties of bamboo flour/low-density polyethylene (LDPE) composites was tested. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyse fractured and flat composite surfaces. The results indicated that the BC increased water resistance, achieving optimal results at 8% content. The BC particles that ranged in size from 60 to 100 mesh were more water-resistant than other sized BC. The water contact angle increased with an increase in the BC content or a decrease in the particle size. These results indicated that BC reduced the composite hydrophilicity and that the smaller BC particles improved this effect. The BC strongly connected with the LDPE composites, and the BC contents below 12% improved the flexural properties and increased the density of the BPCs. Also, the impact strength of the BPCs decreased dramatically with a decrease in the BC particle size. These results demonstrated that the integration of BC with BPCs resulted in strengthened water resistance and physical-mechanical properties and reduced hydrophilicity.

The objective of this study was to characterize growth, nitrogen use, and gene expression of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in response to increasing nitrogen supplies. Perennial ryegrass (cv. Inspire) was grown in sand culture and irrigated with a half-Hoagland solution amended with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mM nitrogen. Leaf tissues were harvested at 10 days (first cutting) and 20 days (second cutting) and roots were harvested at 20 days. The relatively higher N supply (2.0-7.5 mM) resulted in a larger amount of leaf fresh and dry weight but lower root fresh and dry weight, especially for the second cutting. Root: leaf ratio was higher under low N, but lower under the high N treatment. Leaf N content was relatively higher under 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mM N than under the other three treatments, while 2.5 mM N exhibited relatively higher leaf carbon content for both cuttings. Leaf C:N ratio and leaf nitrogen use efficiency (LNUE) decreased with increasing N supplies for the first cutting but were higher under low N (0-1.0 mM) for both cuttings. Leaf C:N ratio and LNUE did not differ among low N and LNUE also remained unchanged among high N for the second cutting. Root N content increased, but the root C:N ratio and root N use efficiency (RNUE) decreased with increasing N supplies, especially under 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mM N. Low (0.5 mM), moderate (2.5 mM), and high (7.5 mM) N were chosen to examine the expression level of NR encoding nitrate reductase and GS1b encoding glutamine synthetase. Treatment of 0.5 mM N had higher expression levels of leaf NR than other two treatments for both cuttings and a higher level of leaf GS for the second cutting. Expression of NR in the roots did not vary among treatments but the expression of GS increased under 2.5 and 7.5 mM, compared with the 0.5 mM N. Differential leaf and root growth and physiological responses to low N(0 to 1 mM) and to moderate to high N (2.5 to 7.5 mM) could be used for examining the natural variation of N use in diverse perennial ryegrass populations.

In the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway, mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, caspase-8 were increased. Also, NiCl2 induced ER stress apoptotic pathway by increasing GRP78 and GRP94 mRNA expressions. The ER stress was activated through PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 pathways, which were characterized by increasing elF2 alpha, ATF4, IRE1, XBP1 and ATF6 mRNA expressions. And, NiCl2 arrested G(2)/M phase cell cycle by increasing p53, p21 and decreasing cdc2, cyclin B mRNA expressions. Simultaneously, NiCl2 increased TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 mRNA expressions through NF-kappa B activation. In conclusion, NiCl2 induces apoptosis through mitochondria, Fas and ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways and causes cell cycle G(2)/M phase arrest via p53-dependent pathway and generates inflammatory response by activating NF-kappa B pathway.

Hepatocyte behavior under static and dynamic conditions was investigated. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated good hepatocyte survival under the dynamic culture system with effective hepatocyte spheroid formation in the patterned microfluidic chip vs. static culture conditions and tissue culture plate (TCP). In particular, hepatocytes seeded in this microfluidic chip under a flow rate of 10 L/min could re-establish hepatocyte polarity to support biliary excretion and were able to maintain high levels of albumin and urea secretion over 15 days. Furthermore, the optimized system could produce sensitive and consistent responses to nano-Ag-induced hepatotoxicity during culture. Thus, this microfluidic chip device provides a new means of fabricating complex liver tissue-engineered scaffolds, and may be of considerable utility in the toxicity screening of nanoparticles.

While this genus is thought to include a single species, Dactylis glomerata, this species encompasses many subspecies whose relationships have not been fully characterized. In this study, the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of nine representative Dactylis subspecies were examined using SSR and IT-ISJ markers. In total, 21 pairs of SSR primers and 15 pairs of IT-ISJ primers were used to amplify 295 polymorphic bands with polymorphic rates of 100%. The average polymorphic information contents (PICs) of SSR and IT-ISJ markers were 0.909 and 0.780, respectively. The combined data of the two markers indicated a high level of genetic diversity among the nine D. glomerata subspecies, with a Nei's gene diversity index value of 0.283 and Shannon's diversity of 0.448. Preliminarily phylogenetic analysis results revealed that the 20 accessions could be divided into three groups (A, B, C). Furthermore, they could be divided into five clusters, which is similar to the structure analysis with K = 5. Phylogenetic placement in these three groups may be related to the distribution ranges and the climate types of the subspecies in each group. Group A contained eight accessions of four subspecies, originating from the westMediterranean, while Group B contained seven accessions of three subspecies, originating from the east Mediterranean.

The triggering of this process is related to slope, rainfall intensity and surface cover. Therefore, this study assesses the effects of different simulated rainfall intensities with different slopes on hydrological and erosional processes in un-mulched and mulched purple soils. Results show that the sediment and water losses increased with an increase of rainfall intensity and slope steepness. Generally, the slope contribution (Sc) on water and sediment losses decreased with increasing rainfall intensity and slope steepness under both un-mulched and mulched soil. In un-mulched conditions, water losses were independent of slope steepness (Sc < 50%) during the highest rainfall intensity. However, in mulched soil, the higher contributions of slope ( Sc) and rainfall (Rc) were found for water and sediment losses, respectively, i.e., > 50%, except during the increase in slope steepness from 15 degrees to 25 degrees under the highest rainfall intensity (120 mm.h(-1)). The effectiveness of mulch was more pronounced in reducing sediment losses (81%-100%) compared with water losses (14%-100%). The conservation effectiveness of mulch both decreased and increased with slope steepness for water and sediment losses, respectively, under higher rainfall intensities. Water infiltration and recharge coefficient ( RC) decreased with an increase of slope steepness, while with an increase in rainfall intensity, the water infiltration and RC were increased and decreased, respectively, in both un-mulched and mulched soil. On the other hand, mulched soil maintained a significantly (alpha = 0.05) higher infiltration capacity and RC compared to that of the un-mulched soil.

To understand how mt genomes evolved in the family Aleyrodidae, we have sequenced the complete mt genome of Aleurocanthus camelliae and comparatively analyzed all reported whitefly mt genomes. The mt genome of A. camelliae is 15,188 bp long, and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 21 tRNA genes and a putative control region (GenBank: KU761949). The tRNA gene, trnI, has not been observed in this genome. The mt genome has a unique gene order and shares most gene boundaries with Tetraleurodes acaciae. Nineteen of 21 tRNA genes have the conventional cloverleaf shaped secondary structure and two (trnS(1) and trnS(2)) lack the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm. Using ARWEN and homologous sequence alignment, we have identified five tRNA genes and revised the annotation for three whitefly mt genomes. This result suggests that most absent genes exist in the genomes and have not been identified, due to be lack of technology and inference sequence. The phylogenetic relationships among 11 whiteflies and Drosophila melanogaster were inferred by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Aleurocanthus camelliae and T. acaciae form a sister group, and all three Bemisia tabaci and two Bemisia afer strains gather together. These results are identical to the relationships inferred from gene order. We inferred that gene rearrangement plays an important role in the mt genome evolved from whiteflies.

Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used in this study to identify differences in gene expression between two C. cladosporioides strains, the highly virulent Z20 strain and the lowly virulent Zt strain. A total of 61 unigenes from the forward library and 42 from the reverse library were identified. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that these genes were involved in various biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the unigenes in the forward library corresponded to 5 different pathways and the reverse library unigenes were involved in 3 different pathways. The qRT-PCR results indicated that expressions of APL1, GUD1, CSE1, SPBC3E7.04c and MFS were significantly different between Z20 and Zt strains, while genes encoding the senescence-associated proteins, psel, nup107, mip1, pex2, icli and alpha/beta hydrolase exhibited no significant differences between the two strains. In addition, we found that 5 unigenes encoding mip1, chk1, icl1, alpha/beta hydrolase and beta-glucosidase may be associated with pathogenicity. One unigene (MFS) may be related to the resistance to 14 cc-demethylase inhibitor fungicides, and 5 unigenes (PEX2, NUP107, PSE1, APL1, and SPBC3E7.04c) may be related to either low spore yield or earlier aging of the Zt strain. Our study may help better understand the molecular mechanism of C. cladosporioides infection, and therefore improve the treatment and prevention of C. cladosporioides induced diseases.

Twelve Maiwa yak (110.3+/-5.85 kg) were randomly divided into two groups (baseline and starvation group). The yak of baseline group were slaughtered at day 0, while the other group of yak were kept in shed without feed but allowed free access to water, salt and free movement for 9 days. Blood samples of the starvation group were collected on day 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and the starved yak were slaughtered after the final blood sample collection. The liver and muscle glycogen of the starvation group decreased (p<0.01), and the lipid content also decreased while the content of moisture and ash increased (p<0.05) both in Longissimus dorsi and liver compared with the baseline group. The plasma insulin and glucose of the starved yak decreased at first and then kept stable but at a relatively lower level during the following days (p<0.01). On the contrary, the non-esterified fatty acids was increased (p<0.01). Beyond our expectation, the ketone bodies of beta-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid decreased with prolonged starvation (p<0.01). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of lipogenetic enzyme fatty acid synthase and lipoprotein lipase in subcutaneous adipose tissue of starved yak were down-regulated (p<0.01), whereas the mRNA expression of lipolytic enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and hormone sensitive lipase were up-regulated (p<0.01) after 9 days of starvation. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase, responsible for hepatic gluconeogenesis were up-regulated (p<0.01). It was concluded that yak derive energy by gluconeogenesis promotion and fat storage mobilization during starvation but without ketone body accumulation in the plasma.

To investigate the effects of urea type (polyaspartate urea versus conventional urea) and N management method (farmer's fertilizer practice and optimized N management) on NSC accumulation and remobilization in rice, field experiments were conducted in Wenjiang, China, in 2014 and 2015. Grain yield, effective panicles, and total number of spikelets were positively related to NSC accumulation in aboveground parts and remobilization of stored NSC (RSN) in the stem plus sheath from 20 d after heading to maturity. Polyaspartate urea, in place of conventional urea, increased NSC accumulation in the leaf lamina and the stem plus sheath at the heading stage and promoted RSN in the stem plus sheath from 20 d after heading to maturity, improving grain yield and total aboveground biomass. Compared with farmer's fertilizer practice, optimized N management showed a 5% reduction in NSC accumulation in the stem plus sheath from planting to heading and a 22% decrease in RSN in the stem plus sheath from heading to 20 d after. Optimized N management increased RSN in the stem plus sheath from 20 d after heading to maturity, increasing NSC accumulation in the panicle and grain yield. Using polyaspartate urea with optimized N management may indeed be a practical and feasible way to enhance grain yield of rice in subtropical humid monsoon climates.

Results demonstrated that optimal Mn increased toughness, collagen content, and pH, and decreased the cooking loss, and cathepsin B and L activities to enhance the flesh quality of fish. Meanwhile, optimal Mn increased the protein, lipid, the total essential amino acid (AA) (especially umami AA), and healthcare fatty acids, C18: 1c+t, C20: 3n-3, C20: 4 and DHA contents. These might be partially related to the decreased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, and the enhanced activities of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) modulated by their gene expression, Nrf2 and TOR signaling. We firstly demonstrated that Mn improved flesh quality, flavor and healthcare function in fish muscle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 24 field strains were isolated from diseased chickens between 2012 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1 nucleotide sequences showed that 16 of the 24 isolates were clustered into four distinct genotypes: QX (37.5%), TW (16.7%, TWI and TWII), Mass (8.3%), and J2 (4.2%). The QX genotype was still the prevalent genotype in southwestern China. Recombination analysis of the S1 subunit gene showed that eight of the 24 field strains were recombinant variants that originated from field strains and vaccine strains. A new potential recombination hotspot [ATTTT(T/A)] was identified, implying that recombination events may become more and more common. The antigenicity of ten IBVs, including seven field strains and commonly used vaccine strains, were assayed with a viral cross-neutralization assay in chicken embryonated kidney cells (CEK). The results showed that the ten IBVs could be divided into four serotypes (Massachusetts, 793B, Sczy3, and SCYB). Sczy3 and 793B were the predominant serotypes. Six of the seven field isolates (all except for cK/CH/SCYB/140913) cross-reacted well with anti-sera against other field strains. In conclusion, the genetic and antigenic features of IBVs from southwestern China in recent years have changed when compared to the previous reports. The results could provide a reference for vaccine development and the prevention of infectious bronchitis in southwestern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of dietary crude protein levels and exogenous protease on performance, nutrient digestibility, trypsin activity and intestinal morphology in broilers	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Protein; Protease; Broiler; Digestibility; Activity of protease; Intestinal morphology	GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; SOYBEAN-MEAL; ENZYME SUPPLEMENTATION; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; MONOCOMPONENT PROTEASE; CHYME CHARACTERISTICS; BODY-COMPOSITION; AMINO-ACIDS; CHICKS; IMPROVEMENT	The experiment was conducted to study the effect of exogenous protease in different crude protein (CP) level diets on performance, nutrient utilization, trypsin activity and intestinal morphology in broilers. A total of 1,080 1-d-old Arbor Acres (AA) male broilers were allocated into a 3 x 3 factorial design that included 3 CP levels (CP1, CP starter 21%, grower 19%; CP2, CP starter 20%, grower 18%; CP3, CP starter 19%, grower 17%) and 3 protease levels (0, 150, and 300 mg/kg, enzyme activity unit 1 x 10(5) U/g) for 42 d (starter, d 1-21; grower, d 22-42). As CP was decreased on d 1-21 and from d 1-42, body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI) of birds were reduced (P <= 0.05), whereas the ratio of feed to gain (F/G) was increased (P < 0.05). Protease supplementation significantly improved the F/G of 1-21-d-old broilers (P < 0.05), regardless of dietary protein level. The apparent CP digestibility of the CP3 diet was lower than that of the CP1 diet (P < 0.05), and protease supplementation significantly improved CP digestibility (P < 0.05). When CP levels decreased, the activity of trypsin in the pancreas and duodenum content was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and both the villus height and the vinous height and the crypt depth ratio (VCR) in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Supplementation with 300 mg/kg of protease significantly increased the activity of trypsin in the pancreas (P < 0.05) and 21 d villus height and VCR in the duodenum, jejunum (villus height), ileum (VCR). No interaction was observed among growth performance, nutrient digestibility, trypsin activity and the intestinal morphology of the broilers. These results suggest that supplementation with an exogenous protease enhanced endogenous trypsin activity and intestinal morphology regardless of CP levels, which resulted in improved CP digestibility during the starter period.

In this study, the molecular biomarker of amoA gene of archaea and bacteria was applied in polymerase chain- reaction (PCR) amplification and quantitative real-time (RT) PCR (qPCR) to detect the abundance of AOA and AOB at 4 locations (Pond, Entrance, Gallery and Central Tower) of Bayon temple at Angkor Thom, Cambodia. The results showed that both AOA and AOB were positively detected at all locations and the diversity index suggested that AOA were more diverse than AOB. Sequences of AOA were mainly distributed in Group I.1b and few clustered in Group I.1a and Group I.1a-associated, while AOB were all closely related to beta-proteobacteria (Nitrosospira). Based on the qPCR results, AOA outnumbered AOB clearly, the gene copy numbers of AOA amoA gene ranged from 1.35 x 10(6) to 2.52 x 10(8) copies per gram of dry materials, while, in comparison, AOB amoA gene copy numbers from 6.54 x 10(5) to 4.52 x 10(6) copies per gram of dry materials. In addition, the abundance of amoA gene from galleries was the highest than other locations. At gallery section, gene abundance, NH4+ and NO3- agreed well with the intensity of biofilm development. Based on the community and abundance analysis, nitrogen cycling plays an important role in contributing to deterioration of sandstone monuments at Angkor Thom in Cambodia under tropical climate.

Hu and Small-tailed Han sheep, for example, have become non-seasonal breeders and exhibit higher fecundity than Tan and Ujumqin breeds. We therefore scanned reproduction-related single-nucleotide variations from methylated DNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing data generated from each of those four breeds to uncover potential mechanisms underlying this breed variation. We generated a high-quality map of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in DNA methylation enriched regions, and found that the majority of variants are located within non-coding regions. We identified 359 SNVs within the Sheep Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) database. Nineteen of these SNVs associated with the Aseasonal Reproduction QTL, and 10 out of the 19 reside close to genes with known reproduction functions. We also identified the well-known FecB mutation in high-fecundity sheep (Hu and Small-tailed Han sheep). When we applied these FecB finding to our breeding system, we improved lambing rate by 175%. In summary, this study provided strong candidate SNVs associated with sheep fecundity that can serve as targets for functional testing and to enhance selective breeding strategies. Mol. Reprod.

To monitor the health status of fish, Hsp90 a potential early warning marker was determined in Schizothorax prenanti after infection with a bacterium. In this study, we cloned Hsp90 from S. prenanti for the first time. The full-length cDNA sequence of SpHsp90 was 2663 bp, contains an open reading frame of 2181 bp, and has a gene encoding 726 amino acids, an estimated molecular mass of 83.38 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.91. The SpHsp90 amino acid sequence has five conserved HSP90 family signatures and shares 87.0-95.5 % identity with other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis and structure comparison indicated that SpHsp90 should be a beta isoform of the HSP90 family. SpHsp90 was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, and the highest level of expression was in the kidney. After Streptococcus agalactiae infection, the level of SpHsp90 expression had significant changes (P < 0.05) in the hepatopancreas, spleen, kidney, and blood. The expression increased to the highest level at 6 h in the blood and at 24 h in the hepatopancreas, spleen, and kidney. The results suggested that the SpHsp90 gene could be induced by S. agalactiae in S. prenanti and that SpHsp90 may be involved in resistance to bacterial infection and provide an early warning information. The kidney is the most suitable for detecting SpHsp90 after bacterial infection.

The results indicated that compared with optimal vitamin C supplementation, vitamin C deficiency (2.9 mg/kg diet) (1) increased reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl (PC) contents (P < 0.05), decreased the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities and mRNA levels (P < 0.05), and glutathione and vitamin C contents (P < 0.05), down-regulated NF-E2-related factor 2 mRNA level (P < 0.05), and up-regulated Kelch-like ECH-associating protein (Keap) 1a (rather than Keap1b) mRNA level (P < 0.05) in the gill of grass carp under infection of F. columnare, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency induced oxidative injury in fish gill; (2) up-regulated caspase-3, -7, -8, -9, Fas ligand, B-cell lymphoma protein 2 associated X protein, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 mRNA levels (P < 0.05), and down-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis protein and B-cell lymphoma-2 (rather than myeloid cell leukemia-1) mRNA level (P < 0.05) in the gill of grass carp under infection of F columnare, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency aggravated cell apoptosis in fish gill; (3) up-regulated pore-forming TJs Claudin-12, 15a, -15b, and related signaling molecules myosin light chain kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (rather than c-jun N-terminal kinases) mRNA levels (P < 0.05), and down regulated barrier-forming TJs Occludin, zonula occludens (ZO) 1, ZO-2, Claudin-c, -3c, -7a, -7b mRNA levels (P < 0.05) in the gill of grass carp under infection of F. columnare, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency disrupted tight junctional complexes in fish gill; (4) decreased lysozyme and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, and complement 3 (C3), C4 and IgM contents (P < 0.05), down-regulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides liver expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A, LEAP-2B, Hepcidin, defensin mRNA levels (P < 0.05) in the gill of grass carp under infection of E columnare, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency decrease fish gill immune function; (5) down-regulated the mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines-related factors interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-11, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1, TGF-beta 2, inhibitor of kappa Ba and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (rather than 4E-BP2) (P < 0.05), and up regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines-related factors interferon gamma 2, IL-beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 P35, IL-12 P40, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 (rather than NF-kappa B p52), I kappa B kinases (IKK) (only IKK alpha and IKK gamma), target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 mRNA levels (P < 0.05) in the gill of grass carp under infection of F columnare, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency aggravated fish gill inflammation. In conclusion, vitamin C deficiency disrupted physical barriers and immune barriers, and regulated relative mRNA levels of signaling molecules in fish gill. The vitamin C requirement for against gill rot morbidity of grass carp (264-1031 g) was estimated to be 156.0 mg/kg diet. In addition, based on the gill biochemical indices (antioxidant indices MDA, PC and vitamin C contents, and immune indices LA and ACP activity) the vitamin C requirements for grass carp (264-1031 g) were estimated to be 116.8, 156.6, 110.8, 57.8 and 134.9 mg/kg diet, respectively.

JIAN; EIF4E-BINDING PROTEIN2; AEROMONAS-HYDROPHILA; GENE EXPRESSIONS; ACTIVATION; PATHWAY	This study investigated the effects of choline on intestinal mucosal immune and the possible mechanisms in fish by feeding juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) with graded levels of dietary choline (165-1820 mg/kg diet) for 65 days. The results firstly showed that choline deficiency induced inflammatory infiltration in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) of fish. Meanwhile, compared with the optimal choline group, choline deficiency decreased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, contents of complement 3 and IgM in the intestine, downregulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A and defensin-3 in the PI and MI, LEAP-2B and hepcidin in the PI, MI and DI), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) 10 and transforming growth factor beta 2 in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecule I kappa B in the PI, MI and DI; while upregulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6a and tumor necrosis factor a in the MI and DI, interferon gamma 2b in the PI and MI, IL-1 beta and IL-6b in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecules (Toll-like receptor 4 in the MI, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 in the PI and MI, Janus kinase 3 and tyrosine kinase 2 in the MI and DI, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 4 and STAT5 in the PI, MI and DI) of juvenile Jian carp, further indicating that choline deficiency caused inflammation and immunity depression in the intestine of fish. But choline deficiency decreased the PI IL-6a mRNA level, and increased the DI LEAP-2A and defensin-3 mRNA levels with unknown reasons. Furthermore, dietary choline deficiency downregulated mRNA levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin 3c in the PI and MI, claudin 7, claudin 11 and occludin in the PI, MI and DI) and signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 in the PI, MI and DI of juvenile Jian carp, whereas upregulated the mRNA levels of claudin 3b in the MI and DI, and claudin 3c in the DI. Moreover, the excessive choline exhibited negative effects on intestinal immunity and TJ proteins that were similar to the choline deficiency. In summary, dietary choline deficiency or excess caused the depression of intestinal mucosal immune by inducing inflammation and dysfunction of the intestinal physical barrier, and regulating related signaling molecules of fish.

However, the researches of UCN3 in fish were scarce. In order to understand whether UCN3 play a role in regulating food intake in fish, we first cloned the ucn3 cDNAs sequence of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii Brandt), and investigated the ucn3 mRNA levels in 11 tissues. The Siberian sturgeon ucn3 cDNA sequence was 1044 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 447 bp that encoded 148 amino acids with a mature peptide of 40 amino acids, a 5'-terminal untranslated region (5'-UTR) of 162 bp and a 3'-terminal untranslated region (3'-UTR) of 435 bp. The result of tissue distribution showed that ucn3 widely distributed in 11 tissues with highest expression in brain. We also assessed the effects of periprandial (pre- and post-feeding), fasting and re-feeding on ucn3 mRNAs abundance in brain. The results showed the expression of ucn3 mRNA in brain was significantly elevated after feeding, decreased after fasting 17 days and increased after re-feeding. To further investigate the food intake role of UCN3 in Siberian sturgeon, we performed intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Siberian sturgeon UCN3 (SsUCN3) with three doses (60, 120 or 240 ng/g) and recorded the food intake. Acute and chronic i.p. injection SsUCN3 reduced the food intake in a dose-dependent pattern. In conclusion, this study indicates that SsUCN3 acts as a satiety factor to inhibit the food intake of Siberian sturgeon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Effects of low-protein diets supplemented with indispensable amino acids on growth performance, intestinal morphology and immunological parameters in 13 to 35 kg pigs	ANIMAL			English	Article						amino acids; protein level; immune function; intestinal morphology; pig	LOW-CRUDE-PROTEIN; GROWING PIGS; WEANED PIGS; NITROGEN-BALANCE; ORGAN WEIGHTS; PIGLETS; LEVEL; INDICATORS; HISTIDINE; RESPONSES	The objective of this study was to determine if a moderate or high reduction of dietary CP, supplemented with indispensable amino acids (IAA), would affect growth, intestinal morphology and immunological parameters of pigs. A total of 40 barrows (initial BW = 13.50 +/- 0.50 kg, 45 +/- 2 day of age) were used in a completely randomized block design, and allocated to four dietary treatments containing CP levels at 20.00%, 17.16%, 15.30% and 13.90%, respectively. Industrial AA were added to meet the IAA requirements of pigs. After 4-week feeding, blood and tissue samples were obtained from pigs. The results showed that reducing dietary CP level decreased average daily gain, plasma urea nitrogen concentration and relative organ weights of liver and pancreas (P < 0.01), and increased feed conversion ratio (P < 0.01). Pigs fed the 13.90% CP diet had significantly lower growth performance than that of pigs fed higher CP at 20.00%, 17.16% or 15.30%. Moreover, reducing dietary CP level decreased villous height in duodenum (P < 0.01) and crypt depth in duodenum, jejunum and ileum (P < 0.01). The reduction in the dietary CP level increased plasma concentrations of methionine, alanine (P < 0.01) and lysine (P < 0.05), and decreased arginine (P < 0.05). Intriguingly, reducing dietary CP level from 20.00% to 13.90% resulted in a significant decrease in plasma concentration of IgG (P < 0.05), percentage of CD3(+)T cells of the peripheral blood (P < 0.01), also down-regulated the mRNA abundance of innate immunity-related genes on toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (P < 0.01) and nuclear factor kappa B (P < 0.05) in the ileum. These results indicate that reducing dietary CP level from 20.00% to 15.30%, supplemented with IAA, had no significant effect on growth performance and had a limited effect on immunological parameters. However, a further reduction of dietary CP level up to 13.90% would lead to poor growth performance and organ development, associated with the modifications of intestinal morphology and immune function.

Twenty-five multiparous Holstein cows were randomly allocated to five groups corresponding to five isonitrogenous total mixed rations, with net energy for lactation (NEL) content of 6.15 (NE-6.15), 6.36 (NE-6.36), 6.64 (NE-6.64), 6.95 (NE-6.95), 7.36 (NE-7.36) MJ/kg of dry matter (DM), respectively. Throughout the experimental period the average temperature humidity index at 07.00, 14.00 and 22.00hours was 72.1, 88.7, and 77.6, respectively. DM intake decreased significantly with the elevated dietary NEL concentration. Fat corrected milk increased quadratically, and milk fat content and milk energy (MJ/kg) reached the greatest in the NE-6.95 group with increasing dietary NEL content. Strong correlations were found between dietary NEL content and: (i) DM intake; (ii) NEL intake; (iii) milk energy (E-l); (iv) E-l/metabolizable energy intake (MEI); (v) E-l/NEL intake, as well as between NEL intake and fat corrected milk yield (FCM). The suitable net energy required for dairy cows producing 1kg FCM ranged from 5.01 to 5.03MJ, was concluded from the above-stated regressions. Correlation between heat production (HP) and MEI could be expressed as: Log (HP)=-0.4304+0.2963*MEI (n=15, R-2=0.99, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)=0.18). Fasting HP was 0.3712MJ/kg(0.75) when extrapolating MEI to zero.

In experiment 1, 24 barrows (28 days old, 7.28 +/- 0.90 kg body weight (BW)) were used to compare the effects of extrusion of corn and broken rice on the values of digestible energy (DE) in weaned pigs. The DE content in extruded corn (17.45 MJ/kg dry matter (DM)) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) by 5.54% compared with that in corn (16.48 MJ/kg DM), while no significant difference in DE content was observed between extruded broken rice (17.66 MJ/kg DM) and broken rice (17.76 MJ/kg DM). In experiment 2, 120 weanling pigs (21 days old, 5.76 +/- 0.07 kg BW) were used to evaluate the influence of substitution corn and extruded corn by different proportions of raw and extruded broken rice on growth performance of pigs. The inclusion of broken rice in the diets improved (P < 0.05) growth performance of pigs during the first week and the 2 weeks post-weaning but not thereafter. However, there was no significant difference in growth performance between treatments in other periods. Overall, this study indicates that feeding weaning pigs with broken rice has beneficial results.

M-4 could degrade 80.62 % of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA; 100 mg L-1) within 5 days. 3-PBA degradation occurred in accordance with first-order kinetics. The degradation metabolites of 3-PBA were identified through high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Relevant enzymatic activities and substrate utilization were also investigated, which indicated that M-4 could effectively degrade the intermediates of 3-PBA. Base on analysis of these metabolites, a novel biochemical pathway for the degradation of 3-PBA was proposed. There exists a mutual transformation between 3-phenoxy-benzyl alcohol and 3-PBA, which was firstly reported about the degradation of 3-PBA and may be attributed to self-protection transformation of M-4; subsequently, 3-PBA was gradually transformed into phenol, 3-hydroxy-5-phenoxy benzoic acid, protocatechuic acid and gallic acid. The safety of M-4 was evaluated via an acute toxicity test in vivo. The biodegradation ability of M-4 without toxic effects reveals that this fungus may be likely to be used for eliminating 3-PBA from contaminated environment or fermented foods.

Methods: We used cell-surface markers and paired box transcription factor 3 (Pax3)/paired box transcription factor 7 (Pax7) expression to separate SC populations. In addition, self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation abilities of each population were analyzed. Results: Pax3(+)/Pax7(-) SCs exhibited higher proliferation ability characterized by forming clusters of myogenic colonies with more self-renewing cells after several passages, while Pax3(-)/Pax7(+) SCs had faster differentiation. The myotubes derived from Pax3(+)/Pax7(-) SCs tended to express slow-myosin heavy chain and exhibited rhythmic contraction, while myotubes originating from Pax3(-)/Pax7(+) SCs primarily formed fast-myosin heavy chains characterized by transitory contraction. Conclusions: Pax3(+)/Pax7(-) SCs exhibited the ability of long-term self-renewal and proliferation, whereas Pax3(-)/Pax7(+) SCs demonstrated faster differentiation.

Although numerous QTLs that regulate grain weight have been identified, the genetic network that controls grain size remains unclear. Herein, we report the cloning and functional analysis of a dominant QTL, grain length and width 2 (GLW2), which positively regulates grain weight by simultaneously increasing grain length and width. The GLW2 locus encodes OsGRF4 (growth-regulating factor 4) and is regulated by the microRNA miR396c invivo. The mutation in OsGRF4 perturbs the OsmiR396 target regulation of OsGRF4, generating a larger grain size and enhanced grain yield. We also demonstrate that OsGIF1 (GRF-interacting factors 1) directly interacts with OsGRF4, and increasing its expression improves grain size. Our results suggest that the miR396c-OsGRF4-OsGIF1 regulatory module plays an important role in grain size determination and holds implications for rice yield improvement.

In addition, plants were treated continuously with either 400 or 800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Seeds were harvested at 42, 53, 69 and 95 days after planting (i.e., final maturity). This study quantified 51 metabolites in developing soybean seeds, plus total lipids and proteins were measured at maturity. About 80% of measured soluble carbohydrates, amines and organic acids decreased to low levels in mature seeds, although important exceptions were raffinose, ribose/ arabinose, citrate and all eight fatty acids. This suggested that the metabolism of young seeds supported lipid and protein synthesis. A total of 35 and 9 metabolites differed among temperature and CO2 treatments, respectively, and treatment effects were predominately observed on the first and second samplings. However, shikimate, pinitol and oleate were increased by high temperature treatments in mature seeds. The above results indicated that CO2 enrichment primarily altered metabolite levels during the initial stages of seed development and this was likely due to enhanced photosynthate formation in leaves.

The short-term responses of glutathione and phytochelation synthetic pathways genes to additional nitrogen under cadmium stress in poplar leaves	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Populus; cadmium; nitrogen; glutathione; phytoremediation; detoxification	OXIDATIVE STRESS; PLANTS; METABOLISM; TOLERANCE; CD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; BIOSYNTHESIS; ACCUMULATION; HOMEOSTASIS; EXPRESSION	Earlier it was noticed that the supplementary nitrogen to nutritive solution of the cadmium stressed (Cd-stressed) plants can alleviate the toxic effects of this metal on the plants and improve plant growth performance. But the underlying mechanisms of such detoxification effect of nitrogen were not studied. In this study, a ten-day responses of related nitrogen-synthesized genes including gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCs), glutathione synthetase (ECGs) and phytochelatin synthase (PCs) involved in glutathione (ECG) and phytochelation (PC) synthetic pathways were examined. The plant growth performance and leaf chlorophyll content were examined at the final harvest. It was shown that the supplement of additional nitrogen to poplar plants under cadmium stress could significantly up-regulate the expression levels of gamma-GCs, ECGs and PCs genes in plant leaves during the first 12 hours. Furthermore, cadmium stressed plants with additional nitrogen supplement showed significant enhancement in growth performance and increase in leaf chlorophyll content compared to sole cadmium stressed plants. Our results suggest that additional nitrogen could stimulate a short-term defense system in poplar plants through ECG and PC synthetic pathways. It is contribute to the alleviation of the toxic symptoms in polar plants caused by cadmium stress. This study provides a potential method to render harmless cadmium toxicity in stressed plants with nitrogen fertilization.

Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the first key enzyme involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Here, three putative CHS genes (designated as FtCHS1 (GU172165), FtCHS2 (KT284884), and FtCHS3 (KT284885) were isolated from tartary buckwheat. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that FtCHS1 and FtCHS2 each contained one intron of 444 bp and 157 bp, respectively. FtCHS3 included two introns, one of 86 bp and another of 73 bp. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed the FtCHSs expression presented the same pattern in the stems and flowers, with FtCHS1 > FtCHS3 > FtCHS2. A different tendency was found in leaves, with FtCHS3 > FtCHS2 > FtCHS1. However, there was no direct correlation between the three CHS expression and total flavonoids. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) performance reveals rutin is the most abundant flavonoid in all tissues, leaves should be the main location for quercetin storage in tartary buckwheat.

High-density marker profiling confirms ancestral genomes of Avena species and identifies D-genome chromosomes of hexaploid oat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; C-BANDED KARYOTYPES; GENUS AVENA; INTERGENOMIC TRANSLOCATIONS; GENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MONOSOMIC LINES; DIPLOID AVENA; LINKAGE MAP; SATIVA L.	Genome analysis of 27 oat species identifies ancestral groups, delineates the D genome, and identifies ancestral origin of 21 mapped chromosomes in hexaploid oat. We investigated genomic relationships among 27 species of the genus Avena using high-density genetic markers revealed by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Two methods of GBS analysis were used: one based on tag-level haplotypes that were previously mapped in cultivated hexaploid oat (A. sativa), and one intended to sample and enumerate tag-level haplotypes originating from all species under investigation. Qualitatively, both methods gave similar predictions regarding the clustering of species and shared ancestral genomes. Furthermore, results were consistent with previous phylogenies of the genus obtained with conventional approaches, supporting the robustness of whole genome GBS analysis. Evidence is presented to justify the final and definitive classification of the tetraploids A. insularis, A. maroccana (=A. magna), and A. murphyi as containing D-plus-C genomes, and not A-plus-C genomes, as is most often specified in past literature. Through electronic painting of the 21 chromosome representations in the hexaploid oat consensus map, we show how the relative frequency of matches between mapped hexaploid-derived haplotypes and AC (DC)-genome tetraploids vs. A- and C-genome diploids can accurately reveal the genome origin of all hexaploid chromosomes, including the approximate positions of inter-genome translocations. Evidence is provided that supports the continued classification of a diverged B genome in AB tetraploids, and it is confirmed that no extant A-genome diploids, including A. canariensis, are similar enough to the D genome of tetraploid and hexaploid oat to warrant consideration as a D-genome diploid.

One of the important parameters of the maize leaf architecture that affects light penetration into the canopy, leaf size, has long attracted breeders' attention for optimizing the plant type of maize and for maximizing the grain yield (GY). In this study, we used 253 RIL lines derived from a cross between B73 and SICAU1212 to investigate the leaf widths (LWs), leaf lengths (LLs), and leaf areas (LAs) of eight consecutive leaves of maize below the tassel and GY across different environments and to identify quantitative traits loci (QTLs) controlling the above-mentioned traits, using inclusive interval mapping for single-environment analysis plus a mixed-model-based composite interval mapping for joint analysis. A total of 171 and 159 putative QTLs were detected through these two mapping methods, respectively. Single-environment mapping revealed that 39 stable QTLs explained more than 10 % of the phenotypic variance, and 35 of the 39 QTLs were also detected by joint analysis. In addition, joint analysis showed that nine of the 159 QTLs exhibited significant QTL x environment interaction and 15 significant epistatic interactions were identified. Approximately 47.17 % of the QTLs for leaf architectural traits in joint analysis were concentrated in ten main chromosomal regions, namely, bins 1.07, 2.02, 3.06, 4.09, 5.01, 5.02, 5.03-5.04, 5.07, 6.07, and 8.05. This study should provide a basis for further fine-mapping of these main genetic regions and improvement of maize leaf architecture.

Four treatments (ungrafted and S. photeinocarpum seedlings grafted on the rootstocks of eggplant, potato, and tomato) were utilized in the present study. In the 2 pot experiments, eggplant and potato reduced biomass of S. photeinocarpum postgrafting generation plants, whereas tomato increased shoot biomass compared with the control (ungrafted seedlings). Compared with ungrafted seedlings, tomato increased and eggplant decreased Cd contents in shoots of S. photeinocarpum postgrafting generation. Only tomato increased Cd extraction by shoots of S. photeinocarpum postgrafting generation compared with ungrafted seedlings. In the field experiment, only tomato increased shoot Cd content of S. photeinocarpum postgrafting generation by 8.31% and shoot Cd extraction by 9.30% compared with ungrafted seedlings. Therefore, use of tomato as rootstock could enhance the ability of S. photeinocarpum postgrafting generation plants to remediate Cd-contaminated soil.

The optimum extraction conditions were: ratio of water to solid, 30 mL/g; extraction duration, 50 min; extraction power, 180W; and extraction temperature, 60 degrees C. Under these conditions, the yield of BPP was 8.61%. Then, BPP was purified, and three purified fractions (designated BPP-1, BPP-2 and BPP-3) were obtained for further physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity analysis. These fractions were mainly composed of glucose, mannose and arabinose residue, meanwhile, BPP-3 had a significantly higher rhamnose and uronic acid content than BPP-1 and BPP-2. And BPP-3 showed the best hydroxyl radial scavenging activity, ferric reducing activity power (FRAP), antihemolytic activity and antibacterial activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pectic polysaccharides from 50% EtOH, 50 degrees C water and 100 degrees C water extracts from elderflowers were treated with endo-alpha-D-(1-4)-polygalacturonase after previous de-esterification with the intention of isolating hairy regions and relate variation in structure to immunomodulating activity. High molecular weight sub-fractions (25-29 kDa) and medium molecular weight sub-fractions (6-17 kDa) were isolated after enzymatic treatment in addition to oligogalacturonides. Structural elucidation indicated that RG-I regions with AG-I and AG-II sidechains were the predominant structures in the high molecular weight sub-fractions, and two of three 1,4-linked GalA units in the rhamnogalacturonan backbone were branched in either position 2 or 3. The medium molecular weight sub-fractions had monomers and linkages typical for both RG-I and RG-II. The results showed that the high molecular RG-I containing polymers exhibit the highest dose-dependent complement fixing and macrophage stimulating activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Given the importance of the humoral immune response in the clearance of DHAV-1, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISAs) to detect immune indices, including IgG, IgM and IgA1, were developed and evaluated in this study. The optimal concentrations of coating-antigen were 1.79 mu g/ml, 2.23 mu g/ml and 2.23 mu g/ml for IgG, IgM and IgA1, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal dilutions of sera were 1:80, 1:40 and 1:40, respectively; and of the conjugates were 1:300, 1:1800 and 1:800, respectively. Based on these conditions, three linear regression equations, y = 1.363 + 1.954 x (r(2) = 0.983), y = 1.141 + 2.228 x (r(2) = 0.970) and y = 1.103 + 1.559 x (r(2) = 0.995) were derived for IgG, IgM and IgA1, respectively. Analytical sensitivities of the new methods were 1:2560, 1:1280 and 1:640 for IgG, IgM and IgA1, respectively. The concordances between the I-ELISAs and serum neutralization were 95.2% for IgG and IgA1, and 75% for IgM. Although there was a weak cross-reaction with DHAV-3 positive serum for the IgG and IgA1 tests, it didn't affect the ability to detect DHAV-1 specific antibodies. Thus, these new I-ELISAs were shown to be potentially convenient methods to survey the status of humoral immune response to DHAV-1. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maize produces a variety of terpenoids involved in defense response. Despite some terpene synthases (TPSs) responsible for these terpenoids have been characterized, biosynthesis of many terpenes, particularly sesquiterpenes, which were produced in response to biotic or abiotic stress, remains largely unknown. Here, we characterized ZmTPS7 biochemically through recombinant expression in Escherichia coli and detected that it catalyzed formation of a blend of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoid alcohols as the sesquiterpene synthase through GC-MS analysis. Subsequently, the major product was purified and identified as tau-cadinol through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analysis, which was also detected in maize tissues infected by pathogen fungus for the first time. ZmTPS7 constitutively expressed in aerial tissues while with trace amount of transcript in roots. Fungus spore inoculation and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment induced gene expression of ZmTPS7 in leaves, while exogenous ABA induced ZmTPS7 dramatically in roots, suggesting that ZmTPS7 might be involved in stress response. tau-cadinol was quantified in infected maize tissues with the concentration of similar to 200 ng/g fresh weight, however, which was much lower than the inhibitory one on two tested necrotrophic fungi. Such evidences indicate that anti-fungal activity of tau-cadinol is not physiologically relevant, and further investigation is needed to clarify its biological functions in maize. Taken together, ZmTPS7 was characterized as the tau-cadinol synthase and suggested to be involved in stress response, which also increased the diversity of maize terpenoid profile.

The cpsJ gene encodes a putative UDP-glucose epimerase involved in the capsule synthesis system. To determine the role of the CpsJ protein in the production of the capsule, a Delta cpsJ mutant was generated and analyzed by comparing its growth performances and virulence with those of the wild type (WT) strain. The Delta cpsJ mutant had longer chains, smaller colonies, and a slower growth rate and decreased optical density than the WT, suggesting that the Delta cpsJ mutant produces less capsular polysaccharide. The Delta cpsJ mutant was more able to adhere to and invaded epithelioma papulosum cyprinid cells (EPCs) when its virulence in vitro was compared with that of the WT, but survived less well in the whole blood of channel catfish. When a channel catfish infection model was used to determine the virulence of the Delta cpsJ mutant in vivo, the mutant caused an increase in survival with the mutant (53.33 %) versus the WT (26.67 %).

However, the antiviral potential of the PAP in plants and its potential role in plant systemic resistance has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this report, we investigated the role of PAP in plant systemic resistance response against virus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. N. benthamiana plants pre-treated with 0.1 mg/mL PAP three days before inoculation with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) showed less symptoms and less reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation compared to PBS-treated plants inoculated with TMV-GFP. Exogenous application of PAP yielded a significant reduction in GFP fluorescence in non-inoculated upper leaves. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the accumulation levels of TMV were significantly reduced in the systemic leaves of PAP-treated N. benthamiana plants compared with the levels observed in PBS-treated plants. In addition, some antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) were activated after PAP treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that exogenous application of PAP enhances N. benthamiana systemic resistance to TMV infection by regulating ROS levels. Furthermore, we concluded that PAP might be acting as a strong antioxidant that does not allow the induction/accumulation of harmful ROS on virus infection.

Methods: Pregnant sows (n = 11) were assigned to either a control (C) group or an undernutrition (U) group (75% of C) during gestation. At postnatal 68 d, the offspring (n = 16) were placed on either a cafeteria feeding (CF) group or a food-restricted (FR) group (75% of CF) for 6 wk. After that, all offspring were fed ad libitum until 189 d (dpn189). Results: The results showed that maternal malnutrition induced offspring glucose intolerance, which was demonstrated by increased serum glucose and triacylglycerol content at dpn189, as well as increased area under the blood glucose curve (AUC) during the intravenous glucose tolerance test (i.v.GTT) (P < 0.05). Interestingly, food restriction followed by controlled refeeding further increased serum glucose content at dpn189 and AUC during i.v.GTT in pigs born from U sows (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by catch-up growth during the refeeding period. These changes were associated with increased mRNA levels of hepatic gluconeogenesis (PC, PEPCK) enzymes (P < 0.05), decreased mRNA level of muscle glucose transporter (GLUT4; P = 0.07), and reduced mRNA level of insulin signaling protein (IRS1, P < 0.05) in the liver. Conclusions: Our results indicate that catch-up growth following food restriction can exacerbate glucose intolerance in offspring exposed to intrauterine malnutrition. This may be caused by increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreased muscle glucose transport, and impaired hepatic insulin signaling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the resources and environment related issues have been challenging their sustain ability to different degree. There still exist the following challenges in evaluating the sustainability of industrial systems due to the existing researches ignoring one or more related issues, including (1) ignorance of ecosystem's contributions to industrial activities, (2) neglect of quality differences between different resources, energies and labors, (3) involving subjectivity of human, (4) inadequate consideration of emissions' impact, and (5) lacking consideration on recycling and reuse benefit derived from industrial symbiosis. Therefore, they are isolated to some degree and lack completeness and systematization. This study aimed to deal with the five issues by adopting classic EA (emergy analysis) method (Overcoming issues 1-3.), quantifying emissions' impact in terms of emergy with some modified parameters (Addressing issue 4.) and proposing indicators to evaluating recycling and reuse benefit (Focusing on issue 5.). Then one proposed emergy method and the related indicator system for assessing the sustainability of industrial parks were set up. Next, an industrial park in Sichuan, China, as a case, was research using the proposed method and indicator system. The study results show that, according to the classic emergy based indicators, this industrial park has relatively high economic competition ability (EYR = 1.14), relatively low environmental press (ELR = 29.31), and relatively strong sustainability (ESI = 0.0388) compared to other industrial parks in China. However, its low economic efficiency and low wastes recycling/reuse degree still seriously challenge its sustainability with the local mineral resources exhaustion in the future. In terms of modified emergy indicators, emissions' impact further raises its environmental load by 3.42% and reduces its sustainability level by 2.70%. Finally, some corresponding suggestions are put forward. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the influences of biochar on extracellular enzyme activity and microbial abundance are still lack and debatable. Currently, there is no information about the impact of biochar on the function of mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, we explored the effects of biochar on extracellular enzyme activity and microbial abundance in subtropical mangrove sediment, and further estimated the contribution of biochar to C sequestration. In this study, sediments were amended with 0 (control), 0.5,1.0 and 2.0% of biochar and incubated at 25 degrees C for 90 days. After incubation, enzyme activities, microbial abundance and the increased percentage of sediment organic C content were determined. Both increase (phenol oxidase and (i-glucosidase) and decrease (peroxidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) of enzyme activities were observed in biochar treatments, but only peroxidase activity showed statistical significance (at least p < 0.01) compared to the control. Moreover, the activities of all enzymes tested were significantly related to the content of biochar addition (at least p < 0.05). On the other hand, bacterial and fungal abundance in biochar treatments were remarkably lower than control (p < 0.001), and the significantly negative relationship (p < 0.05) between bacterial abundance and the content of biochar was found. Additionally, the increased percentage of organic C gradually increased with biochar addition rate, which provided evidence for applying biochar to mitigate climate change. Given the importance of microorganisms and enzyme activities in sediment organic matter decomposition, the increased C sequestration might be explained by the large decrease of microbial abundance and enzyme activity after biochar intervention.

A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of biodegradable [ S,S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) on plant growth and Pb accumulation of Pb phytostabilizer Athyrium wardii (Hook.) grown in Pb contaminated soils and to explore the feasibility of chelate-assisted phytostabilization. Greater adverse effects on plant biomass under high EDDS treatments were observed than NTA treatments. Significant increase of shoot Pb concentrations of A. wardii was noticed with increasing NTA and EDDS dosages, while EDDS induced higher shoot Pb concentrations than NTA. Moreover, root Pb concentrations of A. wardii under NTA treatments were 1.18-1.28-time higher than EDDS treatments, and a peak value of root Pb concentrations was observed at 2 mmol kg(-1) of NTA. Shoot Pb accumulations significantly increased with increasing dosages, and EDDS treatments caused a 1.44-1.6-time increase of shoot Pb accumulation than NTA. Root Pb accumulations under NTA treatments were 1.18-1.28-time higher than EDDS treatments. Maximum root Pb accumulation (155.5 mg plant(-1)) was found at 2 mmol kg(-1) of NTA on the 14th day. Higher BCF values and lower TF values were found under NTA treatments as compared to EDDS treatments. Available Pb concentrations in soil significantly increased on the 7th day with increasing NTA and EDDS dosages, then gradually decreased on the 14th day. Soil pH slightly decreased with increasing NTA and EDDS dosages. Therefore, chelate-assisted phytostabilization could be a feasible way to enhance the efficiency of Pb phytostabilization by A. wardii. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model combined with ordinary kriging (OK) was proposed to predict spatial distribution of four soil nutrients based on the same framework used by regression kriging (RK). In RBFNN_OK, RBFNN model was used to explain the spatial variability caused by the selected auxiliary factors, while OK was used to express the spatial autocorrelation in RBFNN prediction residuals. The results showed that both RBFNN_OK and RK presented prediction maps with more details. However, RK does not always obtain mean errors (MEs) which were closer to 0 and lower root mean square errors (RMSEs) and mean relative errors (MREs) than OK. Conversely, MREs of RBFNN_OK were much closer to 0 and its RMSEs and MREs were relatively lower than OK and RK. The results suggest that RBFNN_OK is a more unbiased method with more stable prediction performance as well as improvement of prediction accuracy, which also indicates that artificial neural network model is more appropriate than regression model to capture relationships between soil variables and environmental factors. Therefore, RBFNN_OK may provide a useful framework for predicting soil properties.

In this study, we employed N,N-bis (carboxymethyl)-L-glutamic acid (GLDA), a novel and readily biodegradable chelator to remove Cd, Pb, and Zn from polluted soils. We investigated the influence of washing conditions, including GLDA concentration, pH, and contact time on their removal efficiencies. The single factor experiments showed that Cd, Pb, and Zn removal efficiencies reached 70.62, 74.45, and 34.43% in mine soil at a GLDA concentration of 75 mM, a pH of 4.0, and a contact time of 60 min, and in polluted farmland soil, removal efficiencies were 69.12, 78.30, and 39.50%, respectively. We then employed response surface methodology to optimize the washing parameters. The optimization process showed that the removal efficiencies were 69.50, 88.09, and 40.45% in mine soil and 71.34, 81.02, and 50.95% in polluted farmland soil for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively. Moreover, the overall highly effective removal of Cd and Pb was connected mainly to their highly effective removal from the water-soluble, exchangeable, and carbonate fractions. GLDA-washing eliminated the same amount of metals as EDTA-washing, while simultaneously retaining most of the soil nutrients. Removal efficiencies of recycled GLDA were no >5% lower than those of the fresh GLDA. Therefore, GLDA could potentially be used for the rehabilitation of soil contaminated by heavy metals.

After confirmed by species-specific multiplex PCR, the recovered isolates were examined for resistance to antimicrobials using an agar dilution method and investigated for the mutation of gyrA, tetO gene and V domain of 23S rRNA as well as the presence of class 1 integron and the associated gene cassettes. In addition, the genotype relatedness of the isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). profiling. The prevalence of Campylobacter was 56.1% in cecal samples, 31.0% in carcasses and 17.0% in carcass parts, respectively. Among them, C. jejuni accounted for 24.6% and C. coli occupied 20.0% of the samples. The strains of C. jejuni were most frequently resistant to ciprofloxacin (88.1%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (79.4%) and levofloxacin (78.1%). Most of the C. coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (100%), tetracycline (98.5%), levofloxacin (98.5%), clindamycin (98.5%) and erythromycin (93.9%). Antimicrobial resistance profiling showed that 93.7% of campylobacters were multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. Moreover, class 1 integrons were detected in 98.6% of MDR campylobacters, among which 98.7% were positive for C. jejuni and 98.5% for C coli. Three kinds of gene cassettes-associated amplicons were identified and the amplicons profile of 1000-750-500 -250 bp was the predominant pattern linked to the aminoglycoside resistance gene of aadA2. The presence of mutation in gyrA, tetO and 23S rRNA between C. jejuni and C. coli varied from 89.7% to 97.3%, 96.6% to 94.1%, and 95.0% to 96.7%, respectively. Finally, the results of PFGE indicated that, 33 PFGE profiles were generated among 78 isolates of C. jejuni and the similarity level ranged from 42.1% to 99.1%. By contrast, 15 PFGE patterns were produced among 68 C. coli isolates sharing a similarity level of 54.0% -99.7%. Comparison of the PFGE and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the isolates reflected the high genetic diversity of Campylobacter tested. A poor correlation among the antimicrobial resistance patterns, resistance determinants and PFGE genotypes was observed in C. jejuni. Our study showed that there were several points of cross-contamination during broiler slaughter, and a high diversity of PFGE types in the Campylobacter isolates with high resistances to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline.

In the current study, we made use of the deep sequencing data from Jianzhou Da'er goat longissimus dorsi sampled on days 45, 60, and 105 of gestation, as well as day three after birth to identify miRNAs that regulate goat skeletal myogenesis, and examine their temporal expression profiles. A total of 410 known goat miRNAs, 752 miRNA homologs and 88 novel miRNAs were identified across four stages. Besides three myomiRs, the abundance of 17 miRNAs, including chi-miR-424, chi-miR-542-3p and chi-miR-136-5p was more than 10,000 reads per million mapped reads (RPM), on average. Furthermore, 50 miRNAs with more than 100 RPM clustered at the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 locus on chromosome 21 and showed similar expression patterns, indicating that these miRNAs played important roles in skeletal myogenesis of goats. Based on pairwise comparisons, 221 differentially expressed (DE), known miRNAs were identified across four stages. GO and KEGG analyses of the genes targeted by the DE miRNAs revealed the significantly enriched processes and pathways to be consistent with temporal changes of skeletal muscle development across all sampled stages. However, follow-up experimental studies were required to explore functions of these miRNAs and targets underlying skeletal myogenesis.

However, the regulation roles of miRNAs and ER stress in myogenic differentiation have not been fully revealed and need to be further studied. Here, we discovered that the expression levels of miR-181a-5p were strongly upregulated during C2C12 cell differentiation. miR-181a-5p overexpression promoted ER stress and differentiation of C2C12 cells, which was accompanied by increasing expression levels of marker genes related to ER stress-mediated apoptosis and myogenic differentiation. Opposite results were observed after inhibition of the miR-181a-5p expression. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments on C2C12 cells showed that miR-181a-5p affected the development of muscle fiber type, but had no significant influence on C2C12 cell proliferation. In the ER-stressed C2C12 cells induced by thapsigargin (Tg), the expression levels of both miR-181a-5p and marker genes related to ER stress and myogenesis were upregulated. In the ER stressed C2C12 cells and porcine muscle fibroblast (PMF) cells pretreated with Tg, we found that miR-181a-5p targeted glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/BIP), and influenced cell apoptosis. In conclusion, these results indicate that miR-181a-5p and ER stress have positive synergistic effects on myogenic differentiation by increasing the expression levels of myogenic differentiation key genes and activating the ER stress-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway.

Here, we present PopSc, a bioinformatic toolkit for calculating 45 basic statistics in molecular population genetics, which could be categorized into three classes, including (i) genetic diversity of DNA sequences, (ii) statistical tests for neutral evolution, and (iii) measures of genetic differentiation among populations. In contrast to the existing computer tools, PopSc was designed to directly accept the intermediate metadata, such as allele frequencies, rather than the raw DNA sequences or genotyping results. PopSc is first implemented as the web-based calculator with user-friendly interface, which greatly facilitates the teaching of population genetics in class and also promotes the convenient and straightforward calculation of statistics in research. Additionally, we also provide the Python library and R package of PopSc, which can be flexibly integrated into other advanced bioinformatic packages of population genetics analysis.

They not only function as key regulators of jasmonate hormonal response, but are also involved in responding to abiotic stress. In this study, we identified 24 TIFY genes (PeTIFYs) in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) of Poaceae by analyzing the whole genome sequence. One PeTIFY belongs to TIFY subfamily, 18 and five belong to JAZ and ZML subfamilies, respectively. Two equivocal gene models were re-predicted and a putative retrotransposition event was found in a ZML protein. The distribution and conservation of domain or motif, and gene structure were also analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis with TIFY proteins of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa indicated that JAZ subfamily could be further divided to four groups. Evolutionary analysis revealed intragenomic duplication and orthologous relationship between P. edulis, O. sativa, and B. distachyon, Calculation of the non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates and their ratios indicated that the duplication of PeTIFY may have occurred around 16.7 million years. ago (MYA), the divergence time of TIFY family among the P. edulis-O. sativa, P. edulis-B. distachyon, and O. sativa-B. distachyon was approximately 39 MYA, 39 MYA, and 45 MYA, respectively, They appear to have undergone extensive purifying selection during evolution. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that more than 50% of PeTIFY genes could be up-regulated by cold and dehydration stresses, and some PeTIFYs also share homology to know TIFYs involved in abiotic stress tolerance. Our results made insights into TIFY family of Moso bamboo, an economically important non-timber forest resource, and provided candidates for further identification of genes involved in regulating responses to abiotic stress.

E. bieneusi has been identified in humans, mammals, birds, rodents and reptiles in China, but few studies have reported E. bieneusi in horses. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess the prevalence, molecular characteristics and zoonotic potential of E. bieneusi among horses in southwestern China. Findings: Three hundred and thirty-three fecal specimens were collected from horses on five farms in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of southwestern China. The prevalence of E. bieneusi was 22.5 % (75/333), as determined by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene of E. bieneusi. Altogether, 10 genotypes were identified among the 75 E. bieneusi-positive samples: four of these genotypes were known (horse1, horse2, SC02 and D) and six were novel (SCH1-4 and YNH1-2). Multilocus sequence typing using three microsatellites (MS1, MS3 and MS7) and one minisatellite (MS4) revealed three, two, three and three genotypes at these four loci, respectively. In phylogenetic analysis, all the genotypes of E. bieneusi obtained in this study were clustered into three distinct groups: D, SC02 and SCH1-3 were clustered into group 1 (zoonotic potential); SCH4 was clustered into group 2 (cattle-hosted); whereas horse2, YNH1 and YNH2 were clustered into group 6 (unclear zoonotic potential). Conclusions: This is the first report of E. bieneusi among horses in southwestern China. This is also the first multilocus genotyping analysis using microsatellite and minisatellite markers of E. bieneusi in horses. The presence of genotype D, which was previously identified in humans, and genotypes SC02 and SCH1-3, which belong to potential zoonotic group 1, these results indicate that horses are a potential source of human E. bieneusi infections in China.

Persistent infections caused by bacterial biofilms are recalcitrant to treat because of the particular drug resistance of biofilm-dwelling cells. TolC, a key component of multidrug efflux pumps, are responsible for multidrug resistance (MDR) in many Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we identified two TolC-like proteins, TolC1 and TolC2, in A. pleuropneumoniae. Deletion of tolC1, but not tolC2, caused a significant reduction in biofilm formation, as well as increased drug sensitivity of both planktonic and biofilm cells. The genetic-complementation of the tolC1 mutation restored the competent biofilm and drug resistance. Besides, biofilm formation was inhibited and drug sensitivity was increased by the addition of phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PA beta N), a well-known efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), suggesting a role for EPI in antibacterial strategies toward drug tolerance of A. pleuropneumoniae. Taken together, TolC1 is required for biofilm formation and is a part of the MDR machinery of both planktonic and biofilm cells, which could supplement therapeutic strategies for resistant bacteria and biofilm-related infections of A. pleuropneumoniae clinical isolate SC1516.

The results showed that the IgG levels in each immune group was significantly higher than that of the negative control (P < 0.001). Except rRnhB group, proliferation of splenocytes was observed in all immunized groups and a relatively higher proliferation activity was observed in rGalU and rGalT groups (P < 0.05). In the rGalT vaccinated group, the proportion of CD4+ T cells in spleen was significant higher than that of negative control (P < 0.05). Moreover, proportions of CD4+ T cells in other vaccinated groups were all up-regulated to varying degrees. Up-regulation of both Th1 (IFN-gamma, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4) cytokines were detected. A survival rate of 87.5, 62.5, and 62.5% were obtained among rGalT, rAPL_1166, and rHflX group, respectively while the remaining three groups was only 25%. Histopathological analyses of lungs indicated that surviving animals from the vaccinated groups showed relatively normal pulmonary structure alveoli. These findings confirm that IVI antigens used as vaccine candidates provide partial protection against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in a mouse model, which could be used as potential vaccine candidates in piglets.

However, there is a growing concern over the practice due to its side effects on intestinal microbial communities which plays a vital role in animals' health. To investigate the effect of antibiotics on the bacterial population of the caecum in rex rabbits, 80 rex rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: control group (B, basal diet), chlortetracycline group (C, 50 mg/kg), colistin sulfate group (S, 20 mg/ kg) and zinc bacitracin group (Z, 40 mg/kg). Caecum microbial communities of rex rabbits from the four groups were analyzed through Illumina Miseq platform after being fed 28 days. The results showed that most obtained sequences belongs to Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes, and the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes in C group (42.31 %) was higher than that in Z group (21.84 %). Zinc bacitracin supplementation caused a significant decreased of the Proteobacteria phylum and Lactobacillus spp. (P < 0.05), while the Lactobacillus spp. significantly increased in S group (P < 0.05). In addition, Ruminococcus spp., especially Ruminococcus albus were the predominant bacterial species found in both S and Z groups. The proportion of Coprococcus spp. significantly increased in Z group (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that the antibiotics used may cause significant changes in the caecum microbiota of rex rabbits, and we also found C group had a similarity caecum bacteria structure with B group which was probably due to the high levels of chlortetracycline resistance.

In general, the rate of photosynthesis (A), stomatal (g(s)) and mesophyll (g(m)) conductance, quantum yield of photosystem II, rates of maximum carboxylation (V-Cmax), and electron transport (J) increased with temperature across CO2 levels. However, compared with OT, the percentage increases in these parameters at HT were lower than the observed decline at LT. The photosynthetic limitation at LT and OT was primarily caused by photo-biochemical processes (49-58%, L-b) followed by stomatal (27-32%, L-s) and mesophyll (15-19%, L-m) limitations. However, at HT, it was primarily caused by L-s (41%) followed by L-b (33%) and L-m (26%). The dominance of L-b at LT and OT was associated with the accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates (e.g., starch) and several organic acids, whereas this accumulation did not occur at HT, indicating increased metabolic activities. Compared with OT, biomass and seed yield declined more at HT than at LT. The eCO(2) treatment compensated for the temperature-stress effects on biomass but only partially compensated for the effects on seed yield, especially at HT. Photosynthetic downregulation at eCO(2) was possibly due to the accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates and the decrease in g(s) and A(std) (standard A measured at 400 mu mol mol(-1) sub-stomatal CO2 concentration), as well as the lack of CO2 effect on g(m), V-Cmax,V- and J, and photosynthetic limitation. Thus, the photosynthetic limitation was temperature-dependent and was primarily influenced by the alteration in photo-biochemical processes and metabolic activities. Despite the inconsistent response of photosynthesis (or biomass accumulation) and seed yield, eCO(2) tended to fully or partially compensate for the adverse effect of the respective LT and HT stresses under well-watered and sufficient nutrient conditions.

Isolation and characterization of cellulose nanofibers from bamboo using microwave liquefaction combined with chemical treatment and ultrasonication	CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS			English	Article						Cellulose nanofibers; Microwave liquefaction; Bamboo; Ultrasonic nanofibrillation	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; REINFORCING AGENT; WHEAT-STRAW; BANANA PEEL; NANOCRYSTALS; COMPOSITES; WOOD; EXTRACTION; COMPONENTS	Cellulose nanofibers were successfully isolated from bamboo using microwave liquefaction combined with chemical treatment and ultrasonic nanofibrillation processes. The microwave liquefaction could eliminate almost all the lignin in bamboo, resulting in high cellulose content residues within 7 min, and the cellulose enriched residues could be readily purified by subsequent chemical treatments with lower chemical charging and quickly. The results of wet chemistry analyses, SEM images, and FTIR and X-ray spectra indicated the combination of microwave liquefaction and chemical treatment was significantly efficient in removing non-cellulosic compounds. Ultrasonication was used to separate the nanofibrils from the purified residues to extract nanofibers. The TEM images confirmed the presence of elementary fibrils, nano-sized fibril bundles, and aggregated fibril bundles. As evidenced by the TGA analysis, cellulose nanofibers isolated by this novel technique had high thermal stability indicating that the isolated nanofibers could possibly be applied as reinforcing elements in biomaterials.

Therefore, this study was conducted with objective of investigating apoptosis induced by sodium fluoride (NaF) and the mechanism behind that in the cultured splenic lymphocytes by flow cytometry, western blot and Hoechst 33258 staining. The splenic lymphocytes were isolated from 3 weeks old male ICR mice and exposed to NaF (0, 100, 200, and 400 mu mol/L) in vitro for 24 and 48 h. When compared to control group, flow cytometry assay and Hoechst 33258 staining showed that NaF induced lymphocytes apoptosis, which was promoted by decrease of mitochondria transmembrane potential, up-regulation of Bax, Bak, Fas, FasL, caspase 9, caspase 8, caspase 7, caspase 6 and caspase 3 protein expression (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expression (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The above-mentioned data suggested that NaF-induced apoptosis in splenic lymphocytes could be mediated by mitochondrial and death receptor pathways.

DICOCCOIDES; RED WINTER-WHEAT; WILD EMMER WHEAT; COMMON WHEAT; CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION; THINOPYRUM-INTERMEDIUM; STRIPE RUST; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; LEAF RUST	The wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pm40, which is located on chromosomal arm 7BS, is effective against nearly all prevalent races of Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) in China and is carried by the common wheat germplasm PI 672538. A set of the F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations from the cross of the resistant PI 672538 with the susceptible line L1034 were used to conduct genetic analysis of powdery mildew resistance and construct a high-density linkage map of the Pm40 gene. We constructed a high-density linkage genetic map with a total length of 6.18 cM and average spacing between markers of 0.48 cM. Pm40 is flanked by Xwmc335 and BF291338 at genetic distances of 0.58 cM and 0.26 cM, respectively, in deletion bin C-7BS-1-0.27. Comparative genomic analysis based on EST-STS markers established a high level of collinearity of the Pm40 genomic region with a 1.09-Mbp genomic region on Brachypodium chromosome 3, a 1.16-Mbp genomic region on rice chromosome 8, and a 1.62-Mbp genomic region on sorghum chromosome 7. We further anchored the Pm40 target intervals to the wheat genome sequence. A putative linear index of 85 wheat contigs containing 97 genes on 7BS was constructed. In total, 9 genes could be considered as candidates for the resistances to powdery mildew in the target genomic regions, which encoded proteins that were involved in the plant defense and response to pathogen attack. These results will facilitate the development of new markers for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection of Pm40 in wheat breeding programs.

Arabidopsis seedlings grown for 3 weeks were pretreated with 2 mM glutamate (Glu) and 2 mM MgCl2 for 48 h at room temperature to induce Mg-Proto IX accumulation. Then cold stress was performed at 4 degrees C for additional 72 h. Glu + MgCl2 pre-treatments alleviated the subsequent cold stress significantly by rising the leaf temperature through inducing Mg-Proto IX signals. The protective role of Glu + MgCl2 treatment was greatly compromised in the mutants of Mg-Proto IX synthesis, Mg-Proto IX signaling, and cyanide-resistant respiration. And the enhancement of cold-responsive gene expression was greatly compromised in the mutants of Mg-Proto IX synthesis, Mg-Proto IX signaling and ABA signaling, but not in the mutant of cyanide-resistant respiration. Cold stress promoted cyanide-resistant respiration and leaf total respiration exponentially, which could be further induced by the Glu + MgCl2 treatment. Mg-Proto IX signals also activate antioxidant enzymes and increase non-enzymatic antioxidants [glutathione but not ascorbic acid (AsA)[ to maintain redox equilibrium during the cold stress.

Through bioinformatics analysis, HxuC, HxuB, and HxuA proteins were found that they might have strong antigenicity, with 31 putative cytotoxic T-Iymphocyte (CTL) epitopes and multiple B-cell antigenic determinants. Western blotting assay indicated that all these antigens are highly immunogenic. The antibody levels and the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma in the groups of HxuA, HxuB, HxuC, HxuCBA (include HxuC, HxuB and HxuA proteins), and M-3 were observed to significantly increase with time post vaccination. HxuC, HxuB, HxuCBA and H. parasuis M-3 vaccinated groups showed a strong immune response and protection against challenge with 6.5 x 10(9) cfu (5 x LD50) of H. parasuis M-3 strain in a mouse model, but HxuA group showed only a low level protection. Additionally, the immune response induced by all of the proteins reduced histopathological lesions and their antisera could inhibit the growth of H. parasuis. We concluded that HxuC, HxuB and HxuCBA may have potential for use as a recombinant subunit vaccine against H. parasuis challenge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intestinal microbiota could transfer host Gut characteristics from pigs to mice	BMC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Pig breeds; Intestinal development; Digestive and absorptive activities; Germ-free mice; Fecal microbiota; transplantation	LACTOBACILLUS-RHAMNOSUS GG; MEAT QUALITY; FECAL MICROBIOTA; LARGE WHITE; DISTAL GUT; GERM-FREE; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; BARRIER FUNCTION; ORGAN WEIGHT; GROWING PIGS	Background: The present study was conducted to compare the differences in gut microbiota composition and gut-phenotypes among pig breeds, and determine whether these differences would transmit to mice colonized with fecal microbiota of different pig breeds. A total of 24 1-day-old germ-free BALB/C mice were divided into 3 groups (TFM, YFM and RFM), which were transplanted with intact fecal microbiota of Tibetan pig (TP), Yorkshire pig (YP) and Rongchang pig (RP), respectively. Results: Results showed that different pig breeds exhibited distinct gut microbiota profile based on high-throughput pyrosequencing. YP exhibited a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and apparent genera differences compared with RP and TP, and higher levels of bacteria from Spirochaetes were observed in TP compared with RP and YP (P < 0.05). Transplanted porcine microbiota into GF mice replicated the phenotypes of pig donors. Moreover, the three groups of donor pigs and their mice recipients exhibited different intestinal index and morphology. TP and RP had higher intestinal weight and relative CDX2 mRNA expression in ileum than YP, and longer intestine, higher villus height of duodenum and jejunum were observed in TP compared with YP and RP (P < 0.05). TP exhibited higher GLP-2 mRNA expression in duodenum and jejunum than RP (P < 0.05). Similarly, YFM had lower intestine weight and CDX2 mRNA expression in ileum than TFM and RFM (P < 0.05). The intestine length in TFM was longer than that in RFM, and TFM had higher villus height in duodenum and jejunum and GLP-2 mRNA expression in ileum than the other two groups (P < 0.05). Besides, the digestive and absorptive ability was different among the three groups in donor pigs and mice recipients. YP had higher jejunal lactase and maltase activities than TP and RP, while TP had higher activities of jejunal ATPase,.gamma-GT, and relative SGLT1 mRNA expression in duodenum and jejunum than YP and RP (P < 0.05). Likewise, YFM had higher jejunal sucrase and maltase activities than TFM and RFM, whereas higher jejunal gamma-GT activity and relative SGLT1 mRNA expression in duodenum and ileum were observed in TFM compared with YFM and RFM (P < 0.05). In addition, Tibetan pigs-derived microbiota improved gut barrier in mice recipients. The concentration of MDA in YP was higher than that in TP and RP (P = 0.078), and the relative ZO-1 mRNA expression in ileum in TP was higher than that in YP (P < 0.05). Likely, compared with TFM and RFM, YFM exhibited increasing MDA concentration in jejunum (P = 0.098), and the relative ZO-1 mRNA expression in duodenum and ileum in TFM were higher than that in YFM (P < 0.05). Conclusions: There were huge differences in gut microbiota composition and gut characteristics among pig breeds, and gut microbiota could partially convey host gut characteristics from pigs to mice.

It offers great yield advantages and has contributed greatly to the world's food security. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis have remained a mystery. In this study we integrated genetics and omics analyses to determine the candidate genes for yield heterosis in a model two-line rice hybrid system, Liang-you-pei 9 (LYP9) and its parents. Phenomics study revealed that the better parent heterosis (BPH) of yield in hybrid is not ascribed to BPH of all the yield components but is specific to the BPH of spikelet number per panicle (SPP) and paternal parent heterosis (PPH) of effective panicle number (EPN). Genetic analyses then identified multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these two components. Moreover, a number of differentially expressed genes and alleles in the hybrid were mapped by transcriptome profiling to the QTL regions as possible candidate genes. In parallel, a major QTL for yield heterosis, rice heterosis 8 (RH8), was found to be the DTH8/Ghd8/LHD1 gene. Based on the shared allelic heterozygosity of RH8 in many hybrid rice cultivars, a common mechanism for yield heterosis in the present commercial hybrid rice is proposed.

Here, we compared the effect of genome-wide DNA methylation on fatty acid metabolism between Landrace pigs (LP, leaner) and Rongchang pigs (RP, fatty). We found that LP backfat (LBF) had a higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content but a lower adipocyte volume than RP backfat (RBF). LBF exhibited higher global DNA methylation levels at the genome level than RBF. A total of 483 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were located in promoter regions, mainly affecting olfactory and sensory activity and lipid metabolism. In LBF, the promoters of genes related to ATPase activity had significantly stronger methylation. This fact may suggest lower energy metabolism levels, which may result in less efficient lipid synthesis in LBF. Furthermore, we identified a DMR in the miR-4335 and miR-378 promoters and validated their methylation status by bisulfite sequencing PCR. The hypermethylation of the promoters of miR-4335 and miR-378 in LBF and the resulting silencing of the target genes may result in LBF's low content in saturated fatty acids and fat deposition capacity. This study provides a solid basis for exploring the epigenetic mechanisms affecting fat deposition and fatty acid composition.

However, diverse coating antigen might bring different antiserum titer and sensitivity for the identical antiserum. In the present study, four AFB1-protein (aflatoxin B1-carrier protein) conjugates were prepared by activated ester method (AFB1O-BSA/AFB1O-OVA) and mannich method (AFB1-cBSA/AFB1-cOVA), and then applied as coating antigen for titer and sensitivity detection of the identical antiserum obtained from rabbit immunized by AFB1-KLH. Afterwards, the ultraviolet visible, fluorescence and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (far-UV CD) spectra were recorded for understanding the difference in titer and sensitivity obtained. Results revealed that AFB1O-BSA/AFB1O-OVA showed a strong intrinsic fluorescence band centered at 450 nm that originated from the emission of AFB1, which differed from AFB1-cBSA/AFB1-cOVA, while the decrease of alpha-helical and increase of beta-sheet in AFB1-cBSA was the most remarkable. This indicated that the better sensitivity obtained by using AFB1O-BSA as coating antigen might be caused by its extended structure, because such structure affect the binding between AFB1 and antibody. The study might offer structural information for understanding the titer and sensitivity difference caused by coating antigen. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is largely unknown that which signaling pathways contribute to excessive apoptosis of immune cells which induced by AFB(1). In this study, we investigated the roles of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and death receptor activated apoptotic pathways in the bursal of Fabricius (BF) cells in the broilers exposed to AFB1 diet. We found that (1) AFB(1) diet induced morphological changes in the BF. (2) FCM and TUNEL methods showed that excessive apoptosis could be resulted from AFB(1) intake. (3) AFB(1)-induced apoptosis of bursal cells involved mitochondrial pathway (increase of Bax, Bak, cytC, caspase-9, Apaf-1, caspase-3 and decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and ER pathway (increase of Grp78/Bip, Grp94 and CaM). (4) Oxidative stress was confirmed in the BF of chicken fed on AFB(1) diet. Overall, this work is the first to demonstrate that the activation of mitochondria and ER apoptosis pathways can lead to excessive apoptosis in BF cells, and oxidative stress is a crucial driver during AFB(1) exposure.

However, flagella might remain in OMV pellets following OMV purification, resulting in non-essential immune responses and counteraction of bacterial protective immune responses when developing a vaccine against infection of multiple serotypes Salmonella. In this study, a flagellin-deficient S. Typhimurium mutant was constructed. Lipopolysaccharide profiles, protein profiles and cryo-electron microscopy revealed that there were no significant differences between the wild-type and mutant OMVs, with the exception of a large amount of flagellin in the wild-type OMVs. Neither the wild-type OMVs nor the non-flagellin OMVs were toxic to macrophages. Mice immunized with the non-flagellin OMVs produced high concentrations of IgG. The non-flagellin OMVs elicited strong mucosal antibody responses in mice when administered via the intranasal route in addition to provoking higher cross-reactive immune responses against OMPs isolated from S. Choleraesuis and S. Enteritidis. Both intranasal and intraperitoneal immunization with the non-flagellin OMVs provided efficient protection against heterologous S. Choleraesuis and S. Enteritidis challenge. Our results indicate that the flagellin-deficient OMVs may represent a new vaccine platform that could be exploited to facilitate the production of a broadly protective vaccine.

In this study, we investigated the ion compartmentalization capacity of two upland cotton genotypes with different salt tolerances under salt shock at the tissue, cell and molecular levels. We found that the leaf glandular trichome could secrete more salt ions in the salt-tolerant genotype than in the sensitive genotype, demonstrating the excretion of ions from tissue may be a new mechanism to respond to short-term salt shock. Furthermore, an investigation of the ion distribution demonstrated that the ion content was significantly lower in critical tissues and cells of the salt-tolerant genotype, indicating the salt-tolerant genotype had a greater capacity for ion compartmentalization in the shoot. By comparing the membrane H+ -ATPase activity and the expression of ion transportation-related genes, we found that the H+ -ATPase activity and Na+/H+ antiporter are the key factors determining the capacity for ion compartmentalization in leaves, which might further determine the salt tolerance of cotton. The novel function of the glandular trichome and the comparison of Na+ compartmentalization between two cotton genotypes with contrasting salt tolerances provide a new understanding of the salt tolerance mechanism in cotton.

J	Yang, JD; Shen, FJ; Hou, R; Da, Y				Yang, Jiandong; Shen, Fujun; Hou, Rong; Da, Yang			Genetic composition of captive panda population	BMC GENETICS			English	Article						Giant panda; Genetic composition; Habitat; Captive breeding	GIANT PANDAS	Background: A major function of the captive panda population is to preserve the genetic diversity of wild panda populations in their natural habitats. Understanding the genetic composition of the captive panda population in terms of genetic contributions from the wild panda populations provides necessary knowledge for breeding plans to preserve the genetic diversity of the wild panda populations. Results: The genetic contributions from different wild populations to the captive panda population were highly unbalanced, with Qionglai accounting for 52.2 % of the captive panda gene pool, followed by Minshan with 21. 5 %, Qinling with 10.6 %, Liangshan with 8.2 %, and Xiaoxiangling with 3.6 %, whereas Daxiangling, which had similar population size as Xiaoxiangling, had no genetic representation in the captive population. The current breeding recommendations may increase the contribution of some small wild populations at the expense of decreasing the contributions of other small wild populations, i.e., increasing the Xiaoxiangling contribution while decreasing the contribution of Liangshan, or sharply increasing the Qinling contribution while decreasing the contributions of Xiaoxiangling and Liangshan, which were two of the three smallest wild populations and were already severely under-represented in the captive population. We developed three habitat-controlled breeding plans that could increase the genetic contributions from the smallest wild populations to 6.7-11.2 % for Xiaoxiangling, 11.5-12.3 % for Liangshan and 12.9-20.0 % for Qinling among the offspring of one breeding season while reducing the risk of hidden inbreeding due to related founders from the same habitat undetectable by pedigree data. Conclusion: The three smallest wild panda populations of Daxiangling, Xiaoxiangling and Liangshan either had no representation or were severely unrepresented in the current captive panda population. By incorporating the breeding goal of increasing the genetic contributions from the smallest wild populations into breeding plans, the severely under-represented small wild populations in the current captive panda population could be increased steadily for the near future.

Five concentrations (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg/L) of ABA were tested to evaluate its protective activityin grape leaves and fruit quality of 3-year-old 'Red Globe' grape, cultivated under the plastic rain shelter. It was found that additionof ABA significantly decreased the level of electrolyteleakage and lipid peroxidation, enhanced the activitiesof superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, proline content and soluble sugars. Meanwhile, exogenous ABA improved the anthocyanin, soluble solids, titrable acidity and AsA. Nevertheless, it had less effect on fruit shape index and weight of grape fruit (bunch and single berry). It was concluded that exogenous ABA may increase stress resistances and improve fruit quality of grape.

Plant phenolic compounds can act as antioxidants, structural polymers (lignin), attractants (flavonoids and carotenoids), UV screens (flavonoids), signal compounds (salicylic acid and flavonoids) and defense response chemicals (tannins and phytoalexins). From a human physiological standpoint, phenolic compounds are vital in defense responses, such as anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities. Therefore, it is beneficial to eat such plant foods that have a high antioxidant compound content, which will cut down the incidence of certain chronic diseases, for instance diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases, through the management of oxidative stress. Furthermore, berries and other fruits with low-amylase and high-glucosidase inhibitory activities could be regarded as candidate food items in the control of the early stages of hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes.

In this study, 19 Myb gene fragments were isolated from five Leymus species, three of which, LrMyb3, LmMyb8 and LmMyb6 were nearly complete open reading frames encoding putative Leymus Myb genes. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that all these putative Myb from Leymus represent plant typical R2R3-Myb genes. Compared with Myb gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, the 19 Leymus Myb gene fragments of the R2R3 region amino acid showed three different types, W-x (19) W-x (19) W-x (12) F-x (18) W-x (18) W, W-x (19) W-x (19) W-x (12) M-x (18) W-x (18) W and W-x (19) W-x (19) R-x (12) L-x (18) W-x (18) W.

However, pesticide residues have caused global concern because of their potential health risk to consumers. In this study, we could identify beta-cypermethrin (beta-CY) and its degradation product 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Few studies on the simultaneous determination of beta-CY and its metabolites have been carried out so far; hence, we established a high-performance liquid chromatography method to determine the concentrations of both beta-CY and 3-PBA simultaneously in microbial degradation systems. In this study, a novel beta-CY degrading strain, Bacillus licheniformis B-1, was isolated from a tea garden soil, utilizing beta-CY as a growth substrate. Good linear relationships between beta-CY and 3-PBA were observed and the concentrations of reference solutions were between 0.50 and 60.00 mu g/mL. Satisfactory stability and intra-and interday precision were obtained. The limits of detection were 0.06 and 0.13 mu g/mL for beta-CY and 3-PBA, respectively, and the corresponding limits of quantification were 0.21 and 0.34 mu g/mL, respectively. Spiking recoveries for beta-CY varied from 98.38 to 105.80%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) varying from 1.49 to 3.93%. Spiking recoveries for 3-PBA varied from 99.59 to 101.20%, with RSDs varying from 0.58 to 3.64%. The proposed method has advantages of simplicity, rapidity, high accuracy, good separation and reproducibility; thus, it is ideally suitable for simultaneous determination of beta-CY and 3-PBA in microbial degradation systems.

In this study, a litterbag experiment employing litterbags with different mesh sizes (3 mm to permit soil fauna access and 0.04 mm to exclude fauna access) was conducted in three habitats (arid valley, ecotone and subalpine forest) with changes in climate and vegetation types to evaluate the effects of soil fauna on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) during the first year of decomposition. The results showed that the individual density and community abundance of soil fauna greatly varied among these habitats, but Prostigmata, Isotomidae and Oribatida were the dominant soil invertebrates. At the end of the experiment, the mass remaining of foliar litter ranged from 58% for shrub litter to 77% for birch litter, and the DOC and TDN concentrations decreased to 54%-85% and increased to 34%-269%, respectively, when soil fauna were not present. The effects of soil fauna on the concentrations of both DOC and TDN in foliar litter were greater in the subalpine forest (wetter but colder) during the winter and in the arid valley (warmer but drier) during the growing season, and this effect was positively correlated with water content. Moreover, the effects of fauna on DOC and TDN concentrations were greater for high-quality litter and were related to the C/N ratio. These results suggest that water, rather than temperature, dominates how fauna affect the release of dissolved substances from fresh litter.

In this study, a novel DREB1/CBF transcription factor, PnDREB1, was isolated from Iceland poppy (Papaver nudicaule), a plant adaptive to low temperature environments. It is homologous to the known DREB1s of Arabidopsis and other plant species. It also shares similar 3D structure, and conserved and functionally important motifs with DREB1s of Arabidopsis. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the AP2 domain of PnDREB1 is similar to those of Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, and M. sativa. PnDREB1 is constitutively expressed in diverse tissues and is increased in roots. qPCR analyses indicated that PnDREB1 is significantly induced by freezing treatment as well as by abscissic acid. The expression levels induced by freezing treatment were higher in the variety with higher degree of freezing tolerance. These results suggested that PnDREB1 is a novel and functional DREB1 transcription factor involved in freezing response and possibly in other abiotic stresses. Furthermore, the freezing-induction could be suppressed by exogenous gibberellins acid, indicating that PnDREB1 might play some role in the GA signaling transduction pathway. This study provides a basis for better understanding the roles of DREB1 in adaption of Iceland poppy to low temperatures.

It also exerts protective effects against mortality secondary to acute lung injury. The effects of obesity on immune responses to acute lung injury induced by Escherichia coli were investigated to determine if the above-mentioned differences in its effects were related to infection severity. Methods: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) and lean control mice received intranasal instillations of 10(9) or 10(10) CFUs of E. coli. The immune responses were examined at 0 h (uninfected), 24 h, and 96 h postinfection. Results: Following infection, the DIO mice exhibited higher leukocyte, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and more severe lung injury than the lean mice. Following inoculation with 10(10) CFUs of E. coli, the DIO mice exhibited higher mortality and more severe inflammation-induced injury than the lean mice, but no differences in E. coli counts were noted between the two groups. However, inoculated with 10 9 CFUs of E. coli, the DIO mice exhibited smaller E. coli burdens at 24 h and 96 h after infection, as well as lower concentrations of IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and less severe lung injury at 96 h after infection. Conclusions: The results support the emerging view that obesity may be beneficial in the setting of milder infection but detrimental in the setting of more severe infection.

We measured cell viability, the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We found that DON exposure increased the concentrations of LDH, MDA, and H2O2 in all experimental groups in a dose-dependent manner, while the concentrations of other antioxidant enzymes were decreased. In Se-pretreated DON-exposed cells, damage to antioxidant enzymes was reduced, especially in the lower-dose DON groups over longer exposure times. These results may indicate that in piglet splenic lymphocytes, Se can alleviate DON-induced damage to antioxidant enzymes by improving glutathione peroxidase activity. Se may function as a potential antioxidative agent to alleviate DON-induced oxidative stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We studied the degradation of lignin and cellulose in the foliar litter of four dominant riparian species (willow: Salix paraplesia; azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum; cypress: Sabina saltuaria; and larch: Larix mastersiana) in an alpine forest river. Over an entire year's incubation, litter lignin and cellulose degraded by 14.7-100% and 57.7-100% of their initial masses, respectively, depending on litter species. Strong degradations of lignin and cellulose occurred in the prefreezing period (i.e., the first 41 d) during litter decomposition, and the degradation rate was the highest among all the decomposition periods regardless of litter species. Litter species, decomposition period, and environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability showed significant influences on lignin and cellulose degradation rates. Compared with previously reported data regarding the dynamics of lignin and cellulose during litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, our results suggest that lignin and cellulose can be degraded much more rapidly in lotic ecosystems, indicating that the traditionally used two-phased model for the dynamics of lignin in decomposing litter may not be suitable in lotic ecosystems.

This study seeks to better understand anatomic prenatal muscle differences and its underpinning mechanisms between two contrasting sheep breeds. A total of 38 sheep fetuses, including 20 Texel with pronounced muscularity and 18 Ujumqin, an indigenous fat -tailed sheep characterized by their hardiness, fetuses aged at up to five time-points from embryonic day (E) 70-135 of gestation were sacrificed and their organs and muscles dissected at 12 anatomical locations from the right side of each animal. Whole Texel fetuses weighed more especially at E70 and E85 (both 1.7-fold, P < 0.001) with heavier internal organs (P < 0.05), than age-matched Ujumqin fetuses. Texel fetuses also contained more muscle, including aggregate-excised muscles (70% before E100, P < 0.001) and muscle proportion (similar to 0.5%, P < 0.05), larger (similar to 20%) and more total muscle fibers, greater muscle size (20% loin muscle area, P=0.008), and a lower proportion of type I muscle fibers (Texel, 18.85%; Ujumqin, 25.23%) at most anatomical locations. Notably, in Texel fetuses from E70 to E85, sharply decreased myofiber number and significantly augmented fiber size were accompanied by the molecular events resembled those in myoblast fusing of Ujumqin sheep (E85-E100), which indicate this period (E70-E85) is pivotal for Texel myoblast fusing. Altogether, these results suggest that comparing with obese animal, the muscular superiority in lean breed largely establishes at middle gestation, although they share the similar regulatory gene network. The present study provides a novel insight into mammalian myogenesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dietary treatments had no effect on growth performance of piglets (21-day weaning) fed the commercial prestart diet for 1 week before receiving the experimental diets supplemented with SF3 at 0, 3 or 5 g/kg diet (Exp. 1), whereas diarrhea frequency averaged across a week was decreased by SF3 supplementation (5 g/kg diet) in piglets fed the experimental diets immediately after weaning (Exp. 2). In Exp. 3, piglets (28-dayweaning) were fed the control (containing pure colistin sulfate and enramycin, respectively, at 20mg/kg diet) for 1week and thenwere fed the control or SF3-supplemented (5 g/kg diet) diet for 2 weeks. The SF3-fed piglets had greater apparent ileal digestibility of calciumand dry matter, while also demonstrating greater overall gross energy, up-regulated jejunal expression of sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 and transforming growth factor-beta, down-regulated jejunal expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, higher ileal Lactobacillus, with lower total bacteria content, lower plasma TNF-alpha but higher IgG levels than the controlfed piglets. Collectively, SF3 consumption improved diarrhea resistance ofweaned pigs by improving nutrient digestibility, piglet immunity and intestinal bacteria profile.

To investigate whether miRNAs regulate the pathogenesis in necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IA, which causes significant yield loss in main economically important crops, and to determine the regulatory mechanism occurring during pathogenesis, we constructed hyphal small RNA libraries from six different infection periods of the rice leaf. Through sequencing and analysis, 177 miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) were identified, including 15 candidate pathogenic novel milRNAs predicted by functional annotations of their target mRNAs and expression patterns of milRNAs and mRNAs during infection. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction results for randomly selected milRNAs demonstrated that our novel comprehensive predictions had a high level of accuracy. In our predicted pathogenic protein-protein interaction network of R. solani, we added the related regulatory milRNAs of these core coding genes into the network, and could understand the relationships among these regulatory factors more clearly at the systems level. Furthermore, the putative pathogenic Rhi-milR-16, which negatively regulates target gene expression, was experimentally validated to have regulatory functions by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Additionally, 23 candidate rice miRNAs that may involve in plant immunity against R. solani were discovered. This first study on novel pathogenic milRNAs of R. solani AG1 IA and the recognition of target genes involved in pathogenicity, as well as rice miRNAs, participated in defence against R. solani could provide new insights into revealing the pathogenic mechanisms of the severe rice sheath blight disease.

Noticeably, the avian Akirin gene family comprises only one gene (Akirin2), However, it remains unknown whether avian Akirin gene family still has the function of Akirin1; moreover, it is still unclear whether and how Akirin2 plays a role in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, the unexpected functions of duck Aldrin2 were revealed in the present study. The Real-time PCR results showed that between 12 and 48 h during the process of duck myoblasts differentiation, the overexpression of Akirin2 did not significantly increase the expression of myogenic regulatory factors. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cell cycle transition was accelerated by Aldrin2 overexpression. Moreover, the overexpression of Aldrin2 did not influence the myotube formation. Strikingly, when duck myoblasts were cultured in the growth medium, the overexpression of Akirin2 significantly enhanced cell viability. Although the expression of cyclin-dependent proteins did not significantly increase after transfection, the expression of the mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) increased. Furthermore, the protein expression of phospho-p70S6K (Ser 417) also increased. However, when rapamycin and pEGFP-N1-Aldrin2 plasmids were added together to the growth medium, the positive impact of Akirin2 on cell viability and the mRNA expression of mTOR and p70S6K were significantly blocked. Furthermore, the expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser 2448) and phospho-p70S6K (Ser 417) were also blocked. Taken together, these results could suggest that duck Aldrin2 could promote myoblast proliferation via the activation of the mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the Cs-137 tracing method, spatial variations in soil erosion, organic carbon, and total nitrogen (TN) in terraced fields lacking field banks and forestland were determined. Soil samples were collected at approximately 5 m and 20 m intervals along terraced field series and forestland transects respectively. Mean 137Cs inventories of the four soil cores from the reference site was estimated at 574.33 +/- 126.22 Bq m(-2) (1 Bq (i.e., one Becquerel) is equal to 1 disintegration per second (1 dps)). For each terrace, the Cs-137 inventory generally increased from upper to lower slope positions, accompanied by a decrease in the soil erosion rate. Along the entire terraced toposequence, Cs-137 data showed that abrupt changes in soil erosion rates could occur between the lower part of the upper terrace and the upper part of the immediate terrace within a small distance. This result indicated that tillage erosion is also a dominant erosion type in the sloping farmland of this area. At the same time, we observed a fluctuant decrease in soil erosion rates for the whole terraced toposequence as well as a net deposition at the toe terrace. Although steep terraces (lacking banks and hedgerows) to some extent could act to limit soil sediment accumulation in catchments, soil erosion in the terraced field was determined to be serious. For forestland, with the exception of serious soil erosion that had taken place at the top of slopes due to concentrated flows from a country road situated above the forestland site, spatial variation in soil erosion was similar to the "standard" water erosion model. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN inventories showed similar spatial patterns to the Cs-137 inventory for both toposequences investigated. However, due to the different dominant erosion processes between the two, we found similar patterns between the < 0.002 mm soil particle size fraction (clay sized) and Cs-137 inventories in terraced fields, while different patterns could be found between Cs-137 inventories and the < 0.002 mm soil particle size fraction in the forestland site. Such results confirm that Cs-137 can successfully trace soil erosion, SOC and soil nitrogen dynamics in steep terraced fields and forestland in the Middle Mountains of Nepal.

Investigation of JAKs/STAT-3 in lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal epithelial cells	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						enteritis; IECs; JAKs/STAT-3; RNA-Seq; siRNA	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; RNA-SEQ; PATHWAY; RESPONSES; CULTURE; IMMUNE; GENE; JAK; EXPRESSION; MECHANISM	Janus-activated kinase (JAKs)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) signalling play critical roles in immunoregulation and immunopathology, which involve inflammatory responses and enteritis. JAK phosphorylates STAT-3 in response to stimulation by cytokines or growth factors, and then activates or represses the gene expression. STAT-3 is activated persistently in cancer cells and contributes to the malignant progression of various types of cancer and inflammation. To elucidate the different roles of JAKs in the activation of STAT-3, the lipopolysaccharideinduced primary intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) acute inflammatory model was established. Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) were then employed to attenuate the expression levels of JAKs. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) revealed that JAK mRNA levels were reduced efficiently by JAK-specific siRNAs. Under the IEC inflammatory model transfected with si-JAK, which equates to effective silencing, qRT-PCR and Western blot assays, suggested that knockdowns of JAK attenuated the JAK-induced down-regulation of STAT3 at the mRNA or protein levels. In particular, JAK1 played a key role, which was consistent with the RNA-Seq results. Subsequently, the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were down-regulated in the IEC inflammatory model transfected with si-JAK1. JAK1 appears as a direct activator for STAT-3, whereas treatments targeting JAK1 repressed STAT-3 sufficiently pathways in the IEC inflammatory model. Therefore, the control of JAK1 using siRNAs has the potential to be an effective strategy against enteritis.

OMPs act as epitopes and are potential vaccine candidates. Outer membrane protein N (OmpN) is a component of the outer membrane of Edwardsiella ictaluri (E. ictaluri). In a previous study, the OmpN1-, OmpN2-, OmpN3-encoding genes of E. ictaluri were cloned, and here they were expressed in Escherichia colt. Western blotting showed that these three proteins had molecular weights of similar to 60 kDa. Channel catfish were immunized with recombinant OmpNs (rOmpNs) and then challenged with E. ictaluri. The results showed that rOmpN1, rOmpN2, and rOmpN3, as well as a mixture of all three proteins (in a ratio of 1:1:1) generated moderate immune protection (relative percentage of survival = 62.5, 62.5, 67.5, and 75%, respectively). In an agglutination antibody titer assay, fish antisera showed an antibody titer of 1:128. Furthermore, each of the proteins stimulated high levels of lysozyme activity. In addition, a real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed significant up-regulation of immune-related genes encoding major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), MHC II, CD4L, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma after 24 and 48 h of challenge, compared with the levels stimulated by phosphate-buffered saline. Taken together, we conclude that rOmpNs may elicit immune responses and generate protection against E. ictaluri in channel catfish. Thus, rOmpNs could be promising vaccine candidates against E. ictaluri. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 540 grass carp (264.11 +/- 0.76 g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of protein (143.1, 176.7, 217.2, 257.5, 292.2 and 322.8 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet) for 8 weeks. After the growth trial, fish were challenged with Flavobacterium columnare for 3 days. The results indicated that optimal levels of dietary protein had the following effects: (1) the production of antibacterial components increased, and anti-inflammatory cytolcines, inhibitor of am, target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 mRNA levels were up regulated, whereas mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) P65, NF-kappa B P52, I kappa B kinase (1KK) alpha, IKK beta, IKK gamma, eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP) 1 and 4E-BP2 were down-regulated in the gills of grass carp (P < 0.05), indicating that fish gill immune function was enhanced at an optimal level of dietary protein; (2) the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione content increased, the contents of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl (PC) decreased, and NF-E2-related factor 2, B-cell lymphoma protein-2, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, myeloid cell leukemia-1 and tight junction complexes mRNA levels were up-regulated, whereas Kelchlike-ECH-associated protein (Keap) 1a, Keap1b, cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease 3, 8, 9, fatty acid synthetase ligand, apoptotic protease activating factor-1, Bc1-2 associated X protein, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mRNA levels were down regulated in the gills of grass carp (P < 0.05), indicating that the fish gill physical barrier function improved at an optimal level of dietary protein. Finally, based on the gill rot morbidity, ACP activity and PC content, the optimal levels of dietary protein for grass carp were estimated to be 286.65 g kg(-1) diet (253.73 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet), 290.46 g kg(-1) diet (257.76 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet) and 296.25 g kg(-1) diet (260.69 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet), respectively.

The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of S. maltophilia are one of the most immunogenic and highly conserved candidates for vaccine development in aquaculture. The present study investigated OMPs of S. maltophilia, as vaccine on immune response and disease resistance against S. maltophilia of channel catfish and investigated the enhancement effect of natural adjuvants Propolis (Pro), FIG polysaccharide (Fcps), Glycyrrhizine (Gly) to OMPs of S. maltophilia for further study. The results indicated that channel catfish injected intraperitoneally with OMPs showed better immune response including leukocytes phagocytosis activity, serum bactericidal activity, complement C3, IgM level and an increasement of resistance against S. maltophilia compared to the control group. Moreover, Pro, Fcps and Gly could enhance the immune response of OMPs. The relative percent of survival (RPS) was 73.33%, 66.67%, 63.33%, 60%, 0% in fish injected OMPs + Pro, OMPs Fcps, OMPs Gly, OMPs and 0.65% normal saline, respectively. These results suggested that OMPs used as vaccine could induce and stimulate immune response and enhance disease resistance in channel catfish, especially for Pro as immunoenhancer. Results revealed that OMPs were an effective vaccine against S. maltophilia in channel catfish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Total viable count of sausages with natural casing-IVC (4.03 log cfu g(-1)) was significantly lower than those of sausages with modified casing-IVC (4.76 log cfu g(-1)) and modified casing-commercial cooling (5.13 log cfu g(-1)) (P < 0.05) at day 21. According to discriminant analysis, sausages stored for 21 days were clearly differentiated from those stored for 5 and 16 days by gumminess. Sausages with natural casing-IVC can be discriminated by gumminess from other treatments. The modified casing was conducive to the IVC system; however, the modified casing was unlikely to protect samples against microorganisms.

The reflection spectrum curve of old rice and new rice were obtained with a field spectroradiometer and the acquired spectral data was preprocessed with direct orthogonal signal correction method (DOSC) to filter the independent signal from the spectral data which is irrelevant with the dependent variable Y array and eliminate the influence and interference of the irrelevant information in the following chemometric analysis. The Durbin-Watson test and Run test methods were utilized to detect the nonlinearity which exists in the spectral data structure. The enhanced partial residual plot analysis method (Augmented partial residual plot) was employed to quantitative analysis of the degree of nonlinearity of the spectral data. Popular linear manifold dimensionality reduction methods including principal component analysis (PCA) method and multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) method and popular nonlinear manifold dimensionality reduction methods including Isometries mapping method (ISOMAP), locally linear embedding (LLE) method and Laplacian Eigenmap method (LE) were used to extract the real variable from the preprocessed spectral data. Then, the intrinsic variable was taken as the input of the kernel partial least squares method (KPLS) to establish the relationship between the intrinsic variables and the storage time of rice samples. The number of experiment samples of the new rice and the old rice were 200 respectively and randomly separated into the training set with 300 samples and the test set with 100 samples. Through comparing the prediction results of the regression models which were established with different manifold reduction methods, the experiment results show that the prediction effects of the nonlinear-based models are superior to the linear-based models. Finally, the KPLS model established with 40 true variables extracted with ISOMAP approach achieved the optimal prediction effect. The prediction correlation coefficient (R-p(2)), RMSEP (RMSEP) and relative prediction error value (RPD) were 0. 917, 0. 187 and 2. 698, respectively. It was concluded that NIRS combined with ISOMAP-KPLS method can be successfully used to determine the storage period of rice accurately and quickly.

However, the underlying molecular coloration mechanism of the red-leaf poplar remains unknown. In this study, tissue buds and leaves from mutant QHP(red) and its wild-type progenitor L2025 (green) were used to study the coloration mechanism by high-throughput RNA sequencing and comparative analysis of the transcriptomes. A total of 12,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Functional enrichment using Gene Ontology (GO) and, Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations showed that 4951 bud DEGs and 1927 leaf DEGs participate in many important biological and metabolic pathways, including anthocyanin biosynthesis. Importantly, some structural genes that contribute to photosynthesis were down-regulated, and some candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene and anthocyanin were up-regulated in the QHP mutant. The DEGs identified provided insight into the novel traits of the mutant. The unigene dataset that was used to discover candidate genes provides a comprehensive resource for molecular research in red-leaf poplar and may provide insight into coloration of other woody plants.

Thus, the process of polyploidization and evolutionary history of polyploids is of widespread interest. The chloroplast DNA regions trnH-psbA was used to analyze to phylogenetic relationships and maternal donor of Elymus species and their closely related species. The Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic reconstructions partitioned the Elymus species into two groups. All the Elymus species were related to species of Pseudoroegneria. These results indicated that (1) Pseudoroegneria (St genome) was the maternal donor of the polyploidy Elymus; (2) the St genome of Elymus had several origins and diverse species of Pseudoroegneria might have taken part in the formation of polyploid species of Elymus; (3) high degree genome differentiation exists among the Pseudoroegneria species.

Under drought stress, chlorophyll (Chl) content, Chl fluorescence, relative water content and oxygen evolution capacity gradually decreased, and the thylakoid structure was gradually damaged. Short-term drought stress caused a rapid disassembly of the light-harvesting complex II (LHCII). However, PSII dimers kept stable under the short-term drought stress and significantly decreased only after 15 days of drought stress. Immunoblotting analysis of the thylakoid membrane proteins showed that most of the photosystem proteins decreased after the stress, especially for Lhcb5, Lhcb6 and PsbQ proteins. However, surprisingly, PsbS significantly increased after the long-term drought stress, which is consistent with the substantially increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) after the stress. Our results suggest that the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes and LHCII assemblies play an important role in preventing photo-damages to PSII under drought stress.

Rapid, simple, and reliable diagnostic techniques are desired for the early detection of Eucalyptus die back of C. scoparium prior to formulation of efficient control plan. For this purpose, three PCR-based methods of nested PCR, multiplex PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were developed for detection of C. scoparium based on factor 1-alpha (tef1) and beta-tubulin gene in this study. All of the three methods showed highly specific to C. scoparium. The sensitivities of the nested PCR and LAMP were much higher than the multiplex PCR. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR was also higher than regular PCR. C. scoparium could be detected within 60 min from infected Eucalyptus plants by LAMP, while at least 2 h was needed by the rest two methods. Using different Eucalyptus tissues as samples for C. scoparium detection, all of the three PCR-based methods showed much better detection results than regular PCR. Base on the results from this study, we concluded that any of the three PCR-based methods could be used as diagnostic technology for the development of efficient strategies of Eucalyptus dieback disease control. Particularly, LAMP was the most practical method in field application because of its one-step and rapid reaction, simple operation, single-tube utilization, and simple visualization of amplification products.

To evaluate the effects of splash erosion on maize, spatial distribution of rainfall intensity and splash erosion rate were measured under maize cover in different growth stages. The relation between splash erosion rate under the maize canopy and rainfall intensity was analyzed. The results indicated that, the average rainfall intensity under the maize canopy gradually increased with the increase in rainfall intensity during the whole growth stage, and splash erosion rate under the maize canopy showed the same change. The average rainfall intensity and splash erosion rate under rainfall of 2.0 mm min(-1) were significantly higher than those of the rainfall of 1.0 mm min(-1). Under the same rainfall intensity, the minimum of splash erosion rate appeared in the jointing stage, while the maximum appeared in the tasseling stage. Compared with the seedling stage, the average splash erosion rates of the jointing stage showed the reduction of 23.9, 24.2, and 41.1 % the corresponding rainfall of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm min(-1), respectively, under the maize canopy. Under rainfall of 1.0 and 1.5 mm min(-1), there was a significant negative correlation between rainfall intensity under the canopy and splash erosion rate of every spot at the maize tasseling stage. Under rainfall of 2.0 mm min(-1), there was also a significant negative correlation between rainfall intensity and splash erosion rate under the canopy of every spot at maize seedling stage and mature stage. The distribution of splash erosion rate was concentrated at maize seedling stage and mature stage. However, the dispersion degree of splash erosion rate was obvious at jointing stage and tasseling stage of maize. Splash erosion rates showed great difference under the canopy at every period of maize growth. Under rainfall of 1.0 mm min(-1), the high splash erosion rate appeared at two spots, while under rainfall of 1.5 and 2.0 mm min(-1), splash erosion rate was only concentrated in a spot. This study would provide theoretical guidance for soil erosion control based on crop growth and coverage.

Most small-scale biogas plants in China are in poor condition and have low utilization rates due to inaccurate designs and inappropriate maintenance. The aim of this study was to find efficiency measures to improve plant operation, and assess the suitability of the plants in the rural Chinese agricultural system. A 30 m(3) plant was operated for a 1-year period to test its performance using an assessment system. The results showed that biogas production reached 99.96 and 96.85 % of the maximum theoretical levels at temperatures of 25 +/- A 2 and 20 +/- A 1 A degrees C, respectively. Through correct installation of insulation and proper construction of the feeding process, the daily average biogas production rate was raised to 0.47 m(3)/(m(3) days). This was enough to completely supply 11 households with a sufficient amount of biogas for 9 months out of the year (CH4 > 55 %). The digestate produced from the biogas production process can also be used efficiently as fertilizer on farmland, and does not lead to nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation or excessive heavy metal content (outside of the permitted range). In the study area, rice and wheat yields increased 14.5 and 15.4 % respectively. Furthermore, we found that a trained farmer could complete all of the regular maintenance tasks of the plant, with the maintenance costs allocated from the biogas supply at an input-output ratio of 1.41. Marginal income was achieved by comprehensive biogas-digestate utilization at an input-output ratio of 7.55. We conclude that small-scale biogas plants currently provide a suitable system for comprehensive biogas-digestate utilization within the dispersed Chinese agricultural structure.

The morulae were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) untreated (control), (2) exposed to vitrification solution without freezing (toxicity), or (3) vitrified by open-pulled straw method (vitrification). In vitro development was evaluated by morphology and assessed by the blastocyst rate and the blastocyst total cell number. Gene expression in morulae and blastocysts was assessed by quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The results showed that at morulae stage, the POU class 5 homeoboxl (Oct-4) and B-cell lymphoma2 (Bcl2) mRNA levels of vitrification group were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of control. Strikingly, the p53 mRNA level was significantly higher in vitrification group. However, the Oct-4, Bcl2 and p53 mRNA levels in mouse blastocysts were not statistically different. Furthermore, western blot results showed that there was no significant difference in Oct-4, Bcl2 and p53 expression at protein level in mouse morulae among three groups. Additionally, the blastocyst rate (96.67%-100.00%) and the average cell number of blastocysts (89.67-92.33) were similar between all groups. The data demonstrate that vitrification transiently changes the mRNA expression of several key genes in mouse morulae regulating early embryo development but does not affect embryo developmental potential in vitro.

There are three serotypes of DHAV: serotype 1 (DHAV-1), serotype 2 (DHAV-2) and serotype 3 (DHAV-3). These serotypes have no cross-antigenicity with each other. To establish an rRT-PCR assay for the rapid detection of a mixed infection of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3, two pairs of primers and a pair of matching TagMan probes were designed based on conserved regions of DHAV-1 VP0 and DHAV-3 VP3. Finally, we established a one-step duplex rRT-PCR assay with high specificity and sensitivity for the simultaneous detection of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3. This method showed no cross-antigenicity with the other pathogens tested, including duck plague virus, Muscovy duck parvovirus, Riemerella anatipestifer, and pathogenic E. coli from ducks. Sensitivity tests identified the minimum detection limits of this method as 98 (DHAV-1) and 10 (DHAV-3) copies/reaction. To validate the method, thirty-eight clinical samples and thirty artificially infected samples collected from dead duck embryos were studied. Thirty-seven samples were positive for DHAV-1, seventeen samples were positive for DHAV-3, and fourteen samples were positive for a mixed infection using the duplex rRT-PCR method.

Here, we resequenced the whole genomes of 38 snub-nosed monkeys representing four species within this genus. By conducting population genomic analyses, we observed a similar load of deleterious variation in snub-nosed monkeys living in both smaller and larger populations and found that genomic diversity was lower than that reported in other primates. Reconstruction of Rhinopithecus evolutionary history suggested that episodes of climatic variation over the past 2 million years, associated with glacial advances and retreats and population isolation, have shaped snub-nosed monkey demography and evolution. We further identified several hypoxia-related genes under selection in R. bieti (black snub-nosed monkey), a species that exploits habitats higher than any other nonhuman primate. These results provide the first detailed and comprehensive genomic insights into genetic diversity, demography, genetic burden, and adaptation in this radiation of endangered primates.

(AS 3.17108) is described. The structure of tanshisorbicin is a hybrid of tanshinone IIA (2) and sorbicillinol (3). The latter is a metabolite produced by Hypocrea sp. The structure of tanshisorbicin was determined using mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and ECD calculations. The anti-MRSA activity of 1 was found to be significantly higher than that of the parent substrate Tan IIA. Preliminary experiments indicate that tanshisorbicin is formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that is likely catalyzed by microbial enzyme.

Fish with initial average weight 103.9 +/- 0.6 g were fed three extruded diets. Fish meal (FM) diet was formulated as the normal control with 40 g kg(-1) FM and 300 g kg(-1) CM; CM diet was prepared by replacing all FM with CM (total 340 g kg(-1)) without Lys or Met supplementation; CM supplement (CMS) diet was similar to CM diet but was supplemented with essential amino acids (EAA) to ensure the levels of Lys and Met similar to those in the FM diet. Feed intake, feed efficiency and specific growth rate of the grass carp fed CMS and FM diets were similar (P > 0.05), but higher than those of the grass carp fed CM diet (P < 0.05). The hepatosomatic index, relative gut length, intestosomatic index and intestinal folds height were significantly improved in fish fed FM and CMS diets as compared to CM diet (P < 0.05). Lower activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase in hepatopancreas were observed in fish fed CM diet (P < 0.05). Three hundred and forty gram per kilogram CM without Lys or Met supplementation significantly decreased trypsin, lipase and amylase mRNA levels in hepatopancreas (P < 0.05). These results indicated that the high supply of CM (340 g kg(-1)) in plant protein (200 g kg(-1) soybean meal and 100 g kg(-1) cottonseed meal) diets decreased digestive ability through decreasing digestive enzyme activities and enzyme gene's expressions of grass carp, and these side effects can be reversed by supplementing Lys and Met. Therefore, CM could be high level used in a plant protein blend-based extruded diet for grass carp as long as EAA were supplemented.

Two hundred eighty 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly assigned to four groups and raised for 42 days. The control group was fed a corn-soybean basal diet (fluorine 22.6 mg/kg). The other three groups were fed the same basal diet, but supplemented with 400, 800, and 1200 mg/kg fluorine (high fluorine groups I, II, and III), administered in the form of sodium fluoride. The microbiota of ileal and cecal digesta was assessed with plate counts and polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). It was found that, compared with those in the control group, the counts of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were markedly decreased (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), whereas the counts of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were significantly increased (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) in the high fluorine groups II and III. PCR-DGGE analysis showed that the number of DGGE bands, similarity, and Shannon index of ileal and cecal bacteria were markedly reduced in the high fluorine groups II and III from 21 to 42 days. Sequencing analysis revealed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was altered in the high fluorine groups. In conclusion, dietary fluorine in the range of 800-1200 mg/kg obviously altered the bacterial counts, and the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens, a finding which implies that dietary high fluorine can disrupt the natural balance and structure of the intestinal microbiota.

Laccases of fungal origins have been extensively studied, but only few reports are available for bacterial laccase-like genes, especially in coastal mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated the seasonal diversity and abundance of bacterial laccase-like genes in coastal mangrove sediments, and then compared to other ecosystems including Forest, Grassland, Fen and Bog. Additionally, the correlations between environmental factors and bacterial laccase-like communities were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the diversity and abundance of bacterial laccase-like genes in this mangrove ecosystem largely varied in sediment types and sampling seasons, and the microbial communities inferred by the functional genes included Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and some Unknown species as the major groups. In comparison, bacterial laccase-like communities in mangrove sediments were significantly different with the referenced ecosystems. The variations of total contents of C and N in soils/sediments are proposed to be the primary reasons for the differences of bacterial laccase-like genes among ecosystems. Moreover, the diversity index was negatively correlated with C:P and N:P, while the abundance showed a positive/negative correlation with water content and redox potential in this mangrove ecosystem, indicating a significant impact of other environmental factors, such as P and redox potential, on the diversity, distribution and the abundance of bacterial laccase-like genes which were underestimated in the previous research. Taking together, hereby P is proposed as a regulatory and limiting element for microbial SOM degradation through the laccases-initiated enzymatic reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Shading treatment had a significant influence on the. of rice organs, resulting in clear increases in the Delta of stems plus sheaths (Delta S-m), rice grains (Delta G(m)) and rice flour (Delta F-m) at maturity, but a reduction in the Delta of leaves (Delta L-g) at the grain-filling stage. The relationships between Delta and leaf photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and grain yield showed a close dependence on plant organs and light regimes. Under shading treatment, photosynthetic rate was negatively associated with Delta G(m) and the Delta of stems plus sheaths at the grain-filling stage (Delta S-g), whereas Delta S-m was significantly (P<0.05) negatively correlated with the quantum yield of PSII (Phi(PSII)), photochemical quenching (qP) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Moreover, grain filling and grain weight under shading treatment were positively correlated with Delta S-g, but negatively related to Delta S-m in 2011. In contrast, a significantly (P<0.01) negative association between grain weight and Delta L-g was observed in 2010. It was found that lower values of Delta L-g, Delta S-m and Delta G(m) in rice indicated better light-harvesting and light-use capability and also higher grain filling and grain weight of rice.

Autophagy signaling pathway was regulated by vitamin D-3 to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Rotavirus (RV) was a major cause of the severe diarrheal disease in young children and young animals. Although evidence suggested that vitamin D-3 attenuates the negative effects of RV infection via the retinoic acid-inducible gene I signaling pathway, little is known of its antiviral effect whether through the regulation of autophagy. The present study was performed to investigate whether vitamin D3 alleviates RV infection in pig and porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) models via regulating the autophagy signaling pathway. RV administration increased the Beclin 1 mRNA abundance in porcine jejunum and ileum. 5000 IU/kg dietary vitamin D-3 supplementation greatly up-regulated LC3-II/LC3-I ratios and PR-39 mRNA expression under the condition of RV challenged. The viability of IPEC-J2 was significantly inhibited by RV infection. Incubation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 significantly decreased the concentrations of RV antigen and non-structural protein 4 (NSP4), and up-regulated the mRNA expression of Beclin 1 and PR-39 in the RV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. And then, based on the 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 treatment and RV infection, LC3-II mRNA expression in cells was inhibited by an autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1, a class of inhibitors of membrane ATPases, inhibits maturation of autophagic vacuoles) treatment numerically enhanced the LC3-II mRNA abundance, but had no effect on NSP4 concentration. Furthermore, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 decreased the p62 mRNA expression and increased porcine cathelicidins (PMAP23, PG1-5 and PR-39) mRNA expression in the RV-infected cells. Taken together, these results indicated that vitamin D-3 attenuates RV infection through regulating autophagic maturation and porcine cathelicidin genes expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of phase compositions of CaP ceramics on their bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) adsorption behaviours in phosphate-buffered saline. The BCP material surface probably has more adsorption sites which can adsorb more BMP-2 molecules. Langmuir, Frundlich, and Temkin isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption of BMP-2 onto CaP ceramics. The Langmuir isotherm model fit the equilibrium data better than the Frundlich and Temkin isotherm models. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model is suitable for the description of the adsorption kinetics, and 240min is thought to be the optimal adsorption time. A possible adsorption mechanism has been proposed. The electrostatic interaction plays an important role in the adsorption processes. In addition, the BMP-2 could be adsorbed to the surface which showed slight conformational changes analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Nevertheless, studies on dietary exposure of human to phthalates are limited. In this study, to assess the daily intakes of phthalate esters and the possible adverse health impacts, different food samples were collected from three areas of Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world. The Sigma phthalate ester concentrations in Kampong Cham, Kratie and Kandal provinces ranged from 0.05 to 2.34 (median 0.88) mu g g(-1), 0.19-1.65 (median 0.86) mu g g(-1) and 0.24-3.05 (median 0.59) mu g g(-1) wet weight (ww), respectively. Di-2-Ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were the predominant compounds among all foodstuffs. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of phthalate esters for the general population in Kampong Cham, Kratie and Kandal was 34.3, 35.6 and 35.8 mu g kg(-1) bw d(-1), respectively. The dietary daily intake of DEHP, benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) in Kampong Cham, Kratie and Kandal were below the tolerable daily intakes (TDI) imposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and reference doses (RfD) imposed by The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Rice contributed the greatest quantity of DEHP to the daily intake in Cambodia so may deserve further exploration. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the occurrence and the daily intakes of phthalate esters in Cambodia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, how to define and how to assess ecological civililation (EC) are worth further exploring. This paper constructed a people-oriented EC indicator system, composed of a set of indicators, viz. Degree of Physiological Equilibrium (DPE), Degree of Psychological Imbalance (DPI), Degree of Imbalance of Human and Environment (DIHE), Degree of Human Development (DHP), Disharmony Degree of Economy and Environment (DDEE), and a composite index-Ecological Civilization Index (ECI), and then the indicator system was used to investigate the trends of China's EC construction during 1980-2010. Based on the reference year 1980, the study revealed that: (1) Physiological equilibrium of Chinese people has been slightly disturbed; (2) Psychological balance of Chinese people has been broken seriously; (3) The balance between human and environment has been destroyed greatly; (4) China has achieved great progress in promoting human development; (5) this country has improved the relationship between economy and environment obviously, despite that this improvement pace still falls behind speed of economic growth; and (6) China's EC level has declined during this study period. Therein, psychological problem and conflict between human and environment are the key obstacles to China's EC progress. China's government should further emphasize reform of its income distribution system and transformation of its economic development mode in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This work put forward a set of indicator system and the related methods, based on energy, current, mass and emergy, to describe the complicated interactions between water supply systems, economic development, energy consumption and environmental impact. As a case, the proposed indicators and methods were used to explore the effects of China's tap water supply system (TWSS) on national economy, energy and environment from 2000 to 2013, so as to discover some underlying obstacles hindering the sustainable development of China's TWSS. The study results show that (1) per capita water use declines by 28.11% from 102.17 t/person in 2000 to 73.45 t/person in 2013; (2) the contribution of China's TWSS to national economy and energy decreases by annual decline rates of 5.37% and 3.66% respectively; (3) the total pollution discharge from this system ascends by an annual growth rate of 1.06%, of which 97.44% comes from sludge discharge in terms of mass; therein, the contribution of COD discharge from this system to national COD discharge rises by an annual growth rate of 2.57% while the contribution of sludge discharge from this system to national sludge discharge falls by an annual decrease rate of 9.26%; generally the environmental impact intensity of this system ascends by an annual growth rate of 0.17%; (4) the annual average leakage rate of 16.49% leads to a lot of water waste. Therefore, China's government will still face the two serious challenges derived from the rising water demand and the increasing energy consumption from tap water supply with development of its society and economy. After discussing the related issues, this work gives the corresponding policy suggestions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although vitamin D has been implicated in muscle development, little is known about the effects of maternal vitamin D status on the muscle development of offspring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of improving maternal vitamin D status by dietary 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (25 OHD3) supplementation on prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle development of offspring, using pigs as the model. Methods: Twenty gilts were allocated to a normal vitamin D (ND) dietary group with 50 g/kg vitamin D-3 or a high-vitamin D (HD) group with an additional 50 nikg 25 OHD3 from mating to weaning. Muscle samples were obtained from piglets at birth and weaning. Results: Serum 25 OHD concentrations were significantly increased in gilts and newborn piglets in the HD group compared with those in the ND group (P < 0.01). Maternal HD significantly increased numbers of muscle fiber in the longissimus dorsi (LM) of newborn piglets (+23.53%; P < 0.01) and weaning piglets (+27.47%; P < 0.05). Meanwhile, maternal HD had significant effects on cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber in psoas major (PM; +12.82%; P < 0.05) and LM (+22.62%; P < 0.05) of weaning piglets. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that PM and LM of piglets from the HD group had higher IGF2, IGF2 R, MyOD1, and myogenin mRNA expressions, but lower MyHC I and myostatin mRNA expressions than those of the ND piglets (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These results suggest that improving maternal vitamin D status by dietary supplementation with 25 OHD3 can promote prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle development of pig offspring by modulating the expressions of muscle transcription factors.

JIAN; IN-VITRO; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BODY-COMPOSITION; WEANED PIGLETS	A 105-day feeding trial was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary curcumin (CM) supplementation on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, and intestinal antioxidant capacity of crucian carp (Carassius auratus). A total of 585 crucian carp with average initial weight of 76.3 +/- 0.10 g were fed three diets supplemented with 0 (basal group), 1, or 5 g kg(-1) CM. Fish fed the diet supplemented with 5 g kg(-1)CM showed significantly higher final body weight (FW), percent weight gain (PWG), and feed efficiency (FE) compares to those fed the basal or 1 g kg(-1) CM diet (P < 0.05). Feed intake and body composition were not significantly different among dietary groups (P > 0.05). The hepatopancreas weight, hepatopancreas protein content, intestinal weight, intestinal somatic index, intestine protein content, trypsin and lipase activities in hepatopancreas and intestine, amylase activity in hepatopancreas, Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), and creatine kinase (CK) activities in intestine were significantly increased with dietary CM supplementation at 5 g kg(-1) (P < 0.05). Fish fed the 5 g kg(-1) CM diet showed significantly lower malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in the intestine (P < 0.05). Superoxide anion and hydroxy radical scavenging ability, glutathione reducase (GR), catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, and glutathione (GSH) content in the intestine were significantly increased with increased CM. The relative mRNA expressions of trypsin, lipase, NKA, AKP, gamma-GT, CK, SOD1, CAT, GPx, GST, and GR in intestine were significantly up-regulated by dietary CM supplementation at 5 g kg(-1). These results suggested that dietary CM supplementation increased intestinal antioxidant capacity, digestive and absorptive ability, and promoted fish growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A two-year field study conducted in an alpine forest meta-ecosystem-with four litter species (i.e., willow: Salix paraplesia, azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum, cypress: Sabina saltuaria, and larch: Larix mastersiana) that varied widely in chemical traits showed that both litter species and ecosystem type (i.e., forest floor, stream and riparian zone) are important factors affecting litter decomposition, and their effects can be moderated by local-scale environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability. Litter decomposed fastest in the streams followed by the riparian zone and forest floor regardless of species. For a given litter species, both the k value and limit value varied significantly among ecosystems, indicating that the litter decomposition rate and extent (i.e., reaching a limit value) can be substantially affected by ecosystem type and the local-scale environmental factors. Apart from litter initial acid unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) concentration and its ratio to nitrogen concentration (i.e., AUR/N ratio), the initial nutrient concentrations of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were also important litter traits that affected decomposition depending on the ecosystem type.

Although it has been reported in many animals, there is no published information available on the occurrence of E. bieneusi in red-bellied tree squirrels. To understand the occurrence, genetic diversity, and zoonotic potential of E. bieneusi in red-bellied tree squirrels, 144 fecal specimens from Sichuan province, China, were examined by PCR amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of E. bieneusi. The overall infection rate of E. bieneusi 16.7% (24/144) was observed in red-bellied tree squirrels. Altogether five genotypes of E. bieneusi were identified: three known genotypes D (n = 18), EbpC (n = 3), SC02 (n = 1) and two novel genotypes CE01, CE02 (one each). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis employing three microsatellite (MS1, MS3, MS7) and one minisatellite (MS4) revealed 16, 14, 7 and 14 positive specimens were successfully sequenced, and identified eight, three, three and two genotypes at four loci, respectively. In phylogenetic analysis, the three known genotypes D, EbpC, and SC02 were clustered into group 1 with zoonotic potential, and the two novel genotypes CE01 and CE02 were clustered into group 6. The present study firstly reported the occurrence of E. bieneusi in red-bellied tree squirrels in China, and the E. bieneusi genotypes D and EbpC were found in humans previously. These results indicate that red-bellied tree squirrels may play a potential role in the transmission of E. bieneusi to humans.

TolC, the key component of multidrug efflux pumps and type I secretion systems, has been well-studied as an exit duct for numerous substances in many Gram-negative bacteria. By contrast, little is known on the role of TolC in biofilm formation. In this study, a Delta tolC mutant was used to examine the importance of TolC in biofilm formation of A. pleuropneumoniae. Surface attachment assays demonstrated the essential role of TolC in initial attachment of biofilm cells. The loss of TolC function altered surface hydrophobicity, and resulted in greatly reduced autoaggregation in Delta tolC. Using both enzymatic treatments and confocal microscopy, biofilm composition and architecture were characterized. When compared against the wild-type strain, the poly-beta-1, 6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA), an important biofilm matrix component of A. pleuropneumoniae, was significantly reduced at the initial attachment stage in Delta tolC. These results were confirmed by mRNA level using quantitative RTPCR. Additionally, defective secretion systems in Delta tolC may also contribute to the deficiency in biofilm formation. Taken together, the current study demonstrated the importance of TolC in the initial biofilm formation stage in A. pleuropneumoniae. These findings could have important clinical implications in developing new treatments against biofilm-related infections by A. pleuropneumoniae.

In this study, a stable wheat-rye substitution line and 3 primary 1RS. 1BL translocation lines were selected from the progeny of the crossing of the Chinese local rye Aigan variety and wheat cultivar Mianyang11. The substitution and translocation lines were identified by molecular cytogenetic analysis. PCR results, fluorescence in situ hybridization and acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that there were a pair of 1R chromosomes in the substitution line which have been named RS1200-3, and a pair of 1RS. 1BL translocation chromosomes in the other 3 translocation lines, which have been named RT1163-4, RT1217-1, and RT1249. When inoculated with stripe rust isolates, these 4 lines expressed high resistance to several Puccinia striiformis f. sp Tritici pathotypes that are virulent on Yr9. Moreover, the different response pattern of resistance among them suggested that the diversity of resistance genes for wheat stripe rust exists in the rye. These 4 lines also showed better agronomic performances than their wheat parent. The GS indices also showed the genetic diversity of the 1RS which derived from same rye variety. The present study indicates that rye cultivars may carry untapped variations that could potentially be used for wheat improvement.

In this study, we focused on quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and general combining ability (GCA) of Ye478, a widely used foundation parent in China. We developed three sets of populations for QTL mapping and to analyze the GCA for some agronomic traits. The assessment of 15 traits resulted in the detection of 251 QTLs in six tested environments, with 119 QTLs identified through a joint analysis across all environments. Further, analyses revealed that most favorable alleles for plant type related traits were from Ye478, and more than half of the favorable alleles for yield-related traits were from R08, another foundation parent used in southwestern China, suggesting that different types of foundation parents carried different favorable alleles. We observed that the GCA for most traits (e.g., plant height and 100-kernel weight) was maintained in the inbred lines descended from the foundation parents. Additionally, the continuous improvement in the GCA of the descendants of the foundation parents was consistent with the main trend in maize breeding programs. We identified three significant genomic regions that were highly conserved in three Ye478 descendants, including the stable QTL for plant height. The GCA for the traits in the F-7 generation revealed that the QTLs for the given traits per se were affected by additive effects in the same way in different populations.

Therefore, we have examined the suppressive effects of sodium fluoride on cultured splenic lymphocytes in mice. CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD19+ B lymphocytes, cytokines, and cell-cycle markers were analyzed through the use of a cell-counting kit, western blot, and flow cytometery. Splenic lymphocytes were isolated from 3-week-old male ICR mice and exposed to sodium fluoride (0, 100, 500, and 1000 mu mol/L) for 24 h. The percentages of CD3+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD19+ B lymphocytes were decreased (P<0.05 or P<0.01) in the sodium fluoride-exposed cells. This finding was correlated with the alterations in expression levels of cytokine proteins and with evidence of cell-cycle arrest. Thus, protein expression levels of IL-2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta were decreased (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and IL-10 protein expression levels were increased (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The percentage of lymphocyte in G1 phase was significantly increased (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while expression levels of cyclin E/D and CDK2/4 were markedly decreased (P<0.05 or P<0.01). These findings demonstrate that sodium fluoride exposure suppresses splenic lymphocyte proliferation, which is represented by reducing populations and activation of splenic T and B lymphocytes. Alterations of cytokine protein expression and cell cycle arrest are the molecular basis of the sodium fluoride-suppressed splenic lymphocyte proliferation, while reduction of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes is the explanation of sodium fluoride-decreased splenic immune function in vitro.

In this study, a polysaccharide fraction from the edible mushroom Catathelasma ventricosum was purified using anion exchange and size exclusion chromatographies. The structure of the resulting polysaccharide, named CVP-1S, was characterized on the basis of partial acid hydrolysis, periodic acid oxidation, methylation analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, 1D/2D NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force spectroscopy. The results showed that CVP-1S is a heteropolysaccharide consisting of glucose (94.2%), galactose (3.51%) and fucose (1.3%) with a molecular weight of 1.5 x 10(4) Da. Its backbone is mainly linked by (1 -> 6)-beta-D-Glcp glycosidic bonds, and branches are attached to the backbone through 13-linked glycosidic bonds. CVP-1S was also found to have antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities in the streptozoicin-induced diabetic mouse model. From these results, we conclude that CVP-1S should receive further attention as a potential agent for the treatment and prevention of diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of S status on polish wheat plant response to Mn toxicity. Results showed that Mn stress inhibited plant growth, disturbed photosynthesis and induced oxidative stress. In response to Mn stress, polish wheat plant activated several detoxification mechanisms to counteract Mn toxicity, including enhanced antioxidant defense system, increased Mn distribution in the cell wall and up-regulated genes involved in S assimilation. Moderate S application was found to alleviate Mn toxicity mainly by sequestering excess Mn into vacuoles, inhibiting Mn translocation from roots to shoots, stimulating activities of antioxidant enzymes and enhancing GSH production via up-regulating genes involved in S metabolism. However, application of high level S to Mn-stressed plants did not significantly alleviated Mn toxicity likely due to osmotic stress. In conclusion, moderate S application is beneficial to polish wheat plant against Mn toxicity, S exerts its effects via stimulating the antioxidant defense system and regulating the translocation and subcellular distribution of Mn, in which processes GSH plays an indispensable role.

In general, the composition of these constituents in raw soybeans is affected by cultivation factors, such as sunlight; however, the relationship of the isoflavone and fatty acid profiles with cultivation factors is not well understood. This study evaluated the isoflavone and fatty acid profiles in soybeans grown under a maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system with different row spacings, and with changes in the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) transmittance. The effects of PAR on the isoflavone and fatty acid contents were found to be quadratic. Appropriate intercropping shading may reduce the bitterness of soybeans caused by soy aglycone and could improve their fatty acid composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study of dwarf polish wheat (DPW)roots, Cd uptake was inhibited by Zn, and Zn uptake was inhibited by Cd, suggesting that Cd and Zn interact antagonistically in this plant. A study of proteomic changes showed that Cd, Zn, and Cd+Zn stresses altered the expression of 206, 303, and 190 proteins respectively. Among these, 53 proteins were altered significantly in response to all these stresses (Cd, Zn, and Cd+Zn), whereas 58, 131, and 47 proteins were altered in response to individual stresses (Cd, Zn, and Cd+Zn, respectively). Sixty-one differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were induced in response to both Cd and Zn stresses; 33 proteins were induced in response to both Cd and Cd+Zn stresses; and 57 proteins were induced in response to both Zn and Cd+Zn stresses. These results indicate that Cd and Zn induce differential molecular responses, which result in differing interactions of Cd/Zn. A number of proteins that mainly participate in oxidation-reduction and GSH, SAM, and sucrose metabolisms were induced in response to Cd stress, but not Cd+Zn stress. This result indicates that these proteins participate in Zn inhibition of Cd uptake and ultimately cause Zn detoxification of Cd. Meanwhile, a number of proteins that mainly participate in sucrose and organic acid metabolisms and oxidation-reduction were induced in response to Zn stress but not Cd+Zn stress. This result indicates that these proteins participate in Cd inhibition of Zn uptake and ultimately cause the Cd detoxification of Zn. Other proteins induced in response to Cd, Zn, or Cd+Zn stress, participate in ribosome biogenesis, DNA metabolism, and protein folding/modification and may also participate in the differential defense mechanisms.

However, regeneration ability of the calli from wheat mature embryos is limited, thus hindering its application. To identify genes associated with the tissue culture response (TCR) of wheat, QTLs for callus induction from mature embryos and callus regeneration were detected using a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population derived from the cross between a synthetic hexaploid wheat genotype, SHW-L1 and a commercial cultivar Chuanmai 32. Three QTLs for callus rate were identified and they were located on chromosomes 1D, 5A, and 6D, respectively, with explained phenotypic variation ranging from 10.16 to 11.82 %. One QTL for differentiation rate was detected only with 10.96 % of the phenotypic variation explained. Two QTLs for emergence rate were identified and they were located on 3B and 4A, respectively, with 9.88 and 10.30 % of phenotypic variation. The results presented in this study with those reported previously indicated that group 1, 3, and 5 chromosomes are likely to play important roles in TCR of wheat.

A total of 90 fish were divided into three treatment groups with three replicates per treatment. Blood parrot were fed with diets containing 0 (control), 5 % (EP 5 %), and 15 % (EP 15 %) dry powder of golden apple snail egg for 60 days, and nine fish per group were sampled at 20, 40, and 60 days. No differences in survival of the fish among treatments were found throughout the experiment. The body coloration of Blood parrot was enhanced in the skin and caudal fin with increasing content of golden apple snail egg powder in the diet. At the end of the experiment, the carotenoid content in the caudal fin and the number of scale chromatophores of the fish fed dietary with EP were higher (P < 0.05) than those of the control group. The EP 15 % treated fishes showed a significant higher (P < 0.05) in the activities of SOD after 60 days, but we could not observe significant changes (P > 0.05) in CAT activities. Results demonstrated that golden apple snail eggs can be used as a colorant to promote the pigmentation efficacy of Blood parrot.

However, the number of known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling kernel length is limited. In the present study, we aimed to identify major QTLs for kernel length, as well as putative candidate genes that might influence kernel length in wild barley. Results: A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the barley cultivar Baudin (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare) and the long-kernel wild barley genotype Awcs276 (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) was evaluated at one location over three years. A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using 1,832 genome-wide diversity array technology (DArT) markers, spanning a total of 927.07 cM with an average interval of approximately 0.49 cM. Two major QTLs for kernel length, LEN-3H and LEN-4H, were detected across environments and further validated in a second RIL population derived from Fleet (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare) and Awcs276. In addition, a systematic search of public databases identified four candidate genes and four categories of proteins related to LEN-3H and LEN-4H. Conclusions: This study establishes a fundamental research platform for genomic studies and marker-assisted selection, since LEN-3H and LEN-4H could be used for accelerating progress in barley breeding programs that aim to improve kernel length.

The origin of BCSCs might have relationship to the development of normal mammary stem cells. BCSCs are believed to play a key role in the initiation, recurrence and chemo-/radiotherapy resistances of breast cancer. Therefore, elimination of BCSCs is crucial for breast cancer therapy. However, conventional chemo and radiation therapies cannot eradicate BCSCs effectively. Fortunately, nanotechnology holds great potential for specific and efficient anti-BCSCs treatment. Smart nanocarriers can distinguish BCSCs from the other breast cancer cells and selectively deliver therapeutic agents to the BCSCs. Emerging findings suggest that BCSCs in breast cancer could be successfully inhibited and even eradicated by functionalized nanomedicines. In this review, we focus on origin of BCSCs, strategies used to target BCSCs, and summarize the nanotechnology-based delivery systems that have been applied for eliminating BCSCs in breast cancer.

Eighty-eight strains representing seven species of Colletotrichum were obtained from rotten pepper fruits in Sichuan Province, China, and characterized according to morphology and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sequence. Fifty-two strains were chosen for identification by phylogenetic analyses of multi-locus sequences, including the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the beta-tubulin (TUB2), actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL) and GAPDH genes. Based on the combined datasets, the 88 strains were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. truncatum, C. scovillei, and C. brevisporum, and one new species was detected, described as Colletotrichum sichuanensis. Notably, C. siamense and C. scovillei were recorded for the first time as the causes of anthracnose in peppers in China. In addition, with the exception of C. truncatum, this is the first report of all of the other Colletotrichum species studied in pepper from Sichuan. The fungal species were all non-host-specific, as the isolates were able to infect not only Capsicum spp. but also Pyrus pyrifolia in pathogenicity tests. These findings suggest that the fungal species associated with anthracnose in pepper may inoculate other hosts as initial inoculum.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in regulation of cell senescence and important age-related signaling pathways. Here, we profiled the lncRNA and mRNA transcriptome of fruit flies at 7 day and 42 day during DR and fully-fed conditions, respectively. In general, 102 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 1406 differentially expressed coding genes were identified. Most informatively we found a large number of differentially expressed lncRNAs and their targets enriched in GO and KEGG analysis. We discovered some new aging related signaling pathways during DR, such as hippo signaling pathway-fly, phototransduction-fly and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum etc. Novel lncRNAs XLOC_ 092363 and XLOC_166557 are found to be located in 10 kb upstream sequences of hairy and ems promoters, respectively. Furthermore, tissue specificity of some novel lncRNAs had been analyzed at 7 day of DR in fly head, gut and fat body. Also the silencing of lncRNA XLOC_ 076307 resulted in altered expression level of its targets including Gadd45 (involved in FoxO signaling pathway). Together, the results implicated many lncRNAs closely associated with dietary restriction, which could provide a resource for lncRNA in aging and age-related disease field.

A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the Pb uptake characteristics and phytostabilization potential of the mining ecotype (ME) of Athyrium wardii and the corresponding non-mining ecotype (NME) when exposed to the Pb contaminated soils for 40 days. The ME was more tolerant to Pb than the NME when grown in Pb contaminated soil, and the ME demonstrated a greater Pb accumulation ability in roots (30.6-175.45 mg plant(-1)) than the NME (0.85-25.59 mg plant(-1)). The bioaccumulation coefficients of ME ranging from 52.02 to 83.16 were 3.24-8.89 times higher than those of the NME under Pb treatment, and the translocation factors of ME ranging from 0.022 to 0.079 were <1. The ME showed a higher capability in absorbing available Pb in soil than the NME. Furthermore, Pb remediation factors in roots of the ME were 6.93-15.35 times higher than those of the NME, and the plant effective number in roots of the ME ranging from 5.70 to 12.74 were lower than those of the NME. These results indicated that the ME showed a greater Pb uptake and phytostabilization potential than the NME, which enabled it as a worthy candidate for Pb phytostabilization.

It is characterized by tolerance to nutrition deficiency and strong seed dormancy and has potential to be useful in wheat breeding programs. To tap the advantages of Tibetan semiwild wheat in wheat breeding, we investigated nine agronomic traits including heading date (HD), anthesis date (AD), plant height (PHT), tiller number (TN), spike length (SL), spikelet number per spike (SNS), spikelet density (DS), grain weight per spike (GWS), and 1000-grain weight (TGW) in 186 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between Tibetan semiwild wheat 'Q1028' and common wheat 'Zhengmai 9023' (ZM 9023) across three growing seasons. Forty-five qualitative trait loci (QTLs) on 12 chromosomes were detected. The phenotypic variation explained by each of these QTL ranged from 4.7 to 29.7%. Positive alleles for 28 of these QTLs were derived from Q1028. Of these QTLs, 25 (56%) were detected in at least two growing seasons. Fifteen stable QTLs that were significant across all three growing seasons were identified. Novel QTLs derived from Q1028 were identified, such as QSd. sau7A for spikelet density, QTgw. sau-2B for TGW and QSns. sau-3D for SNS. Eleven QTL clusters were detected, including one on chromosome 5A flanked by the markers wPt-9094 and wPt-9513. This cluster consists of QTLs controlling HD, AN, PHT, SL, and spikelet density and explained 6.6 to 12.6% of the phenotypic variation in these traits. The QTLs and molecular markers identified here could be useful in fine mapping and breeding programs.

The resulting vector was transformed into tobacco, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed four types of gene combinations in the T-1 and T-2 generations: Gus only, Hyg only, Gus + Hyg, and untransformed lines. The intermediate region from the T-DNA of the right border of Hyg to the left border of Gus in the Hyg and Gus lines was not amplified. Genome walking confirmed that the Hyg and Gus T-DNA cassettes were independently inserted in different regions of the tobacco genome. Thus, the two T-DNA cassettes were integrated randomly as independent loci into the tobacco genome. The results of reverse transcription-PCR indicated that Hyg could normally be expressed in the roots, stems, and leaves of transgenic lines, and the resistance test showed that all Hyg transgenic lines could grow in the presence of 50 mg/L hygromycin. All Gus transgenic lines showed obvious blue coloration in enzyme activity tests, indicating that the Gus gene could be normally expressed in all the lines. Therefore, the super twin T-DNA vector (pTRIDT313-g) exhibits independent integration, heredity, and normal gene function from two T-DNA cassettes. This vector could be a useful and valuable tool in the production of marker-free transgenic lines. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Molecular Characterization of Different Triticum monococcum ssp monococcum Glu-A1(m)x Alleles	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						genetic resources; glutenin; cultivated einkorn; quality breeding	BREAD-MAKING QUALITY; HMW GLUTENIN SUBUNIT; SEED STORAGE PROTEINS; WHEAT-VARIETIES; DURUM-WHEAT; AESTIVUM L; A-GENOME; URARTU; GENES; SEQUENCE	High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are important seed storage proteins associated with bread-making quality in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). Variation in the Glu-A1x locus in common wheat is scare. Diploid Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum (2n = 2x = 14, A(m)A(m)) is the first cultivated wheat. In the present study, allelic variations at the Glu-A1(m)x locus were systematically investigated in 197 T. monococcum ssp. monococcum accessions. Out of the 8 detected Glu-A1(m)x alleles, 5 were novel, including Glu-A1(m)-b, Glu-A1(m)-c, Glu-A1(m)-d, Glu-A1(m)-g, and Glu-A1(m)-h. This diversity is higher than that of common wheat. Compared with 1Ax1 and 1Ax2*, which are present in common wheat, these alleles contained three deletions/insertions as well as some single nucleotide polymorphism variations that might affect the elastic properties of wheat flour. New variations in T. monococcum probably occurred after the divergence between A and A(m) and are excluded in common wheat populations. These allelic variations could be used as novel resources to further improve wheat quality.	[Li, H. Y.; Li, Z. L.; Zeng, X. X.; Zhao, L. B.; Chen, G.; Kou, C. L.; Ning, S. Z.; Yuan, Z. W.; Zheng, Y.

Two field experiments (manually transplanted rice with three indica hybrid rice cultivars and four N treatments, mechanically transplanted rice with eight N applications) were conducted in 2011 and 2012, to investigate the effects of RFA on rice yield and NUE. The results showed that RFA increased the total amount of N uptake in the plants and improved NUE when compared with the farmers' nitrogen fertilizer practices (FFP). The average increment in agronomy efficiency (AE), recovery efficiency (RE), and partial factor productivity for applied nitrogen (PFP) were 12.16, 10.91, and 6.01% for the mechanically transplanted rice and 30.81, 65.57, 6.18% for the manually transplanted rice. The main reason for the increase was the improvement in N concentration of the plant organs. For RFA, the grains per panicle was 12.15 and 7.59% higher than that of FFP, which was the main reason for the 6.19 and 3.33% increase in the yield of the manually and mechanically transplanted rice, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RFA strategy to be applied, and the jointing stage and 15 to 20 d after the jointing stage are the key periods for increasing the total amount of N uptake and grain yield; this strategy should be widely applied for indica hybrid rice production.

Identification and characterization of AP2/ERF transcription factors in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis)	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						AP2/ERF; moso bamboo (P. edulis); transcription factor; gene duplication	GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS; GENE FAMILY; ARABIDOPSIS; DNA	Bamboo belongs to subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family and is one of the most important non-timber forest resources in the world. The AP2/ERF superfamily is a group of plant specific transcription factors and plays important roles in the regulation of plant growth and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. By comprehensively analyzing the recently uncovered whole genome sequence and full length cDNA of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), 142 AP2/ERF transcription factors were identified and 53 among them are supported by full length cDNA. Compared with a recent report on the identification of 116 AP2/ERF transcription factors from the P. edulis genome, our study identified similar to 22% more AP2/ERF transcription factors. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence of the AP2/ERF domain assigned 23 genes to the AP2 family, 7 to the RAV family, 64 genes to the ERF subfamily, and 47 to the DREB subfamily, respectively. A soloist divergent from others was also found. The further multiple sequence alignment of the AP2/ERF domain, phylogenetic analysis and motif recognition were performed and revealed conserved residues, similarities and evolution relationship of members in each family or subfamily. The ortholog relationship and colinearity between P. edulis and O. sativa were analyzed. Additionally, 36 duplicates of orthologs in O. sativa genome were identified, which may originate from the whole genome duplication. Despite of the ortholog duplication, the gene numbers in groups A5, B3, and B6 are significantly lower than those in O. sativa and A. thaliana, and the A3 group is missing, suggesting potential gene loss of these groups during species divergence. This study provides more knowledge of AP/ERF genes in P. edulis.

The Ae. variabilis karyotype was poorly characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The FISH probe combination of pSc119.2, pTa71 and pTa-713 identified each of the 14 pairs of Ae. variabilis chromosomes. Our FISH ideogram was further used to detect an Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying stripe rust resistance in the background of wheat lines developed from crosses of the stripe rust susceptible bread wheat cultivar Yiyuan 2 with a resistant Ae. variabilis accession. Among the 15 resistant BC1F7 lines, three were 2S(v) + 4S(v) addition lines (2n = 46) and 12 were 2S(v)(2B) or 2S(v)(2D) substitution lines that were confirmed with SSR markers. SSR marker gwm148 can be used to trace 2S(v) in common wheat background. Chromosome 2S(v) probably carries gametocidal(Gc) gene(s) since cytological instability and chromosome structural variations, including non homologous translocations, were observed in some lines with this chromosome. Due to the effects of photo period genes, substitution lines 2S(v)(2D) and 2S(v)(2B) exhibited late heading with 2S(v)(2D) lines being later than 2S(v)(2B) lines. 2S(v)(2D) substitution lines were also taller and exhibited higher spikelet numbers and longer spikes.

Aquatic animals secrete different kinds of antimicrobial peptides which have antimicrobial activity towards microorganisms. NK-lysins, mature peptides produced by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, are comprised of 74-78 amino acid residues, demonstrating broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasites. In this study, three distinct NK-lysin mature peptide (mNKLs), transcripts (76 amino acid residues) cloned from the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) head kidney were ligated into plasmid vector pET-32a(+) to express the mNKLs fusion protein. The fusion protein was successfully expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) under optimized conditions. After purification by affinity column chromatography, the fusion protein was successfully cleaved by enterokinase and released the peptide mNKLs. Tricine-SDS-PAGE results showed that mNKLs (approximately 8.6 kDa) were successfully expressed. The purified peptide mNKLs exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli.

This study fabricated aligned poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/multiwalled carbon nanotube fibers by electrospinning. The Young's modulus and conductivity were significantly greater on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) fibers with 3% multiwalled carbon nanotubes compared to others. Topographical cues and conductivity were applied to investigate the combined effect on cardiomyocyte behavior. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured on the conductive fibers maintained their viability, induced cell elongation, and enhanced sarcomeric alpha-actinin and troponin I production in cardiomyocytes. The results indicate that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/multiwalled carbon nanotube composite fibers have great potential for cardiac tissue engineering.

This study aims to investigate the effect of dietary arginine supplementation on rat growth performance and urinary metabolome through H-1-NMR spectroscopy. Twenty rats were randomly assigned to two groups supplemented with 0% or 1.0% l-arginine for 4 weeks. Urine samples were analyzed through NMR-based metabolomics. Arginine supplementation significantly increased the urine levels of 4-aminohippurate, acetate, creatine, creatinine, ethanolamine, formate, hippurate, homogentisate, indoxyl sulfate, and phenylacetyglycine. Conversely, arginine decreased the urine levels of acetamide, -glucose, cirtulline, ethanol, glycine, isobutyrate, lactate, malonate, methymalonate, N-acetylglutamate, N-methylnicotinamide, and propionate. Results suggested that arginine can alter common systemic metabolic processes, including energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microbiota metabolism. Moreover, the results also imply a possible physiological role of the metabolism in mediating the arginine supplementation-supported growth of rats.

Specifically, this strategy is based on fusion between the capsid protein of a virus and a crucial effector molecule, such as a nuclease (e.g., staphylococcal nuclease, Barrase, RNase HI), lipase, protease, or single-chain antibody (scAb). In general, capsid proteins have a major role in viral integration and assembly, and the effector molecule used in CTVI functions to degrade viral DNA/RNA or interfere with proper folding of viral key proteins, thereby affecting the infectivity of progeny viruses. Interestingly, such a capsid-enzyme fusion protein is incorporated into virions during packaging. CTVI is more efficient compared to other antiviral methods, and this approach is promising for antiviral prophylaxis and therapy. This review summarizes the mechanism and utility of CTVI and provides some successful applications of this strategy, with the ultimate goal of widely implementing CTVI in antiviral research.

Using fieldwork data from 577 farmers and 20 water managers in Sichuan, we explore farmers' information processing regarding paying agricultural water fees via three sequential mental accounting processes, with the associated underlying principles and measures behind each process. We find that the information processing in three mental accounting scenarios related to the agricultural water fee elucidates farmers' observed behaviors in rural China. Generally, in the three mental accounting scenarios, two conditional intuitive expectations and nine conditional intuitive preferences are formed; however, the conditions of those expectations or preferences cannot be matched with the facts due to the reform of rural taxes and fees, the direct agricultural subsidy programs, and the internal attributes of agricultural water fee, which interpret those negative behaviors in rural China. Additionally, this paper offers a view into how previous policies create negative psychological externalities (such as farmers' psychological dependence on the government) through mental accounting to negatively influence agents' subsequent decision-making; it highlights the significance of underlying mental factors and information processing of negative behaviors in policymaking for managing or conserving common pool resources.

A pot experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of humic substances on growth, cadmium (Cd) accumulation and phytostabilization potential of the mining ecotype (ME) and the corresponding non-mining ecotype (NME) of Athyrium wardii (Hook.) grown in Cd-contaminated soils. The addition of the humic substances demonstrated great promotion for the growth and Cd uptake of ME. Both plant biomass and Cd concentration significantly increased with the increasing application of the humic substances up to 100 g kg(-1), beyond which no significant change of underground part biomass and Cd concentrations in underground part of A. wardii was observed. The maximum Cd concentration in underground part of ME was 180 mg kg(-1) when 150 g kg(-1) humic substances were applied. The ME showed greater Cd accumulation capability in underground part (0.47-0.68 mg plant(-1)) than that of NME (0.27-0.45 mg plant(-1)). Increasing bioaccumulation coefficient (BCF) values of A. wardii was observed with increasing application of the humic substances. The BCF values of ME were higher than those of NME. However, the use of the humic substances exhibited little impact on translocation factors (TFs) of ME, and the TF values of ME were less than NME. Furthermore, the application of the humic substances improved the remediation factors (RFs) of A. wardii. The RF values in underground part of ME ranging from 0.73 to 0.91 % were apparently higher than those of NME. These results indicated that the humic substances can be a potential candidate for enhancing the phytostabilization of A. wardii grown in Cd-contaminated soils.

In this study, seedlings of cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum were collected from two different climate-ecology regions of the western Sichuan Basin, China, to carry out reciprocal hybridizing and to study the Cd accumulation characteristics of F1 hybrids of S. nigrum. In the two pot experiments (high and low soil Cd concentration), the biomass and Cd extraction of reciprocal hybridizing F1 hybrids were higher than those of the parents, but the Cd content in different organs was lower than those of the parents. These results indicate that the biomass and Cd extraction of F1 hybrids show over-parent heterosis, and the Cd content shows hybrid weakness. In the field experiment, the variety of the biomass, Cd content, and Cd extraction of reciprocal hybridizing F1 hybrids were the same as the pot experiments, and the Cd extraction by shoots of reciprocal hybridizing F1 hybrids increased by 17.20 and 23.08 %, relative to the two higher parents. Therefore, the reciprocal hybridizing S. nigrum of different climate-ecology regions could be efficiently used to improve the phytoremediation ability of S. nigrum to Cd-contaminated soil.

Merr.]; Intercropping; Lodging resistance; Cellulose	SUCROSE-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; CALLOSE	Stem lodging is the most important constraint for soybean at seedling stage in maize soybean inter cropping in China. This study was conducted to determine whether cellulose accumulation and lodging resistance of soybean was affected by different cropping systems and soybean varieties with different shading tolerance at seedling stage. Three soybean varieties Nandou 032-4 (shade susceptible), Jiuyuehuang (moderately shade tolerant) and Nandou 12 (shade tolerant) were used to investigate the effect of intercropping on soybean lodging behavior and cellulose accumulation in stems and its relationship to lodging resistance. Shading by maize significantly reduced cellulose accumulation and the stem breaking strength of the soybean, which were significantly negatively correlated with the lodging rate. In the maize soybean intercropping system, shading inhibited sucrose transportation and degradation into cellulose in the soybean stem. Less content of cellulose in soybean stem at the seedling stage resulted in lodging in the intercropping system. Compared with shade susceptible varieties, Nandou 12 had higher cellulose accumulation and related enzyme activities in the stem, and thus the stem breaking strength and lodging resistance of the basal stem increased. The higher activities of sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose synthetase in the stem were associated with shade tolerance and lodging resistance. Thus, we concluded that the high physical strength and high cellulose contents of the stem of shade tolerant soybean reduced the rate of lodging in the maize soybean intercropping system.

In total, 780 female and 156 male duck breeders were randomly allotted to 2 treatments. Duck breeders were fed either a commercial diet (containing 3,000 IU/kg vitamin D-3) or the same diet plus a mixture of CX (6 mg/kg) and 25-OH-D-3 (0.069 mg/kg) for 40 wk. The antioxidant status of duck breeders, egg yolk, and ducklings; tibia quality of duck breeders and ducklings; and shell quality of breeder eggs were investigated. The total antioxidant capacity of breeder female liver (P = 0.028), breeder male testis (P = 0.049), egg yolk (P = 0.032), one-day-old duckling liver (P = 0.024), and one-day-old duckling yolk sac (P = 0.012) were increased by dietary supplementation of the mixture of CX and 25-OH-D-3. The inclusion of CX and 25-OH-D-3 decreased liver protein carbonyl of breeder females (P = 0.030), and liver malonaldehyde (P = 0.050) and protein carbonyl (P = 0.030) of breeder males. Yolk (P < 0.001), shank (P < 0.001), and yolk sac pigmentation (P < 0.001) of one-day-old ducklings were increased by the supplementation of the CX and 25-OH-D-3 mixture. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed in tibia quality or eggshell quality between treatments. In conclusion, the inclusion of the mixture of CX and 25-OH-D-3 in a diet sufficient in vitamin D-3 increased antioxidant status but not tibia quality of duck breeders and newly hatched ducklings.

It is reported extremely rarely in commercial poultry flocks and has not been reported in commercial domestic ducks to date, with domestic ducks reported to be moderately resistant to M. avium infection. Here, we report the outbreak of avian tuberculosis in commercial Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) flocks. Postmortem and histopathologic findings included nodules presenting in the visceral organs of ducks, and granulomas with central caseous necrosis surrounded by infiltrating lymphocytes. The M. avium pathogen was isolated and further identified by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and PCR based on insert sequence IS901 and the 16S rRNA gene. We highlight that avian tuberculosis not only has economic significance for the duck industry, but also presents a potential zoonotic hazard to humans.

We evaluated the individual and combined effect of the Fusarium toxins zearalenone and deoxynivalenol on the mouse brain. We examined brain weight, protein, antioxidant indicators, and apoptosis. After 3 and 5 days of treatment, increased levels of nitric oxide, total nitric oxide synthase, hydroxyl radical scavenging, and malondialdehyde were observed in the treatment groups. This was accompanied by reduced levels of brain protein, superoxide dismutase (apart from the low-dose zearalenone groups), glutathione, glutathione peroxidase activity, and percentage of apoptotic cells. By day 12, most of these indicators had returned to control group levels. The effects of zearalenone and deoxynivalenol were dose-dependent, and were synergistic in combination. Our results suggest that brain function is affected by zearalenone and deoxynivalenol. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ren, Z. H.; Deng, H. D.; Deng, Y. T.; Deng, J. L.; Zuo, Z.

Methods and ResultsThe Salmonella isolates were serotyped, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of disinfectants were determined. Results showed that the Salmonella isolates recovered from both chains were diverse, and the serotypes in each part of the production chain and between the two production chains were significantly different. In the chicken production chain, 19 different serotypes were recovered, while only five serotypes were found in the egg production chain. The isolates showed a high susceptibility to didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) but a low susceptibility to benzalkonium chloride (BC), benzalkonium bromide (BAB) and chlorhexidine (CHX). Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium were more resistant to BC and BAB. The qacE1 and qacF resistance genes were detected in 26<bold></bold>7 and 7<bold></bold>7% of the isolates respectively. The qacE1 gene was frequently found in Salmonella Derby and Salm.Enteritidis (P<0<bold></bold>05). ConclusionOur findings indicated that Salmonella was commonly present in both chains, and could serve as a critical vector in spreading disinfectant resistance associated with different serotypes. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study first demonstrated disinfectant resistance phenotypes and genotypes of serotyped Salmonella. The study highlights the need for monitoring the disinfectant resistance varied in different Salmonella serotypes.

Here, we characterized the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) and DNA of the H+-PPase gene ScHP1 in rye (Secale cereale L. 'Qinling'). We determined the subcellular localization of this gene and predicted the corresponding protein structure. We analysed the evolutionary relationship between ScHP1 and H+-PPase genes in other species, and did real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to explore the expression patterns of ScHP1 in rye plants subjected to N, P and K deprivation and to cold, high-salt and drought stresses. ScHP1 cDNA included a 2289 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 762 amino acid residues with 14 transmembrane domains. The genomic ScHP1 DNA was 4354 bp and contained eight exons and seven introns. ScHP1 was highly homologous with other members of the H+-PPase gene family. When the full-length ORF was inserted into the expression vector pA7-YFP, the fluorescent microscopy revealed that ScHP1-YFP fusion protein was located in the plasma membrane. Rye plants that were subjected to N deprivation, cold and high-salt stresses, ScHP1 expression was higher in the leaves than roots. Conversely, plants subjected to P and K deprivation and drought stress, ScHP1 expression was higher in the roots than leaves. Under all the investigated stress conditions, expression of ScHP1 was lower in the stem than in the leaves and roots. Our results imply that ScHP1 functions under abiotic stress response.

Previous research had revealed that chicken has only three bitter taste receptor genes (Tas2r1, Tas2r2 and Tas2r7). To better understand the genetic polymorphisms and importance of bitter taste receptor genes (Tas2rs) in chicken, here, we sequenced Tas2rs of 30 Sichuan domestic chickens and 30 Tibetan chickens. Thirteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including three nonsynonymous mutations (m.359G>C, m.503C>A and m.583A>G) were detected in Tas2r1 (m. is the abbreviation for mutation); three SNPs were detected in Tas2r2, but none of them were missense mutation; eight SNPs were detected in Tas2r7 including six nonsynonymous substitutions (m.178G>A, m.421A>C, m.787C>T, m.832G>T, m.907A>T and m.943G>A). Tajima's D neutral test indicates that there is no population expansion in both populations, and the size of the population is relatively stable. All the three networks indicate that red jungle fowls share haplotypes with domestic chickens. In addition, we found that haplotypes H1 and HE1 were positively associated with high-altitude adaptation, whereas haplotypes H4 and HE4 showed a negative correlation with high-altitude adaptation in Tas2rs. Although, chicken has only three Tas2rs, our results showed that both Sichuan domestic chickens and Tibetan chickens have abundant haplotypes in Tas2rs, especially in Tas2r7, which might help chickens to recognize a wide variety of bitter-tasting compounds.

In this study, we cloned and identified OASL in the Chinese goose for the first time. Goose 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (goOASL), including an ORF of 1527bp, encoding a protein of 508 amino acids. GoOASL protein contains 3 conserved motifs: nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) domain, and 2 ubiquitin-like (UBL) repeats. The tissue distribution profile of goOASL in 2-week-old gosling and adult goose were identified by Real-Time quantitative PCR, which revealed that the highest level of goOASL mRNA transcription was detected in the blood of adult goose and gosling. The mRNA transcription level of goOASL was upregulated in all tested tissues of duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV)-infected 3-day-old goslings, compared with control groups. Furthermore, using the stimulus Poly(I: C), ODN2006, R848, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as the viral pathogens DTMUV, H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), and gosling plague virus (GPV) to treat goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 6h, goOASL transcripts level was significantly upregulated in all treated groups. To further investigate the antiviral activity of goOASL, pcDNA3.1(+)-goOASL-His plasmid was constructed, and goOASL was expressed by the goose embryo fibroblast cells (GEFs) transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-goOASL-His. Our research data suggested that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication (viral copies and viral titer) in GEFs was significantly reduced by the overexpression of goOASL protein. These data were meaningful for the antiviral immunity research of goose and shed light on the future prevention of NDV in fowl.

Griseb.). The aqueous leaf extracts from the crofton weed drastically inhibited the root growth of alligator weed at 0.04 g.mL(-1) concentration. There was no root or few roots only at the bottom stem node, when the concentration reached to 0.08 g.mL(-1). These extracts also changed the physiological and biochemical parameters in treated alligator weed. The chlorophyll content, the root activity and the acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity were significantly decreased. While the superoxide anion (O-2(-)), the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, peroxidase (POD) activity and shikimic acid content were significantly increased, these reflect the stressful conditions. Thus, the main allelopathic effects of crofton weed were on the cell structure, cell membrane and the activity of key enzymes in amino acid biosynthesis. Our data also showed that crofton weed may be used in bio-control of alligator weed.	[Chen, H. B.; Yang, C. P.; Wang, W. M.; Gong, G.

Increasing evidence has proven the beneficial immunomodulating activity of YPF. However, the action mechanism(s) of it is not known. Here, we explored the immunomodulatory activity of unfermented Yupingfeng polysaccharides (UYP) and fermented Yupingfeng polysaccharides (FYP) obtained using Rhizopus oligosporus SH in weaning Rex rabbits. The results showed that both UYP and FYP exhibited notable growth-promoting and immune-enhancing activities, improvement of the intestinal flora homeostasis, and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and functionality. Notably, compared with UYP, FYP effectively enhanced average daily gain, organ indices, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TLR2, and TLR4 mRNA levels in spleen, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma protein concentrations in serum, and TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expressions in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Moreover, FYP exhibited greater beneficial effects in improving the intestinal flora, including augment flora diversity and the abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, reduction the abundance of Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. in the GIT, particularly the foregut and maintaining the intestinal barrier integrity and functionality by upregulating zonula occludens 1, claudin, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, trefoil factor, and epidermal growth factor mRNA levels in the jejunum and ileum. Our results indicated the immunoenhancement effect of FYP is superior over that of UYP, which is probably related with the amelioration of the intestinal microflora and intestinal barrier in the foregut.

The objective of this study was to investigate the apoptosis of thymus and bursa of Fabricius in broilers fed with AFB(1). Two hundred Avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups of 50 each, namely control group and three AFB(1) groups fed with 0.15 mg, 0.3 mg, and 0.6 mg AFB(1)/kg diet, respectively. In this study, flow cytometer and immunohistochemical approaches were used to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells and the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3. The results showed that consumption of AFB(1) diets results in increased percentage of apoptotic cells and increased expression of Caspase-3 in both thymus and bursa of Fabricius. The expression of Bax was increased and the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased in the thymus, but no significant changes in Bax and Bcl-2 expression were observed in the bursa of Fabricius when broilers fed with AFB(1). These findings suggest that adverse effects of AFB(1) on thymus and bursa of Fabricius in broilers were confirmed by increased apoptotic cells and abnormal expression of Caspase-3.

The effects of two OKGM modified products on the immune parameters and expressions of toll-like receptor 22 (TLR22), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interferon regulatory factors 7 (IRF7) genes in Schizothorax prenanti were determined. The alternative haemolytic complement (ACH50) activity was found to be significantly increased by the OKGMS diets. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) level was significantly enhanced by the OKGMS diets. The lysozyme activity was significantly increased by both OKGMS and A-OKGM diets. The superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity in fish fed with all doses of OKGMS diets was significantly higher than that in fish fed with basal diet. The glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in fish fed with 0.8% and 1.6% A-OKGM diets was significantly higher than control group. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level was significantly decreased by both OKGMS and A-OKGM diets. The 0.8% A-OKGM diet significantly up-regulated TLR22 gene expression in the head kidney and spleen. TLR22 gene expression was significantly promoted by all OKGMS diets in the mesonephros and liver. The MyD88 mRNA level in 1.6% A-OKGM group significantly increased in the head kidney. The low dose of OKGMS significantly induced the MyD88 gene expression in the mesonephros, gut and liver, while 0.8% A-OKGM group also showed a significantly enhanced MyD88 mRNA expression in the gut. High dose of OKGMS significantly increased the IRF7 mRNA expression in the mesonephros and spleen. Fish fed with low dose of A-OKGM showed significantly higher expression of IRF7 in the gut and liver. Present study suggested that OKGMS and A-OKGM can act as immunostimulant to improve the immune indexes and up-regulate the immune-related gene expressions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon Melia) were fed with six diets containing gradual levels of histidine for 8 weeks. The results firstly demonstrated that histidine deficiency caused increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and severe oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation) in the gills of fish, which was partially due to the decreased glutathione (GSH) content and antioxidant enzyme activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)]. Further investigations indicated that histidine deficiency caused depressions of those antioxidant enzyme activities are related to the down-regulation of corresponding antioxidant enzyme genes and the related signaling factor Nrf2 mRNA levels. Meanwhile, histidine deficiency induced DNA fragmentation via up-regulation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 expressions that referring to the down regulation of TOR and S6K mRNA levels. Furthermore, His deficiency down-regulated claudin-b, claudin-c, claudin-3, claudin-12, claudin-15, occludin and ZO-1 transcription in fish gills. These effects were partially related to the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and related signaling factor nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF-kappa B P65) mRNA levels, and the down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor 1 beta (TGF-beta 1) and related signaling factor I kappa B alpha mRNA levels. Excessive histidine exhibited negative effects that were similar to histidine deficiency, whereas the optimal histidine levels reversed those negative effects. Taken together, our results showed that histidine deficiency or excess impaired the structural integrity of fish gill by disrupted fish antioxidant defenses and regulating the expression of tight junction protein, cytokines, apoptosis, antioxidant enzymes, NF-kappa B p65, I kappa B alpha, TOR, Nrf2, Keapi and apoptosis-related genes in the fish gills.

JIAN; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; DISEASE RESISTANCE	Our study investigated the effect of dietary methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA) on growth and immunity (head kidney, spleen and skin) of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 630 grass carp (259.70 +/- 0.47 g) were fed graded levels of MHA (0, 2.4, 4.4, 6.4, 8.5 and 10.5 g/kg diet) and one DL-methionine (DLM) group (6.4 g/kg diet) for 8 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila for 14 days. The results indicated that optimal MHA increased lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, complement 3 (C3), C4 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) contents and up-regulated mRNA levels of liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2, hepcidin (head kidney), beta-defensin1 in the immune organs (P < 0.05), suggesting that MHA could enhance antimicrobial ability of fish. Meanwhile, optimal MHA enhanced the immune function of immune organs via down-regulating pro inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels and up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels, which might be attributed to the down-regulation of nuclear factor kappa B p65, c-Rel, I kappa B kinase beta, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase, eIF4E-binding protein1 (4E-BP1) and 4E-BP2 mRNA levels and up-regulation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and target of rapamycin mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In addition, optimal MHA improved cellular structure integrity of immune organs via repressing death receptor and mitochondria pathways induced apoptosis, which might be related to the down-regulation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, optimal MHA improved cellular structure integrity of immune organs via elevating glutathione contents, antioxidant enzymes activities and corresponding isoforms mRNA levels to attenuate oxidative damage, which might be to the up regulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 mRNA levels and down-regulation of Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Besides, optimal MHA improved intercellular structure integrity of immune organs via up-regulating the mRNA levels of intercellular tight junctions-related genes, which might be owing to the down-regulation of myosin light chain kinase mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MHA exerted a positive effect on the immune function and structural integrity of immune organs in fish. Furthermore, according to the positive effect, MHA was superior to DLM in grass carp. However, based on the growth performance, the efficacy of MHA relative to DLM was 97%. Finally, on the premise of the basal diet containing 4.01 g/kg methionine, the optimal MHA supplementation levels based on feed intake, PWG, defense against skin hemorrhage and lesion, 12 and ACP activities, IgM content, against malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and ROS in the head kidney of young grass carp were 5.07, 5.21, 5.76, 5.90, 5.88, 5.80, 6.22, 5.68 and 6.85 g/kg diet, respectively.

This fungus can produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and a very large amount of IAA accumulates in wheat head tissues during the first few days of infection by F. graminearum. Using liquid culture conditions, we have determined that F. graminearum can use tryptamine (TAM) and indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) as biosynthetic intermediates to produce IAA. It is the first time that F. graminearum is shown to use the L-tryptophan-dependent TAM and IAN pathways rather than the indole-3-acetamide or indole-3-pyruvic acid pathways to produce IAA. Our experiments also showed that exogenous IAA was metabolized by F. graminearum. Exogenous IAA, TAM, and IAN inhibited mycelial growth; IAA and IAN also affected the hyphae branching pattern and delayed macroconidium germination. IAA and TAM had a small positive effect on the production of the mycotoxin 15-ADON while IAN inhibited its production.

This study was to further investigate the role of NO in spermidine (Spd)-induced drought tolerance associated with antioxidant defense in leaves of white clover (Trifolium repens) under drought stress induced by -0.3 MPa polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) solution. A hydroponic growth method was used for cultivating plants in a controlled growth chamber for 30-33 days until the second leaves were fully expanded. Two relative independent experiments were carried out in our study. One is that exogenous application of Spd or an NO donor (sodium nitroprusside (SNP)) significantly improved drought tolerance in whole plants, as demonstrated by better phenotypic appearance, increased relative water content (RWC), and decreased electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in leaves as compared to untreated plants. For another detached leaf experiment, PEG induced an increase in the generation of NO in cells and significantly improved activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). These responses could be blocked by pre-treatment with a Spd biosynthetic inhibitor, dicyclohexyl amine (DCHA), and then reversed by application of exogenous Spd. Meanwhile, PEG induced up-regulation of activities and gene transcript levels of corresponding antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) to varying degrees, while these effects were partially blocked by pre-treatment with DCHA, the scavenger of NO, the inhibitors of NR or NOS. In addition, Spd-induced antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expression also could be effectively inhibited by an NO scavenger as well as inhibitors of NR and NOS. These findings suggest that both Spd and NO can enhance drought tolerance. Spd was involved in drought stress-activated NR and NOS pathways associated with NO release, which mediated antioxidant defense and thus contributed to drought tolerance in white clover.

The identification and characterization of thermotolerance is restricted by the plant growth environment and growth stage. In this study, four genotypes of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with known field thermotolerance were evaluated under normal and HTs at the seedlings stage in a growth cabinet with 11 physiological, biochemical, and phenotypic assays. Consistent with previous field observations, the thermotolerance could be identified by genotype differences at the seedling stage under HT in a growth cabinet. Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed on seedlings of two contrasting cotton genotypes after 4 and 8 h of HT exposure. Gene ontology analysis combined with BLAST annotations revealed a large number of HT-induced differentially expressed genes (4,698) that either exhibited higher expression levels in the heat-tolerant genotype (Nan Dan Ba Di Da Hua) compared with the heat-sensitive genotype (Earlistaple 7), or were differentially expressed only in Nan Dan Ba Di Da Hua. These genes encoded mainly protein kinases, transcription factors, and heat-shock proteins, which were considered to play key roles in thermotolerance in upland cotton. Two heat-shock transcription factor genes (homologs of AtHsfA3, AtHsfC1) and AP2/EREBP family genes (homologs of AtERF20, AtERF026, AtERF053, and AtERF113) were identified as possible key regulators of thermotolerance in cotton. Some of the differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Our findings provide candidate genes that could be used to improve thermotolerance in cotton cultivars.

Although highly reflective materials can reduce the heat gain of the target building by specular reflection, they also increase the heat gain of the surrounding buildings owing to the fact that the reflected radiation is only transferred, not eliminated. In this situation, this study considers retro-reflective materials, which can improve the building temperature conditions by reflecting the solar radiation back in the opposite direction. Comparative experiments were conducted without any conditioning in summer, and the experimental results show that due to the covering of the retro-reflective materials, the peak temperatures of the indoor air and the inner surfaces were decreased up to 8 degrees C and 10 degrees C, while the outer surface peak temperature was reduced up to 25 degrees C. Through a comparison of the walls in different orientations, the top, south and east walls were found to be better choices for covering with the retro-reflective materials. To explore the influence of retro-reflective materials on the inner surface heat flow, a one-dimensional wall heat transfer model was built for four typical walls with an indoor constant temperature of 25 degrees C, and this model was verified by the experimental data. The numerical results showed that, due to the addition of the retro-reflective materials, the inner surface heat flow can be reduced by more than 30%, and the outer surface peak temperature can be reduced by 10-20 degrees C, clearly demonstrating that retro-reflective materials can reduce the outer surface temperature effectively.

This method derives the optimal plan based on the line segment (the chord) that connects the highest and lowest points of the curve or surface that corresponds to the nonlinear stress-life relationship, and consequently, it transforms the problem of designing the optimal plan of an ALT with a univariate or multivariate nonlinear stress-life relationship to the problem of designing the optimal plan of an ALT with a univariate linear stress-life relationship. The theoretical analysis and examples show that compared with the methods that find the optimal plan based on the nonlinear stress-life relationship itself, the proposed method can simplify the design problem and obtain better plans.

The objective was to determine the effects of immunocastration on splenic reproduction- and immunity-related gene expressions, and serum cytokine profiles in rams. Forty rams were randomly allocated into three groups: control (n = 14); surgically castrated (n = 13); or immunized (n = 13) against 100 mu g D-Lys6-GnRH-tandem-dimer peptide conjugated to ovalbumin in Specol adjuvant at 6 months of age (with a booster 2 months later). Blood samples (for hormone and immune cytokine profiles) were collected at 1-month intervals until rams were slaughtered (10 months). Compared to intact controls, anti-GnRH immunization reduced (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of LH, FSH, and testosterone. Reduced testosterone abrogated its inhibitor feedback effect on the synthesis of GnRH in spleen, as evidenced by increased (P < 0.05) protein content and mRNA expressions of GnRH, and simultaneously decreased (P < 0.05) mRNA expressions of androgen receptor in spleen. In parallel with the increased GnRH production in spleen, the mRNA expressions of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as lymphocyte marker CD4, CD8 and CD19 molecules were increased (P < 0.05) in spleen. Consistently, serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha were increased (P < 0.05) in rams following immunization. Similarly, deprivation of testosterone by surgical castration also increased (P < 0.05) GnRH and thus immune cytokine expressions in spleen. Collectively, our data suggested that immunocastration increased GnRH production in spleen by abrogating the inhibitory feedback effects from testosterone, consequently improving the immune markers of spleen and serum immune cytokines in rams.

Cytokines are important mediators of the immune system. T-cell subsets play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of dietary AFB(1) on the cytokines expression and T-cell subsets in the cecal tonsil of broiler chickens throughout a 21-day experimental period. One hundred and fifty six one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into control group (0 mg AFB(1)/kg feed) and AFB(1) group (0.6 mg pure AFB(1)/kg feed). At 7, 14 and 21 days of age, the levels of seven cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) mRNA expression as well as the proportions of T-cell subsets (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+ CD8+) by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry methods were assessed in the cecal tonsils. The levels of the seven cytokines mRNA expression and the percentages of T-cell subsets significantly decreased at 14 and 21 days of age in the AFB(1) group compared with the control group. However, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was not significantly changed. These results demonstrate that 0.6 mg/kg AFB(1) dietary exposure reduced the levels of cytokines mRNA expression and the percentages of T-cell subsets in the cecal tonsils of broiler chickens, suggesting that the cell-mediated immunity of cecal tonsils might be impaired in broilers.

Twelve Yorkshire boars were paired by age and allocated to one of two dietary treatments composed of total lysine levels of 0.64%(T1) and 0.96% (T2), with the lysine: methionine: threonine: tryptophan: valine ratio in the diets set to 100:27:73:19:69 through the addition of synthetic amino acids. Semen was collected twice weekly (phase 1, 1-12 wk); every other day (phase 2, 13-16 wk); twice weekly (phase 3, 17-26 wk); and daily (phase 4, 27-28 wk). Semen was collected from boars during phase 3 and used to inseminate 64 multiparous sows. Our results showed that sperm concentration and total sperm cells were greater in boars in T2 than in boars in T1 in phases 2 and 4 (P <0.05). Sperm motility parameters, morphologically normal sperm, and acrosome integrity in T2 boars were greater than those in Ti boars (P < 0.05) during the experiment. Free amino acid concentrations in seminal plasma increased in T2 boars (P < 0.05). Furthermore, sows inseminated with semen collected from T2 boars gave birth to more live piglets than those inseminated with semen collected from T1 boars (P= 0.04). In conclusion, supplementation of boar diet with amino acids improves sperm quality, and subsequently increases fertilization capacity and the number of live piglets.

The Selx knockdown and control cells were further exposed to H2O2, and cell viability, cell apoptosis rate, and the expression levels of mRNA and protein of apoptosis-related genes were detected. The results showed that vector targeting the 3'-UTR of Selx successfully silenced mRNA or protein expression of SelX in LO2 cells. Selx knockdown resulted in decreased cell viability, increased percentage of early apoptotic cells, decreased Bcl2A1 and Bcl-2 expression, and increased phosphorylation of P38 in LO2 cells. When Selx knockdown LO2 cells were exposed to H2O2, characteristics of H2O2-induced cell dysfunctions were further exacerbated. Taken together, our findings suggested that SelX played important roles in protecting LO2 cells against oxidative damage and reducing H2O2-induced apoptosis in liver cells.

However, the restoration and control of desertified land in these areas have not received enough attention as in arid and semi-arid areas, and little is known about the vegetation community and soil microbiological properties during the ecological restoration in Alpine cold semi-humid desertified areas. In this paper, the method of fencing, removing grazing and planting Tamarix ramosissima was taken as the measure for ecological restoration of Alpine-cold desertified land in Northwest Sichuan. The results showed ecological restoration resulted in significant improvement in the height, coverage, density, biomass, and diversity of vegetation communities, numbers of soil microorganisms (including bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi). Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and urease, invertase and protease activities increased after the restoration, especially in the 0-20 cm layer. These trends increased with increasing restoration age but decreased with increasing soil depth. Ecological restoration by fencing, non-grazing and planting T. ramosissima is therefore considered an effective and applicable measure to restore vegetation and soil microbiological properties and control desertification in the Northwest Sichuan, and is recommended for adoption in Alpine-cold semi-humid sandy areas on a large scale.

Growth and photosynthetic responses in Jatropha curcas L. seedlings of different provenances to watering regimes	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						carotenoids; chlorophyll fluorescence; gas exchange; water-use efficiency	DROUGHT STRESS; CONDUCTANCE; LIMITATIONS; EUCALYPTUS; FOOTPRINT; RECOVERY; YIELD	Seedlings from four provenances of Jatropha curcas were subjected to 80, 50, and 30% of soil field capacity in potted experiments in order to study their responses to water availability. Our results showed that with the decline of soil water availability, plant growth, biomass accumulation, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration rate (E) decreased, whereas leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), leaf pigment contents, and stomatal limitation value increased, while maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry was not affected. Our findings proved that stomatal limitation to photosynthesis dominated in J. curcas under low water availability. The increase of delta C-13 should be attributed to the decrease in g(s) and E under the lowest water supply. J. curcas could adapt to low water availability by adjusting its plant size, stomata closure, reduction of E, increasing delta C-13, and leaf pigment contents. Moreover, effects of provenance and the interaction with the watering regime were detected in growth and many physiological parameters. The provenance from xeric habitats showed stronger plasticity in the plant size than that from other provenances under drought. The variations may be used as criteria for variety/provenance selection and improvement of J. curcas performance.	[Yin, C. Y.; Pang, X.

The gene encoding this enzyme is Wx and in this study, eight novel Wx alleles were identified in three diploid Taeniatherum species. The variability of these alleles was evaluated, and their nucleotide sequences were compared with those of homologous alleles from wheat. Two types of Taeniatherum Wx alleles were detected in three diploid species Ta. caput-medusae, Ta. asperum, and Ta. crinitum. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Taeniatherum Wx alleles were more closely related to Wx alleles from Aegilops species with C, D, M, and U genomes than to Wx alleles of other species. These alleles represent a potential genetic resource that may be useful in wheat breeding programs.	[Dai, S. F.; Jiang, J. Q.; Jia, Y. N.; Xue, X. F.; Liu, D. C.; Wei, Y. M.; Zheng, Y. L.; Yan, Z.

The obtained HAp/yeast biomass composites were characterized by various techniques, including SEM, EDX, XRD, TGA, FTIR, XPS and fluorescence detection, respectively. It was found that the yeast cells were wrapped by the well-dispersed HAp, and more functional groups (such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino) on yeast surface were exposed. Also, varying factors that may affect the adsorption efficiency of HAp/yeast biomass composites, such as solution pH, reaction temperature and time, have been carefully investigated respectively. Remarkably, more than 99% of Pb2+ can be removed by the HAp/yeast biomass composites. Evidence from FTIR and XPS analysis revealed that the higher removal efficiency should be ascribed to the synergetic effect of synthesized HAp and more functional groups exposed on yeast surface.

In China, common wheat landraces are potential sources of disease and abiotic stress resistance genes for wheat improvement. Yilongtuomai (YL), a wheat landrace from Yilong County, Sichuan Province, shows high levels of resistance against most Chinese Pst races. In this study, the resistance of YL to stripe rust disease was examined in detail. Parent strains, YL and Taichung 29, a variety susceptible to Pst race CYR32, and their F-1, F-2, and F-2:3 offspring, were inoculated with CYR32 during the seedling stage in the field or adult-plant stage in the greenhouse. Results indicated that resistance to CYR32 in YL is conferred by a single dominant gene, designated YrYL. The segregating F-2 population (352 plants), was analyzed in terms of its resistance locus using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), resistance gene analog polymorphisms (RGAPs), and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP). A linkage group of 6 SSRs, 2 RGAPs, and 1 SRAP was constructed for the YrYL gene. Using the identified SSRs associated with physical mapping of RGAP using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic stocks, the YrYL gene was localized to the short arm of chromosome 7D. The gene was flanked by 1 SSR marker, Xbarc92, and 1 RGAP marker, CLRRfor/Ptokin4, at genetic distances of 5.35 and 9.86 cM, respectively. The YrYL gene was compared to other stripe rust resistance genes reported on chromosome 7D by evaluating its reaction patterns to CYR32 and its pedigree relationship. Our results suggest that the YrYL gene is a new stripe rust resistance gene.

We evaluated the spatial variability of soil total nitrogen (TN) and available nitrogen (AN) in the Fujiang River Valley, a typical hilly region composed of low, medium and high hills in the central Sichuan Basin, China. We considered the two N forms at single hill, landscape and valley scales using a combined method of classical statistics, geostatistics and a geographic information system. The spatial patterns and grading areas of soil TN and AN were different among hill types and different scales. The percentages of higher grades of the two nitrogen forms decreased from low, medium to high hills. Hill type was a major factor determining the spatial variability of the two nitrogen forms across multiple scales in the valley. The main effects of general linear models indicated that the key affecting factors of soil TN and AN were hill type and fertilization at the single hill scale, hill type and soil type at the landscape scale, and hill type, slope position, parent material, soil type, land use and fertilization at the valley scale. Thus, the effects of these key factors on the two soil nitrogen forms became more significant with upscaling. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of various combined organic acid treatments during the cutting process on the microbial decontamination of chicken drumsticks. Changes in naturally occurring microflora before and after treatment were analyzed through microbiological counting and polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Results revealed that the most effective treatments obtained through the combination of orthogonal design and sensory evaluation were as follows: 0.5% lactic acid (w/v), 1% citric acid (w/v), and spray-washing for 30 s. Microbiological counting results and PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the microbial load on the chicken drumsticks decreased significantly after the treatment was administered. The treatment did not affect the physicochemical properties and sensory attributes of the quick-frozen chicken drumsticks during storage. Therefore, the proposed technique could be used to improve the microbial quality of chicken drumsticks. The technique could also be employed in poultry meat production chains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the population structure, genetic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium decay distance of 362 important inbred lines collected from the breeding program of Southwest China were characterized using the MaizeSNP50 BeadChip with 56,110 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results: With respect to population structure, two (Tropical and Temperate), three (Tropical, Stiff Stalk and non-Stiff Stalk), four [ Tropical, group A germplasm derived from modern U.S. hybrids (PA), group B germplasm derived from modern U.S. hybrids (PB) and Reid] and six (Tropical, PB, Reid, Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic, PA and North) subgroups were identified. With increasing K value, the Temperate group showed pronounced hierarchical structure with division into further subgroups. The Genetic Diversity of each group was also estimated, and the Tropical group was more diverse than the Temperate group. Seven low-genetic-diversity and one high-genetic-diversity regions were collectively identified in the Temperate, Tropical groups, and the entire panel. SNPs with significant variation in allele frequency between the Tropical and Temperate groups were also evaluated. Among them, a region located at 130 Mb on Chromosome 2 showed the highest genetic diversity, including both number of SNPs with significant variation and the ratio of significant SNPs to total SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium decay distance in the Temperate group was greater (2.5-3 Mb) than that in the entire panel (0.5-0.75 Mb) and the Tropical group (0.25-0.5 Mb). A large region at 30-120 Mb of Chromosome 7 was concluded to be a region conserved during the breeding process by comparison between S37, which was considered a representative tropical line in Southwest China, and its 30 most similar derived lines. Conclusions: For the panel covered most of widely used inbred lines in Southwest China, this work representatively not only illustrates the foundation and evolution trend of maize breeding resource as a theoretical reference for the improvement of heterosis, but also provides plenty of information for genetic researches such as genome-wide association study and marker-assisted selection in the future.

This study attempted to characterize CRISPR-Cas systems in the disease-causing agent, Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer). The CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes and CRISPR-cas loci extensively exist in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. However, the structure characteristics of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems remains to be elucidated due to the limited availability of genomic data. Results: To identify the structure and components associated with CRISPR-Cas systems in R. anatipestifer, we performed comparative genomic analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems in 25 R. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that most of the R. anatipestifer strains (20/25) that were analyzed have two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). CRISPR1 was shown to be flanked on one side by cas genes, while CRISPR2 was designated as an orphan. The other analyzed strains harbored only one locus, either CRISPR1 or CRISPR2. The length and content of consensus direct repeat sequences, as well as the length of spacer sequences associated with the two loci, differed from each other. Only three cas genes (cas1, cas2 and cas9) were located upstream of CRISPR1. CRISPR1 was also shown to be flanked by a 107 bp-long putative leader sequence and a 16 nt-long anti-repeat sequence. Combined with analysis of spacer organization similarity and phylogenetic tree of the R. anatipestifer strains, CRISPR arrays can be divided into different subgroups. The diversity of spacer organization was observed in the same subgroup. In general, spacer organization in CRISPR1 was more divergent than that in CRISPR2. Additionally, only 8 % of spacers (13/153) were homologous with phage or plasmid sequences. The cas operon flanking CRISPR1 was observed to be relatively conserved based on multiple sequence alignments of Cas amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic analysis associated with Cas9 showed Cas9 sequence from R. anatipestifer was closely related to that of Bacteroides fragilis and formed part of the subtype II-C subcluster. Conclusions: Our data revealed for the first time the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems. The illumination of structural features of CRISPR-Cas system may assist in studying the specific mechanism associated with CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in R. anatipestifer.

Gagnep. var. craveniana (S.Y.Hu) Lo (TSG) is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection and has anti-bacterial and anti-ulcer activity. Our study investigated the bactericidal effects of TSG and its major component, palmatine, against a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strain isolated from pig and the standard strain H. pylori SS1 in vitro and in vivo. Methods: H. pylori was isolated from pig and named H. pylori SCYA201401. For in vitro experiments, the inhibitory activity of TSG and palmatine against H. pylori SCYA201401 and H. pylori SS1 were tested by use of the agar cup diffusion technique. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined from the absence of H. pylori colonies on agar plates. Time-kill curves were used to evaluate bactericidal activity; the average number of colonies was calculated at 0 to 48 h after liquid incubation, with concentrations of drugs at 0.5, 1, and 2 x MIC. For in vivo experiments, H. pylori SCYA201401-infected mice were randomly divided into TSG, palmatine, triple therapy (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin), blank control, and model groups. The eradication ratios were determined by use of rapid urease tests and bacterial culture. Results: In vitro, the MIC and MBC of TSG against H. pylori SCYA201401 and SS1 were both 6250 mu g/mL, whereas palmatine against H. pylori SCYA201401 was 6.25 mu g/mL and against H. pylori SS1 was 3.12 mu g/mL. The time-kill curves showed a dose-dependent, progressive decline in the numbers of viable bacteria up to 40 h. In vivo, the eradication ratios in the TSG and palmatine groups of mice were 80 and 50 % compared with 70 % in the triple-therapy group. Conclusion: TSG and its major component, palmatine, have bactericidal activity against H. pylori in vitro and in vivo. The possibility that TSG or palmatine can be effective in the treatment of human and animals H. pylori infection deserves investigation.

Genomic imprinting is considered to be the underlying mechanism establishing the post-zygotic hybridization barrier. We characterized disrupted seed development in reciprocal crosses between a diploid Japonica rice and a tetraploid Indica rice. Triploid seeds from these crosses had aborted development and could not germinate in soil but could be rescued in culture medium with significantly more seeds developing to seedlings in the 4n x 2n (a (TM) Euro-a (TM),) cross with excess maternal genomes than in the 2n x 4n cross with excess paternal genome. Consistent with previous findings, precocious endosperm cellularization and bigger embryos were observed in the seeds from the maternal excess cross, whereas absence of cellularization and arrested globular embryos were found in the seeds from the paternal excess cross, supporting the idea that endosperm cellularization is an important transition for embryo development. Moreover, we found that starch granules were persistently deposited in the pericarp parenchyma cells of the paternal excess cross, while pericarp starch gradually decreased and relocated to the developing endosperm in balanced and maternal excess crosses in which cellularization and starch deposition occur in endosperm, suggesting that parental genome balance influences pericarp starch relocation via cellularization and starch deposition. Loss of imprinting, or altered expression of imprinted genes and epigenetic regulators, OsFIE2 and OsMET1b were observed, implying the potential role of imprinting and epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the differential parental genome dosage effects on endosperm development. Our results support the hypothesis that the maternal genome dosage promotes endosperm cellularization and the paternal genome dosage delays or inhibits cellularization via contributing different sets of imprinted genes.

To explore these differences, we determined the genome-wide landscape of DNA methylomes and their relationship with the mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes of the oxidative muscle psoas major (PMM) and the glycolytic muscle longissimus dorsi (LDM). We observed the hypo-methylation of sub-telomeric regions. A high mitochondrial content contributed to fast replicative senescence in PMM. The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in promoters (478) and gene bodies (5,718) were mainly enriched in GTPase regulator activity and signaling cascade-mediated pathways. Integration analysis revealed that the methylation status within gene promoters (or gene bodies) and miRNA promoters was negatively correlated with mRNA and miRNA expression, respectively. Numerous genes were closely related to distinct phenotypic traits between LDM and PMM. For example, the hyper-methylation and down-regulation of HK-2 and PFKFB4 were related to decrease glycolytic potential in PMM. In addition, promoter hypo-methylation and the up-regulation of miR-378 silenced the expression of the target genes and promoted capillary biosynthesis in PMM. Together, these results improve understanding of muscle metabolism and development from genomic and epigenetic perspectives.

The medium-chain diols with one hydroxyl group at its subterminal end are able to confer more flexibility upon the synthesized materials. But unfortunately, this type of diols has not been synthesized so far. The strong need for advanced materials impelled us to develop a new strategy for the production of these novel diols. In this study, we use the remodeled P450(BM3) for high-specificity production of 1,7-decanediol. Results: The native P450(BM3) was capable of converting medium-chain alcohols into corresponding alpha, omega 1-. alpha, omega 2- and alpha, omega 3-diols, with each of them accounting for about one third of the total diols, but it exhibited a little or no activity on the short-chain alcohols. Greatly improved regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation was obtained by laboratory evolution of P450(BM3). After substitution of 12 amino acid residues (J2-F87A), the ratio of 1,7-decanediol (omega-3 hydroxylation) to total decanediols increased to 86.8 % from 34.0 %. Structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the heme end residues such as Ala(78), Phe(87) and Arg(255) play a key role in controlling the regioselectivity of the alcohol hydroxylation, while the residues at the mouth of substrate binding site is not responsible for the regioselectivity. Conclusions: Herein we employ an engineered P450(BM3) for the first time to enable the high-specificity biosynthesis of 1,7-decanediol, which is a promising monomer for the development of advanced materials. Several key amino acid residues that control the regioselectivity of alcohol hydroxylation were identified, providing some new insights into how to improve the regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation. This report not only provides a good strategy for the biosynthesis of 1,7-decanediol, but also gives a promising approach for the production of other useful diols.

But, the precise effects of E. adenophorum on hepatocytes is unclear. Saanen goats were fed on E. adenophorum to detect the cytotoxicity effects of E. adenophorum on hepatocytes. Our study has shown that the typical apoptotic features, the increasing apoptotic hepatocytes and activated caspase-9, -3 and the subsequent cleavage of PARP indicated the potent pro-apoptotic effects of E. adenophorum. Moreover, the translocation of Bax and Cyt c between mitochondria and cytosol triggering the forming of apoptosome proved that the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was triggered by E. adenophorum. Furthermore, E. adenophorum increased the MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles and the subcellular localization of punctate LC3, the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and the protein levels of Beclin 1, but decreased that of P62, indicating the potent pro-autophagic effects of E. adenophorum. In addition, E. adenophorum significantly inhibited the protein leves of p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTORC1, but increased PTEN and p-AMPK. Also, the p-mTORC2 and p-Akt Ser473 were inhibited, indicating that the supression of mTORC2/Akt pathway could induce the autophagy of hepatocytes. The autophagy-realted results indicated that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTORC1- and mTORC2/Akt-mediated pathways contributed to the pro-autophagic activity of E. adenophorum. These findings provide new insights to understand the mechanisms involved in E. adenophorum-caused hepatotoxicity of Saanen goat.

Methods which block glutamine metabolism in treatment of breast cancer inhibit oncogenic transformation and tumor growth. We investigated whether inhibiting glutamine metabolism produces effects that are synergistic with those produced by drugs which damage DNA in triple-negative breast cancer cells. HCC1937 and BT-549 breast cancer cells were co-treated with either cisplatin or etoposide in combination with BPTES ( a specific inhibitor of glutaminase 1) or exposure to a glutamine-free medium, and the cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, immunoblotting studies, and CCK-8 assays. The results showed that both glutamine deprivation and BPTES pretreatments increased the toxic effects of cisplatin and etoposide on HCC1937 cells, as demonstrated by their reduced proliferation, increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins ( cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase 9, and cleaved-caspase 3) and decreased Bcl-2/BAX ratio. However, in BT-549 cells, glutamine deprivation and BPTES treatment increased etoposide-induced apoptosis only when used with higher concentrations of etoposide, and the effect on cisplatin-induced apoptosis was minimal. These results suggest that the anticancer effects produced by a combined approach of inhibiting glutamine metabolism and administering common chemotherapeutic agents correlate with the tumor cell type and specific drugs being administered.

Large numbers of lncRNAs have been identified in mouse, rat, and human, and some of them have been shown to play important roles in muscle development and myogenesis. However, there are few reports on the characterization of lncRNAs covering all the development stages of skeletal muscle in livestock. Results: RNA libraries constructed from developing longissimus dorsi muscle of fetal (45, 60, and 105 days of gestation) and postnatal (3 days after birth) goat (Capra hircus) were sequenced. A total of 1,034,049,894 clean reads were generated. Among them, 3981 lncRNA transcripts corresponding to 2739 lncRNA genes were identified, including 3515 intergenic lncRNAs and 466 anti-sense lncRNAs. Notably, in pairwise comparisons between the libraries of skeletal muscle at the different development stages, a total of 577 transcripts were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) which were validated by qPCR using randomly selected six lncRNA genes. The identified goat lncRNAs shared some characteristics, such as fewer exons and shorter length, with the lncRNAs in other mammals. We also found 1153 lncRNAs genes were neighbored 1455 protein-coding genes (< 10 kb upstream and downstream) and functionally enriched in transcriptional regulation and development-related processes, indicating they may be in cis-regulatory relationships. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficients of co-expression levels suggested 1737 lncRNAs and 19,422 mRNAs were possibly in trans-regulatory relationships (r > 0.95 or r < -0.95). These co-expressed mRNAs were enriched in development-related biological processes such as muscle system processes, regulation of cell growth, muscle cell development, regulation of transcription, and embryonic morphogenesis. Conclusions: This study provides a catalog of goat muscle-related lncRNAs, and will contribute to a fuller understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning muscle development in mammals.

Obese Rongchang pigs (RP) exhibited distinct fiber characteristics and lipid metabolic profiles in their muscle compared with lean Yorkshire pigs (YP). However, whether RP have a different gut microbiota than YP and whether there is a relationship between the microbiota and muscle properties are poorly understood. The present study was conducted to test whether the muscle properties can be transferred from pigs to germ-free (GF) mice. High-throughput pyrosequencing confirms the presence of distinct core microbiota between pig breeds, with alterations in taxonomic distribution and modulations in beta diversity. RP displayed a significant higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and apparent genera differences compared with YP. Transplanting the porcine microbiota into GF mice replicated the phenotypes of the donors. RP and their GF mouse recipients exhibited a higher body fat mass, a higher slow-contracting fiber proportion, a decreased fiber size and fast IIb fiber percentage, and enhanced lipogenesis in the gastrocnemius muscle. Furthermore, the gut microbiota composition of colonized mice shared high similarity with their donor pigs. Taken together, the gut microbiota of obese pigs intrinsically influences skeletal muscle development and the lipid metabolic profiles.

There is no reliable method to monitor sheep CE. Here, we characterize E. granulosus glutaredoxin 1 (Eg-Grx1) and report an improved immunodiagnostic method for CE. Methods: We cloned and expressed recombinant Eg-Grx1 and generated antibodies. We analyzed the location of the protein in different parasite stages by fluorescence immunohistochemistry, detected the immunogenicity of recombinant Eg-Grx1, and developed an indirect ELISA (iELISA) for CE serodiagnosis. Results: Eg-Grx1 is a classic dithiol Grx with several GSH-binding motifs. Native Eg-Grx1 protein was distributed in the tegument of protoscoleces, the whole germinal layer, and the parenchymatous tissue of adult worms. Recombinant Eg-Grx1 exhibited good immunoreactivity to CE-infected sheep serum. An iELISA using this antigen showed specificity of 64.3 % (9/14) and sensitivity of 1: 3200, and the diagnostic accordance rate was 97.9 % (47/48) compared with the results of necropsy. Conclusion: We characterized a novel Grx (Eg-Grx1) from a parasitic helminth and present a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and structure of this protein. The recombinant Eg-Grx1 protein showed good potential serodiagnostic performance, and we established an iELISA method, which may contribute to the surveillance of sheep CE in epidemic areas.

To determine the origination and evolution of this isolated strain, we carried out complete genome sequencing of this strain. Findings: Sequencing of the nucleotide sequence of DHBV strain SCP01 revealed a genome size of 3021 bp that contained three open reading frames, designated as C, S, and P, which were consistent with those of other duck hepatitis B viruses nucleotide sequences available in the GenBank of NCBI. Sequence comparisons based on the full-length genomic sequences showed that the DHBV SCP01 strain had the highest similarity (99.64 %) with the sequence of strain DHBV-XY, but had a lower similarity (90.04 %) with the sequence of strain DHBV CH5 isolated from Southwestern China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the DHBV-XY and DHBV SCP01 formed a branch that was clearly distinct from the other strains. Conclusion: This study show that the DHBV SCP01 strain from Sichuan belonged to "Western" isolates, while the DHBV CH5 from Sichuan belonged to "Chinese" isolates. These data will promote further research into the evolutionary biology, epidemiology and pathobiology of hepadnavirus infections. In addition, continuing duck hepatitis B virus surveillance in poultry is critical to understand the patterns of DHBV infection, and to find further animal infection models to study HBV infection.

Previous studies have demonstrated that recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) may be a potential vaccine candidate because it can express JEV envelope epitopes and induce immune responses against JEV. Still, it will be necessary to develop an adjuvant that can enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses to the recombinant antigen delivered by non-replicating Ad5. In this study, we investigated the systemic immune responses of BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant adenovirus expressing JEV envelope epitopes in combination with porcine interleukin-6 (rAdE-IL-6).The rAdE-IL-6 immunized group had the highest titers of anti JEV antibody as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as well as the highest levels of neutralizing antibody (1:75) as detected by a serum neutralization test. Similarly, higher concentrations of interferon-gamma (834.7 pg/ml) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (229.7 pg/ml) were detected in the rAdE-IL-6 group using an ELISA assay. These data indicate that immunized BALB/c induce a strong cellular response against rAdE-IL-6. Furthermore, after challenge with the virulent JEV SCYA201201 strain, the rAdE-IL-6 group generated an immune protective response 70% greater than that of the control group, indicating that rAdE-IL-6 induced a protective immune response against JEV challenge in mice. The results from this study demonstrated that IL-6 is a strong adjuvant that can enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Furthermore, a recombinant adenovirus coexpressing JEV envelope epitopes and porcine IL-6 protein may be an effective vaccine in animals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PLANTS; FREE AMINO-ACIDS; CATHARANTHUS-ROSEUS; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CUCUMIS-SATIVUS; PROTEIN-KINASES; CADMIUM STRESS; PROTON PUMPS	Despite numerous reports implicating nitric oxide (NO) in the environmental-stress responses of plants, the specific metabolic and ionic mechanisms of NO-mediated adaptation to metal stress remain unclear. Here, the impacts of copper (Cu) and NO donor (SNP, 50 mu M) alone or in combination on the well-known medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus L. were investigated. Our results showed that Cu markedly increased Cu2+ accumulation, decreased NO production, and disrupted mineral equilibrium and proton pumps, thereby stimulating a burst of ROS; in addition, SNP ameliorates the negative toxicity of Cu, and cPTIO reverses this action. Furthermore, the accumulations of ROS and NO resulted in reciprocal changes. Interestingly, nearly all of the investigated amino acids and the total phenolic content in the roots were promoted by the SNP treatment but were depleted by the Cu + SNP treatment, which is consistent with the self-evident increases in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and total soluble phenol content induced by SNP. Unexpectedly, leaf vincristine and vinblastine as well as the total alkaloid content (ca. 1.5-fold) were decreased by Cu but markedly increased by SNP (+38% and +49% of the control levels). This study provides the first evidence of the beneficial behavior of NO, rather than other compounds, in depleting Cu toxicity by regulating mineral absorption, reestablishing ATPase activities, and stimulating secondary metabolites.

Various influencing parameters of nanoZnO/yeast composites, such as initial pH, contact time and initial Pb2+ concentration were investigated, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of nano-ZnO/yeast composites for Pb2+ (31.72 mg g(-1)) is 2.03 times higher than that of pristine yeast (15.63 mg g(-1)). The adsorption mechanism of nano-ZnO/yeast composites was studied by a series of techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that nano-ZnO is evenly deposited on yeast surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis exhibited that the yeast surface is rougher than that of pristine yeast. Energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the existence of nano-ZnO on yeast surface. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements further illustrated that alkali hydrothermal method causes not only the generation and anchorage of nano-ZnO on yeast surface but also the exposure of more functional groups (such as amino, carboxyl groups etc.) on yeast surface, both of which could adsorb Pb2+ via synergistic effect.

In total, twelve primiparous Landrace x Yorkshire gilts were fed rations providing either 100% (control (CON)) or 75% (undernutrition (UN)) nutritional requirements according to the National Research Council recommendations, throughout gestation. Muscle samples of offspring were collected at birth (dpn1), weaning (dpn28) and adulthood (dpn189). Compared with CON pigs, UN pigs showed lower serum glucose concentrations at birth, but showed higher serum glucose and insulin concentrations as well as increased area under the blood glucose curve during intravenous glucose tolerance test at dpn189 (P < 0.05). Compared with CON pigs, GLUT-4 gene and protein expressions were decreased at dpn1 and dpn189 in the muscle of UN pigs, which was accompanied by increased methylation at the GLUT4 promoter (P<0.05). These alterations in methylation concurred with increased mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 at dpn1 and dpn28, DNMT3a at dpn189 and DNMT3b at dpn1 in UN pigs compared with CON pigs (P < 0.05). Interestingly, although the average methylation levels at the muscle GLUT4 promoter were decreased at dpn189 compared with dpn1 in pigs exposed to a poor maternal diet (P < 0.05), the methylation differences in individual CpG sites were more pronounced with age. Our results indicate that in utero undernutrition persists to silence muscle GLUT4 likely through DNA methylation during the ageing process, which may lead to the amplification of age-associated glucose intolerance.

The loss of mass and the degree of humification of the above-ground woody debris, below-ground woody debris, bark and root system (R1, 10 mm >= diameter > 0 mm; R2, 25 mm >= diameter > 10 mm; 100 mm >= R3 > 25 mm; R4 > 100 mm) of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) stump systems were evaluated in southwestern China in a chronosequence of plantations cut 1-15 years prior to the study. The results indicated that above-ground woody debris decomposed more quickly than below-ground woody debris and bark, whereas the degree of humification followed the opposite trend. Compared with one-year stumps, the mass losses of 15-year stump systems were 60.4% for above-ground woody debris, 42.1% for below-ground woody debris, 47.3% for bark, 69.9% for R1, 47.3% for R2, 51.0% for R3, and 83.2% for R4. In contrast, below-ground woody debris showed a greater degree of humification compared with other components in the stump system. Among the root system, fine roots (R1, diameter <= 10 mm) had the largest k value (0.09), whereas the decay rate of coarser roots (R2, R3, R4; diameter > 10 mm) increased with increasing root diameter. However, coarse roots showed a larger degree of humification (0.2-0.6) than fine roots (0.3-0.4). These results suggest that below-ground woody debris and coarse roots may display a higher degree of humification, showing greater short-term contributions to overall humification when compared with the other components in the stump system.

CULTIVARS; GENOMIC-SSR; REGISTRATION; DIVERSITY; GERMPLASM; PROGRAM	Background: Genetic diversity of 19 forage-type and 2 turf-type cultivars of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) was revealed using SSR markers in an attempt to explore the genetic relationships among them, and examine potential use of SSR markers to identify cultivars by bulked samples. Results: A total of 227 clear band was scored with 14 SSR primers and out of which 201 (88.6 %) were found polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) per primer pair varied from 62.5 to 100 % with an average of 86.9 %. The polymorphism information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.116 to 0.347 with an average of 0.257 and the highest PIC value (0.347) was noticed for primer NFA040 followed by NFA113 (0.346) whereas the highest discriminating power (D) of 1 was shown in NFA037 and LMgSSR02-01C. A Neighbor-joining dendrogram and the principal component analysis identified six major clusters and grouped the cultivars in agreement with their breeding histories. STRUCTURE analysis divided these cultivars into 3 sub-clades which correspond to distance based groupings. Conclusion: These findings indicates that SSR markers by bulking strategy are a useful tool to measure genetic diversity among tall fescue cultivars and could be used to supplement morphological data for plant variety protection.

Commensal Bacteria-Induced Inflammasome Activation in Mouse and Human Macrophages Is Dependent on Potassium Efflux but Does Not Require Phagocytosis or Bacterial Viability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME; INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION; IL-1-BETA PRODUCTION; CROHNS-DISEASE; RECEPTOR; AUTOPHAGY; PROTEIN; INFECTION; DECTIN-1; CELLS	Gut commensal bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, in part by activating the inflammasome and inducing secretion of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Although much has been learned about inflammasome activation by bacterial pathogens, little is known about how commensals carry out this process. Accordingly, we investigated the mechanism of inflammasome activation by representative commensal bacteria, the Gram-positive Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis and the Gram-negative Bacteroides fragilis. B. infantis and B. fragilis induced IL-1 beta secretion by primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages after overnight incubation. IL-1 beta secretion also occurred in response to heat-killed bacteria and was only partly reduced when phagocytosis was inhibited with cytochalasin D. Similar results were obtained with a wild-type immortalized mouse macrophage cell line but neither B. infantis nor B. fragilis induced IL-1 beta secretion in a mouse macrophage line lacking the nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. IL-1 beta secretion in response to B. infantis and B. fragilis was significantly reduced when the wild-type macrophage line was treated with inhibitors of potassium efflux, either increased extracellular potassium concentrations or the channel blocker ruthenium red. Both live and heat-killed B. infantis and B. fragilis also induced IL-1 beta secretion by human macrophages (differentiated THP-1 cells or primary monocyte-derived macrophages) after 4 hours of infection, and the secretion was inhibited by raised extracellular potassium and ruthenium red but not by cytochalasin D. Taken together, our findings indicate that the commensal bacteria B. infantis and B. fragilis activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in both mouse and human macrophages by a mechanism that involves potassium efflux and that does not require bacterial viability or phagocytosis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that regulated truncation of LPS enhances the cross-reaction against conserved outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from enteric bacteria. We speculate that the regulation of both O-antigen and ECA may enhance the induction of immune responses against conserved OMPs from enteric bacteria. In this work we targeted rfbB and rffG genes which encode dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratases and share the same function in regulating O-antigen and ECA synthesis. We constructed a mutant, 5496 (Delta rfbB6 Delta rffG7 Delta pagL73::TT araC P-BAD rfbB-3), in which rfbB gene expression was dependent on exogenously supplied arabinose during in vitro growth and achieved the simultaneous tight regulation of both LPS and ECA synthesis, as demonstrated by the LPS profile and Western blotting using antisera against LPS and ECA. When administered orally, S. Typhimurium 5496 was completely attenuated for virulence but still retained the capacity to colonize and disseminate in mice. In addition, we found that oral immunization with S496 resulted in increased immune responses against OMPs from enteric bacteria and enhanced survival compared with immunization with 5492 possessing Delta rfbB6 Delta rffG8 mutations when challenged with lethal doses of Salmonella Choleraesuis or Salmonella Enteritidis. These results indicate that S. Typhimurium arabinose-regulated rfbB strain S496 is a good vaccine candidate, conferring cross-protection against lethal challenge with heterologous Salmonella.

Results: The DLM-fed sows showed negative energy balance manifested by lost bodyweight, lower plasma glucose, subdued tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased plasma lipid metabolites levels. Both villus height and ratio of villus height to crypt depth averaged across the small intestine of piglets were higher in the DLM and HMTBA groups than in the control group. Piglet jejunal oxidized glutathione concentration and ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione were lower in the HMTBA group than in the DLM and control groups. However, piglet jejunal aminopeptidase A, carnitine transporter 2 and IGF-II precursor mRNA abundances were higher in the DLM group than in the HMTBA and control groups. Conclusion: Increasing maternal consumption of methionine as DLM and HMTBA promoted neonatal intestinal growth by increasing morphological development or up-regulating expression of genes responsible for nutrient metabolism. And increasing maternal consumption of HMTBA promoted neonatal intestinal antioxidant capacity without compromising maternal energy homeostasis during early lactation.

Camellia sinensis is an important cash crop, but breeding improvements and genetic studies of the plant are hindered by SI. However, the SI mechanism in C. sinensis remains unclear. In this study, a putative S-RNase gene (KU852488) was cloned from C. sinensis. The full-length cDNA of CsS-RNase is 1121 bp, which encodes 238 amino acids. It shares the closest relationship with an S-RNase gene (ADA67883.1), which was cloned from a self incompatibility Citrus reticulata cultivar 'Wuzishatangju'. The expression level of CsS-RNase in the styles were 3-259 ('Fuding Dabaicha') and 5.6-119 ('Zhongcha108') times higher than the other tissues, for example petals, pollen grains, filaments and buds. And its expression rose in self-pollinated styles with 24h earlier than cross-pollinated styles. The genotypes of CsS-RNase in 10 cultivars and one breeding line of C. sinensis were analyzed. Totally, 11 polymorphic amino acid residues were identified. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker of CsS-RNase was developed. Finally, the CsS-RNase was mapped onto a reference genetic linkage map of tea plant. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A large number of TEs have been identified in reference genome of each crop(named accumulated TEs), which are the important part of genome. However, whether there existed TEs with different insert positions in resequenced crop accession genomes from those of reference genome (named non-reference transposable elements, non-ref TEs), and what the characteristics (such as the number, type and distribution) are. To identify and characterize crop non-ref TEs, we analyzed non-ref TEs in more than 125 accessions from rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) using resequenced data with paired-end mapping methods. Results: We identified 13,066, 23,866 and 35,679 non-ref TEs in rice, maize and sorghum, respectively. Genome-wide characterization analysis shows that most of non-ref TEs were unique and non-ref TE classes shows different among rice, maize and sorghum. We found that non-ref TEs have a strong positive correlation with gene number and have a bias toward insertion near genes, but with a preference for avoiding coding regions in maize and sorghum. The genes affected by non-ref TE insertion were functionally enriched for stress response mechanisms in all three crops. Conclusions: These observations suggest that transposon insertion is not a random event and it makes genomic diversity, which may affect the intraspecific adaption and evolution of crops.

In this study, the mRNA expressions of ANGPTL-3 and ANGPTL-4 (ANGPTL-3 and-4) and tissue distribution in Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) of 1 to 8 weeks of age were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR methods. It was observed that ANGPTL-3 and-4 mRNAs were broadly expressed in duck liver and adipose tissues and were most abundant in infra abdominal adipose tissue (AD). ANGPTL-3 and-4 had different expression patterns in tissues. These data suggested that both duck ANGPTL-3 and-4 could be related to the development of tissues, and ANGPTL-4 may contribute to the development of adipose tissue through promoting adipocyte differentiation.

We therefore determined the association of a maternal high fat diet in pregnancy with offspring ovarian health during the gestation and postnatal female offspring in pig a model. Thirty-two Yorkshire gilts with similar bodyweights mated at the third estrus were randomly assigned to two nutrition levels of either a control (CON, crude fat: 7.27%) or a high fat diet (HFD, crude fat: 11.78%). Ovary samples were collected during the fetal (Day 55 (g55) and Day 90 of gestation (g90)) and offspring (prepuberty Day 160 (d160) and age at puberty) period to detect ovary development, antioxidant status and apoptosis cells. Maternal HFD did not influence notch signaling gene expression, which regulates primordial follicle formation and transformation, and ovarian histological effect at g55 and g90. However, maternal HFD reduced the numbers of large follicles at d160 and small follicle numbers upon puberty compared to CON in offspring. The results also revealed that the antioxidant index of total antioxidative capability (T-AOC), cytoplasmic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and mRNA expression were higher in the CON than the HFD at g90 and d160, whereas, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was decreased in the CON. Maternal HFD increased the inhibitor of the apoptosis-related gene of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl2) mRNA expression at g90 and d160, whereas, pro-apoptotic-related gene bcl-2 assaciated X protein (bax) was reduced. These data show that the maternal high fat diet does not delay fetal ovarian development, but it changes ovarian health by the induction of oxidative stress and accelerating cell apoptosis in offspring.

Pers. from Pir Chinasi Hill in Western Himalaya were evaluated for their degree of tolerance to altitudinal stress. Differential response of all ecotypes in terms of adequate structural modifications to different elevation levels was an evident to confirm the hypothesis that plants inhabiting different altitudes show variation in structure (internal modifications) and strategic (response) due to heterogeneity in environmental gradients. Soil at top hill site was more acidic and displayed significant increase in ionic content and total nitrogen. High elevation had severe impact on morpho-anatomical and physiological attributes. A significant decline in shoot fresh weight and total leaf area was observed in top hill ecotype. With exception of Ca2+ and carotenoid, other ionic and chlorophyll content were significantly declined at high elevations. Anatomical alterations such as, increased leaf thickness, intensive sclerification around the vascular bundle and pith area, reduced metaxylem vessel area, high number of silica bodies, high pubescence (increased microhair and trichome density) were some of the promising anatomical adaptations in top hill ecotype which played an important role in high degree of tolerance of this grass to cope with altitudinal stresses. Increased leaf thickness might be a response to lower temperature that protects mesophyll cells and high density of trichomes may be involved in blocking transpiration water and internal heat. The pattern of constant variation suggests that differential response of these ecotypes is highly related to air temperature, pattern of rainfall, availability of nutrients.

Full geometry optimizations have been performed for all the ligands (L-X- anions), MCl+ cations, and the complexes. In the ligands, the energy levels of the carbon sigma lonepair orbitals suggest the trend L-H- > L-Cl- > L-CN- for the donor strength. The role of the M-NHC interaction in complexes was investigated by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. The results show that the NHC-M bond consists of the components originating from the L -> M donation and the M -> Carbene C back-donation and the metal -> the ring of NHC back-donation. The transition-metal strongly affects the donation and back-donation. The interaction between the metal and the NHC ligand can be influenced by the central metal and the substituent on the ring of NHC.

The genetic and evolutionary basis of the adaptation of this wild grass species to drought stress is largely unknown. Peroxidase (POD) may play a role in plant drought tolerance, but whether the allelic variations of genes encoding the specific POD isoenzymes are associated with plant response to drought stress is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to examine natural variation of POD isoenzyme patterns, to identify nucleotide diversity of POD genes and to relate the allelic variation of genes to drought tolerance traits of diverse Brachypodium accessions. Methods Whole-plant drought tolerance and POD activity were examined in contrasting ecotypes. Non-denaturing PAGE and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed to detect distinct isozymes of POD in 34 accessions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by comparing DNA sequences of these accessions. Associations of POD genes encoding specific POD isoenzymes with drought tolerance traits were analysed using TASSEL software. Key Results Variations of POD isoenzymes were found among accessions with contrasting drought tolerance, while the most tolerant and susceptible accessions each had their own unique POD isoenzyme band. Eight POD genes were identified and a total of 90 SNPs were found among these genes across 34 accessions. After controlling population structure, significant associations of Bradi3g41340.1 and Bradi1g26870.1 with leaf water content or leaf wilting were identified. Conclusions Brachypodium ecotypes have distinct specific POD isozymes. This may contribute to natural variations of drought tolerance of this species. The role of specific POD genes in differentiating Brachypodium accessions with contrasting drought tolerance could be associated with the general fitness of Brachypodium during evolution.

The main function of HSP90 is to assist other proteins to fold properly. In this study, we uncovered and analysed nine OsHSP90 (OsHSP90-1--OsHSP90-9) family members in rice Nipponbare, in which three distinct motifs were identified. All the HSP90 proteins were classified into three major groups (I, II, III) by phylogenetic analysis. The expression of OsHSP90 family in 10 tissues was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). OsHSP90-4, OsHSP90-6 and OsHSP90-7 had high expression, while OsHSP90-5 and OsHSP90-8 had very low expression across almost all 10 samples. The gene that encodes OsHSP90-1 was preferentially expressed in embryo at 14days after flowering. It has been reported that some heat shock proteins were up-regulated in response to heat or other stresses. However, in our study the expression pattern of OsHSP90 genes is heterogeneous under a range of stress conditions. The expression of OsHSP90-2 and OsHSP90-4 was up-regulated under drought, salt, cold and heat conditions, while the expression of OsHSP90-3 and OsHSP90-5 was down-regulated under salt and drought conditions. OsHSP90-7 and OsHSP90-9 were down-regulated only under drought conditions. OsHSP90-6 did not change its expression across all conditions compared to control. Overexpression of OsHSP90-2 in E. coli could enhance cell viability and significantly improved resistance to heat, high salinity and drought stress conditions. The results presented here may provide new insights into the function of OsHSP90 family in rice.

The synonymous codon usage patterns of bacteria reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable bacteria to improve tolerance of the various environments. We detailed the codon usage patterns of RA isolates from the available 12 sequenced genomes by multiple codon and statistical analysis. Nucleotide compositions and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that A or U ending codons are predominant in RA. Neutrality analysis found no significant correlation between GC(12) and GC(3) (p > 0.05). Correspondence analysis and ENc-plot results showed that natural selection dominated over mutation in the codon usage bias. The tree of cluster analysis based on RSCU was concordant with dendrogram based on genomic BLAST by neighbor-joining method. By comparative analysis, about 50 highly expressed genes that were orthologs across all 12 strains were found in the top 5% of high CAI value. Based on these CAI values, we infer that RA contains a number of predicted highly expressed coding sequences, involved in transcriptional regulation and metabolism, reflecting their requirement for dealing with diverse environmental conditions. These results provide some useful information on the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage bias and evolution of RA.

The survival rates, height of regenerated shell, and activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) were investigated and recorded for 15days. A triangular piece of shell about 8mm wide was excised from the ventral region of the shell. On the basis of photographs and enzyme assay, it was concluded both yellow-shell apple snails and black-shell apple snails had high survival rates (100%). The regenerated new shell was initially thin, with the wound sealed 5days after induction of shell regeneration; after that the regenerated shell thickened. Three snails were sampled at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 15 days after shell excision for analysis of enzymatic activity of ALP and CA. Trends of the activity of ALP and CA in the mantle were similar. Initially they both showed a decline on the first day, then rose on following days. Activity of ALP declined to a minimum on the first day, and an activity peak in both colour forms appeared on the fifth day (P<0.05) and was maintained for the rest of the experiment. The minimum value of CA occurred after 0.5 days, and a significant increase was also observed on the fifth day (P<0.05). This study has revealed that apple snails have good shell regeneration abilities, and that ALP and CA probably play a crucial role in shell growth and regeneration.

Cells were cultured with 5 % CO2-humidified chamber at 37 degrees C until the cells grew to complete confluence and then exposed to a mild hyperthermia at 41.5 degrees C (HS) or 37 degrees C (control) for another 24 h, finally harvested for total RNA or protein extraction. Real-time quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were performed to compare gene expression of 25 selenoprotein genes, 3 tight junction-related genes, and 10 inflammation-related genes. Protein expressions of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and selenoprotein X and P (SelX and SelP) were also investigated by Western blot. The results showed that HS up-regulated (P< 0.05) Hsp70 and one tight junction-related gene [ zonula occludens-1 (Zo-1)] in IPEC-J2 cells. At the same time, HS up-regulated (P< 0.05) 4 selenoprotein genes (Gpx3, DiO(2), Selk, Sels) and three inflammation-related genes (Il-6, Icam-1, Tgf-beta) and down-regulated (P < 0.05 or as indicated) six selenoprotein genes (Gpx2, Gpx6, Txnrd1, Selh, Selm, Selx) and three inflammation-related genes (Ifn-beta, Mcp-1, Tnf-alpha) in the cells. HS also exhibited impacts on protein expressions, which up-regulated Hsp70, down-regulated SelX, and showed no effect on SelP in IPEC-J2 cells. Our results showed that HS affected the expression of inflammation-related genes and up-regulated gene and protein expressions of Hsp70. The changes of so many selenoprotein genes expression implied a potential link between selenoprotein genes and HS. Moreover, the results provided by this IPEC-J2 model may be used to further study the interactive mechanisms between selenoprotein function and potential intestinal damage induced by HS.

A total of 540 young grass carp with an average initial weight of 261.41 +/- 0.53 g were fed diets containing six graded levels of lipids at 5.9 -80.1 WIT diet for 8 weeks. After that, a challenge trial was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila over 2 weeks. The results indicated that compared with optimal lipids supplementation, low and excess levels of lipids down-regulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides, anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibitor of kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) and ribosomal p70S6 kinase (S6K1), and up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), NF-kappa B c-Rel (not p52), I kappa B kinase alpha (IKK alpha), IKK beta, IKK gamma, and eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP) mRNA levels in the head kidney and spleen of young grass carp (P < 0.05). Low or excess levels of lipids also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) contents, reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes (P < 0.05), down-regulate the relative mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and up-regulated the expression levels of Kelch-like ECH-associating protein la (Keap1a) and Keap1b in the head kidney and spleen. In addition, low or excess levels of lipids down regulated the mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) in the head kidney and spleen, whereas up-regulated the mRNA levels of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), caspase 3, 7, 8 and 9 mRNA levels in the head kidney and spleen and Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA levels in the spleen of young grass carp, suggesting that low or excess levels of lipids could decrease the head kidney and spleen immune function, induce oxidative damage and apoptosis and impair antioxidant system of young grass carp. At last, low or excess levels of lipids also impaired the immune function and structure in the skin of young grass carp. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for PWG, skin haemorrhage and lesions morbidity and IgM content, the dietary lipids requirements for young grass carp were estimated to be 43.7, 60.2, 55.0 and 52.1 g/kg diet, respectively.

A total of 540 young grass carp (264.11 +/- 0.76 g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of protein (143.1, 176.7, 217.2, 257.5, 292.2 and 322.8 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet) for 8 weeks. After the growth trial, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila and mortalities were recorded for 14 days. The results indicated that optimal dietary protein levels: increased the production of antibacterial components, up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibitor of kappa B alpha, target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 mRNA levels, whereas down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) P65, NF-kappa B P52, c-Rel, I kappa B kinase I kappa B kinase gamma and eIF4E-binding proteins 2 mRNA levels in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0:05), suggesting that optimal dietary protein level could enhance fish intestinal immune barrier function; up-regulated the mRNA levels of tight junction complexes, B-cell lymphoma protein-2, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, myeloid cell leukemia-1 and NF-E2-related factor 2, and increased the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, whereas down-regulated myosin light chain kinase, cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, fatty acid synthetase ligand, apoptotic protease activating factor-1, Bcl-2 associated X protein, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase and Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1b mRNA levels, and decreased reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05), indicating that optimal dietary protein level could improve fish intestinal physical barrier function. Finally, the optimal dietary protein levels for the growth performance (PWG) and against enteritis morbidity of young grass carp were estimated to be 286.82 g kg(-1) diet (250.66 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet) and 292.10 g kg(-1) diet (255.47 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet), respectively.

JIAN; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; DISEASE RESISTANCE	This study investigated the effects of exogenous lipase supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal growth and function, immune response and physical barrier function, and related signaling molecules mRNA expression of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 450 grass carp (255.02 +/- 0.34 g) were fed five diets for 60 days. There were 5 dietary treatments that included a normal protein and lipid diet containing 30% crude protein (CP) with 5% ether extract (EE), and the low-protein and high-lipid diets (28% CP, 6% EE) supplemented with graded levels of exogenous lipase supplementation activity at 0, 1193, 2560 and 3730 U/kg diet. The results indicated that compared with a normal protein and lipid diet (30% CP, 5% EE), a low-protein and high-lipid diet (28% CP, 6% EE) (un-supplemented lipase) improved lysozyme activities and complement component 3 contents in the distal intestine (DI), interleukin 10 mRNA expression in the proximal intestine (Pp, and glutathione Stransferases activity and glutathione content in the intestine of young grass carp. In addition, in low protein and high-lipid diets, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation significantly increased acid phosphatase (ACP) activities and complement component 3 (C3) contents (P < 0.05), up-regulated the relative mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and hepcidin) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor 01) and signaling molecules inhibitor protein-kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) and target of rapamycin (TOR) (P < 0.05), down-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 8, interferon gamma 2, and interleukin 1 beta), and signaling molecules (nuclear factor kappa B p65, I kappa B kinase beta, I kappa B kinase gamma) (P < 0.05) in the intestine of young grass carp. Moreover, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) contents (P < 0.05), improved the activities of anti-superoxide anion (ASA) and anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), glutathione content, and the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferases and glutathione reductase) (P < 0.05), up-regulated signaling molecule NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P < 0.05), down-regulated signaling molecules (Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein la, Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1b) (P < 0.05) in the intestine of young grass carp. Furthermore, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation significantly elevated the mRNA levels of tight junction proteins (Occludin, zonula occludens 1, Claudin b, Claudin c and Claudin 3) (P < 0.05), down-regulated the mRNA levels of tight junction proteins (Claudin 12 and Claudin 15a) (P < 0.05), down-regulated signaling molecules myosin light chain kinase (P < 0.05) in the intestine of young grass carp. In conclusion, dietary lipid could partially spare protein, and the low-protein and high-lipid diet could improve growth, intestinal growth and function, immune response and antioxidant capability of fish. Meanwhile, in high-fat and low protein diets, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation improved growth, intestinal growth and function, intestinal immunity, physical barrier, and regulated the mRNA expression of related signal molecules of fish. The optimal level of exogenous lipase supplementation in young grass carp (255 -771 g) was estimated to be 1193 U kg(-1) diet. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

JIAN; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; GRADED-LEVELS	To investigate the effects of dietary niacin on gill immunity, tight junction proteins, antioxidant system and related signaling molecules mRNA expression, young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) were fed six diets containing graded levels of niacin (3.95-55.01 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks. The study indicated that niacin deficiency decreased lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, and complement 3 content, and caused oxidative damage that might be partly due to the decreased copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities and reduced glutathione content in fish gills (P < 0.05). Moreover, the relative mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and Hepcidin), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor On tight junction proteins (Occludin, zonula occludens 1, Claudin-15 and -3), signaling molecules (inhibitor of kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha), target of rapamycin (TOR), ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)) and antioxidant enzymes were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in niacin-deficient diet group. Conversely, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 8, interferon gamma 2, and interleukin 1 beta), signaling molecules (nuclear factor kappa B p65, I kappa B kinase alpha, I kappa B kinase 13, I kappa B kinase gamma, Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1b, myosin light chain kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in fish gills fed niacin-deficient diet. Interestingly, the varying niacin levels of 3.95-55.01 mg/kg diet had no effect on the mRNA level of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein la, Claudin-c and -12 in fish gills (P > 0.05). In conclusion, niacin deficiency decreased gill immunity, impaired, gill antioxidant system, as well as regulated mRNA expression of gill tight junction proteins and related signaling molecules of fish.

Four litter species (i.e., willow: Salix paraplesia, azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum, cypress: Sabina saltuaria, and larch: Larix mastersiana) that had varying initial litter chemical traits were placed separately in litterbags and then incubated on the soil surface of forest floor plots or in the water of the stream and riparian zone plots. Litterbags were retrieved five times each year during the two-year experiment, with nine replicates each time for each treatment. The results suggested that foliar litter lost 32.2%-89.2% of the initial dry mass depending on litter species and ecosystem type after two-year's incubation. The cellulose lost 60.1%-96.8% of the initial mass with degradation rate in the order of stream > riparian zone > forest floor. Substantial cellulose degradation occurred at the very beginning (i.e., in the first pre-freezing period) of litter decomposition. Litter initial concentrations of phosphorus (P) and lignin were found to be the dominant chemical traits controlling cellulose degradation regardless of ecosystems type. The local-scale environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability were important moderators of cellulose degradation rate. Although the effects of common litter chemical traits (e.g., P and lignin concentrations) on cellulose degradation across different individual ecosystems were identified, local-scale environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability were found to be of great importance for cellulose degradation. These results indicated that local-scale environmental factors should be considered apart from litter quality for generating a reliable predictive framework for the drivers of cellulose degradation and further on litter decomposition at a global scale.

Strain 25-1(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0, at 28-30 A degrees C and in the presence of NaCl concentrations from 0.0% to 0.5 %. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain 25-1(T) belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium within the family Flavobacteriaceae and is related most closely to C. carnis G81(T) (96.4% similarity), C. lathyri RBA2-6(T) (95.8% similarity), and C. zeae JM1085(T) (95.8% similarity). Its genomic DNA G+C molar composition was 36.2%. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 (44.0%), iso-C-17:0 3OH (19.8%) and C-16:1 omega 7c/(16:1) omega 6c (12.7%). The only isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone 6 (MK-6). The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified amino lipids and two unidentified lipids. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain 25-1(T) and C. lathyri RBA2-6(T) was 38%. Phenotypic, genotypic, and phylogenetic characteristics indicated that strain 25-1(T) is a novel member of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the name C. chengduensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 25-1(T) (CCTCC AB2015133(T)=DSM 100396(T)).

The high-temperature requirement A (HtrA)-like protease, which is involved in protein quality control, has been reported to be a virulence factor in many pathogens. In this study, we showed that HtrA of H. parasuis (HpHtrA) exhibited both chaperone and protease activities. Finally, nickel import ATP-binding protein (NikE), periplasmic dipeptide transport protein (DppA), and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) were identified as proteolytic substrates for HpHtrA. The protease activity reached its maximum at 40 degrees C in a time-dependent manner. Disruption of the htrA gene from strain SC1401 affected tolerance to temperature stress and resistance to complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, increased autoagglutination and biofilm formation were detected in the htrA mutant. In addition, the htrA mutant was significantly attenuated in virulence in the murine model of infection. Together, these data demonstrate that HpHtrA plays an important role in the virulence of H. parasuis.

However, some studies showed that the selection of social genetic effect leaded to extra increase of inbreeding. In this study, two optimization methods (SBLUP+GA1, SBLUP+GA2) based on genetic algorithm were used to obtain the optimal genetic contributions of seedstocks and maximize the average genetic gains of direct and social genetic component while minimizing the inbreeding. In SBLUP+GA1, only the contributions of sires were optimized. In SBLUP+GA2, the contributions of sires and darns were optimized together. The results showed SBLUP+GA1 and SBLUP+GA2 resulted in 18.52% and 25.93% lower inbreeding rate than common social genetic effect selection based on BLUP method (SBLUP) under base parameters, respectively. Under that situation, the average gains for direct, social and total genetic effect component in SBLUP+GA1 were actually improved 3.59%, 10.02% and 432% relative to SBLUP, respectively. In SBLUP+GA2, they were 1.28%, 10.00% and 2.02%, respectively. SBLUP+GA2 resulted in lower inbreeding rate, but, obtained slightly less genetic gain than SBLUP+GA1. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is unknown whether excessive benzoic acid in diets would have a potential risk on pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the safety of benzoic acid that was used in diets of piglets. A total of 120 weaned pigs [(Yorkshire x Landrace) x Duroc] with initial average BW of 8.16 +/- 0.09 kg (28 +/- 1 d of age) were randomly allotted to four groups receiving diets supplementing 0%, 0.5%, 2.5% and 5.0% benzoic acid for 56 d. Supplementing 0.5% benzoic acid in the diet had no negative effects on the growth of piglets, and increased antioxidant enzyme (CAT and GSH-Px) activities in the liver (P < 0.05). Dietary 2.5% benzoic acid supplementation decreased ADFI and ADG of pigs from 1 to 28 d (P < 0.05), reduced the white blood cell and globulin on d 56 (P < 0.05), and resulted in spleen injury on d 28 and d 56. In addition, besides impairing growth performance of pigs during the whole experiment (P < 0.05), supplementing 5.0% benzoic acid in the diet increased the relative liver weight on d 56 (P < 0.05), enhanced the serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase of pigs on d 28 (P < 0.05), and led to liver injury. Moreover, dietary 5.0% benzoic acid supplementation also decreased the red cell pressure product, red blood cell volume and increased red cell distribution width-SD/CV on d 28 (P < 0.05), and resulted in the serious spleen damage. When compared with pigs fed by the diet supplemented 0.5% benzoic acid, pigs fed the diets containing 2.5% or 5.0% benzoic acid would have higher benzoic acid residues in the liver and kidneys on d 28 and d 56 (P < 0.05). These results suggested that dietary 0.5% benzoic acid supplementation had the beneficial effects on piglets, but supplementing excessive (2.5% and 5.0%) benzoic acid in the diets could lead to growth retardation, hematological abnormality and the injury of some organs (liver and spleen).

Transcription factor Foxp3 is required for the development of these cells. How Foxp3 is stabilised and affects Tregs development is still incompletely understood. Previous studies have suggested that hypoxia inducible factor gene HIF-1 alpha negatively influences the development of Tregs and enhances the development of IL-17 producing Th17 cells. In this study, we reveal that prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3), which is a negative regulator of HIF-1 alpha, is upregulated in Tregs and enhances the development of Tregs. The PHD3 inhibitor dimethyl oxalylglycine (DMOG) or siRNAs-PHD3, which upregulates HIF-1 alpha, dow -regulated Foxp3 expression, and enhanced the development of Th17 cells. Our observations disclose a novel role of PHD3 in the development of Tregs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The chemical structure was elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Floraosmanol A (1) significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) activated RAW264.7 macrophages and the release of beta-hexosaminidase as a marker of degranulation from rat basophile leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. In addition, several cinnamic acid analogues were conjugated with geraniol and 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol through an ester linkage. The inhibitory effects on NO production and the release of beta-hexosaminidase of the synthesized compounds were examined for structure-activity relationships.

Rhinopithecus bieti, Rhinopithecus roxellana, and Rhinopithecus strykeri inhabit high-altitude habitats, whereas Rhinopithecus brelichi and Rhinopithecus avunculus inhabit lowland regions. We report the de novo whole-genome sequence of R. bieti and genomic sequences for the four other species. Eight shared substitutions were found in six genes related to lung function, DNA repair, and angiogenesis in the high-altitude snub-nosed monkeys. Functional assays showed that the high-altitude variant of CDT1 ( Ala537Val) renders cells more resistant to UV irradiation, and the high-altitude variants of RNASE4 ( Asn89Lys and Thr128Ile) confer enhanced ability to induce endothelial tube formation in vitro. Genomic scans in the R. bieti and R. roxellana populations identified signatures of selection between and within populations at genes involved in functions relevant to high-altitude adaptation. These results provide valuable insights into the adaptation to high altitude in the snub-nosed monkeys.

Effects of inhibiting PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway on lipid metabolism homeostasis in goose primary hepatocytes	ANIMAL			English	Article						PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway; lipids metabolism; goose hepatocyte	PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR; MAMMALIAN TARGET; FATTY-ACID; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; VLDL PRODUCTION; LIVER; LIPOGENESIS; RAPAMYCIN; MTOR; CHOLESTEROL	Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K)-Protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays an important role in the synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerol. However, the mechanism of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in regulating lipid metabolism of goose liver was poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulating lipid metabolic homeostasis in goose hepatocytes. Goose primary hepatocytes were treated with different PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal inhibitors (LY294002, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235) for 24 h. The results showed that these inhibitors evidently inhibited PI3K-Akt-mTOR downstream signaling. Meanwhile, these PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors reduced intracellular lipid accumulation, decreased the mRNA expression and protein content of genes involved in the de novo fatty acid synthesis, while increased the transcriptional and protein level of key factors involved in fatty acid oxidation and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion. Conclusion: These findings suggested that the reduction of lipids accumulation induced-by inhibiting PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway was closely linked to the decrease of lipogenesis, the increase of fatty acids oxidation, and the increase of VLDL assembly and secretion in goose hepatocytes.

In this study, the identified goose Mx (goMx) mRNA is 2009 bp long, shares partially conserved exons with other homologues, and shares highly conserved domains in its primary structure. The amino acid position 629 (629 aa) of the goMx protein was identified as serine (Ser), in contrast to the Ser located at 631 aa in chicken Mx, which is considered to be responsible for the lack of chicken Mx antiviral activity. In addition, the goMx 142 aa residue in the dynamin family signature differs from that of other functional Mx proteins. Transcriptional analysis revealed that goMx was mainly expressed in the digestive, respiratory and immune systems in an age-specific manner. GoMx transcript levels in goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were found to be significantly up-regulated by various agonists and avian viruses. Furthermore, a time course study of the effects of H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) on goMx expression in infected goslings suggested that H9N2 AIV affected goMx expression. However, significant changes in goMx expression were observed in the trachea, lung and small intestine of infected birds. Altogether, these results indicate that goMx protein may have acquired its broad antiviral activity by changing only a few amino acids at select sites, even as it shares a conserved architectures with species.

CAG repeats have been found in the coding sequence (CDS) of avian MEF2D; however, their functions remain unknown and require further investigation. Here, we examined the characteristics and functional role of MEF2D CAG repeat in duck. The full-length CDS of duck MEF2D was cloned for the first time, and a novel CAG repeat was identified and located in exon 9. Sequence analysis indicated that the protein domains of duck MEF2D are highly conserved relative to other vertebrates, whereas MEF2D CAG repeats with variable repeat numbers are specific to avian species. Furthermore, sequencing has revealed polymorphisms in MEF2D CAG repeat at both DNA and mRNA levels. Four MEF2D CAG repeat genotypes and 10 MEF2D cDNA variants with different CAG repeat numbers were detected in two duck populations. A t-test showed that the expanded CAG repeat generated significantly longer transcription products (p <0.05). Association analysis demonstrated positive correlations between the expansion of the CAG repeat and five muscle-related traits. By using protein structure prediction, we suggested that the polymorphisms of the CAG repeat affect protein structures within protein domains. Taken together, these findings reveal that duck MEF2D CAG repeat is a potential functional element with polymorphisms and may cause differences in MEF2D function between duck and other vertebrate species.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of glutamine and N-carbamylglutamate supplementation in rat metabolism. Thirty rats were fed a control, glutamine, or N-carbamylglutamate diet for four weeks. Urine samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics, specifically high-resolution H-1 NMR metabolic profiling combined with multivariate data analysis. Glutamine significantly increased the urine levels of acetamide, acetate, citrulline, creatinine, and methymalonate, and decreased the urine levels of ethanol and formate (p < 0.05). Moreover, N-carbamylglutamate significantly increased the urine levels of creatinine, ethanol, indoxyl sulfate, lactate, methymalonate, acetoacetate, m-hydroxyphenylacetate, and sarcosine, and decreased the urine levels of acetamide, acetate, citrulline, creatine, glycine, hippurate, homogentisate, N-acetylglutamate, phenylacetyglycine, acetone, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate (p < 0.05). Results suggested that glutamine and N-carbamylglutamate could modify urinary metabolome related to nitrogen metabolism and gut microbiota metabolism. Moreover, N-carbamylglutamate could alter energy and lipid metabolism. These findings indicate that different arginine precursors may lead to differences in the biofluid profile in rats.

In this research, the two different Cd accumulation rice lines of Lu527-8 (the high Cd accumulating rice line) and Lu527-4 (the normal rice line) were grown in soils with different Cd treatments (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg kg(-1) soil) to evaluate Cd accumulation characteristics and Cd removal potentials. When the concentration of Cd in soil increased, Lu527-8 showed less symptoms of phytotoxicity when compared to Lu527-4. Furthermore, Lu527-8 demonstrated greater shoot Cd accumulation (321.17-964.95 mg plant(-1)) than Lu527-4 (50.37-201.66 mu g plant(-1)) at the jointing and filling stages. The soil available Cd content of Lu527-8 significantly decreased by 26.92-38.97 and 27.77-63.44 % at the jointing and filling stages, respectively. Meanwhile, the total Cd content in soil also reduced by 11.64-46.75 and 21.41-54.11 % at jointing and filling stages, respectively. When the Cd concentration in soil was 20 mg kg(-1), the Cd extraction rate in shoots of Lu527-8 reached 2.12 and 2.85 % which increased 10.60 and 6.48 times compared with that of Lu527-4 at the jointing and filling stages, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Lu527-8 shows great abilities of Cd accumulation and Cd removal potential from contaminated soils with different Cd treatments and it is a promising species for phytoextraction of Cd-contaminated soils.

Mixtures of swine manure (SM), cow dung (CD), and animal wastewater treatment plant sludge (S) were applied as feeds, and Eisenia fetida was employed in this study to investigate the vermicomposting efficiency based on their several growth stages. The hatching test resulted in a 100 % hatching rate in S60SM40 (60 % S + 40 % SM) mixture, while 4.40 hatchlings per cocoon were observed. The growth of infancy performed best in 0-20 % CD mixtures (0.05 +/- 0.002 g), followed by in SM + CD (0.04 +/- 0.003 g). The highest growth rate of young and adult E. fetida was noticed in CD + S mixtures (11.14 +/- 0.01 and 6.00 +/- 0.02 mg/d/worm, respectively), while the higher cocoon production of adults was noticed in S + SM mixtures especially in S40SM60 (537 +/- 5 worms). Moreover, the conversion of solids; the modified pH value; the reduction in total organic carbon (TOC); total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NH4-N, NO3-N, and C:N ratio; and the rich in total available phosphorus (TAP) and total potassium (TK) content by young and adult E. fetida were related to the growth of worms. Such work would benefit understanding and to increase the efficiency of vermicompost processing of different wastes.

Effects of dietary DL-2-hydroxy-4(methylthio)butanoic acid supplementation on growth performance, indices of ascites syndrome, and antioxidant capacity of broilers reared at low ambient temperature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Antioxidant capacity; Ascites syndrome; Broiler; DL-2-Hydroxy-4(methylthio)butanoic acid; Low ambient temperature	PULMONARY-HYPERTENSION SYNDROME; COLD-INDUCED ASCITES; BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; FEED RESTRICTION; OXIDATIVE STATUS; CHICKENS; METHIONINE; MORTALITY	This study examined the effects of dietary DL-2-hydroxy-4(methylthio)butanoic acid (DL-HMTBA) supplementation on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and ascites syndrome (AS) in broilers reared at low ambient temperature (LAT) from 7 to 28 days of age. Eight hundred 7-day-old broilers were randomly assigned to two ambient temperatures (LAT and normal ambient temperature [NAT]), four supplemental DL-HMTBA levels (0.17, 0.34, 0.51, and 0.68 %) of the basal diet in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement (ten replicate pens; ten birds/pen). LAT and NAT indicate temperatures of 12-14 and 24-26 A degrees C in two chambers, respectively, and broilers were reared at these temperatures from 7 to 28 days of age. LAT significantly decreased body weight gain (P < 0.001), serum glutathione (GSH) content (day 14, P = 0.02; day 28, P = 0.045), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) at 21 days (P = 0.001, 0.015) and 28 days (P = 0.017, 0.010) and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.001), serum malondialdehyde (day 21, P = 0.000) and protein carbonyl Level (day 14, P = 0.003; day 21, P = 0.035). As for incidence of AS, there were significant effects of LAT on red blood cell (RBC) count (P < 0.05), hematocrit (HCT) (P < 0.05), and the right to total ventricular weight ratio (RV/TV) at 21 days (P = 0.012) and 28 days (P = 0.046). Supplementation of DL-HMTBA markedly decreased RV/TV at day 28 (P = 0.021), RBC (day 21, P = 0.008), HCT (day 21, P < 0.001), mean cell hemoglobin (day 14, P = 0.035; day 21, P = 0.003), and serum protein carbonyl level (day 21, P = 0.009), while significantly increased serum GSH content (day 14, P = 0.022; day 28, P = 0.001), SOD and GSH-Px activities at 21 days of age (P < 0.001 and P = 0.037). The optimal supplemental DL-HMTBA levels in basal diet of broilers aged from 7 to 28 days under low or normal temperatures were similar, so the authors recommended supplemental of DL-HMTBA level was 0.46 %.

Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an economically important disease that affects wheat worldwide. The discovery of novel resistance genes and the deployment of effectively resistant cultivars are important for the ongoing control of wheat stripe rust and the maintenance of the agricultural productivity of wheat. CH7086, a new stripe rust-resistant wheat introgression line, was selected by crossing susceptible cultivars with the resistant Thinopyrum ponticum-derived partial amphiploid Xiaoyan 7430. The resistance of CH7086 is effective against all current Chinese P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races. CH7086 was crossed with the stripe rust-susceptible cultivars to develop F-1, F-2, F-3, and BC1 populations for genetic analysis. Segregation in the F-2 and BC1 populations and F-2:3 lines were tested for resistance against the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici race CYR32. This test showed that CH7086 carries a single dominant gene for stripe rust resistance, which was temporarily designated YrCH86. The closest of the eight simple sequence repeat (SSR) and expressed sequence tag-SSR markers flanking the locus were X2AS33, which is 1.9 cM distal, and Xmag3807, which is 3.1 cM proximal. The resistance gene and its polymorphic markers were placed in deletion bin 2AS-0.78-1.00 using the 'Chinese Spring' nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic, and deletion lines. The tests of both allelism and resistance specificity suggested that the resistance gene found in CH7086 was not Yr17, which was the only current formally named Yr gene on chromosome 2AS. Thus, YrCH86 appeared to be a new locus and was permanently designated Yr69.

In this study, a vinyl silsesquioxane (VS) was added to a pesticide (citral) to enhance residual, thermal and anti-ultraviolet properties via three double-bond reactions in the presence of an initiator: (1) the connection of VS and citral, (2) a radical self-polymerization of VS and (3) a radical self-polymerization of citral. VS-citral, the expected and main product of the copolymerization of VS and citral, was characterized using standard spectrum techniques. The molecular consequences of the free radical polymerization were analyzed by MALDITOF spectrometry. Anti-ultraviolet and thermal stability properties of the VS-citral system were tested using scanning spectrophotometry (SSP) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The repellency of VS-citral decreased over time, from 97.63% at 0 h to 72.98% at 1 h and 60.0% at 2 h, as did the repellency of citral, from 89.56% at 0 h to 62.73% at 1 h and 50.95% at 2 h.

The study evaluated the Waxy gene variability in 59 accessions of six diploid Triticum and Aegilops species. The percentages of variable sites, singleton variable sites, and parsimony informative sites were 16.38, 5.59, and 10.79 %, respectively. A total of 22 amino acid changes in the transit peptide and the remaining in the mature protein were observed. Moreover, 17 amino acid changes between Triticum and Aegilops species were also detected. Specially, Gla 14 and Phe 153 was observed in diploid Triticum, compared with Thr 14 and Tyr 153 in diploid Aegilops. Two types of amino acids, Gla 5/Val 5 and Ile 140/Val 140, were identified in T. urartu, as well as Val 22/Phe 22, Thr 52/Lys 52, and Gln 54/delete in A. tauschii. The insertion/deletions (InDels) had high frequency in intron region, but very low in transit peptide and exon region. Neighbour-joining tree showed that 146 sequences from 23 species could be clustered into eight groups with the species characterizations. The Wx-B1 of polyploid Triticum were grouped with A. sharonensis, A. longissima, A. searsii, A. speltoides, while Wx-D1 of T. aestivum and T. spelta together with A. umbellulata, A. markgrafii, A. comosa, and A. tauschii. The Wx-A1 of polyploid Triticum were separated clearly with the diploid species. The Wx-B1 could be divided into two subgroups and maybe had two phylogenetic origins, but most of them were related to A. speltoides. Waxy gene of A. tauschii also had two subgroups, and the sequences from southern Caspian (Mazandaran, Iran) were more closed with Wx-D1. The variability of 5' Un-Translation Region (UTR) of waxy was stronger than intron and exon region based on genetic distance. Phylogeography analysis showed that geography affected strongly the distribution of all accessions along the north-south axis based on the partial open reading fragment (ORF) of waxy gene, A. speltoides and A. longissima along the west-east axis and north-south axis based on exon, and A. tauschii along the west-east axis based on 5' UTR, respectively. Our results suggest that diploid Triticum and Aegilops have new waxy gene resources; waxy gene could play a more important role in genetic exploitation, genetic relationship evaluation and phylogeography investigation.

In this study, DEV UL54 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm was verified with a heterokaryon assay. One predicted nuclear export sequence (NES) (339-348 aa) was shown to be functional and chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent; however, the insensitivity of UL54 to Leptomycin B (LMB) and NES mutation suggests that other mechanisms are responsible for the observed nuclear export. Next, three non-classical nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), referred to as NLS1 (105-122 aa), NLS2 (169-192 aa) and NLS3 (257-274 aa), were identified. Furthermore, a recombinant DEV with the UL54 NLSs deleted (DEV- UL54 mNLSs) was constructed and showed that UL54 NLSs moderately affected DEV growth.

Herein, the pore and adsorption properties of wine lees-derived biochar were explored. Specifically, the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of Pb2+ onto wine lees-derived biochar were examined. Experimental results revealed that wine lees-derived biochar featured large specific surface area and total pore volume, and high contents of -COOH and -OH on its surface. Adsorption of Pb2+ onto wine lees-derived biochar proceeded via a multilayer adsorption mechanism, as described by the Freundlich adsorption model. Adsorption kinetics followed the Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetics model; adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 30-60 min. Furthermore, the effect of solution pH on the adsorption of Pb2+ was investigated. Within the studied pH range of 3-6, the adsorption capacity increased with increasing pH. Under established optimized conditions, wine lees-derived biochar achieved a Pb2+ adsorption capacity of 79.12 mg/g.

The wheat-rye 1BLaEuro cent 1RS translocation line from Petkus rye has contributed substantially to the world wheat production. However, due to extensive growing of cultivars with disease resistance genes from short arm of rye chromosome 1R and coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance, these cultivars successively lost resistance to pathogens. In this study, a new wheat-rye line K13-868, derived from the progenies of wheat-rye-Psathyrostachys huashanica trigeneric hybrids, was identified and analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), and molecular markers. Cytological studies indicated that the mean chromosome configuration of K13-868 at meiosis was 2n = 42 = 0.14 I + 18.78 II (ring) + 2.15 II (rod). Sequential FISH and GISH results demonstrated that K13-868 was a compensating wheat-rye 1BLaEuro cent 1RS Robertsonian translocation line. Acid PAGE analysis revealed that clear specific bands of rye 1RS were expressed in K13-868. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and rye 1RS-specific markers omega-sec-p1/omega-sec-p2 and O-SEC5'-A/O-SEC3'-R suggested that the 1BS arm of wheat had been substituted by the 1RS arm of rye. At the seedling and adult growth stage, compared with its recurrent wheat parent SM51 and six other wheat cultivars containing the 1RS arm in southwestern China, K13-868 showed high levels of resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) pathogens prevalent in China, which are virulent to Yr10 and Yr24/Yr26. In addition, K13-868 expresses higher thousand-kernel weight and more grain number per spike than these controls in two growing seasons, suggesting that this line may carry yield-related genes of rye. This translocation line, with significant characteristics of resistance to stripe rust and high thousand-kernel weight and grain number per spike, could be utilized as a valuable germplasm for wheat improvement.

S. stipitis is able to in situ detoxify aldehyde inhibitors (such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)) to less toxic corresponding alcohols. However, the reduction enzymes involved in this reaction remain largely unknown. In this study, we reported that an uncharacterized open reading frame PICST_72153 (putative GRE2) from S. stipitis was highly induced in response to furfural and HMF stresses. Overexpression of this gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae improved yeast tolerance to furfural and HMF. GRE2 was identified as an aldehyde reductase which can reduce furfural to FM with either NADH or NADPH as the co-factor and reduce HMF to FDM with NADPH as the co-factor. This enzyme can also reduce multiple aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that it is a member of the subclass "intermediate" of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Although GRE2 from S. stipitis is similar to GRE2 from S. cerevisiae in a three-dimensional structure, some differences were predicted. GRE2 from S. stipitis forms loops at D133-E137 and T143-N145 locations with two alpha-helices at E154-K157 and E252-A254 locations, different GRE2 from S. cerevisiae with an alpha-helix at D133-E137 and a beta-sheet at T143-N145 locations, and two loops at E154-K157 and E252-A254 locations. This research provided guidelines for the study of other SDR enzymes from S. stipitis and other yeasts on tolerant mechanisms to aldehyde inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic biomass.

However, the effects of different chronosequence phases on the changes of fluoride fractions in these plantations are poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the distribution of extractable fluoride fractions in four differently aged tea plantations (16, 23, 31, and 53 years old, respectively), in Zhongfeng Township of Ming-shan County, Sichuan, Southwest China. This study aimed to determine the effects of the age of various tea plantations with respect the contents of T-F, also considering the water-soluble fluoride (Ws-F), the exchangeable fluoride (Ex-F), the Fe/Mn oxide-bound fluoride (Fe/Mn-F), the organic matter-bound fluoride (Or-F), and the residual fluoride (Res-F) within soil aggregates. The T-F, Ws-F, Ex-F, and Res-F contents increased with the decreasing of particle size except for Fe/Mn-F and Or-F. Along with the increase of tea plant life, the contents of Ws-F and Ex-F within soil aggregates gradually increased. In addition, the trends of extractable Fe/Mn-F and Or-F were opposite to that of highly available fluoride after 23 years. The results of this study show that fluoride is easily transformed into highly available phases in long-term tea plantations, improving the absorption of fluoride for tea plants.

Effects of Inulin Supplementation in Low- or High-Fat Diets on Reproductive Performance of Sows and Antioxidant Defence Capacity in Sows and Offspring	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; FIBER SUPPLEMENTATION; GESTATING SOWS; BODY CONDITION; FETAL-DEVELOPMENT; LACTATION; PREGNANCY; RATS; PIGLETS; DIGESTIBILITY	Contents This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of inulin supplementation in low- or high-fat diets on both the reproductive performance of sow and the antioxidant defence capacity in sows and offspring. Sixty LandracexYorkshire sows were randomly allocated to four treatments with low-fat diet (L), low-fat diet containing 1.5% inulin (LI), high-fat diet (H) and high-fat diet containing 1.5% inulin (HI). Inulin-rich diets lowered the within-litter birth weight coefficient of variation (CV, p=0.05) of piglets, increased the proportion of piglets weighing 1.0-1.5kg at farrowing (p<0.01), reduced the loss of body weight (BW) and backfat thickness (BF) during lactation (p<0.05) and decreased the duration of farrowing as well as improved sow constipation (p<0.05). Sows fed fat-rich diets gained more BW during gestation (p<0.01), farrowed a greater number of total (+1.65 pigs, p<0.05) and alive (+1.52 pigs p<0.05) piglets and had a heavier (+2.06kg, p<0.05) litter weight at birth as well as a decreased weaning-to-oestrous interval (WEI, p<0.01) compared with sows fed low-fat diets. However, it is worth noting that the H diet significantly decreased the serum activities of superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and increased the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in sows and piglets (p<0.05). In contrast, HI diet enhanced the activities of T-SOD and GSH-Px and decreased the serum MDA concentrations (p<0.05) in sows and piglets. In summary, the fat-rich diets fed to sows during gestation had beneficial effects on reproductive performance, but aggravated the oxidative stress in sow and piglets. Inulin-rich diets fed to sow during gestation had beneficial effects on within-litter uniformity of piglet birthweight and enhanced the antioxidant defence capacity of sows and piglets.	[Wang, Y.

Effects of dietary mannan oligosaccharide supplementation on performance and immune response of sows and their offspring	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Immune response; Mannan oligosaccharide; Performance; Piglet; Sow	RESPIRATORY SYNDROME VIRUS; WEANLING PIGS; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; WEANED PIGS; PHARMACOLOGICAL ADDITIONS; PHOSPHORYLATED MANNANS; YEAST; IMMUNOCOMPETENCE; NUTRITION; COLOSTRUM	The present study investigated the effects of mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) supplementation of the diets of sows and/or their offspring on maternal and offspring performance and immune status. Sixty multiparous sows were fed either the control diet (sCON, n = 30) or the control diet containing 400 mg/kg MOS (sMOS, n = 30) from d 86 of gestation until weaning. On d 7 of age, offspring were assigned within sow treatments to the piglet basal diet (pCON) or the piglet basal diet supplemented with 800 mg/kg MOS (pMOS) for 28 days. No dietary effect was observed on the number of total piglets born and born alive and the piglet weight at birth. Immunoglobulins concentrations in sow colostrum and milk were not affected by sow diet MOS supplementation (P > 0.05). However, the weaning to estrus interval of sows was shortened significantly in the sMOS treatment compared with that of the sCON treatment (P = 0.05). The weaning weight (P = 0.03) and pre-weaning weight gains (P = 0:01) of piglets from the sMOS sows were greater than that of piglets from the sCON sows. Furthermore, piglets from sMOS had higher serum concentrations of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (P < 0.01), immunoglobulin G (IgG) (P < 0.01), complement 3 (C3) (P < 0.01), complement 4 (C4) (P = 0.05) and lysozyme (LYZ) (P < 0.01) at weaning, as well as C3 (P < 0.01) and LYZ (P < 0.01) on d 35 of age. Piglet dietary MOS improved both pre- and post-weaning weight gain (P < 0.01) and increased serum concentrations of IgA (P = 0.01) and IgG (P = 0.01) at weaning, as well as C3 (P < 0.01), LYZ (P < 0.01) and C4 (P = 0.01) on d 35 of age. Piglets coming from both supplemented groups, sow and piglet's diets, showed the best performance and immune status at weaning and at 35 d of life. These results may suggest that those improvements at the pre-weaning stage may be partly derived by MOS sow's supplementation, being additive its effect when MOS were also added in pre- and post-weaning piglet diets.

Tryptamine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, and spermidine were analyzed by UV detection after pre-column derivatization with dansyl chloride. There were wide ranges of different biogenic amines in the samples, except spermidine. The results showed that the histamine was the major biogenic amines, followed by tyramine and cadaverine, which have a mean value of 196.06 mg/kg (ranging from 114.33 to 327.35 mg/kg), 164.67 mg/kg (ranging from 88.84 to 285.89 mg/kg), and 141.65 mg/kg (ranging from 19.14 to 376.46 mg/kg), respectively. The toxicity limit of histamine is 100 mg/kg, where all of the samples exceeded this limit. None of the samples of total biogenic amines content exceeded 1000 mg/kg. The results showed that the amounts of biogenic amines in Sichuan-style spontaneously fermented sausages sold in Sichuan retail markets may pose a potential health risk for sensitive individuals. This suggested that it is necessary to improve the production techniques and the raw materials' hygienic quality, to ensure the quality and safety of this fermented sausages with respect to their biogenic amine content.

The possible molecular formulas of the constituents deduced based on the parent triacylglycerols (TAGs) were investigated in three MW distributions. TAGs and oxygenated TAGs were found in region A (m/z853-1001). Diacylglycerols (DAGs), oxygenated DAGs, and oxidized TAG decomposition products were observed in region B (m/z600-853). Combination products between one TAG and one or two short-chain oxidative decomposition products (ODPs), one TAG and one DAG, two TAGs (dimers), one TAG dimer and one or more short-chain ODPs, and three TAGs (trimers) and so on were shown in region C (m/z1001-3000). Some even MWs were assigned to nitrogen- and sulfur-containing TAG derivatives due to the introduction of proteins contained in CBM. Furthermore, the possible reaction mechanisms which occurred during the deep-fat frying process were also discussed based on the deduced molecular structures of constituents. Depending on the obtained results, the composition profile of frying oil can be well elucidated by the MALDI-TOF-MS-based method for the quality monitoring of the frying oil or fried food.

Vitamin E is an essential vitamin that animals must obtain from their diet for proper growth and development. gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT), which catalyzes the conversion of delta- and gamma-tocopherols (or tocotrienols) to beta- and alpha-tocopherols (or tocotrienols), respectively, is the final enzyme involved in the vitamin E biosynthetic pathway. The overexpression of M. sativa L.'s gamma-TMT (MsTMT) increased the alpha-tocopherol content 10-15 fold above that of wild type Arabidopsis seeds without altering the total content of vitamin E. Additionally, in response to osmotic stress, the biomass and the expression levels of several osmotic marker genes were significantly higher in the transgenic lines compared with wild type. Overexpression of MsTMT in alfalfa led to a modest, albeit significant, increase in alpha-tocopherol in leaves and was also responsible for a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. Additionally, the crude protein content was increased, while the acid and neutral detergent fiber contents were unchanged in these transgenic lines. Thus, increased alpha-tocopherol content occurred in transgenic alfalfa without compromising the nutritional qualities. The targeted metabolic engineering of vitamin E biosynthesis through MsTMT overexpression provides a promising approach to improve the alpha-tocopherol content of forage crops. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Effect of fabricated density and bamboo species on physical-mechanical properties of bamboo fiber bundle reinforced composites	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							ANATOMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; HEIGHT; LUMBER	Bamboo stems were subjected to a mechanical treatment process for the extraction of bamboo fiber bundles. The fiber bundles were used as reinforcement for the fabrication of high-performance composites with phenolic resins as matrix. The influence of fabricated density and bamboo species on physical-mechanical properties of bamboo fiber bundle reinforced composites (BFCs) was evaluated. The results revealed that BFCs with density of 1200 kg/m(3) exhibited lower water absorption, better dimensional stability, and higher mechanical properties with comparison to those with lower density. The changes in microstructures of BFCs with respect to density gave evidence that the high performance of BFCs with high density was due to the almost complete collapse of bamboo lumens, which resulted in the formation of solid bamboo and thin resin films with water resistance ability. BFCs fabricated from five bamboo species all showed better properties compared to commercialized bamboo-based composites. However, significant differences in physical-mechanical properties of BFCs among bamboo species were also found. This may be attributed to the variations in anatomical structure and physical-mechanical properties among original bamboo species. From a practical production view, the effect of bamboo species on properties of BFCs should be properly taken into consideration.

However, it remains unclear about the similarities and differences between Rbm24 and Rbm38 in terms of their sequence characteristics and expression profiles during myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle development. In this study, we found that the coding domain sequences (CDSs) of duck Rbm24 and Rbm38 consisted of 678 and 648 nucleotides, respectively. Both of them contain a conserved RNA-recognition motif (RRM). Phylogenetic analysis showed that duck Rbm24 and Rbm38 were clustered with other Ayes, nevertheless, avian Rbm24 was clustered with mammalian and reptilian Rbm24; avian Rbm38 was clustered with amphibian and reptilian Rbm38. Real-time PCR results exhibited that during embryonic stage, Rbm24 and Rbm38 in leg and breast muscle increased to their peak (P < 0.01) at same time. During postnatal stage, the peak of Rbm24 and Rbm38 in leg were found at W5, while the peak of them in breast was found at W6 (P < 0.01). Moreover, a relative high value of Rbm24 and Rbm38 in leg was found at W1 and W3, respectively. Additionally, both Rbm24 and Rbm38 expressed at each stage of duck myoblast differentiation, however, Rbm24 shared similar expression profiles with MEF2C, and Rbm38 shared similar expression profiles with MyoG and MEF2A. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering results were consistent with the preceding findings. These results serve as a foundation for further investigations about similar and different effects of Rbm24 and Rbm38 on myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle development.

Effects of feed restriction on the upper temperature tolerance and heat shock response in juvenile green and white sturgeon	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Critical thermal maximum; Heat shock proteins; Sturgeon; Stress tolerance; Nutritional status	SAN-FRANCISCO ESTUARY; ORGANISM THERMAL TOLERANCE; ACIPENSER-MEDIROSTRIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; POTAMOCORBULA-AMURENSIS; DIETARY METHYLMERCURY; OLIGOCOTTUS-MACULOSUS; FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS; SALINITY TOLERANCE	The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of feed restriction on whole-organism upper thermal tolerance and the heat shock response of green and white sturgeon to determine how changes in food amount might influence physiological performance of each species when faced with temperature stress. Two parallel feed restriction trials were carried out for juvenile green (202 g; 222-day post hatch: dph) and white sturgeon (205 g; 197-dph) to manipulate nutritional status at 12.5%, 25%, 50%, or 100% of optimum feeding rate (100% OFR were 1.6% and 1.8% body weight/day, respectively) for four weeks. Following the trials, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax, 0.3 degrees C/min) of sturgeon (N = 12/treatment/species) was assessed as an indicator of whole-organism upper thermal tolerance. To assess temperature sensitivity, sturgeon (N = 9/treatment/species) were acutely transferred to two temperature treatments (28 degrees C and 18 degrees C as a handling control) for 2 h followed by 2 h of recovery at 18 degrees C before being sacrificed, and gill, brain, and mucus sampled for measurements of 70-kDa heat shock protein levels (Hsc/Hsp70). Feeding rate had species-specific effects on CTMax in green and white sturgeon such that CTMax of green sturgeon decreased as the magnitude of feed restriction increased; whereas, CTMax of white sturgeon did not change with feed restriction. Elevated temperature (28 degrees C) and feed restriction increased Hsc/Hsp70 levels in the gill tissue of green sturgeon, while heat shock increased Hsc/Hsp70 levels in the mucus of white sturgeon. Our results suggest that green sturgeon may be more susceptible to temperature stress under food-limited conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Lee, Seunghyung; Hung, Silas S.

The Effect of Dietary Replacement of Ordinary Rice with Red Yeast Rice on Nutrient Utilization, Enteric Methane Emission and Rumen Archaeal Diversity in Goats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PURPUREUS-FERMENTED RICE; MONASCUS-PURPUREUS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; DAIRY-COWS; SHEEP; BIOSYNTHESIS; REDUCTASE; INHIBITION	Twenty castrated Boer crossbred goats were used in the present study with two treatments to examine the effect of dietary replacement of ordinary rice with red yeast rice on nutrient utilization, enteric methane emission and ruminal archaea structure and composition. Two treatment diets contained (DM basis) 70.0% of forage, 21.8% of concentrates and 8.2% of either ordinary rice (control) or red yeast rice (RYR). Nutrient utilization was measured and enteric methane emissions were determined in respiration chambers. Results showed that RYR had significantly lower digestibility of N and organic matter compared to control group. However, feeding red yeast rice did not affect N retention as g/d or a proportion of N intake, and reduced heat production as MJ/d or as a proportion of metabolizable energy intake, thus leading to a higher proportion of metabolizable energy intake to be retained in body tissue. RYR also had significantly lower methane emissions either as g/d, or as a proportion of feed intake. Although feeding red yeast rice had no negative effect on any rumen fermentation variables, it decreased serum contents of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. In the present study, 75616 archaeal sequences were generated and clustered into 2364 Operational Taxonomic Units. At the genus level, the predominant archaea in the rumen of goats was Methanobrevibacter, which was significantly inhibited with the supplementation of red yeast rice. In conclusion, red yeast rice is a potential feed ingredient for mitigation of enteric methane emissions of goats. However, caution should be taken when it is used because it may inhibit the digestibility of some nutrients. Further studies are required to evaluate its potential with different diets and animal species, as well as its effects on animal health and food safety.	[Wang, L. Z.; Zhou, M. L.; Wang, J.

The objectives of this study were to examine whether increased GABA could improve heat tolerance in cool-season creeping bentgrass through physiological analysis, and to determine major metabolic pathways regulated by GABA through metabolic profiling. Plants were pretreated with 0.5 mM GABA or water before exposed to non-stressed condition (21/19 degrees C) or heat stress (35/30 degrees C) in controlled growth chambers for 35 d. The growth and physiological analysis demonstrated that exogenous GABA application significantly improved heat tolerance of creeping bentgrass. Metabolic profiling found that exogenous application of GABA led to increases in accumulations of amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, threonine, serine, and valine), organic acids (aconitic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, and threonic acid), sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, galactose, and maltose), and sugar alcohols (mannitol and myo-inositol). These findings suggest that GABA-induced heat tolerance in creeping bentgrass could involve the enhancement of photosynthesis and ascorbate-glutathione cycle, the maintenance of osmotic adjustment, and the increase in GABA shunt. The increased GABA shunt could be the supply of intermediates to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle of respiration metabolism during a long-term heat stress, thereby maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

To understand the molecular mechanisms associated with salt stress and identify genes of potential importance in cultivated chrysanthemum, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of chrysanthemum. Two cDNA libraries were generated from the control and salt-treated samples (Sample_0510_control and Sample_0510_treat) of leaves. By using the Illumina Solexa RNA sequencing technology, 94 million high quality sequencing reads and 161,522 unigenes were generated and then we annotated unigenes through comparing these sequences to diverse protein databases. A total of 126,646 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were identified in leaf. Plant hormones, amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis and secondary metabolism were all changed under salt stress after the complete list of GO term and KEGG enrichment analysis. The hormone biosynthesis changing and oxidative hurt decreasing appeared to be significantly related to salt tolerance of chrysanthemum. Important protein kinases and major transcription factor families involved in abiotic stress were differentially expressed, such as MAPKs, CDPKs, MYB, WRKY, AP2 and HD-zip. In general, these results can help us to confirm the molecular regulation mechanism and also provide us a comprehensive resource of chrysanthemum under salt stress.

J	Su, HF; Zhu, J; Liu, G; Tan, FR				Su, HaiFeng; Zhu, Jun; Liu, Gang; Tan, Furong			Investigation of availability of a high throughput screening method for predicting butanol solvent -producing ability of Clostridium beijerinckii	BMC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Screening; Clostridium beijerinckii; Butanol; Trypan blue dye; Starch	CELL VIABILITY; ACETOBUTYLICUM; FERMENTATION; DEHYDROGENASE	Background: Currently, efficient screening methods for selection of desired bacterial phenotypes from large populations are not easy feasible or readily available due to the complicated physiological and metabolic networks of solventogenic clostridia. In this study, to contribute to the improvement of methods for predicting the butanol-producing ability of Clostridium beijerinckii based on starch substrate, we further investigate a simple, visualization screening method for selecting target strains from mutant library of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 by using trypan blue dye as an indicator in solid starch via statistical survey and validation of fermentation experiment with controlling pH. Results: To verify an effective, efficient phenotypic screening method for isolating high butanol-producing mutants, the revalidation process was conducted based on Trypan Blue was used for visualization, and starch was used as the bacterial metabolic substrate. The availability of the screening system was further evaluated based on the relationship between characteristics of mutant strains and their alpha-amylase activities. Mutant clones were analyzed in detail based on their distinctive growth patterns and rate of fermentation of soluble starch to form butanol and were compared by statistical method. Significant correlations were identified between colony morphology and changes in butanol concentrations. The screening method was validated via statistical analysis for characterizing phenotypic parameters. The fermentation experiment of mutant strains with controlling pH value also demonstrated a positive correlation between increased alpha-amylase activity and increased solvent production by Clostridium beijerinckii was observed, and therefore indicated that the trypan blue dyeing method can be used as a fast method to screen target mutant strain for better solvent producers from, for instance, a mutant library. Conclusions: The suitability of the novel screening procedure was validated, opening up a new indicator of approach to select mutant solventogenic clostridia with improved fermentation of starch to increase butanol concentrations. The applicability can easily be broadened to a wide range of interesting microbes such as cellulolytic or acetogenic microorganisms, which produce biofuels from feedstock rich in starch.

Improving plant tolerance to P starvation through molecular breeding is an efficient alternative to increase grain production. In the study, 331 diverse maize inbreds were used to detect nucleotide diversity and favorable alleles of ZmARF31, which plays a key role in low P responses and root architecture regulation. Significant phenotypic variation was found in each of 11 tested traits under both P and no-P treatments, and 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 14 insertiondeletions (InDels) were detected in ZmARF31 among the 331 maize inbreds. The 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of ZmARF31 showed a small linkage disequilibrium (LD) block under significant purifying selection, whereas the 3'-UTR showed the most abundant diversity and a larger LD block. Thirty, fourteen, and nine natural variations were identified in ZmARF31 that were associated with P-deficiency-tolerance traits (P <= 0.01) by using the general linear model (GLM), GLM incorporated with population structure, and mixed linear model, respectively. Four SNPs were significantly associated with the total dry weight (TDW) in the three models, of which SNPs S410 and S462 were located in a complete LD block. A further verification conducted in a recombinant inbred line population revealed that favorable allele G/G of non-synonymous mutation S410 and favorable allele with a 38 bp insertion of InDel S1442 exhibited positive genetic effects on the TDW and total root tips, respectively. Expression analysis further confirmed that ZmARF31 was highly expressed in the roots of low-P-tolerant inbred 178. The protein encoded by ZmARF31 was located both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Haplotypes carrying more favorable alleles showed a greater effect on phenotypic variation than single loci. Such haplotypes should be helpful to develop valuable genetic markers and perform maize molecular breeding.

Whether WGD is accompanied by the evolution of epigenetic regulators remains to be explored. Here we investigate whole genome methylation, gene expression, and miRNA regulation among monoploid, diploid, and triploid rice plants isolated from a twin-seedling population. The DNA methylation patterns in the three different ploidy plants were highly similar, with DNA methylation primarily enriched in the promoters. We examined the methylation of single genes and detected around 25,500 methylated genes, of which 22,751 were methylated in all three lines. Significantly divergent DNA methylation patterns between each pair of three lines were only detected in 64 genes, though more genes were found to exhibit differential expression. Analysis of DNA methylation and expression patterns showed that higher DNA methylation levels upstream of the transcription start sites are correlated with higher levels of expression of related genes; whereas higher DNA methylation levels in gene body regions are correlated with lower levels of expression. We also carried out high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries and identified 36 new miRNAs. These miRNAs have different expression levels depending on the ploidy.

The present study was aimed to comparatively investigate the effects of surgical and immunologic castration on hypothalamic GnIH expression and endocrine function of the growth axis. Thirty-six prepubertal male rats were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 12): control, surgically castrated or immunized against 100-mu g D-Lys6-GnRH-tandem peptide conjugated to ovalbumin in Specol adjuvant at 6 weeks of age (with a booster 8 weeks later). Blood samples were collected (for hormone and urea nitrogen concentrations) at 2-week intervals, and growth performance was evaluated. Compared to intact controls, surgical castration reduced (P < 0.05) messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of hypothalamic GnIH and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), pituitary growth hormone (GH), and liver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), reduced (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of GH and IGF-1 and increased (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of urea nitrogen. In contrast, immunocastration did not alter messenger RNA expressions of hypothalamic GnIH, GHRH and pituitary GH, and the serum concentrations of GH (P > 0.05). Moreover, serum concentrations of IGF-1 and urea nitrogen in immunocastrates were substantially higher and lower than those in surgical castrates, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared to surgical castrates, immuncastrates had superior feed conversion efficiency and faster daily weight gain (P < 0.05). We concluded that surgical castration but not immunocastration is associated with reduced hypothalamic GnIH and GHRH/GH/IGF-I axis function in male rats. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that exposure to 6 mg/l Cu for 72 h induced the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in enterocytes of grass carp in vitro. Cells exposed to Cu alone resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release, which is accompanied by depletions of antioxidants, including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxy radical (AHR) activities and GSH content. Pre-treatment with Glu remarkably prevented the toxic effects of Cu on the T-SOD, GST, GR, AHR, and ASA activities and GSH content in enterocytes. However, Cu induced an adaptive increase in the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Glu supplementation further increased GPx activity in enterocytes. Interestingly, the experiment in vivo showed that Glu pre-supplementation significantly elevated SOD, GPx, GST, GR, ASA and AHR activities, as well as GSH content. Further results showed that pre-treatment with Glu could alleviate Cu-induced oxidative injury by elevating antioxidant enzyme activities through regulating the expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA. Together, these results indicated that Glu could attenuate Cu-induced cellular oxidative damage in fish intestine, likely mediated through Nrf2 signalling pathways regulating mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes and synthesis of GSH.

Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 2264) were investigated as a candidate for hydrogen storage material within DFT framework. The covalent interactions stemming from strong orbital overlaps between C-2p and Ti-3d (4s) was revealed by QTAIM and DOS analyses. The CTi72+ cluster can bind 20 H-2 molecules at most, which can result into the gravimetric density of 19%. The interaction energies between H2 molecules and CTi72+ cluster are in the range of 0.24-0.31 eV at B3LYP level of theory, and these energies are about 0.1 eV larger when long range interaction was considered with wB97xD and CAM-B3LYP functionals.

Significant differences in nutritional content were noted between parasitized and non-parasitized pupae and between venom-and phosphate buffered saline-injected pupae. When pupae were injected with venom, the fat body could not be disintegrated into granules; however, when pupae were parasitized, fat-body disintegration occurred. Electrophoresis showed no differences in hemolymph protein content between parasitized pupae and those injected with venom, indicating that the wasp did not have narrow-spectrum peptides. These findings confirmed that S. sichuanensis was a typical idiobiont ectoparasitoid wasp, and that nutrient regulation was similar between idiobiont and koinobiont wasps. The strong similarities between the two treatments suggest that venom injection is a major factor responsible for changes in host nutrient content. The wasp fed mainly on reducing sugars, free amino acids, and fat-body tissues; larval fat bodies were derived from hemolymph and from host tissue. Our findings suggest that lipid catabolism might be accelerated, and that lipid biosynthesis might be inhibited, when host pupae are parasitized or injected with venom. In addition to venom, physiological and biochemical changes that occur during the parasitic process might be caused by venom, ovarian proteins, saliva, or secretions.

The present study was performed to evaluate the prevalence, genotypic diversity and zoonotic potential of E. bieneusi among wildlife at Chengdu and Bifengxia zoological gardens in Sichuan Province, China. Results: Of the 272 fresh fecal samples harvested from 70 captive wildlife species at Chengdu Zoo (n = 198) and Bifengxia Zoo (n = 74), 21 (10.6 %) and 22 (29.7 %) tested positive for E. bieneusi by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing analysis, respectively. Specifically, genotypes D, Peru 6, CHB1, BEB6, CHS9, SC02 and SC03, and genotypes D, CHB1, SC01 and SC02 were detected in the Chengdu and Bifengxia Zoo samples, respectively. Five known genotypes (D, Peru 6, BEB6, CHS9 and CHB1) and three novel genotypes (SC01, SC02 and SC03) were clustered into the zoonotic group (group 1) and host-adapted group (group 2). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis targeting three microsatellites (MS1, MS3 and MS7) and one minisatellite (MS4) were successfully sequenced for 37, 33, 35 and 37 specimens, generating 8, 3, 11 and 15 distinct locus types, respectively. Altogether, we identified 27 multilocus genotypes (MLGs) among the E. bieneusi isolates by MLST. These data highlight the high genetic diversity of E. bieneusi among zoo wildlife. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the prevalence and genotypic diversity of E. bieneusi infections among captive wildlife in zoos in southwest China. Notably, we identified three novel E. bieneusi genotypes, as well as six new mammalian hosts (Asian golden cats, Tibetian blue bears, blackbucks, hog deer, Malayan sun bears and brown bears) for this organism. Moreover, the occurrence of zoonotic genotypes suggests that wildlife may act as reservoirs of E. bieneusi that can serve as a source of human microsporidiosis. The findings presented here should contribute to the control of zoonotic disease in China.

High-density genetic linkage mapping is a valuable and effective method for exploring complex quantitative traits. In this study, we developed 447,177 markers based on SLAF-seq and used them to perform a comparative genomics analysis. Perennial ryegrass sequences were the most similar (5.02%) to orchardgrass sequences. A high-density linkage map of orchardgrass was constructed using 2,467 SLAF markers and 43 SSRs, which were distributed on seven linkage groups spanning 715.77 cM. The average distance between adjacent markers was 0.37 cM. Based on phenotyping in four environments, 11 potentially significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for two target traits-heading date (HD) and flowering time (FT)-were identified and positioned on linkage groups LG1, LG3, and LG5. Significant QTLs explained 8.20-27.00% of the total phenotypic variation, with the LOD ranging from 3.85-12.21. Marker167780 and Marker139469 were associated with FT and HD at the same location (Ya'an) over two different years. The utility of SLAF markers for rapid generation of genetic maps and QTL analysis has been demonstrated for heading date and flowering time in a global forage grass.

Here we used a modified method of suppression-subtractive hybridization to identify two key factors involved in N-regulated flowering time control in Arabidopsis thaliana, namely ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase and the blue-light receptor cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). The expression of both genes is induced by low N levels, and their loss-of-function mutants are insensitive to altered N concentration. Low-N conditions increase both NADPH/NADP(+) and ATP/AMP ratios, which in turn affect adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Moreover, our results show that the AMPK activity and nuclear localization are rhythmic and inversely correlated with nuclear CRY1 protein abundance. Low-N conditions increase but high-N conditions decrease the expression of several key components of the central oscillator (e.g., CCA1, LHY, and TOC1) and the flowering output genes (e.g., GI and CO). Taken together, our results suggest that N signaling functions as a modulator of nuclear CRY1 protein abundance, as well as the input signal for the central circadian clock to interfere with the normal flowering process.

However, there are fewer reports about the characterization and adjuvant effects of IL-8 in fish. In this study, cloning and sequence analysis of IL-8 coding region of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were conducted, mature IL-8(rtIL-8) was expressed and evaluated for its adjuvant effects on the immunoprotection of subunit vaccine encoding alpha-enolase (rENO) of Streptococcus iniae from several aspects in channel catfish. The results showed covaccination of rENO with rtIL-8 enhanced immune responses including humoral and cellular immunity, with higher relative percent survival(RPS, 71.4%) compared with the moderate RPS of rENO alone(50%) against S. iniae infection at 4 week post vaccination. While rtIL-8 failed to maintain long-lasting immune protection, only with RPS of 26.67% in rENO + rtIL-8-vaccinated fish compared with that of rENO alone(20%) at 8 week, signifying that IL-8 hold promise for use as potential immunopotentiator in vaccines against bacterial infections in fish, whereas it is insufficient to extend the immunoprotection for long time, and further studies are required to understand the mechanisms of IL-8 used as an adjuvant and seek for more effective way to strengthen the adjuvanticity of IL-8.

Insulin Promotes the Expression of the Gluconeogenic Rate-Limiting Enzymes Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (Pepck) and Glucose 6-Phosphatase (G6pase) through PI3k/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway in Goose Hepatocytes	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						G6Pase; insulin; PEPCK; PI3k/Akt/mTOR	GENE-EXPRESSION; GLUCOSE; CANCER; LIVER; TRANSCRIPTION; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITION; RAPAMYCIN; FGF21; MTOR	To identify what makes insulin have an activating or inhibiting role in gluconeogenesis in goose hepatocytes and whether insulin regulates PEPCK and G6Pase through the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway or not, goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro. After 12h cultured in serum-free medium, hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h in the medium with no addition (control) or with the addition of 50, 100, and 150 nM of insulin, 1000 nM NVP-BEZ235, or co-addition of 150 nM insulin and 1000 nM NVP-BEZ235. Glucose concentration and PEPCK and G6Pase expression were determined. The results showed that PEPCK and G6Pase mRNA levels and activities were up regulated in the 50, 100, and 150 nM insulin treatments, while glucose concentration was not significantly altered (p>0.05). Compared with the activation role of 150 nM insulin alone, the co-treatment with 1000 nM NVP-BEZ235 and 150 nM insulin significantly down regulated PEPCK mRNA level and G6Pase protein activity (p<0.05). However, there is a different result on mRNA level of G6Pase. In conclusion, G6Pase and PEPCK are up regulated by insulin through PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway in goose hepatocytes. However, G6Pase mRNA and protein levels may be regulated by insulin through different signaling pathways.	[Xiong, X. P.; Song, Q.; Han, C. C.; Gan, W.; He, F.; Wei, S. H.; Liu, H. H.; Xu, H.

Based on morphological characteristics, 45 and 32 strains from G. inflate and G. glabra, respectively, were selected for further analyses. According to 16S rRNA sequence analysis, most of the strains belonged to genus Streptomyces and a few strains represented the rare actinobacteria Micromonospora, Rhodococcus and Tsukamurella. A total of 39 strains from G. inflate and 27 strains from G. glabra showed antimicrobial activity against at least one indicator organism. The range of the antimicrobial activity of the strains isolated from G. glabra and G. inflate was similar. A total of 34 strains from G. inflate and 29 strains from G. glabra carried at least one of the genes encoding polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and FADH2-dependent halogenase. In the type Il polyketide synthase KS alpha gene phylogenetic analysis, the strains were divided into two major clades: one included known spore pigment production-linked KS alpha sequences and other sequences were linked to the production of different types of aromatic polyketide antibiotics. Based on the antimicrobial range, the isolates that carried different KS alpha types were not separated from each other or from the isolates that did not carry KS alpha. The incongruent phylogenies of 16S rRNA and KS alpha genes indicated that the KS alpha genes were possibly horizontally transferred. In all, the liquorice plants were a rich source of biocontrol agents that may produce novel bioactive compounds.

Therefore, information on the genetic architecture of A. tauschii can aid the development of drought-resistant wheat varieties. Here, we evaluated 13 traits in 373 A. tauschii accessions grown under normal and polyethylene glycol-simulated drought stress conditions and performed a genome-wide association study using 7,185 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We identified 208 and 28 SNPs associated with all traits using the general linear model and mixed linear model, respectively, while both models detected 25 significant SNPs with genome-wide distribution. Public database searches revealed several candidate/flanking genes related to drought resistance that were grouped into three categories according to the type of encoded protein (enzyme, storage protein, and drought-induced protein). This study provided essential information for SNPs and genes related to drought resistance in A. tauschii and wheat, and represents a foundation for breeding drought-resistant wheat cultivars using marker-assisted selection.

From the single-factor experimental design, extraction with hexane resulted in the highest yield compared to petroleum ether and isopropanol. The amount of extracted rice lipids yields enhanced with increasing sonication power, temperature and time, respectively. However, excessive sonication power, temperature and prolonged time would lead to the decrease of rice lipid. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the parameters on UAE based on single factor experiment. Optimum combinations for lipid extraction yield (77.31%) were hexane, 123W, 42 degrees C and 37 min. The compositions of lipid were obtained by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and no significant differences were observed between UAE and conventional method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The total environment has been continuously changing in recent decades, especially in high-latitude regions; these alterations, however, profoundly contribute to the decomposition process, but a comprehensive recognition has not available. Here we reviewed the empirical observations and current knowledge regarding how hydrological leaching and freeze-thaw events modulate early decomposition of plant litter. Leaching contributes a considerable percentage of mass loss and carbon and nutrient release in early stage of decomposition, but the magnitudes are different between species levels depending on the chemical traits. Frequent freezing and thawing events could positively influence decomposition rate in cold biomes but also hamper soil decomposer and there is no general and predictable pattern has been emerged. Further experiments should be manipulated to estimate how the altered freezing and thawing effect on carbon and nutrient release from plant litter to better understanding the changing environment on litter decomposition.

J	Wu, Y; Wang, YJ; Du, JG; Wang, ZH; Wu, QL				Wu Yang; Wang Yingjun; Du Jinge; Wang Zhanghong; Wu Qinglian			Effects of yttrium under lead stress on growth and physiological characteristics of Microcystis aeruginosa	JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS			English	Article						yttrium; lead; MC-LR; rare earth elements; Microcystis aeruginosa	INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; CHANGING CLIMATE; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; LANTHANUM; CERIUM; ALGAE; NICKEL; BLOOMS	Yttrium is a main kind of rare earth elements (REEs) with wide applications in modern industry and farming. Lead has been considered to be one of the most important heavy metal pollutants due to its environmental persistence and tendency. In order to clarify the effects of REEs on cyanobacteria in case of suffering heavy metal pollutants, we investigated the effect of different concentrations of yttrium ion (Y3+) on the common blue-green microalgae Microcystis aeruginosa, grown under conditions of lead ion (Pb2+) stress. Growth and physiological status were tested involving several important enzyme of antioxidant defense system (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), malondiadehyde (MDA), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), soluble sugar and Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in cultured experiments. Results indicated that growth of M. aeruginosa was stimulated when treated less than 0.50 mg/L Y3+ and 0.20 mg/L is the optimum concentration. With the increasing content of Chl-a and activity of SOD, POD, CAT at the 12th day at relatively low concentration of Y3+ treatment (<= 0.20 mg/L), enhancement of photosynthesis and the improvement of eliminating active oxygen on M. aeruginosa were observed. On the contrast, soluble sugar content on algae reduced as the treatment of initial Y3+ concentration was in the range of 0.00-0.50 mg/L. Besides, there was a significant accumulation in both contents of MDA and MC-LR exposed from 1.00 to 5.00 mg/L Y3+, indicating that the ruin of antioxidant defense system and further aggravation to the existence of algal cell may be due to MC-LR releasing. M. aeruginosa might suffer a more positive physiological impact for exposure of relatively low Y3+ concentration against Pb2+ stress harm, which provided a far-reaching significance on blue-green algae research.

Here, we describe the antiviral activity of goose type I interferon (IFN alpha) and type II interferon (IFN gamma) against duck plague virus (DPV). Recombinant goose IFN alpha and IFN gamma proteins of approximately 20 kDa and 18 kDa, respectively, were expressed. Following DPV-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) infection of duck embryo fibroblast cells (DEFs) with IFN alpha and IFN gamma pre-treatment, the number of viral gene copies decreased more than 100-fold, with viral titers dropping approximately 100-fold. Compared to the control, DPV-EGFP cell positivity was decreased by goose IFN alpha and IFN gamma at 36 hpi (3.89%; 0.79%) and 48 hpi (17.05%; 5.58%). In accordance with interferon-stimulated genes being the "workhorse" of IFN activity, the expression of duck myxovirus resistance (Mx) and oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL) was significantly upregulated (p < 0.001) by IFN treatment for 24 h. Interestingly, duck cells and goose cells showed a similar trend of increased ISG expression after goose IFN alpha and IFN gamma pretreatment. Another interesting observation is that the positive feedback regulation of type I IFN and type II IFN by goose IFN alpha and IFN gamma was confirmed in waterfowl for the first time. These results suggest that the antiviral activities of goose IFN alpha and IFN gamma can likely be attributed to the potency with which downstream genes are induced by interferon. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the functional significance of the interferon antiviral system in aquatic birds and to the development of interferon-based prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against viral disease.

Herein, we report a CoO/MoOx crystalline/amorphous structure as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Converted from CoMoO4 by hydrogenation, the CoO/MoOx, featured with crystalline CoO in amorphous MoOx matrix, displays superior catalytic activities toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It shows small onset overpotentials of 40 and 230 mV for the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and overall water splitting starting at 1.53 V with a robust stability. The high catalytic activity of the CoO/MoOx is benefited from the large defect-rich interface between CoO and MoOx, along with the amorphous nature of MoOx. Thus, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of structural manipulation in developing highly active electrocatalysts for overall electrochemical water splitting.

Like many plant hormonal signaling systems, SLs act by promoting ubiquitination of target proteins and their subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Recently, SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8, members of the SMAX1-LIKE (SMXL) family of chaperonin-like proteins, have been identified as proteolytic targets of SL signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate downstream events remain largely unclear. Here, we show that SMXL7 functions in the nucleus, as does the SL receptor, DWARF14 (D14). We show that nucleus-localized D14 can physically interact with both SMXL7 and the MAX2 F-box protein in a SL-dependent manner and that disruption of specific conserved domains in SMXL7 affects its localization, SL-induced degradation, and activity. By expressing and overexpressing these SMXL7 protein variants, we show that shoot tissues are broadly sensitive to SMXL7 activity, but degradation normally buffers the effect of increasing SMXL7 expression. SMXL7 contains a well-conserved EAR (ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR Amphiphilic Repression) motif, which contributes to, but is not essential for, SMXL7 functionality. Intriguingly, different developmental processes show differential sensitivity to the loss of the EAR motif, raising the possibility that there may be several distinct mechanisms at play downstream of SMXL7.

It plays critical roles in fetal development and neonatal growth and is especially important for brain development in mammals. In the present study, we profiled the expression pattern and methylation signature of the DIO3 gene in goats. The complete coding sequence of caprine DIO3 encoded a protein of 301 amino acids and harbored an internal selenocysteine-encoding TGA codon. The DIO3 messenger RNA (mRNA) was predominantly expressed in the neonatal goat liver (P < 0.01), while expression in other tissues was quite low, with the lowest levels in the lung. In in situ hybridization, the DIO3 mRNA was predominantly localized in the liver and the lowest content was detected in the lung. The DIO3 transcript was widely localized in neurons and the neuropil. Methylation profiling of the DIO3 CpG island showed a significant difference between the 5' region (CpGs_1 similar to 24) and the 3' region (CpG_25 similar to 51) of the coding region. Furthermore, no significant difference in methylation status was observed among the six tested tissues with levels in the range of 29.11-33.12 %. The CpG islands in the intergenic-differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) showed significantly different methylated levels among tissues, and the highest methylated level was observed in lung (CpG island 1, 69.34 %) and longissimus dorsi (LD) (CpG island 2, 52.62 %) tissues. Our study lays a foundation for understanding DIO3 function and the diseases caused by altered methylation profiles of the DIO3 gene.

In this study, we used real-time qPCR to investigate the abundance of bacteria, archaea, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), and the amoA gene transcripts, during the decomposition of dwarf bamboo (Fargesia nitida) litter under different snow patches at various snow-cover stages in an alpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau in China. The effects of snow thickness were significant, with thicker snow patches resulting in higher microbial abundance and the amoA gene transcripts, while the degree of the effects were different. Compared with AOB, AOA were more abundant on the majority of sampling dates during the freeze-thaw period, and as well as their amoA gene transcripts. AOA are more persistent and abundant than AOB, and the higher AOA/AOB ratios were observed clearly in shrub litter and continued to decrease as the snow thickness increased, meanwhile gradually increased under uniform snow thickness over time. Our results suggested that the reduced seasonal snow cover and shortened freeze-thaw cycle periods caused by winter warming would significantly affect the ammonia oxidizers particularly tied to the ammonia oxidation process, and then could contribute to N cycle as related to litter in alpine forest ecosystems.

The diets comprised a normal protein diet (NP, 14.5% crude protein), a low crude protein diet supplemented with 0.27% alanine (LP + Ala, 10.0% crude protein), or a low crude protein diet supplemented with 0.40% leucine (LP + Leu, 10.0% crude protein). The whole-body protein synthesis rate, whole-body protein breakdown rate and protein deposition rate in pigs fed the LP + Leu diet were similar to the NP diet (P > 0.05), and both were significantly higher than pigs fed the LP + Ala diet (P < 0.05). The Longissimus muscle area (LMA) of pigs fed the LP + Leu diet was larger than those fed the LP + Ala diet (P = 0.05). In addition, drip loss and intramuscular fat of pigs fed the LP + Ala diet were higher than that of the others (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation of leucine in low protein diet could stimulate protein deposition and improve the meat quality of finishing pigs more than an alanine-supplemented one.

In this study, a full-length open reading frame (ORF) of AGP-L gene (named as Agp2) in wheat and a series of Agp2 gene sequences in wheat relatives were isolated. The coding region of Agp2 contained 15 exons and 14 introns including a full-length ORF of 1566 nucleotides, and the deduced protein contained 522 amino acids (57.8 kDa). Generally, the phylogenetic tree of Agp2 indicated that sequences from A-and D-genome donor species were most similar to each other and sequences from B-genome donor species contained more variation. Starch accumulation and Agp2 expression in wheat grains reached their peak at 21 and 15 days post anthesis (DPA), respectively.

This paper examines the relationship between the content of sulfuric radicals and uronic acid in BPL and the antioxidant activity of BPL. Materials and Methods: The free radicals, 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+) and 1,1-diphnyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH-), were used to determine the antioxidant activity of BPL. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of BPL-1 and BPL-2 revealed typical characteristics of polysaccharides. Results: The two sample types had different contents. This was proved by their different adsorption peak intensities. The IC50 values of BPL-1 (31.189 mg/ml) and BPL-2 (1.863 mg/ml) showed significant DPPH radical scavenging activity. Based on the quantification of ABTS radical scavenging, the IC50 value of BPL-1 (5.460 mg/ml) was higher than that of BPL-2 (0.239 mg/ml). Therefore, in terms of the reducing power, the IC50 value of BPL-1 was too high to determine, and the IC50 value of BPL-2 was found to be 50.557 mg/ml. Hence, the antioxidant activity and total reducing power were high, and they were greater in BPL-2 than in BPL-1. In addition, BPL-2 was found to have more sulfuric radicals and uronic acid than BPL-1. Conclusion: The contents of sulfuric radicals and uronic acid are significantly correlated to the antioxidant activity and reducing power of BPL; the more sulfuric radicals and uronic acid, the more antioxidant activity and reducing power BPL has.

The objectives of this study were to estimate broad-sense heritabilities for tillering-related traits, to analyze correlations between biomass yield and the traits, and to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for them. A first-generation selfed population of NL94 plant and a hybrid population between NL94 and SL93 plants were field established in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Stillwater and Perkins, OK. Phenotypic data were collected in 2 yr and genotypic data were obtained by genotyping simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers in the two populations on the basis of two preexisting genetic maps. Plant base size (PBS), plant girth (PG), tillering ability (TA), tiller diameter (TD), and tiller dry weight (TDW) were positively correlated with biomass yield in both populations. Consistently, PBS had the largest correlation coefficients for biomass yield, suggesting its value as an indirect selection criterion for biomass yield. Twenty and 26 QTL for six tillering-related traits were detected in the hybrid and selfed population, respectively. Among the QTL, one on linkage group (LG) 5a between sww-2387/PVCAG-2197/2198 and PVGA-1649/1650 for PBS, PG, and TA and another on LG 2a between sww-2640/sww-2545 and PVCA-765/766 for TD and TDW were stably detected in multiple environments in the two populations. The findings add to the knowledge base regarding the genetics of tillering-related traits that could be used in accelerating the development of high-yielding cultivars through marker-assisted selection.

In this study, we found higher absorption of Cd by the roots of A. hybridus than by its other organs. To understand the mechanism of Cd accumulation in A. hybridus roots, a comparative proteomic approach was used to differentiate the two-dimensional electrophoretic profiles of root proteins in Cd-free and Cd-treated plants. Twenty-eight differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Of these, 10 were specifically expressed under Cd stress, and another 11 were upregulated and 7 downregulated by >2.5-fold under Cd stress. We observed increased expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism, protein metabolism, stress and defense, and signal transduction. These changes likely enhanced Cd tolerance and enrichment in A. hybridus. The downregulated proteins were mainly involved in the synthesis of microRNAs, cell walls, and other structural components. These observations were further confirmed by quantitative fluorescence PCR. The resulting differences in protein expression patterns suggest that redirection of root cell metabolism might be an important survival mechanism for A. hybridus under Cd stress.

HCV genotype 1 is the subject of intense research and clinical investigations because of its worldwide prevalence and poor access to treatment for patients in developing countries and marginalized populations. The predominant subtypes 1a and 1b of HCV genotype 1 present considerable differences in epidemiological features. However, the genetic signature underlying such phenotypic functional divergence is still an open question. Here, we performed a genome-wide evolutionary study on HCV subtypes 1a and 1b. The results show that adaptive selection has driven the diversification between these subtypes. Furthermore, the major adaptive divergence-related changes have occurred on proteins E1, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Structurally, a number of adaptively selected sites cluster in functional regions potentially relevant to (i) membrane attachment and (ii) the interactions with viral and host cell factors and the genome template. These results might provide helpful hints about the molecular determinants of epidemiological divergence between HCV 1a and 1b.

The rainwater pH values ranged from 3.25 to 6.86, with an annual volume-weighted mean (VWM) of 4.38, and the acid rain frequency was 74 %. Such severe acidification, 15 % of the total events showed a pH below 4.0, attributed to the deficiency of Ca2+, significant anthropogenic pollution contribution, and rainy pattern to this area. The annual VWM of total ions concentration was 477.19 mu cq/L. NH4+ was the most abundant ionic species, followed by SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, Cl-, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and F- in a descending order. The total ionic concentrations presented a seasonal trend of lower values in autumn and summer but higher ones in winter and spring. Based on enrichment factor, correlation analysis and principle component analysis, three factors were identified: factor 1 (NH4+, SO42-, NO3-, K+, and Cl-, 47.45 % of the total variance) related to anthropogenic sources (coal/fuel combustion, biomass burning and agriculture), factor 2 (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and Cl-, 34.01 % of the total variance) associated with natural sources, and factor 3 (H+, 11.78 % of the total variance) related to free acidity. Back trajectory analysis indicates that the rainwater chemistry in Ya'an was mainly affected by regional air masses from Sichuan basin. Long-range transported air masses from southwest with heavy anthropogenic pollution increased the total ion concentration and acidity of rainwater. Considering its special topography, anthropogenic emissions from regional and long-range transport (especially from southwest) must be controlled effectively to improve the acid rain condition of non-urban areas in Sichuan basin.

The chicken ovulatory cycle seems to provide an example of a system in which circadian and interval timing mechanisms operate during ovulation-oviposition. However, little is known about the possible role of circadian regulation during egg formation and laying. To this end, we determined the rhythmic expression of several known canonical clock genes and clock controlled genes in the 4 segments of the chicken oviduct infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, and uterus) taken from the same biological state laying sequence and oviposition time) using real time RT-PCR. Except for Cry1, the other genes we analyzed were expressed in all 4 segments of the oviduct. Intriguingly, in a daily light-dark cycle, Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Per3, Cry2, and Rev-erb beta have highly significant rhythmic expression in the infundibulum and uterus but not in the magnum and isthmus. These results show that there is spatial specificity in the localization of clock cells in the hen reproductive tract and that peripheral clocks might have a direct role in the infundibulum and uterus where yolk is captured and the eggshell is formed, respectively.

Effect of tea polyphenols on production performance, egg quality, and hepatic antioxidant status of laying hens in vanadium-containing diets	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						vanadium; tea polyphenols; egg quality; depletion; laying hens	TOXICITY; FORM	This study was conducted to determine the effect of tea polyphenols (TP) on production performance, egg quality, and hepatic-antioxidant status of laying hens in vanadium-containing diets. A total of 300 Lohman laying hens (67 wk old) were used in a 1 plus 3 x 3 experiment design in which hens were given either a diet without vanadium and TP supplementation (control) or diets supplemented with 5, 10, or 15 mg V/kg and TP (0, 600, 1,000 mg/kg) diets for 8 wk, which included 2 phases: a 5-wk accumulation phase and a 3-wk depletion phase. During the accumulation phase, dietary vanadium addition decreased (linear, P < 0.01) albumen height and Haugh unit (HU), and TP supplementation mitigated (linear effect, P < 0.01) this reduction effect induced by vanadium. Eggshell thickness (linear, P < 0.01), redness (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05), and yellowness (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) were decreased by vanadium and increased by the effect of TP when a vanadium-containing diet was fed. In the depletion phase, the bleaching effect on eggshells induced by vanadium disappeared one wk after vanadium withdrawal. Eggshell thickness, eggshell strength, albumen height, and HU were lower (P < 0.05) in the 15 mg/kg vanadium group compared with the control diet until 2 wk post vanadium challenge, but hens fed 15 mg/kg vanadium and 600 mg/kg TP showed no difference from the control diet only after 1 wk withdrawal. In the liver, the activity of glutathione S-transferases and glutathione peroxidase was increased (linear, P < 0.01) with the TP addition at 5 wk in the accumulation phase in the vanadium-containing diet; the malondialdehyde content increased (linear effect, P = 0.02) with the addition of vanadium. The results indicate that supplementation of 10 and 15 mg/kg vanadium resulted in reduced albumen quality, bleaching effect on eggshell color, and antioxidant stress in the liver. The effect of TP addition can prevent laying hens from the adverse effect of vanadium on egg quality, liver antioxidant stress and shorten the recovery time.	[Yuan, Z. H.; Zhang, K. Y.; Ding, X.

However, whether sex-dependent susceptibility to AM colonization exists, which can induce a differential tolerance between the sexes to stress conditions, is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Glomus intraradices on Cd-stressed males and females of Populus deltoides (spiked with 10 mg Cd per kg dry substrate) in terms of morphology, physiology, biochemistry, ultrastructure, and toxin storage and translocation. Exposure to Cd promoted the colonization by G. intraradices in males, but not in females. Generally, females suffered more impairments than males in response to Cd stress, reflected by leaf symptoms, the extent of lipid peroxidation, and integrity of the cellular ultrastructure, whether they were inoculated or not. Inoculation with G. intraradices alleviated the phytotoxic effects of Cd in females by stimulating antioxidant enzymes, decreasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restricting Cd transfer to the shoots. In contrast, these beneficial effects induced by AM were not detected in mycorrhizal males compared to non-mycorrhizal males, based on thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TSARS) and cellular ultra structure. Inoculation with AM promoted Cd accumulation in males but not in females, and caused the sequestration of more toxic Cd in the root systems in both sexes. Therefore, our results suggest that inoculated males of P. deltoides are suitable candidates for phytostabilization in Cd-polluted soils, due to their higher accumulation ability and greater tolerance relative to inoculated females.

In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 64 % of MRSA isolates were of the USA300 clonal type in infected patients in USA. The aim of our study was to estimate the in vitro effect of imperatorin on MRSA strain BAA-1717 (USA300). The effects of imperatorin on alpha-hemolysin (Hla) production, when strain BAA-1717 was co-cultured with sub-inhibitory concentrations of imperatorin, were analysed using susceptibility testing, hemolysis assays, western blotting and real-time PCR. Live/Dead analysis and cytotoxicity assays were employed to examine the protective effect of imperatorin against the strain BAA-1717-mediated injury of human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). The results showed that imperatorin has no anti-S. aureus activity at the tested concentrations in vitro. However, imperatorin can observably inhibit the production of Hla in culture supernatants and reduce the transcriptional levels of hla (the gene encoding Hla) and arg (the accessory gene regulator). Imperatorin prevented Hla-mediated A549 epithelial cell injury in a co-culture system. In conclusion, our results suggested that imperatorin has the potential to be developed as a new anti-virulence drug candidate for managing S. aureus infection.

It causes root hypertrophy, hampering the uptake of nutrients and water. In the evaluation of resistance, small spheroid galls (SSGs), which are distinct from typical spindle galls, and are generally regarded as a host resistance reaction, were observed. In this study, the occurrence of SSGs was investigated when evaluating the host resistance of seven commercial clubroot-resistant (CR) Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) cultivars inoculated with 12 P. brassicae populations collected from different infested fields in Chuanyu region of China. Results showed that while all seven CR Chinese cabbage cultivars exhibited high resistance levels to the major populations tested, SSGs occurred in host-population combinations contained either Chinese cabbage cultivar 'T1-145' or population 'FL'. This indicated that some CR cultivars or P. brassicae populations might be more likely to produce SSGs than others. Thus, recording the occurrence of SSGs separately in the resistance evaluation might be useful in mitigating the potential for selection of SSG producing hosts. External morphology observations revealed that both fresh root weight and gall diameter of spindle galls were significantly higher than SSGs, and histological observations indicated that delayed pathogen development in cortical infection might contribute to the restricted development of SSGs. Additionally, the number of SSGs formed per root was low (2.2 in average). This observation further confirmed that some host-population combinations cannot form large numbers of SSGs on single roots.

Photosynthetic performance of soybean plants to water deficit under high and low light intensity	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Water deficit; Shaded soybean; Exposed soybean; Chlorophyll; Photosynthetic rate	CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; DROUGHT STRESS; FOOD SECURITY; GAS-EXCHANGE; SHADE; PHOTOINHIBITION; TOLERANCE; CULTIVARS; RESPONSES; SEEDLINGS	The two major challenges to relay strip intercropping soybean production in Southwest China are drought and lowlight intensity. This study tests whether the impact of drought on the photosynthetic performance of soybean plants is different between low and high light intensity conditions. To investigate this, soybean plants were grown in pots in a factorial experiment at two irrigation regimes (75 +/- 2% and 45 +/- 2% of soil field capacity) and two light intensity treatments (100% and 65% light intensity) in 2011. In 2012, soybean plants were grown in two irrigation regimes (75 +/- 2% of soil field capacity vs. progressive soil drying) and two light intensity treatments (sole cropping soybean and relay strip intercropping soybean). Photosynthetic performance was assessed by measuring parameters such as net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), water use efficiency (WUE), which were decreased significantly in drought stressed plants. We also observed differences in the photosynthetic responses of soybean plants to drought depending on the light intensity treatment the plants were subjected to. Shaded soybean plants in response to drought conditions had increased chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), chlorophyll (Chl), carotenoid (Car), ratio of Car/Chl, leaf relative water content (RLWC), leaf area per plant, specific leaf area (SLA), Pn, Gs, intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), photochemical quenching (qP) and electron transport rate (ETR). The above-mentioned photosynthetic changes may play an important role in determining how shaded soybean plants adjust their photosynthetic rate when experiencing drought conditions. (C) 2016 SAAB.

Proper management of this cash crop requires systematic understanding of various environmental conditions that are vital to yield and quality. High temperature stress can severely affect the viability of pollens and anther indehiscence, which leads to significant yield losses. Cotton can respond to withstand adverse environmental condition in several phases among which the accumulation of chemicals is extremely vital. Calcium, kinases, reactive oxygen species, carbohydrate, transcription factors, gene expression regulation, and plant hormones signaling pathways are playing a handy role in activating the major genes responsible to encounter and defend elevated temperature stress. The production of heat shock proteins is up-regulated when crops are unleashed to high temperature stress. Molecular breeding can play a functional role to identify superior genes for all the important attributes as well as provide breeder ready markers for developing ideotypes. The development of high-temperature resistant transgenic cultivars of cotton can grant a stability benefit and can also ameliorate the production capacity in response to elevated temperature.

The morphology, crystal structure, chemical states, and optical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photon electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible-infrared absorption spectroscopy, respectively. Transient photocurrent response, linear sweep voltammetry, and photoconversion efficiency were also measured. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated from both hydrogen generation and methyl orange degradation experiments. Our results suggested that the film was composed of small uniform TiO2 nanofibers, having interstitial nitrogen doping, oxygen vacancies and a mixture of anatase and rutile crystal phases. The films exhibited strong and broad optical absorption from 200 to 2500 nm. Owing to this strong absorption and rapid transport of photogenerated electrons, the nanofiber films exhibited a high photoconversion efficiency of 0.62%, and a hydrogen generation rate of 0.62 mL h(-1) cm(-2) under visible light irradiation. Under solar irradiation the films also showed remarkable efficiency and stability for the degradation of methyl orange. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Most of Chinese Rubus are assigned in two major sections, Idaeobatus and Malachobatus. To explore the phylogenetic relationships within Chinese Rubus, inferences upon three chloroplast DNA (rbcL, rpl20-rps12, and trnG-trnS), nuclear ribosomal ITS, and two low-copy nuclear markers (GBSSI-2 and PEPC) were deduced in 142 Rubus taxa from 17 subsections in 6 sections. nrITS and GBSSI-2 were the most informative among the six DNA regions assessed. Phylogenetic relationships within Rubus were well-resolved by combined nuclear datasets rather than chloroplast markers. The phylogenetic inferences strongly supported that section Idaeobatus was a polyphyletic group with four distant clades. All samples of sect. Malachobatus formed a monophyletic Glade, in which R. tsangorum and R. amphidasys of sect. Dalibardastrum, and R. peltatus from subsection Peltati of sect. Idaeobatus were always nested. Rubus pentagonus (2n = 2x = 14) from subsect. Alpestres of sect. Idaeobatus was a sister group to the polyploid sect. Malachobatus, as well as the polytomy of three sect. Cyalctis members. This suggests that some polyploids of Malachobatus might originate from common ancestors, via polyploidization of hybrids between R. pentagonus and sect. Cylactis species. They had experienced species explosion in a short time. Section Dalibardastrum species have potential parental lineages from subsects. Moluccani and Stipulosi of sect. Malachobatus. Based on molecular phylogenies, we also provided recommendations for the taxonomic treatments of four taxa. In addition, our results showed certain incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear markers, which might be due to hybridization and introgression.

In this study, we used a diverse panel of alfalfa accessions previously described by Zhang et al. (2015) to identify molecular markers associated with salt tolerance during germination using genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Phenotyping was done by germinating alfalfa seeds under different levels of salt stress. Phenotypic data of adjusted germination rates and SNP markers generated by GBS were used for marker-trait association. Thirty six markers were significantly associated with salt tolerance in at least one level of salt treatments. Alignment of sequence tags to the Medicago truncatula genome revealed genetic locations of the markers on all chromosomes except chromosome 3. Most significant markers were found on chromosomes 1, 2, and 4. BLAST search using the flanking sequences of significant markers identified 14 putative candidate genes linked to 23 significant markers. Most of them were repeatedly identified in two or three salt treatments. Several loci identified in the present study had similar genetic locations to the reported QTL associated with salt tolerance in M. truncatula. A locus identified on chromosome 6 by this study overlapped with that by drought in our previous study. To our knowledge, this is the first report on mapping loci associated with salt tolerance during germination in autotetraploid alfalfa. Further investigation on these loci and their linked genes would provide insight into understanding molecular mechanisms by which salt and drought stresses affect alfalfa growth. Functional markers closely linked to the resistance loci would be useful for MAS to improve alfalfa cultivars with enhanced resistance to drought and salt stresses.

De novo generation of novel cis-regulatory elements (CREs) is much rarer than genomic events that alter existing CREs such as transposition, promoter switching or co-option. Only one case of de novo generation has been reported to date, in fish and without involvement of phenotype alteration. Yet, this event likely occurs in other animals and helps drive genetic/phenotypic variation. Results: Using a porcine model of spontaneous hearing loss not previously characterized we performed gene mapping and mutation screening to determine the genetic foundation of the phenotype. We identified a mutation in the non-regulatory region of the melanocyte-specific promoter of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene that generated a novel silencer. The consequent elimination of expression of the MITF-M isoform led to early degeneration of the intermediate cells of the cochlear stria vascularis and profound hearing loss, as well as depigmentation, all of which resemble the typical phenotype of Waardenburg syndrome in humans. The mutation exclusively affected MITF-M and no other isoforms. The essential function of Mitf-m in hearing development was further validated using a knock-out mouse model. Conclusions: Elimination of the MITF-M isoform alone is sufficient to cause deafness and depigmentation. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of a de novo CRE in mammals that produces a systemic functional effect.

Their structures were characterized by chemical composition analysis, high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Further, their antioxidant activities were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that EAP-2A had higher uronic acid content and larger average molecular weight than EAP-1N. Compared with EAP-1N, EAP-2A exhibited significantly scavenging activities against free radical in vitro, as well as strongly stimulating effect on antioxidant enzyme activities (including superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases (CAT), and glutathione peroxidases (GSH-PX)) and preferably inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation and protein carboxyl in the mode of Caenorhabditis elegans.

The yield of EPS (324.80 mg/l) was obtained with a sodium selenite concentration of 6 mu g/ml. The results indicated that the EPS was soluble in water, but insoluble in organic solvents. The molecular weight of this highly thermal stability EPS was 1.83 x 10(4) Da and 1.33 x 10(4) Da with or without Se enriched respectively. The EPS was composed of mannose, galactose and glucose in a molar ratio of 92.21:1.79:6.00 and 91.36:2.44:6.20 with or without Se. This compound had a backbone of (1 -> 2)-linked Man, (1 -> 2.6)-linked Glc, (2 -> 6)-linked Man, and (2 -> 6)-linked Gal confirmed by GCMS. IR analysis suggested that the EPS belonged to heteropolysaccharide with a pyran group, with possible presence of Se=O and C-Se-C residues that Se may substitutes CH3 in -OCH3 in the polysaccharide as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.

The global regulator crp gene has been found to regulate the virulence of some bacteria, and crp mutants have been demonstrated to be effective attenuated vaccines against Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Here, we first characterized the crp gene in P. multocida, and we report the effects of a crp deletion. Results: The P. multocida crp mutant exhibited a similar lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane protein profile but displayed defective growth and serum complement resistance in vitro compared with the parent strain. Furthermore, crp deletion decreased virulence but did not result in full attenuation. The 50 % lethal dose (LD50) of the Delta crp mutant was 85-fold higher than that of the parent strain for intranasal infection. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that 92 genes were up-regulated and 94 genes were down-regulated in the absence of the crp gene. Finally, we found that intranasal immunization with the Delta crp mutant triggered both systematic and mucosal antibody responses and conferred 60 % protection against virulent P. multocida challenge in ducks. Conclusion: The deletion of the crp gene has an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth and bacterial resistance to serum complement in vitro. The P. multocida crp mutant was attenuated and conferred moderate protection in ducks. This work affords a platform for analyzing the function of crp and aiding the formulation of a novel vaccine against P. multocida.

Epidemiological findings indicate that maternal undernutrition-induced mitochondrial dysfunction during pregnancy is associated with the development of metabolic disorders in offspring. Here, we investigated the effects of moderately decreased maternal energy intake during pregnancy on skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis in fetal offspring with pig as a model. Methods: Pregnant Meishan sows were allocated to a standard-energy (SE) intake group as recommended by the National Research Council (NRC; 2012) and a low-energy (LE) intake group. Fetal umbilical vein serum and longissimus muscle samples were collected for further analysis on day 90 of pregnancy. Results: Sow and fetal weights and the concentrations of serum growth hormone (GH) and glucose were reduced in LE group. Maternal LE diet decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), beta subunit of mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase (ATB5B), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), and citrate synthase (CS). The protein expression of PPARGC1A and Sirt1, intracellular NAD+-to-NADH ratio, and CS activity was reduced in LE group, and accordingly, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content was decreased. Moreover, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) expression at both mRNA and protein levels and SOD and catalase (CAT) activities were reduced in LE group as well. Conclusions: The observed decrease in muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense capacity suggests that moderately decreased maternal energy intake during pregnancy impairs mitochondrial function in fetal pigs.

Encouraging self-similar pixels to be assigned to the same label has been proved to be effective for stereo. A typical way of taking advantage of self-similarity is performing a color segmentation on the image and motivating the pixels within each segment to share an identical label. However, some cases cannot be handled by image segmentation, such as the pixels in disconnected regions. This paper proposes a stereo method based on the assumption, that a 3D scene is a collection of a few smooth surfaces and a few classes of reflective materials, such that the 3D points belonging to an identical material are likely to lie on a small number of surfaces and the 3D points lying on a single surface belong to a few classes of reflective materials. Each material is expected to have specific albedo properties. This paper presents two methods for classifying the albedo properties depending on whether the illumination environment is known, without recovering the albedo parameters. The proposed model is formulated as an energy function incorporating some new priors, that is optimized via fusion move algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies showed that the expression of several miRNAs is closely related with promoter methylation. However, it is not known whether miRNA mediates adipocytes differentiation by means of DNA methylation. Here, we showed that miR-145a-5p was poorly expressed in adipose tissue from mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). Over expression or inhibition of miR-145a-5p was unfavorable or beneficial, respectively, for adipogenesis, and these effects were achieved by regulating adipocyte-specific genes involved in lipogenic transcription, fatty acid synthesis, and fatty acid transportation. Particularly, we first suggested that miR-145a-5p mimics or inhibitors promoted or repressed adipocytes proliferation by regulating p53 and p21, which act as cell cycle regulating factors. Surprisingly, the miR-145a-5p-repressed adipocyte differentiation was enhanced or rescued when cells treated with 5-Aza-dC were transfected with miR-145a-5p mimics or inhibitors, respectively. These data indicated that, as a new mean to positively regulate adipocyte proliferation, the process of miR-145a-5p-inhibited adipogenesis may be regulated by DNA methylation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although much work has been done to investigate the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest, there is no information regarding the differences of protein composition between cattleyak and yak testis. Comparative investigation of testis proteomes between cattleyak and yak using iTRAQ proteomics identified 256 differentially abundant proteins with fold change values higher than +/- 1.5. Most of the differentially abundant proteins were involved in extracellular matrix organization, response to stimulus, metabolic and cellular process, in which a large number of the cattleyak predominant proteins were associated with various stresses, cell adhesion and germ cell migration. Such upregulated proteins as integrins and their ligands in the extracellular matrix involved in ECM-receptor interaction pathway may help germ cells to endure pulling forces and impede their migration. In contrast, down-regulated proteins in cattleyak were associated with defects in various metabolic processes and cellular processes during spermatogenesis. Such Downregulated proteins as the subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome Bc1 complex involved in the Alzheimer's disease and oxidative phosphorylation pathways may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in cattleyak testis. Biological significance: Spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak involves defects of both germ cells and their micro environment in testis. In this study, Dozens of proteins possibly associated with spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak were identified by comparative iTRAQ proteomics, in which a large number of the cattleyak predominant proteins may act in response to various stresses (especially inflammatory stresses), enhance cell adhesion and impeded germ cell migration, while down-regulated proteins in cattleyak were associated with defects in various metabolic processes and cellular processes during spermatogenesis. Therefore, germ cells in testis of cattleyak may be constantly in a stress state (similar to inflammation) due to accumulation of some toxic intermediate products resulted from metabolic disturbances. Metabolic defects of germ cells and their deleterious micro environment in testis of cattleyak may be the root of all other problems during spermatogenesis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A total of 14 pairs of normal birth weight (NBW) and IUGR piglets (7 days old) were randomly assigned to receive a milk-based control diet (CON diet) or diet supplemented with nucleotides (NT diet) for a period of 21 days. Blood samples, intestinal tissues and digesta were collected at necropsy and analyzed for morphology, digestive enzyme activities, microbial populations, peripheral immune cells, expression of intestinal innate immunity and barrier-related genes and proteins. Compared with NBW piglets, IUGR piglets had significantly lower average daily dry matter intake and body weight gain (P<0.05). Moreover, IUGR markedly decreased the villous height and villi: crypt ratio in duodenum (P<0.05), as well as the maltase activity in jejunum (P<0.05). In addition, IUGR significantly decreased the serum concentrations of IgA, IL-1 beta and IL-10 (P<0.05), as well as the percentage of peripheral lymphocytes (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the down-regulation of innate immunity-related genes such as TOLLIP (P<0.05), TLR-9 (P = 0.08) and TLR-2 (P = 0.07) was observed in the ileum of IUGR relative to NBW piglets. Regardless of birth weight, however, feeding NT diet markedly decreased (P<0.05) feed conversion ratio, increased the villous height in duodenum(P<0.05), activities of lactase and maltase in jejunum (P<0.05), count of peripheral leukocytes (P<0.05), serum concentrations of IgA and IL-1 beta as well as gene expressions of TLR-9, TLR-4 and TOLLIP in ileum (P<0.05). In addition, expressions of tight junction proteins (Claudin-1 and ZO-1) in ileum were markedly increased by feeding NT diet relative to CON diet (P<0.05). These results indicated that IUGR impaired growth performance, intestinal and immune function, but dietary nucleotides supplementation improved nutrients utilization, intestinal function and immunity.

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of G(2)/M cell cycle arrest induced by AFB(1) in the jejunum of broilers. Broilers, as experimental animals, were fed 0.6 mg/kg AFB(1) diet for 3 weeks. Our results showed that AFB(1) reduced the jejunal villus height, villus height/crypt ratio and caused G(2)/M cell cycle arrest. The G(2)/M cell cycle was accompanied by the increase of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), p53, Chk2, p21 protein and mRNA expression, and the decrease of Mdm2, cdc25C, cdc2, cyclin B and proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein and mRNA expression. In conclusion, AFB(1) blocked G(2)/M cell cycle by ATM pathway in the jejunum of broilers.

Failed convergence often occurs due to wrongly selected initial values when using currently available methods, especially the kind of local optimization. There are no reliable methods that can resolve the conundrum of selecting appropriate initial values. After comparing the performance of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and other three algorithms for global optimization, we develop a general method for parameter estimation in four photosynthetic light response models, based on the use of Differential Evolution (DE). The new method was shown to successfully provide good fits (R-2 > 0.98) and robust parameter estimates for 42 datasets collected for 21 plant species under the same initial values. It suggests that the DE algorithm can efficiently resolve the issue of hyper initialvalue sensitivity when using local optimization methods. Therefore, the DE method can be applied to fit the light-response curves of various species without considering the initial values.

Excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizer has generated serious environment pollution and increased production cost in agriculture. To deal with this problem, tremendous efforts have been invested worldwide to increase the nitrogen use ability of crops. However, only limited success has been achieved to date. Here we report that NLP7 (NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7) is a potential candidate to improve plant nitrogen use ability. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, NLP7 increases plant biomass under both nitrogen-poor and -rich conditions with better-developed root system and reduced shoot/root ratio. NLP7-overexpressing plants show a significant increase in key nitrogen metabolites, nitrogen uptake, total nitrogen content, and expression levels of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation and signalling. More importantly, overexpression of NLP7 also enhances photosynthesis rate and carbon assimilation, whereas knockout of NLP7 impaired both nitrogen and carbon assimilation. In addition, NLP7 improves plant growth and nitrogen use in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Our results demonstrate that NLP7 significantly improves plant growth under both nitrogen-poor and -rich conditions by coordinately enhancing nitrogen and carbon assimilation and sheds light on crop improvement.

Alone or in coordination with ABA, it can regulate the expression of genes involved in starch synthesis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, maize endosperms were collected from Zea mays L. B73 inbred line 10 d after pollination and treated with sucrose, ABA, or sucrose plus ABA at 28 degrees C in the dark for 24 h. RNA-sequence analysis of the maize endosperm transcriptome revealed 47 candidate transcription factors among the differentially expressed genes. We therefore speculate that starch synthetic gene expression is regulated by transcription factors induced by the combination of sucrose and ABA. ZmEREB156, a candidate transcription factor, is induced by sucrose plus ABA and is involved in starch biosynthesis. The ZmEREB156-GFP-fused protein was localized in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and ZmEREB156 protein possessed strong transcriptional activation activity. Promoter activity of the starch-related genes Zmsh2 and ZmSSIIIa increased after overexpression of ZmEREB156 in maize endosperm. ZmEREB156 could bind to the ZmSSIIIa promoter but not the Zmsh2 promoter in a yeast one-hybrid system. Thus, ZmEREB156 positively modulates starch biosynthetic gene ZmSSIIIa via the synergistic effect of sucrose and ABA.

The present study investigated whether Cu causes oxidative damage and induces changes in the expression of genes that encode tight junction (TJ) proteins, cytokines and antioxidant-related genes in the intestine of the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). We demonstrated that Cu decreases the survival rate of fish and increases oxidative damage as measured by increases in malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents. Cu exposure significantly decreased the expression of genes that encode the tight junction proteins, namely, claudin (CLDN)-c, -3 and -15 as well as occludin and zonula occludens-1, in the intestine of fish. In addition, Cu exposure increases the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically, IL-8, TNF-alpha and its related signalling factor (nuclear factor kappa B, NF-kappa B), which was partly correlated to the decreased mRNA levels of NF-kappa B inhibitor protein (I kappa B). These changes were associated with Cu-induced oxidative stress detected by corresponding decreases in glutathione (GSH) content, as well as decreases in the copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and mRNA levels, which were associated with the down-regulated antioxidant signalling factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels, and the Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1) mRNA levels in the intestine of fish. Histidine supplementation in diets (3.7 up to 12.2 g/kg) blocked Cu-induced changes. These results indicated that Cu-induced decreases in intestinal TJ proteins and cytokine mRNA levels might be partially mediated by oxidative stress and are prevented by histidine supplementation in fish diet.

However, the narrow genetic basis and sterile characteristics of M. x giganteus have become a limitation for utilization and adaptation to extreme climate conditions. In this study, we focused on one of the progenitors of M. X giganteus, Miscanthus sinensis, which was originally distributed in East Asia with abundant genetic resources and comparable biomass yield potential to M. x giganteus in some areas. A collection of 138 individuals was selected for conducting a 3-year trial of biomass production and analyzed by using 104 pairs of SRAP, ISAP, and SSR primers for genetic diversity as well as marker-trait association. Significant differences in biomass yield and related traits were observed among individuals. Tiller number, fresh biomass yield per plant and dry biomass yield per plant had a high level of phenotypic variation among individuals and the coefficient of variation were all above 40% in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The majority of the traits had a significant correlation with the biomass yield except for the length and width of flag leaves. Plant height was a highly stable trait correlated with biomass yield. A total of 1059 discernible loci were detected by markers across individuals. The population structure (Q) and cluster analyses identified three subpopulations in the collection and family relative kinship (K) represented high gene flow among M. sinensis populations from Southwest China. Model testing identified that Q+K was the best model for describing the associations between the markers and traits, compared to the simple linear, Q or K model. Using the Q+K model, 12 significant associations (P < 0.001) were identified including four markers with plant height and one with biomass yield. Such associations would serve an efficient tool for an early selection of M. sinensis and facilitate a genetic improvement of biomass yield for this species.

Molecular Cloning and Identification of Novel omega-gliadin Genes from Triticum Species	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						omega-gliadin; Triticum; cloning; pseudogene	BREAD-MAKING QUALITY; GLUTEN PROTEINS; HEXAPLOID WHEAT; AESTIVUM; SUBUNITS; GENETICS; TAUSCHII; WEIGHT	Gliadin is a main component of gluten proteins that affect functional properties of bread making and contributes to the viscous nature of doughs. In this study, thirteen novel omega-gliadin genes were identified in several Triticum species, which encode the ARH-, ATD- and ATN-type proteins. Two novel types of omega-gliadins: ATD- and ATN-have not yet been reported. The lengths of 13 sequences were ranged from 927 to 1269 bp and the deduced mature proteins were varied from 309 to 414 residues. All 13 genes were pseudogenes because of the presence of internal stop codons. The primary structure of these.-gliadin genes included a signal peptide, a conserved N-terminal domain, a repetitive domain and a conserved C-terminus. In this paper, we first characterize omega-gliadin genes from T. timo-pheevi ssp. timopheevi and T. timopheevi ssp. araraticum. The omega-gliadin gene variation and the evolutionary relationship of omega-gliadin family genes were also discussed.	[Li, Z. L.; Wu, D. D.; Li, H. Y.; Chen, G.; Ning, S. Z.; Liu, D. C.; Zhang, L.

The synthetic AnFaeA-syn was inserted into the pPICZ alpha A and then integrated into P. pastoris X33. SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant feruloyl esterase displayed a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 40.0 kDa. Western blot analysis confirmed that the expressed protein was the target protein. Furthermore, we showed that codon optimization increased enzyme yield for about 6.4-fold (35.12 U/mL vs 5.51 U/mL) in shake flask cultivation, compared to the non-codon-optimized control. Taken together, this study showed that the yield of feruloyl esterase could be increased by codon optimization.

Associations between virulence factors (VFs) and phylogenetic group, between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and phylogenetic group, and between AMR and VFs were subsequently assessed. The results showed 30 LPEC isolated were grouped into seven different clusters (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). The detection rates of crl (90%), kpsMT II (76.67%), mat (76.67%), and ompA (80%) were over 75%. The most frequent types of resistance were to amoxicillin (100%), sulfafurazole (100%), ampicillin (96.67%), and tetracycline (96.67%), with 93.33% (n = 28) of isolates resistant to more than eight types of drugs. There were significant relationships between resistance to cefalotin and the presence of iucD(a) (P < 0.001), papC (P = 0.032), and kpsMT II (P = 0.028); between resistance to chloromycetin and the presence of irp2 (P = 0.004) and vat (P = 0.047); between resistance to nalidixic acid and the presence of crl (P = 0.002) and iucD(a) (P = 0.004); and between resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and the presence of vat (P = 0.013). These results indicated there could be some association between resistance and VFs, and there is a great need for the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in LPEC.

Results showed that the MIC of nisin was 2.44 to 1250 mg/L for GPB and reached 5000 mg/L for GNB. The MICs of TPs and chitosan were 313 to 625 mg/L and 469 mg/L for GNB, and 156 to 5000 mg/L and 234 to 938 mg/L for GPB, respectively. These results indicated that TPs and chitosan exhibited inhibitory effects against both GPB and GNB, whereas nisin inhibited the growth of GPB only. Based on the orthogonal test of their MICs, and evaluation of preservative effect and sensory attributes in chilled mutton, the optimum combination was chosen as 0.625, 0.313, and 3.752 g/L for nisin, TPs, and chitosan, respectively. By using the optimum treatment, the shelf life of chilled mutton was extended from 6 to 18 d at 4 degrees C in the preservative film packages. These results indicate that the combination of nisin, TPs, and chitosan could be used as preservatives to efficiently inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms and pathogens in meat, thus improving the safety and shelf life of chilled mutton.

The effects of pressure on the Pb(II) adsorption capacity, primary cilia structure and surface topography of SIDF were determined using a gastrointestinal simulated model in vitro. SIDF (at pH 7.0) showed maximum binding capacity (261.42 +/- 2.77 mu mol/g), which was about 1.13 times higher than that of untreated sample (233.47 +/- 1.84 mu mol/g), when pressure reached 80 MPa. However, the net adsorption value of SIDF in a simulated small intestine (similar to 9 mu mol/g) was significantly lower than that in the stomach (similar to 48 mu mol/g), because of the competitive adsorption of Pb2+ by pancreatin, cholate and several enzymes in the small intestine. In addition, the adsorption capacity of SIDF exhibited good linear relationship with the physicochemical properties of total negative charges, and the adsorption behavior presumably occurred on the surface area of granules fiber.

The counts of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and total microbes were determined. The pH, total nitrogen (TN), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (A-N), organic matter (OM), available potassium (A-K), and available phosphorus (A-P) of the soil were measured. Results indicated that the counts of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and total microbes reached 60.33 x 10(5), 4.00 x 10(5), 0.92 x 10(5), and 65.25 x 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in August, all of which were higher than those of the control group (CK). The bacterial count of the experimental group (EG) was higher than that of the CK in August. The pH-values of the EG were always lower than those of the CK. In August, the TN content of the EG was 1.52 g/kg, which was higher than that of the CK (1.35 g/kg). A significant negative association between the actinomycetes count and TN (p < 0.05) was found. For A-N and OM, the content of the EG (A-N, 125.18 mg/kg; OM, 49.84 mg/kg) was roughly the same as that of the CK (A-N, 112.51 mg/kg; OM, 53.11 mg/kg) in August. However, the A-K and A-P contents of the EG (A-K, 145.25 mg/kg; A-P, 111.25 mg/kg) were lower than those of the CK (A-K, 182.52 mg/kg; A-P, 202.19 mg/kg) in August. Results show that application of EMs in kiwifruit planting soil can increase the counts of soil microbes and might promote the absorption of major nutrients for kiwifruit tree.

The algorithm was based on a theoretical normal closure model and semianalytical dilation model and required only the three-dimensional topography data of the two fracture surfaces at the initial stage before shearing. It allowed the prediction of the aperture distribution of a fracture under normal stress and various shear displacements, which is difficult to observe in coupled shear-flow tests. To ensure the precision of the surface topography data, a laser-scanning profilometer system was used for surface topography measurement. The contact algorithm was then used to predict the aperture evolution of a marble fracture during shearing.

Effect of dietary vanadium and vitamin C on egg quality and antioxidant status in laying hens	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION			English	Article						vanadium; vitamin C; productive performance; antioxidative status	ASCORBIC-ACID; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TOXICITY; SUPPLEMENTATION	This study assessed the effect of dietary vanadium (V) and vitamin C (VC) on production performance, egg quality and antioxidant status in laying hens. A total of 360 laying hens (31-week-old) were randomly allotted into a 3 9 3 factorial arrangement treatments (four replicates and 10 chicks per replicate) with three levels of dietary V (0, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and three levels of vitamin C (0, 50 and 100 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. The effect of V and VC did not alter egg production, egg weight, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio during 1-12 week. Albumen height and Haugh unit value were linearly decreased (p < 0.001) by addition of V, whereas the effect of 100 mg/kg VC was observed to counteract (p < 0.05) this effect in V-containing treatments during 1-12 week. Hens fed V-containing diet laid lighter (linear effect, p < 0.05) coloured eggs (higher lightness value, lower redness and yellowness value), and the VC exerted no influence on it during 1-12 week. The serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical, were significantly decreased, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) and V contents were increased (p < 0.05) by effect of V during 4, 8 and 12 week. The effect of VC alone and the interactive effect between VC and V were shown to increase serum (p < 0.05) SOD activity in 4 week and decrease MAD levels in 12 week. The result indicate that V decreased the egg quality and caused the oxidative stress at level of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, and the addition of 100 mg/kg vitamin C can alleviate its egg quality reduction effect and can mitigate the oxidative stress to some extent.

Although the MRS2/MGT genes have been identified in two model plant species, Arabidopsis and rice, a comprehensive analysis of the MRS2/MGT gene family in other plants is lacking. In this work, 12 putative MRS2/MGT genes (ZmMGT1-ZmMGT12) were identified in maize and all of them were classified into five distinct subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis. A complementation assay in the Salmonella typhimurium MM281 strain showed that five representatives of the 12 members possess Mg2+ transport abilities. Inhibition of ZmMGT protein activity using the hexaamminecobalt (III) (Co-Hex) inhibitor indicated that the ZmMGT protein mediated both low-affinity and high-affinity Mg2+ transport in maize. A semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that eight genes were constitutively expressed in all of the detected tissues, with one being specifically expressed in roots and three having no detectable expression signals. A quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that some ZmMGT members displayed differential responses to Mg2+ deficiency and aluminum (Al) stress. Furthermore, root growth inhibition and Mg2+ accumulation analyses in two maize inbred lines, which conferred different levels of Al tolerance, revealed that ZmMGT proteins contributed to the Al resistance of the Al tolerance genotype. We hypothesize that ZmMGT family members function as Mg2+ transporters and may play a role in linking Mg2+ deficiency and Al stress responses. Our results will be valuable in a further analysis of the important biological functions of ZmMGT members in maize.

As a linkage between sows and piglets, porcine milk is crucial for the health of newborn piglets. Free milk oligosaccharides (MOs) are kinds of important bioactive substance in mammalian milk. However, little is known about the component and function of the porcine MOs (PMOs). In this study, a hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-Q-TOF MS) system was utilized to profile the PMOs. Forty-one distinct PMOs were identified totally in three breeds of sows. The PMOs were highly sialylated (similar to 30%) and fucosylated PMOs (1-3%) were monitored at low levels. The most abundant oligosaccharide was a trisaccharide (Hex(3)) which contributed over 50% of the total PMOs abundance. Comparison of free MOs profiles revealed heterogeneity and variations among individuals and different breeds of sows, however, the MOs variation among breeds was limited even minor than that among individuals. Furthermore, most PMOs contents were higher in colostrum and decreased in the early lactation, but a few kinds increased at last. Different oligosaccharides had different patterns during lactation. Overall, these observations showed a more detailed PMOs library and would contribute to the exploration of influence of PMOs on piglets' health.

Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for GY and three kernel-related traits were detected in a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs). One hundred and seven simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 168 insertion/deletion polymorphism markers (Indels) were used to genotype RILs. Eight QTLs were found to be associated with four yield-related traits: GY, 100-kernel weight (HKW), 10-kernel length (KL), and 10-kernel length width (KW). Each QTL explained between 5.96 (qKL2-1) and 13.05 (qKL1-1) per cent of the phenotypic variance. Notably, one common QTL, located at the marker interval between bnlg1893 and chr2-236477 (chromosomal bin 2.09) simultaneously controlled GY and HKW; another common QTL, at bin 2.03 was simultaneously responsible for HKW and KW. Of the QTLs identified, only one pair of significant epistatic interaction involved in chromosomal region at bin 2.03 was detected for HKW; no significant QTL x environment interactions were observed. These results provide the common QTLs and for marker-assisted breeding.

In plants, stress responses, such as the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), are induced to help them adapt to low phosphate (Pi) concentrations. In this study, deep sequencing was performed using the roots and leaves of maize seedlings grown under low Pi concentrations to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed during the early stages of Pi deficiency. Eight small RNA libraries were constructed, and 159 known miRNAs representing 32 miRNA families and 10 novel miRNAs. Members of the miR396 family were extremely abundant. Further, 28 Pi-responsivemiRNAswere identified (27 known and 1 novel) of which 8 and 7 were significantly expressed exclusively in leaf and root tissues, respectively. The analysis of Pi-responsive miRNAs target genes suggested that most target genes functioning as transcription factors were involved in root and leaf development. The expression profiles of selected Pi-responsive miRNAs and target genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, we discuss the significance of the differences in expression patterns of these miRNAs during the early and later stages of Pi starvation.

In order to provide a detection method for quantifying goose CD8 alpha expression, this study raised the protein and antibody for goose CD8 alpha and developed a feasible cell marker enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) method. Recombinant protein of the extracellular region gene of goCD8 alpha was expressed in prokaryotic expression system, and specific polyclonal antibodies for goCD8 alpha were raised and purified, which was further confirmed by Western-blot, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A cell marker ELISA was established and optimized to detect the change of goCD8 alpha expression between goose parvovirus (GPV)-infected and mock-infected goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which is consistent with our previously results of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Cell marker ELISA can provide a new method to detect goCD8 alpha in protein level and in a sensitive, specific, and simple way. This may provide a convenient and novel method for the detection of goCD8 alpha expression.

In this study, we investigated the starch morphologies, compositions, and thermal properties between high protein peas ( approximately 30%) and other market types of field peas (yellow, green, maple, and marrowfat peas, with approximately 23% protein contents). For the shape and size, high protein peas had the compound starch granules that could be easily fragmented into small irregular and polygonal granules, whereas other pea types had oval or kidney-like starch granules with high percentage of large granule sizes. High protein peas had significantly lower starch contents (27.2%-34.2%) than other pea types (45.5%-47.4%). However, the amylose content (74.6%-89.2%) in high protein peas were significantly higher that of other pea types (50.1%-54.1%). Our differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) data showed that the onset temperature (T-o), peak temperature (T-p), and conclusion temperature (T-c) of starch gelatinization in high protein peas were significantly higher than those of other pea types, whereas the enthalpy change (Delta H) of high protein peas was significantly lower than those of other pea types. The unique properties of high protein peas characterized in this study provided useful information to further improve pea quality.

Isoflavones are a class of flavonoids that exhibit antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Increasing evidence has highlighted the potential for isoflavones to prevent the chronic diseases in which inflammation plays a key role, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, some studies have raised concerns about isoflavones induced negative effects like carcinogenesis, thymic involution, and immunosuppression. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the anti-inflammatory effects of isoflavones, unravel the underlying mechanisms, and present the potential health risks.

Three first lactation Saanen dairy goats (body weight 30 +/- 1.5 kg) were surgically fitted with indwelling catheters in the portal vein, mesenteric vein and carotid artery, and were randomly assigned to a 383 Latin square design. Dietary treatments were the basal diet, and the basal diet supplemented with either 100 IU VE or 30 g YC. Goats were kept in temperature and humidity-controlled room at 35 degrees C from 8:00 to 20:00 and at 24 degrees C from 20:00 till the next morning at 8:00. The relative humidity was kept at 55%. HS increased dairy goats' rectum temperature and respiration frequency (p<0.01). HS reduced plasma flux rate of milk goats (p<0.01), but the plasma flux rate increased when the animal was under the conditions of the thermo-neutral period (p<0.01). The VE supplementation lowered dairy goats' rectum temperature during thermo-neutral period (p<0.01). Meanwhile, no significant differences were observed between the control and YC treatment in rectum temperature and respiration frequency (p>0.05). Dietary supplementation of VE and YC reduced heat stressed dairy goats' endotoxin concentration of the carotid artery and portal vein (p<0.01). However, the endotoxin concentration of the YC treatment was higher than that of the VE treatment (p<0.01). Both VE and YC supplementation decreased heat stressed dairy goats' absorption of endotoxin in portal vein (p<0.01). The endotoxin absorption of YC treatment was higher than the VE treatment (p<0.01). The addition of VE and YC decreased dairy goats' superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration during HS and the whole experiment period (p<0.01). The addition of VE lowered SOD concentration during thermo-neutral period (p<0.01). Likewise, the addition of VE and YC lowered dairy goats' malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration during HS and the whole experimental period, and the MDA concentration in the VE treatment was lower than the YC treatment (p<0.05). The addition of VE decreased MDA concentration during thermo-neutral period. On the contrast, the addition of VE increased dairy goats total antioxidant potential (TAP) concentration during HS, thermo-neutral and the whole experimental period (p<0.01). The addition of YC increased TAP concentration only during HS period (p<0.01). It is concluded that both VE and YC are useful in alleviating HS of dairy goats by weakening endotoxin absorption and promoting antioxidant capacity. Compared with YC, VE is much more powerful in easing dairy goats HS.

ACE inhibitory peptides (ACEIPs) were successfully purified from seed protein hydrolysates through ultrafiltration and gel chromatography. In vitro ACE inhibitory assay revealed an IC50 value of 0.032 +/- 0.008 mg center dot mL(-1) for a component with <5 kDa molecular weight. Four fractions were isolated by Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography under the following elution conditions: flow rate, 0.6 mL center dot min(-1); initial volume, 2.0 mL; and sample concentration, 30 mg center dot mL(-1). The second fraction showed the highest inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.021 +/- 0.007 mg center dot mL(-1). The stability of the ACE inhibitory activity of the obtained ACEIPs was identified under storage conditions with varied temperature, pH, and gastrointestinal protease digestion. Peptides derived from prickly ash seed protein hydrolysates may be a potential resource for exploring functional food or pharmaceuticals against hypertension.

Biopolyols were first analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS), and the main components were sugar derivatives with 2-4 hydroxyl groups and phenolic compounds derived from lignin. The residues were collected and evaluated for potential use in the production of nanofibrillated cellulosic fibers. Results show that liquefied residue content as well as its physicochemical properties varied with respect to particle size, liquefaction temperature, and reaction time. It was also found that residues from liquefaction reaction with the minimum residue content in this study still exhibited traced fiber structure with remaining cellulose attached with recondensed lignin. Pure white cellulose fibers were extracted from the residues with yield of 65.61% using a combination of bleaching and acid hydrolysis treatment. Nanofibrillated cellulosic fibers were generated by given the purified cellulose fibers to high-intensity ultrasonic treatment. The resulted nanofibrillated cellulosic fibers had a range of 4-18 nm in diameter and length of 550 nm or longer, indicating the nanofibers obtained from liquefied bamboo residues hold great potential in reinforcing polymeric matrix materials. The successful isolation of nanofibrillated cellulosic fibers from liquefied residues offers a novel approach to make full use of the liquefied bamboo for value-added green products.

Muscle regeneration largely relies on muscle stem cells called satellite cells. Satellite cells normally remain quiescent, but in response to injury or exercise they become activated and proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and fuse to form multinucleate myofibers. Interestingly, the inflammatory process following injury and the activation of the myogenic program are highly coordinated, with myeloid cells having a central role in modulating satellite cell activation and regeneration. Here, we show that genetic deletion of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in mice substantially delays muscle regeneration. Surprisingly, miR-155 does not appear to directly regulate the proliferation or differentiation of satellite cells. Instead, miR-155 is highly expressed in myeloid cells, is essential for appropriate activation of myeloid cells, and regulates the balance between pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages during skeletal muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, we found that miR-155 suppresses SOCS1, a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, during the initial inflammatory response upon muscle injury. Our findings thus reveal a novel role of miR-155 in regulating initial immune responses during muscle regeneration and provide a novel miRNA target for improving muscle regeneration in degenerative muscle diseases.

In this study, the full-length MCH cDNA was obtained from Schizothorax prenanti by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction. The full-length MCH cDNA contained 589 nucleotides including an open reading frame of 375 nucleotides encoding 256 amino acids. MCH mRNA was highly expressed in the brain by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Within the brain, expression of MCH mRNA was preponderantly detected in the hypothalamus. In addition, the MCH mRNA expression in the S. prenanti hypothalamus of fed group was significantly decreased compared with the fasted group at 1 and 3 h post-feeding, respectively. Furthermore, the MCH gene expression presented significant increase in the hypothalamus of fasted group compared with the fed group during long-term fasting. After re-feeding, there was a dramatic decrease in MCH mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of S. prenanti. The results indicate that the expression of MCH is affected by feeding status. Taken together, our results suggest that MCH may be involved in food intake regulation in S. prenanti.

Dietary threonine response of Pekin ducks from hatch to 14 d of age based on performance, serology, and intestinal mucin secretion	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Pekin duck; threonine; growth performance; mucin; serology	NATURAL ANTIBODIES; REQUIREMENT; DYNAMICS; PIGLETS; IMMUNE	Two experiments were conducted to determine the dietary threonine (Thr) requirement of Pekin ducks from hatch to 14 d of age. In experiment 1, practical corn-soybean meal diets were formulated to contain 0.78, 0.84, 0.90, 0.96, and 1.02% Thr (0.74, 0.83, 0.88, 0.92, and 1.00% Thr on an analyzed basis). In experiment 2, corn-soybean meal diets supplemented with 11 crystalline amino acids were formulated to contain 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00, and 1.10% Thr (0.60, 0.75, 0.89, 0.95, 1.01, and 1.09% Thr on an analyzed basis). In both experiments, diets were fed to 8 replicate cages with 6 male ducks per cage. Body weight and feed intake from each cage were recorded weekly. At 14 d of age, breast meat, ileal digesta, and serum were collected to determine breast meat yield, mucin secretion, and serology parameters. In both studies, the estimated Thr requirement (expressed as % dietary Thr basis) for 14 d BW and BW gain (BWG) by quadratic broken-line (QBL) regression were similar, which were 0.87 and 0.86%, respectively. Additional measures in both experiments resulted in Thr requirements via QBL regression in rank order of crude mucin secretion < breast meat yield < serum immune activity. Summing up the estimates from both studies, the Thr requirement ranged from a low of 0.81% to maximize feed intake (FI) to a high of 1.00% to maximize serum Rb L100 by QBL regression. Correspondingly, the Thr requirement varied between a low of 0.90% to maximize crude mucin secretion on a dry matter intake (DMI) basis and a high of 0.98% to maximize feed-to-gain when using quadratic regression.

To uncover the genetic controls of agronomic traits and facilitate marker-assisted breeding (MAB) in tea plant, we constructed a saturated SSR-based linkage map using an F-1 population derived from the crossing of 'Longjin43' x 'Baihaozao'. A total of 483 SSR markers, consisting of 117 novel loci, 129 transferred from other tea plant maps, and 237 previously mapped, were successfully integrated into a new consensus map. The map has 15 linkage groups, covering 1226.2 cM in total with an average marker distance of 2.5 cM. The 126 markers in common enabled us to align this map to the reference genetic maps of tea plant. Phenotype data were collected in 2014 and 2015 for five traits: timing of spring bud flush (TBF), young shoot color (YSC), mature leaf length (MLL), mature leaf width (MLW), and leaf shape index (LSI, i.e., MLL/MLW). QTL analyses were performed for the five traits using the new consensus map and 15 QTLs were identified. The SSR markers, linkage map, and QTLs reported here are useful resources for future QTL mining, identification of causal genes, and MAB in tea plant.

However, the temporal and spatial variation in soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of tropical forest remains uncertain, especially near the Tropic of Cancer. In this research, we studied the annual soil CO2 fluxes from three tropical montane rainforests on the Hainan Island of China (pristine montane rainforest, PF; secondary montane rainforest, SF; and Podocarpus imbricatus plantation, PP). The results showed a lower annual average soil CO2 flux as 6.85 +/- 0.52 Mg C-CO2 ha-1 (9.17 Mg C-CO2 ha(-1) in the wet season and 4.50 Mg C-CO2 ha(-1) in the dry season). The CO2 fluxes exhibited obviously seasonal variation during the study period. Among the three forest types, PF had the highest average CO2 flux rate of 317.77 +/- 147.71 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) (433.08 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the wet season and 202.47 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the dry season), followed by PP of 286.84 +/- 137.48 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) (367.12 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the wet season and 206.56 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the dry season) and SF of 255.09 +/- 155.26 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) (351.48 mg CO2 m-2 h(-1) in the wet season and 155.71 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the dry season). We found between CO2 fluxes and soil temperature a highly significant linear relation (P < 0.01) at 5 cm depth and a highly significant exponential correlation (P < 0.01) at 10 cm depth for all three forest types; a significant linear relation (P < 0.05) between CO2 fluxes and soil moisture content was found for SF and PF, but not for PP (P > 0.05). The CO2 flux was significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with water-filled pore space only for PF. In conclusion, our results suggested soil CO2 fluxes in the three forest types that exhibit obviously spatial and temporal variation, and the temperature is the major factor affecting soil CO2 fluxes from this region.

Litter decomposition in terrestrial lotic ecosystem is one of the most important pathways for metallic elements cycling, while little information is currently available about the dynamics of metallic elements in the decomposing litter of lotic ecosystems. The concentrations and release rates of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and aluminium (Al) were investigated in the decomposing foliar litter of four dominant species in an alpine forest river. Over a 1-year period of decomposition, K, Ca, and Mg were released from virtually all types of litter, whereas Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Al were released from willow litter but accumulated in azalea, cypress, and larch litters during litter decomposition. Litter species, decomposition period, and river water characteristics (e.g., temperature, pH, flow velocity, and nutrient availability) were significantly related to the dynamics of these metallic elements in decomposing litter. Our results suggested that the similarity between the dynamics of metallic elements in the decomposing litter of lotic ecosystems reported here and previously for forest floors indicates a general pattern for the cycling of metallic element across different ecosystem types, and the net accumulation patterns for elements such as Zn, Cu, and Al during litter decomposition suggested that some litter species may act as efficient "cleaner" for metal purification in future ecological engineering.

The semi-dwarfing gene uzu in barley is widely used in East Asia. Its value as an Rht gene in the warm and dry environments in Australia was evaluated in this study. In addition to plant height, this gene showed significant effects on a wide range of characteristics. It reduced the overall plant height by an average of 33.7 % with the most significant reduction occurred on the internode below the peduncle. The gene reduces spike length by 31.6 % and grain weight by 18.8 %. It increases grain number per spike by 5.6 % and grain density by 51.8 %. Seedling assays suggested that the effects of this gene became more significant with increased temperature. It reduced coleoptile and seedling length by 19.4 % and 15.1 %, respectively at 7 A degrees C. The reduction increased to 61 % and 46.7 %, respectively, at 25 A degrees C. These results indicated that the uzu gene could have limited values in some high temperature and drought prone environments.

Although vaccines were wildly used in controlling this disease, some infection could still not be prevented and led to significant economic losses as a result of mortality and decreased egg production. However, there is no antiviral drug against DEV. Resveratrol was identified to exert its antiviral activity by inhibiting the DEV replication in preliminary investigations. In the present study, we confirmed that resveratrol significantly reduced the mortality of ducklings which infected with a virulent strain of DEV. With resveratrol treatment, the survival rate increased by almost 80% at 8 days post infection (dpi). Pathological symptoms of ducklings caused by DEV were also relieved by resveratrol. The virus load in blood and tissues were effectively depressed when compared with the untreated group. In the assay of immune cytokines, the resveratrol exerted a dual-regulation effect. These results suggest that resveratrol is expected to be a new alternative control measure for DEV infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sequence alignments showed that the SC201301 strain shared 97-100% sequence identity with other genotype III strains but showed less similarity to genotype I representative JEVs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the SC201301 strain belonged to genotype III and was most closely related to representative strains such as SA14-14-2, HW and SH0601. Our findings suggest that JEV genotype III is still prevalent in swine herds in Sichuan province in China, and thus, there is an urgent need to monitor the infection status of JEV among swine herds in China.

In this study, the remediation efficiency of Cd contamination in arable soils, the distribution pattern of Cd concentration in crops, and the food safety to humans of three typical cropping systems (S1: maize + sweet potato-Chinese cabbage, S2: maize + ginger-stem mustard, and S3: rice) were investigated and evaluated. After 1-year rotation, the percentage of Cd extracted by crops from the plough soil layer was observed in three system fields with the trend of S1 (2.30 %) > S2 (1.16 %) > S3 (0.21 %) and Cd extraction amount in crops was maximum in sweet potato, then in maize. The same kind of crop had the same pattern of Cd distribution in organs, and the edible parts generally accumulated less Cd amount than the inedible parts. Further, the grain crops were found to possibly be suitable one for using as phytoaccumulators of Cd contamination for farmlands. Direct consumption of these crops from the three systems would pose a high health risk to local inhabitants since it would result in the monthly intake of Cd (247 mu g kg(-1) body weight) being nearly 10 times higher than the recommended tolerable monthly intake (RTMI) (25 mu g kg(-1) body weight), resulting mainly from the consumption of vegetables rather than the grains, which would be potentially reduced by these foods being consumed by livestock firstly.

Methods Twelve primiparous purebred Large White sows (initial body weight 135.5 +/- 1.6 kg) were allocated to one of two energy intake treatments: normal-energy-intake group (Con, 30.96 MJ DE/day) as recommended by the National Research Council (NRC; 2012) and high-energy-intake group (HE, 34.15 MJ DE/day). The nutritional treatments were introduced from mating to day 90 of gestation. On day 90 of gestation, foetuses were examined by morphological, biochemical and molecular analysis of the longissimus muscle. Umbilical vein serum hormones were measured. Results Sow body weight was increased in HE group compared with Con group (P < 0.05), whereas foetal myofibre density was decreased (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, protein concentration, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities and umbilical vein serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentration were decreased in HE foetuses (P < 0.05). Maternal HE diets decreased the mRNA abundance of muscle growth-related genes, myosin heavy-chain (MYH/MyHC) genes (MYH2 and MYH1) and insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin growth factor-binding protein 5 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the protein expressions of myogenic differentiation factor 1, myogenin and fast-MyHC isoforms were reduced in HE foetuses (P < 0.05). Conclusion Our results suggest that moderately increased maternal dietary energy intake delays the differentiation and maturation in skeletal muscle of the foetus on day 90 of gestation.

In this study, we focused on TaPRR73, a paralog of "Green Revolution" gene Ppdl (TaPRR37). We found that overexpression of the truncated TaPRR73 form lacking part of the N-terminal PR domain in transgenic rice promoted heading under long day conditions. Association analysis in common wheat verified that TaPRR73 was an important agronomic photoperiod response gene that significantly affected heading date and plant height; expression analysis proved that specific alleles of TaPRR73-A1 had highly expressed levels in earlier heading lines; the distribution of haplotypes indicated that one of these alleles had been selected in breeding programs. Our results demonstrated that TaPRR73 contributed to regulation of heading date in wheat and could be useful in wheat breeding and in broadening adaptation of the crop to new regions.

GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION			English	Article						Glume hairiness; Genetic mapping; SSR; Triticum aestivum; Tibetan semi-wild wheat	COMMON WHEAT; RESISTANCE; BARLEY; LANDRACES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; LINKAGE	Hairiness is a common character in planta. Glume hairiness (Hg) is present in the full spectrum of bread wheat and its close relatives and was mainly studied in phenotypic diversity, species evolution, and mapping as a morphological marker. Previous studies indicated that Hg was controlled by a single dominant gene Hg on the short arm of chromosome 1A. However, to date, systematic and comprehensive study of Hg is not available; and markers flanking Hg were rather limited as well, hindering the fine mapping and even cloning of this gene. In the study reported here, aiming at genetically analyze Hg gene systematically, a linkage map of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) generated from the cross between the Tibetan semi-wild wheat (Triticum aestivum subsp. tibetanum Shao) Q1028 and a cultivated wheat Zhengmai 9023 (ZM9023) was constructed using diversity array technology (DArT) and reported simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Five SSR markers (saufc2, saufc9, saufc17, saufc25, saufc90) were further developed to accurately locate Hg in this study. Of these five SSR markers all linked to Hg, saufc2 was genetically most closed to Hg with a distance of 1.6 cM. The effectiveness of the five newly developed SSR markers were validated in another RIL derived from Q1028 and a cultivated line 99E18. To our knowledge, this is the first report on fine mapping of Hg in bread wheat. The accurate localization of the Hg and the development of the markers flanked it should facilitate the cloning of this gene and further the study of its possible physiological function in bread wheat.

They play a crucial role in determining dough viscoelastic properties and end-use quality of wheat flour. To investigate the potential utilization of the special HMW-GSs from wild emmer wheat (2n = 4x = 28, AABB) accession D141 in common wheat (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD), continued to our previous report of the 1Ay and its coding sequence, the other three HMW-GSs, 1Ax, 1Bx13.1 and 1By16.1, and their coding genes were isolated, characterized and transferred from D141. The 1Ax gene was silent because of containing a premature stop codon TGA at position 835-837. The ORFs of 1Bx13.1 and 1By16.1 were 2373 and 2157 bp in length, and encoded 789 and 717 amino acid residues, respectively. Compared with the other 20 Glu-1Bx alleles in GenBank, seven SNPs and one 18-bp deletion were detected in 1Bx13.1. Compared with the other 10 Glu-1By alleles in GenBank, nine SNPs were observed in 1By16.1. The mobility of 1Bx13.1 and 1By16.1 on the SDS-PAGE gel was most similar to that of 1Bx13 and 1By16 from common wheat (T. aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) cv. 'Jimai 20', respectively. Protein secondary structure prediction showed that the combination of 1Bx13.1 + 1By16.1 possessed more alpha-helixes with more amino acid residues than that of 1Bx13 + 1By16. It suggested that 1Bx13.1 + 1By16.1 from wild emmer accession D141 might have more positive effects on bread-making quality than the superior subunit combination 1Bx13 + 1By16. The HMW-GS composition analysis of F-1 and F-2 between common wheat for female and wild emmer accession D141 for male, indicated that the special HMW-GSs from wild emmer accession D141 could be easily introduced into common wheat (2n = 42) by general inter-species hybridization.

In this study, we identified and mapped the LSF1 and LSF2 genes in barley (HvLSF1 and HvLSF2), characterized their gene and protein structures, predicted the cis-elements of their promoters, and analysed their expression patterns. HvLSF1 and HvLSF2 were mapped on the long arm of chromosome 1H (1HL) and 5H (5HL), respectively. Our results revealed varied exon-intron structures and conserved exon-intron junctions in both LSF1 and LSF2 from a range of analysed species. Alignment of protein sequences indicated that cTP and CT domains are much less varied than the functional domains (PDZ, DPS and CBM48). LSF2 was mainly expressed in anthers of barley and rice, and in leaf of Arabidopsis. LSF1 was mainly expressed in endosperm of barley and leaf of Arabidopsis and rice. The expression of LSF1 exhibited a diurnal pattern in rice only and that of LSF2 in both rice and Arabidopsis. Of the investigated stresses, only cold stress significantly reduced expression level of LSF1 and LSF2 in barley and LSF2 in Arabidopsis at late stages of the treatments. While heat treatment significantly decreased expression levels of LSF1 at middle stage (4 h) of a treatment in Arabidopsis only. The strong relationships detected between LSF2 and starch excess4 (SEX4), glucan, water dikinases or phosphoglucan, water dikinases were identified and discussed. Taken together, these results provide information of genetic manipulation of LSF1 and LSF2, especially in monocotyledon and further elucidate their regulatory mechanism in plant development.

Dlk1 transcripts were identified in the Jianyang Da'er goats by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by Bayesian inference and neighbor-joining methods. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), western blotting and in situ hybridization were performed to analyze the expression pattern of Dlk1. Five alternatively transcripts were identified in different tissues and designated as Dlk1-AS1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Compared with the normal transcript Dlk1-AS1, Dlk1-AS4 and Dlk1-AS5 retained the identical open reading frame (ORF) and encoded proteins with truncated epidermal-growth-factor like repeats of 121 and 83 amino acids, respectively. Using the Bayesian inference method, the consensus phylogenetic tree indicated that caprine Dlk1 had a closer relationship with bovine Dlk1 than with Dlk1 from pigs, humans and mice. qPCR revealed high expression levels of Dlk1 in the kidney (P < 0.01). However, mRNA and protein levels presented an inconsistent correlation, possibly because of post-transcriptional regulation. RNA in situ hybridization indicated that Dlk1 mRNA was localized in the interlobular bile duct and alongside the hepatocyte nuclei, in the epithelial cells of proximal and distal convoluted tubules and in the connective region between the mesothelium and myocardium in the heart. The Dlk1 gene in goats produces alternatively spliced transcripts, with specific expression and cellular localization patterns. These findings would lay the foundation for further study.

The proteins of the R2R3-MYB superfamily play key roles in the growth and development processes as well as defense responses in plants. However, their characteristics and functions have not been fully investigated in tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), a strongly abiotic resistant coarse cereal. In this article, eight tartary buckwheat R2R3-MYB genes were isolated with full-length cDNA and DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the members of the R2R3-MYB superfamily between Arabidopsis and tartary buckwheat revealed that the assumed functions of the eight tartary buckwheat R2R3-MYB proteins are divided into five Arabidopsis functional subgroups that are involved in abiotic stress. Expression analysis during abiotic stress and exogenous phytohormone treatments identified that the eight R2R3-MYB genes responded to one or more treatments. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the R2R3-MYB gene family in tartary buckwheat under abiotic stress.

Methane production, fermentation characteristics, and microbial profiles in the rumen of tropical cattle fed tea seed saponin supplementation	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Camellia sinensis L.; Ruminant	VITRO RUMINAL FERMENTATION; FEEDING YUCCA-SCHIDIGERA; LACTATING DAIRY-COWS; REAL-TIME PCR; IN-VITRO; QUILLAJA-SAPONARIA; NITROGEN-UTILIZATION; CILIATE PROTOZOA; PLANT MATERIALS; SHEEP	Belmont Red Composite rumen-cannulated steers (n = 8, 364 +/- 8.4 kg liveweight, LW; least squares means +/- s.e.m.) were used to assess effects of feeding tea seed (Camellia sinensis L.) saponin (TSS) supplementation on performance, methanogenesis, fermentation pattern and rumen microbial communities. The expectation was to use TSS to potentially modulate the rumen microbial population and decrease enteric methane (CH4) production. The steers were fed twice a day with a basal diet (BD) that contained a mixture of 0.15 Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay plus 0.85 of a commercial concentrate before CH4 emissions were measured in open-circuit respiratory chambers for 48 h. Steers were then adapted progressively to doses of 20 and 30 g/day of TSS for 10 and 6 days, respectively before new CH4 measurements were recorded. Final placement in chambers was conducted after 13 days of TSS removal (BDP). Rumen fluid samples from each steer were collected for the treatments BD, BD + 20 g TSS, BD + 30 g TSS and BDP. Growth performance and CH4 emissions were not affected by the addition of TSS, but compared to the BD and TSS diets, daily CH4 emissions (g) and yield (gCH(4)/kg DMI) were lower (P < 0.05) by 18 and 22%, respectively, after TSS treatment. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetate and propionate were not affected by TSS treatment, as were total rumen bacteria and methanogens numbers. Relative to the BD and BDP, butyrate concentration was higher (P < 0.05) in TSS treated animals, resulting in a reduced ratio of acetate to butyric acid (P < 0.05). In comparison with BD control, the relative abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes increased by 2 fold (P < 0.001) in the other three dietary groups. However, compared to the BD and BD + 20 g of TSS, the abundance of R. albus increased by 100 fold (P < 0.01) in the BD + 30 g of TSS and BDP diets, while the abundance of R. flavefaciens was 100 fold lower in TSS supplemented and BDP groups than in BD control group (P < 0.001). Thermoplasmatales-related RCC archaea and protozoa counts increased linearly with 20 and 30 g of TSS addition, but returned to BD control levels after the TSS supplement was withdrawn. It was concluded that TSS supplementation changed rumen microbial community in cattle, but was not inhibitory to methane production, which was inconsistent with published in vitro results and small ruminant trials where TSS caused a dose-dependent reduction in CH4 emissions.

In the present study, the complete mitochondrial genomes (mt) of H. gallinae and H. beramporia were amplified by long-PCR and then sequenced. The complete mt genomes of H. gallinae and H. beramporia were 13,973 bp and 14,012 bp in size, respectively. Both mt genomes contain 12 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. All genes are transcribed in the same direction and the gene arrangement is identical to Ascaridia spp. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 12 protein-coding genes revealed that the family Heterakidae (represented by H. gallinae and H. beramporia) was more closely related to the infraorder Ascaridomorpha than it was to the infraorder Oxyuridomorpha. The present study determined the complete mt genome sequences for two Heterakis species, providing useful markers for studying the systematics, population genetics, and molecular epidemiology of these Heterakis parasites.

The S proteins are the main structural proteins of PEDV and TGEV capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo. In this study, a DNA vaccine SL7207 (pVAXD-PS1-TS) co-expressing S proteins of TGEV and PEDV delivered by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium was constructed and its immunogenicity in piglets was investigated. Twenty-day-old piglets were orally immunized with SL7207 (pVAXD-PS1-TS) at a dosage of 1.6 x 10(11) CFU per piglet and then booster immunized with 2.0 x 10(11) CFU after 2 weeks. Humoral immune responses, as reflected by virus neutralizing antibodies and specific IgG and sIgA, and cellular immune responses, as reflected by IFN-gamma, IL-4, and lymphocyte proliferation, were evaluated. SL7207 (pVAXD-PS1-TS) simultaneously elicited immune responses against TGEV and PEDV after oral immunization. The immune levels started to increase at 2 weeks after immunization and increased to levels statistically significantly different than controls at 4 weeks post-immunization, peaking at 6 weeks and declined at 8 weeks. The humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses induced by SL7207 (pAXD-PS1-TS) were significantly higher than those of the PBS and SL7207 (pVAXD) (p < 0.01). In particular, the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 were higher than those induced by the single-gene vaccine SL7207 (pVAXD-PS1) (p < 0.05). These results demonstrated that SL7207 (pVAXD-PS1-TS) possess the immunological functions of the two S proteins of TGEV and PEDV, indicating that SL7207 (pVAXD-PS1-TS) is a candidate oral vaccine for TGE and PED.

The seven experimental diets were formulated to contain the graded levels of thiamine (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 100 mg kg(-1) diet, respectively), providing the actual dietary thiamine values of 0.31 (control), 9.82, 21.49, 29.83, 41.66, 62.24 and 114.58 mg kg(-1) diet, respectively. Each diet was assigned to three replicate groups of S. prenanti (initial body weight: 13.46 +/- 0.28 g, means +/- SD) for 60 days. Increasing dietary thiamine level up to 21.49 mg kg(-1) diet increased weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P < 0.05), beyond which they remained nearly unchanged. Similarly, hepatic thiamine concentration and several serum biochemical parameters (transketolase activity, triglyceride and total cholesterol contents) increased with increasing levels of thiamine up to 21.49 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05) and, thereafter, remained almost constant. However, no significant differences in body composition (moisture, protein, lipid and ash contents) were found among dietary thiamine treatments (P > 0.05). Analysis by the broken-line regression of WGR, SGR, FE, PER, hepatic thiamine concentration and serum transketolase activity indicated that dietary thiamine requirements in juvenile S. prenanti were 18.45-25.91 mg kg(-1) diet.

JIAN; PSEUDOSCIAENA-CROCEA; CREATINE-KINASE; LYSINE REQUIREMENT	To study the effects of manganese on growth performance, digestive and absorptive abilities, as well as the antioxidative capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine, young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus Val.) (264 +/- 1 g) were fed diets containing graded levels of manganese at 3.65 (control), 8.62, 13.48, 18.24, 22.97 and 27.86 mg kg(-1) diet for 8 weeks. Per cent weight gain (PWG) and feed intake were the poorest in fish fed the basal diet (P < 0.05). The activities of trypsin, lipase and alkaline phosphatase in the intestine were significantly enhanced with dietary manganese level at 13.48 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Additionally, in the hepatopancreas and intestine, the protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde contents were the lowest in fish fed the diet with dietary manganese level at 13.48 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05), while the anti-hydroxyl radical capacities, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities were significantly enhanced with dietary manganese level at 13.48 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, the catalase activity and glutathione content in the intestine were the highest in fish fed the diet with dietary manganese level at 18.24 mg kg(-1) diet (P < 0.05). These results indicated that optimum dietary manganese promoted growth, enhanced the digestive and absorptive abilities, and improved the antioxidative capacity in young grass carp. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for PWG and intestinal MnSOD activity, the manganese requirements for young grass carp with the initial body weight of 264 g were 16.91 and 18.21 mg kg(-1) diet respectively.

However, most of the potential P accumulators have relatively low P removal potential when used for extracting excess soil P. An important question then is how can we improve the P uptake capability of P accumulators? This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different nitrogen (N) treatments (0-350 mg N kg(-1)) on growth, P accumulation characteristics, and P removal potentials of P. sinofasciata. A mining ecotype (ME) and a non-mining ecotype (NME) were grown for 9 weeks in P enriched soils affected by different N treatments. The pot survey revealed that two ecotypes of P. sinofasciata showed significant increases in shoot biomass and P accumulation with ascending N supplied up to a level of 140 mg N kg(-1), beyond which a notable decrease was found. The ME demonstrated greater shoot biomass and P accumulation than the NME. The P extraction ratio in shoot of the ME reached 15.92% under 140 mg N kg(-1), and increased by 30.08% compared with that of NME. Shoot P removal of the ME reached 29.58 mg kg(-1) under 140 mg N kg 1 which was higher than the NME. The ME and NME both showed high levels of P removal from soil, maximum potential yield, and P removal potential after the addition of N. In conclusion, both ecotypes of P. sinofasciata show high P accumulation and P removal from N impacted soils, and thus P. sinofasciata is a potential and worthy candidate for phytoextraction.

Predicted global warming and changes in freeze-thaw cycles therefore may directly or indirectly impact litter decomposition in those ecosystems. Here, we conducted a 2-year-long litter decomposition experiment along an elevational gradient from 3000 to 3600 m to determine the potential effects of litter quality, climate warming and freeze-thaw on the mass losses of three litter types [dragon spruce (Picea asperata Mast.), red birch (Betula albosinensis Burk.), and minjiang fir (Abies faxoniana Rehd. et Wild)]. Marked differences in mass loss were observed among the litter types and sampling dates. Decay constant (k) values of red birch were significantly higher than those of the needle litters. However, mass losses between elevations did not differ significantly for any litter type. During the winter, lost mass contributed 18.3-28.8 % of the net loss rates of the first year. Statistical analysis showed that the relationships between mass loss and litter chemistry or their ratios varied with decomposition periods. Our results indicated that short-term field incubations could overestimate the k value of litter decomposition. Considerable mass was lost from subalpine forest litters during the wintertime. Potential future warming may not affect the litter decomposition in the subalpine forest ecosystems of eastern Tibetan Plateau.

In the current study, to address the challenges of a rapid function loss of primary hepatocytes, the coculture of hepatocytes with fibroblasts and endothelial cells (Hep-Fib-EC) was established on micropatterned fibrous scaffolds. Liver-specific functions, such as the albumin secretion and urea synthesis, were well maintained in the coculture system, accompanied by a rapid formation of multicellular hepatocyte spheroids. The activities of phase I (CYP3A11 and CYP2C9) and phase II enzymes indicated a gradual increase for cocultured hepatocytes, and a maximum level was achieved after 5 days and maintained throughout 15 days of culture. The metabolism testing on model drugs indicated that the scaled clearance rates for hepatocytes in the Hep-Fib-EC coculture system were significantly higher than those of other culture methods, and a linear regression analysis indicated good correlations between the observed data of rats and in vitro predicted values during 15 days of culture. In addition, the enzyme activities and drug clearance rates of hepatocytes in the Hep-Fib-EC coculture model experienced sensitive responsiveness to the inducers and inhibitors of metabolizing enzymes. These results demonstrated the feasibility of micropatterned coculture of hepatocytes as a potential in vitro testing model for the prediction of in vivo drug metabolism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The pathogens included in this study were pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Seven pairs of chimeric primers, consisting of a pathogen-specific sequence fused to a universal sequence at the 5' end, were used to initiate the PCR, after which a set of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the PCR. Amplification products were separated by capillary electrophoresis and identified using fluorescence spectrophotometry. The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with single and mixed pathogen cDNA/DNA templates. The specific DNA product amplification peaks of seven pathogens were observed on the GeXP analyser. Negative controls did not produce DNA products. The sensitivity was evaluated by performing the assay on serial 10-fold dilutions of the plasmids containing the target sequence. Under optimised conditions this assay achieved a sensitivity of 100-1000 copies/mu L for a single virus and 1000 copies/mu L when all of the seven pre-mixed viral targets were present. Furthermore. the GeXP-PCR assay was 100% specific when 58 clinical samples were tested in comparison with the conventional PCR method. In conclusion, the GeXP assay is a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and high throughput method for simultaneously detecting seven pathogens that infect swine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the details of this process are largely unknown. Foliar litters of willow (Salix paraplesia), larch (Larix mastersiana), fir (Abies faxoniana), azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), birch (Betula albosinensis) and cypress (Sabina saltuaria) were selected in an alpine forest of eastern Tibetan Plateau. The litterbags were placed on the forest floor from gap center, canopy gap edge and expanded gap edge to closed canopy. Zinc and copper contents were studied as litter decomposition proceeded. After one year of decomposition, zinc accumulated in all foliar litters regardless of gap positions, but copper accumulated in the litters of fir, azalea and cypress. Separately, copper was released from all foliar litters in winter, whereas zinc in litters of larch, azalea, birch and cypress was released in winter. Moreover, both copper and zinc accumulated during the growing season regardless of litter species. Nevertheless, higher accumulation rates were observed under closed canopy compared with other gap positions. These results suggest that forest gap slows the releases of copper and zinc in foliar litter during forest regeneration in these cold biomes.

Muscle fiber types were very important to meat quality traits, however, the molecular mechanism by which miRNAs regulate the muscle fiber type composition is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miRNA-23a can affect muscle fiber type composition. Luciferase reporter assays proved that miRNA-23a directly targets the 3' untranslated region (UTRs) of MEF2c. Overexpression of miRNA-23a significantly suppressed the expression of MEF2c both in mRNA and protein levels, thus caused down regulation of the expression of some key downstream genes of MEF2c (PGC1-alpha, NRF1 and mtTFA). More interestingly, overexpression of miRNA-23a significantly restrained the myogenic differentiation and decreased the ratio of slow myosin heavy chain in myoblasts (p < 0.05). Our findings hinted a novel role of miRNA-23a in the epigenetic regulation of meat quality via decreasing the ratio of slow myosin heavy chain isoforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, knowledge of the effects of benzoic acid on jejunal digestive physiology, especially the antioxidant capacity and mucosal glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) concentrations is lacking. Methods: A total of 20 barrows [Duroc x (Yorkshire x Landrace)] with an average body weight (BW) of 18.75 +/- 0.2 kg were used in a 14-d trial to determine the potential mechanisms of benzoic acid supplementation on the performance, nutrient digestibility and jejunal digestive physiology in young pigs. All pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 2 diets supplemented with 0 or 5000 mg/kg benzoic acid. Results: Relative to the control, benzoic acid supplementation increased the average daily feed intake (ADFI), and average daily gain (ADG) in young pigs (P < 0.05), improved the apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), gross energy (GE) and crude ash (P < 0.05), and enhanced the activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Similarly, relative to the control, supplementing benzoic acid in the diet resulted in a trend to reduce the pH values of the digesta (P = 0.06), decreased crypt depth and increased the villus height to crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) in the jejunum of pigs. Finally, benzoic acid supplementation increased the mRNA expression and concentration of glucagon-like peptide 2 and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the jejunal mucosa of young pigs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In conclusion, supplementation with 5000 mg/kg benzoic acid improved the performance of young pigs through promoting nutrient digestion, improving jejunal antioxidant capacity, and maintaining the jejunal morphology in young pigs.

These landraces may harbor rich genetic variation responsible for those phenotypes. Four-row Wax is one such landrace, with four rows of kernels on the cob. We resequenced the genome of Four-row Wax, obtaining 50.46 Gb sequence at 21.87 x coverage, then identified and characterized 3,252,194 SNPs, 213,181 short InDels (1-5 bp) and 39,631 structural variations (greater than 5 bp). Of those, 312,511 (9.6%) SNPs were novel compared to the most detailed haplotype map (HapMap) SNP database of maize. Characterization of variations in reported kernel row number (KRN) related genes and KRN QTL regions revealed potential causal mutations in fea2, td1, kn1, and te1. Genome-wide comparisons revealed abundant genetic variations in Four-row Wax, which may be associated with environmental adaptation. The sequence and SNP variations described here enrich genetic resources of maize, and provide guidance into study of seed numbers for crop yield improvement.

The combination of these two compounds has synergistic interaction against the disease. We performed RNA-seq on cucumber leaf samples treated with physcion and chrysophanol alone and with their combination. We generated 17.6 Gb of high-quality sequencing data (similar to 2 Gb per sample) and catalogued the expressions profiles of 12,293 annotated cucumber genes in each sample. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes that exhibited distinct expression patterns among the three treatments. The gene expression patterns of the Chr and Phy treatments were more similar to each other than to the Phy x Chr treatment. The Phy x Chr treatment induced the highest number of differentially expressed genes. This dramatic transcriptional change after Phy x Chr treatment leaves reflects that physcion combined with chrysophanol treatment was most closely associated with induction of disease resistance. The analysis showed that the combination treatment caused expression changes of numerous defense-related genes. These genes have known or potential roles in structural, chemical and signaling defense responses and were enriched in functional gene categories potentially responsible for cucumber resistance. These results clearly demonstrated that disease resistance in cucumber leaves was significantly influenced by the combined physcion and chrysophanol treatment. Thus, physcion and chrysophanol are appealing candidates for further investigation of the gene expression and associated regulatory mechanisms related to the defense response.

Some forms were previously reported for developing the hexaploid triticale, such as crossing tetraploid wheat or hexaploid wheat with rye, crossing hexaploid triticale and/or hexaploid wheat with octoploid triticale, and spontaneously appearing in the selfed progenies of octoploid triticale. In the present study, we developed an effective method for production of diverse types of hexaploid triticale via wheat-rye-Psathyrostachys huashanica trigeneric hybrid. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) karyotyping revealed that D genome chromosomes were completely eliminated and the whole A, B, and R genome chromosomes were retained in three lines. More interestingly, the composite genome of the line K14-489-2 consisted of complete A and B genomes and chromosomes 1D, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R, and 7R, that of line K14-491-2 was 12 A-genome (1A-6A), 14 B-genome (1B-7B), 12 R-genome (1R-3R, 5R-7R), and chromosomes 1D and 3D, and that of the line K14-547-1 had 26A/B and 14R chromosomes, plus one pair of centric 6BL/2DS translocations. This finding implies that some of D genome chromosomes can be spontaneously and stably incorporated into the hexaploid triticale. Additionally, a variety of highmolecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) compositions were detected in the six hexaploid triticale lines, respectively. Besides, compared with its recurrent triticale parent Zhongsi828, these lines showed high level of resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) pathogens prevalent in China, including V26/Gui 22. These new hexaploid triticales not only enhanced diversification of triticale but also could be utilized as valuable germplasm for wheat improvement.

This study uses four global ensemble weather prediction systems: the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the European Centre for Medium -Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the UK Met Office (UKMO), and the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in the THORPEX (The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive from 2006 to 2010. Based on results from the XXT (the first X denotes Xinanjiang, the second X denotes hybrid, and the T denotes TOPMODEL) distributed hydrological model, as well as soil moisture observations and digital elevation model (DEM) data, synthesized drought grades were established in the Huaihe River Basin of China. To filter out the impact of short-term fluctuations on observed soil moisture, a 30 -day moving average was calculated. Use of the moving average significantly improves the correlation between observed soil moisture and simulated soil water deficit depth. Finally, a linear regression model describing the relationship between observed soil moisture and simulated soil water deficit depth was constructed. The deterministic regression coefficient was 05872, the correlation coefficient was 0.77, and the regression coefficient was 15423. The trends in drought grades calculated using soil moisture and soil water deficit depth were found to be the same, and the grades agreed to within one level. Our findings highlight the importance of synthesizing drought grading when assessing drought using different soil moisture indicators in order to obtain a more comprehensive forecast of drought conditions.

JIAN; COOK LOSS	Flesh quality, muscle antioxidant status and related signalling molecule expressions were investigated in young grass carp fed six levels of tryptophan (Trp) for 8 weeks. The results indicated that fish fed 0.7 (deficiency) and 6.1 g Trp g/kg (excess) diets exhibited lower muscle water-holding capacity, tenderness, cathepsin activity, protein levels, lipids and collagen contents. Optimal Trp reversed these negative effects, which were related to enhanced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities regulated at gene transcription levels, rather than to superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase (CAT). The expression of signalling molecules [Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, target of rapamycin (TOR) and ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1] involved in the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway revealed a potential method of Trp-enhanced antioxidant defence. Collectively, the present study indicated that appropriate Trp levels improved flesh quality partly related to the enhancement of antioxidant ability through Nrf2 and TOR signalling.

Methods: Eight gilts with similar age and body weight were randomly allocated into 2 groups receiving the control and high fat diets (HF diet) from d 30 to 90 of gestation, with 4 gilts each group and one gilt each pen. At d 90 of gestation, two fetuses each gilt were removed by cesarean section. Intestinal samples were collected for analysis of morphology, enzyme activities and transcriptional profile. Results: The results showed that feeding HF diet markedly increased the fetal weight and lactase activity, also tended to increase intestinal morphology. Porcine Oligo Microarray analysis indicated that feeding HF diet inhibited 64 % of genes (39 genes down-regulated while 22 genes up-regulated), which were related to immune response, cancer and metabolism, also markedly modified 33 signal pathways such as antigen processing and presentation, intestinal immune network for IgA production, Jak-STAT and TGF-beta signaling transductions, pathways in colorectal cancer and glycerolipid metabolism. Conclusion: Collectively, it could be concluded that maternal high fat intake was able to increase fetal weight and lactase activity, however, it altered the intestinal immune response, signal transduction and metabolism.

The results showed that the bamboo lignin component and extractives were almost completely removed by using a liquefaction process at 120 degrees C for 9min, and the residual lignin and extractives in the solid residue were as low as 0.65% and 0.49%, respectively. Increasing the reaction temperature or time could decrease the solid yield, but they can also enhance the removal of lignin and extractives from bamboo particles and increase the holocellulose content in the solid residue. The absorbance bands that characterized functional groups of lignin on the Fourier transform infrared spectra of the solid residue weakened or disappeared. The solid residue showed high crystallinity, indicating the removal of noncellulosic material. Small cracks were observed on the SEM images of the residue, which indicated that the fibers from liquefaction may be susceptible to chemical access or enzyme attack. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the host immune response of the goose against these two different categories of virus has not been well documented. Here, we compared the clinical symptoms and pathological characteristics, antigen distribution and intensity, and expression of immune-related genes in TMUV- and GPV-infected goose. The immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that GPV was primarily located in the liver, lung, small intestine, and rectum, while TMUV was situated in the liver, brain, spleen, and small intestine. The induction of IFN gamma and proinflammatory cytokines is highly associated with the distribution profiles of antigen and CD8 alpha+ molecules. The effector function of CD8 T cells may be accomplished by the secretion of IFN gamma together with high expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and IL6. Remarkably, significant increases in the transcription of immune genes were observed after infection, which suggested that both GPV and TMUV can effectively induce immune response in goose PMBCs. This study will provide fundamental information for goose molecular immunology in defending against pandemic viruses.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prolonged effect of GLP-2 on the growth performance of weaned piglets. Forty piglets weaned at the age of 28 d with an average BW of 6.8 +/- 0.4 kg were assigned to four treatments: (i) nonchallenged control; (ii) LPS-challenged control; (iii) LPS + low GLP-2; and (iv) LPS + high GLP-2. Piglets in groups (i), (ii), and (iv) were s.c. injected with PBS supplemented with human [Gly2] GLP-2(1-34) at doses of 0, 2 and 10 nmol/kg BW per day for seven consecutive days. BW, gain: feed ratio (G:F), and plasma GLP-2 levels were determined on d 0, 7, and 14 after weaning. Piglets were challenged with i. p. administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 100 mu g/kg on d 14 to induce intestinal damage. Twenty-four hours later, intestinal tract samples were collected to assess intestinal morphology and quantify enzyme activity. Results: Plasma GLP-2 levels decreased after weaning, but in the high GLP-2 group, plasma GLP-2 was maintained on d 7 and even increased to a level higher than the preweaning level on d 14 (P < 0.05). High GLP-2 treatment significantly increased the duodenal, jejunal and ileal weight, as well as the gross weight of the small intestine (SI), and the SI weight index (P < 0.05). LPS caused villous atrophy and disrupted intestinal morphology in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. GLP-2 also significantly increased the villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio (VCR) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (P < 0.05). Histological examination revealed that in GLP-2-treated groups, the integrity of the villus was maintained, and the villus was protected against LPS-induced damage. GLP-2 significantly increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT), and pancreatic lipase in the duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05). GLP-2 treatment also significantly increased the average daily gain (ADG) and G:F of piglets at 0 to 7, 7 to 14, as well as 0 to14 d (P < 0.05), resulting in a significant increase of final BW in high GLP-2 pigs (P = 0.016). Conclusions: Exogenous GLP-2 improved the growth of weaned piglets and protected them against LPS-induced intestinal damage.

The physical and chemical properties of biochars varied significantly based on the pyrolysis temperatures. Analysis of the data revealed that the aromaticity, polarity, specific surface area, pH, and ash content of the biochars increased gradually with the increase in pyrolysis temperature, while the cation exchange capacity, and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen contents decreased. The adsorption kinetics of CR and MB were described by pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Both of Langmuir and Temkin model could be employed to describe the adsorption behaviors of CR and MB by these biochars. The biochars generated at higher pyrolysis temperature displayed higher CR adsorption capacities and lower MB adsorption capacities than those compared with the biochars generated at lower pyrolysis temperatures. The biochar generated at the higher pyrolytic temperature displayed the higher ability to adsorb CR owing to its promoted aromaticity, and the cation exchange is the key factor that positively affects adsorption of MB.

The present study investigated possible regulation of porcine epithelial beta-defensins in response to branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in vivo and in vitro. BCAA treatment increased relative mRNA expression of jejunal and ileal beta-defensins in weaned piglets. In IPEC-J2 cells, isoleucine, leucine, and valine could stimulate beta-defensin expression, possibly associated with stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Sirt1 and ERK completely blocked the activation of ERK and 90RSK protein by isoleucine, simultaneously decreasing defensin expression. BCAA. stimulate expression of porcine intestinal epithelial beta-defensins with isoleucine the most, potent possibly through activation of the Sirt1/ERK/90RSK signaling pathway. The beta-defensins regulation of lipopolysaccharide was related with an ERK-independent pathway. BCAA modulation of endogenous defensin might be a promising approach to enhance disease resistance and intestinal health in young animals and children.

Genetic selection for o2 modifiers can convert the normally chalky endosperm of the mutant into a hard, vitreous phenotype, yielding what is known as quality protein maize (QPM). Previous studies have shown that enhanced expression of 27-kDa gamma-zein in QPM is essential for endosperm modification. Taking advantage of genome-wide association study analysis of a natural population, linkage mapping analysis of a recombinant inbred line population, and map-based cloning, we identified a quantitative trait locus (q gamma 27) affecting expression of 27-kDa gamma-zein. q gamma 27 was mapped to the same region as the major o2 modifier (o2 modifier1) on chromosome 7 near the 27-kDa gamma-zein locus. q gamma 27 resulted from a 15.26-kb duplication at the 27-kDa gamma-zein locus, which increases the level of gene expression. This duplication occurred before maize domestication; however, the gene structure of q gamma 27 appears to be unstable and the DNA rearrangement frequently occurs at this locus. Because enhanced expression of 27-kDa gamma-zein is critical for endosperm modification in QPM, q gamma 27 is expected to be under artificial selection. This discovery provides a useful molecular marker that can be used to accelerate QPM breeding.

In our study, 360 healthy adult female mice were randomly assigned to 9 groups for a 12-day study. Mice of all groups were given a 4-day continuous intraperitoneal injection with different concentrations of ZEA alone, DON alone, and the mixture of ZEA and DON, individually. Blood samples were collected in days 0, 3, 5, 8, and 12 of the experiment. The experiment results showed that all of the experimental groups could cause the dysregulation of the IL-1, IL-4, and C3 levels, thus affecting the immunity of mice. The mixture groups, especially in the group with higher concentrations of ZEA and DON (Group D2Z2), showed more obvious effect on the dysregulation of the IL-1, IL-4, and C3 levels. There was a synergistic effect between DON and ZEA.	[Ren, Z. H.; Deng, Y. T.; Zhou, R.; Deng, H. D.; Deng, J. L.; Zuo, Z. C.; Peng, X.; Yu, S. M.; Shen, L. H.; Cui, H. M.; Hu, Y.

Despite its significance, little is known about the rumen microbial communities at different life stages after birth. In this study, we characterized the rumen bacterial and the archaeal communities in 11 different age groups (7, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 360, 540 and 720 days old) of a crossbred F1 goats (n = 5 for each group) by using an Illumina MiSeq platform targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the bacterial communities were mainly composed of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria across all age groups. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was stable across all age groups. While changes in relative abundance were observed in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, these two phyla reached a stable stage after weaning (day 90). Euryarchaeota (82%) and Thaumarchaeota (15%) were the dominant phyla of Archaea. Crenarchaeota was also observed, although at a very low relative abundance (0.68% at most). A clear age-related pattern was observed in the diversity of bacterial community with 59 OTUs associated with age. In contrast, no age-related OTU was observed in archaea. In conclusion, our results suggested that from 7 days to 2 years, the ruminal microbial community of our experimental goats underwent significant changes in response to the shift in age and diet.

Specific modulation of endogenous HDP synthesis by dietary compounds has been regarded as a novel approach to boost immunity and disease resistance in animal production. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-3 (1,25D(3)) is well known as a powerful HDP inducer in humans, but limited information about the effect of 1,25D(3) on HDPs in poultry is available. Here, we sought to examine whether 1,25D(3) could stimulate avian beta-defensin (AvBD) expression in chickens. We used chicken embryo intestinal epithelial cells (CEIEPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to study the effect of 1,25D(3) on the expression of AvBDs. We observed that 1,25D(3) is able to up-regulate the expression of several AvBDs in CEIEPCs and PBMCs, whereas it increased the amounts of AvBD4 mRNA in CEIEPCs only in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). On the other hand, LPS treatment not only inhibited the expression of CYP24A1 but also altered the expression pattern of VDR in CEIEPCs. Furthermore, AvBDs were not directly regulated by 1,25D(3), as cycloheximide completely blocked 1,25D(3)-induced expression of AvBDs. Our observations suggest that 1,25D(3) is capable of inducing AvBD gene expression and is a potential antibiotic alternative through augmentation of host innate immunity as well as disease control in chickens.

Leymus, a group of allopolyploid species with the NsXm genomes, is a perennial genus with a diverse array of morphology, ecology, and distribution in Triticeae. To estimate the phylogeny and molecular evolution of a single-copy DMC1 gene in Leymus and its diploid relatives, DMC1 homoeologous sequences were isolated from the sampled Leymus species and were analyzed with those from 30 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that: (i) different Leymus species might derive their Ns genome from different Psathyrostachys species; (ii) Pseudoroegneria has contributed to the nuclear genome of some Leymus species, which might result from recurrent hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting; (iii) the Xm genome origin of Leymus could differ among species; (iv) rapid radiation and multiple origin might account for the rich diversity, numbers of species, and wide ecological adaptation of Leymus species; and (v) the DMC1 sequence diversity of the Ns genome in Leymus species was lower than that in the Psathyrostachys diploids, while the level of DMC1 sequence diversity in Leymus was higher than that in diploid Pseudoroegneria. Our results provide new insight on the evolutionary dynamics of duplicate DMC1 genes, polyploid speciation, and the phylogeny of Leymus species.

Lipid homeostasis, closely involved in obesity, has been reported to be regulated by multiple pathways. mTORC1 is emerging as a critical regulator of lipid metabolism. Here, we describe that the consumption of soy isoflavones, with a structural similarity to that of estradiol, could mitigate obesity through an AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Fed with soy isoflavones, the diet-induced obesity (DIO) male rats exhibited decreased body weight, accompanied with suppressed lipogenesis and adipogenesis, as well as enhanced lipolysis and beta-oxidation. The phosphorylation of AKT and S6 were decreased after soy isoflavone treatment in vivo and in vitro, suggesting an inhibition effect of soy isoflavones on mTORC1 activity. Our study reveals a potential mechanism of soy isoflavones regulating lipid homeostasis, which will be important for obesity treatment.

We studied anti-fungal activities of the leaf oil extracted from Eucalyptus. grandis x E. urophylla. Eleven plant pathogenic fungi were tested based on the mycelium growth rates with negative control. The results showed that Eucalyptus oil has broad-spectrum inhibitory effects toward these fungi. Remarkable morphological and structural alterations of hypha have been observed for Magnaporthe grisea after the treatment. The mRNA genome array of M. grisea was used to detect genes that were differentially expressed in the test strains treated by the Eucalyptus oil than the normal strains. The results showed 1919 genes were significantly affected, among which 1109 were down-regulated and 810 were up-regulated (p < 0.05, absolute fold change >2). According to gene ontology annotation analysis, these differentially expressed genes may cause abnormal structures and physiological function disorders, which may reduce the fungus growth. These results show the oil has potential for use in the biological control of plant disease as a green biopesticide.

The root biomass, stem biomass, shoot biomass, total biomass, and the antioxidant enzyme activity of G. parviflora were increased by application of the straw of Y. erythrocarpa. The straw of Y. erythrocarpa, S. orientalis, and B. pilosa reduced soil pH, increased the soil exchangeable Cd concentration, and increased the Cd contents in stems, leaves, and shoots of G. parviflora compared with the control. The straw of Y. erythrocarpa and B. pilosa increased the Cd extraction amount in stems, leaves, shoots and the whole plant of G. parviflora compared with the control, with the effect of Y. erythrocarpa higher than that of B. pilosa. Therefore, the straw of Y. erythrocarpa and B. pilosa improved the Cd extraction ability of G. parviflora from cadmium-contaminated soil, and the straw of Y. erythrocarpa demonstrated to be the best material.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the effects of maternal energy on the growth and small intestine development of offspring. After mating, twenty gilts (Large White (LW) breeding, body weight (BW) at 135.54 +/- 0.66 kg) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments: a control diet (CON) group and a high-energy diet (HED) group, respectively. The nutrient levels of the CON were referred to meet the nutrient recommendations by the National Research Council (NRC, 2012), while the HED was designed by adding an amount of soybean oil that was 4.6% of the total diet weight to the CON. The dietary treatments were introduced from day 1 of gestation to farrowing. At day 90 of gestation, day 1 post-birth, and day 28 post-birth, the weights of fetuses and piglets, intestinal morphology, enzyme activities, and gene and protein expressions of intestinal growth factors were determined. The results indicated that the maternal HED markedly increased the BW, small intestinal weight, and villus height of fetuses and piglets. Moreover, the activities of lactase in fetal intestine, sucrase in piglet intestine were markedly increased by the maternal HED. In addition, the maternal HED tended to increase the protein expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) in fetal intestine, associated with significantly increased the gene expression of IGF-1R. In conclusion, increasing energy intake could promote fetal growth and birth weight, with greater intestinal morphology and enzyme activities.

The purpose of this research was to determine the protective effect of GLP-2 mediated TJ and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stressed IPEC-J2 cells and to test the hypothesis that GLP-2 regulate TJ and TER through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells. Wortmannin and LY294002 are specific inhibitors of PI3K. The results showed that 100 ng/mL LPS stress decreased TER and TJ proteins occludin, claudin-1 and zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) mRNA, proteins expressions (p<0.01) respectively. GLP-2 (100 nmol/L) promote TER and TJ proteins occludin, claudin-1, and zo-1 mRNA, proteins expressions in LPS stressed and normal IPEC-J2 cells (p<0.01) respectively. In normal cells, both wortmannin and LY294002, PI3K inhibitors, prevented the mRNA and protein expressions of Akt and mTOR increase induced by GLP-2 (p<0.01) following with the significant decreasing of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 mRNA and proteins expressions and TER (p<0.01). In conclusion, these results indicated that GLP-2 can promote TJ's expression and TER in LPS stressed and normal IPEC-J2 cells and GLP-2 could regulate TJ and TER through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

How can plants fine-tune this balance and meet such conflicting needs? Here, we show that XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (XDH1) in Arabidopsis thaliana appears to play spatially opposite roles to serve this purpose. Through a large-scale genetic screen, we identified three missense mutations in XDH1 that impair XDH1's enzymatic functions and consequently affect the powdery mildew resistance mediated by RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8 (RPW8) in epidermal cells and formation of xanthine-enriched autofluorescent objects in mesophyll cells. Further analyses revealed that in leaf epidermal cells, XDH1 likely functions as an oxidase, along with the NADPH oxidases RbohD and RbohF, to generate superoxide, which is dismutated into H2O2. The resulting enrichment of H2O2 in the fungal haustorial complex within infected epidermal cells helps to constrain the haustorium, thereby contributing to RPW8-dependent and RPW8-independent powdery mildew resistance. By contrast, in leaf mesophyll cells, XDH1 carries out xanthine dehydrogenase activity to produce uric acid in local and systemic tissues to scavenge H2O2 from stressed chloroplasts, thereby protecting plants from stress-induced oxidative damage. Thus, XDH1 plays spatially specified dual and opposing roles in modulation of ROS metabolism during defense responses in Arabidopsis.

Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were infected with NDV, and quantitative analysis of apoptotic cells was performed using flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity and anti-viral activities of baicalin were studied using the MTT method. The results showed that the maximal safe concentrations of baicalin to CEFs was 1 x 2(-2) mg/ml. Baicalin could directly kill NDV, inhibit the infectivity of NDV to CEF and block intracellular NDV. It inhibited the apoptosis of NDV-infected CEFs and suppressed the spread of NDV. These results indicate that baicalin has strong anti-NDV activity and has the potential for use as components of an antiviral drug.

The selected woody plant species were Abies faxoniana, Betula albosinensis, Sorbus rufopilosa, Rhododendron taliense, Lonicera lanceolata, and L. myrtillus. Mass loss, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) release, and cellulose and lignin degradation in litter were examined from retrieved litterbags over a 6 month period at the end of one snow-covered season. The results showed that the mass loss of A. faxoniana, L. lanceolata, and S. rufopilosa litter, but not that of the other species, was accelerated at higher elevations. Abies faxoniana, B. albosinensis, and S. rufopilosa C release, A. faxoniana and S. rufopilosa N release, L. myrtillus, L. lanceolata, and S. rufopilosa P release, B. albosinensis, S. rufopilosa, and R. taliense cellulose degradation, and L. myrtillus lignin degradation significantly increased with increasing elevation. These results imply that changes in foliar litter decomposition with elevation, although species-specific, could indicate a possible shift in woody plant composition in the alpine forest-tundra ecotone under climate change scenarios. Thus, further studies regarding how elevation shifts could alter litter decomposition and ecosystem sustainability are warranted.

The N-terminal domains of 1St1.2 resemble that of the y-type subunits, while their C-terminal domains are similar to the x-type subunits. We discovered many variation types of polypeptides in central repetitive domain. There also have amino acid mutations in the N-terminal domain. The results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that 1St1.2 might be expression from the St genome. Therefore, the results indicated that 1St1.2 is a novel HMW-GS variant or isoform, and the characterization of the subunit can enhance our understanding on the structural differentiation and evolutionary relationships of HMW-GSs in wheat and its wild relatives.

Chitin is a critical component of the fungal cell wall and is polymerized from UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine by chitin synthase. We characterized FgCHS8, a new class of the chitin synthase gene in F. graminearum. Disruption of FgCHS8 resulted in reduced accumulation of chitin, decreased chitin synthase activity, and had no effect on conidia growth when compared with the wild-type isolate. Delta FgCHS8 had a growth rate comparable to that of the wild type isolate in vitro. However, Delta FgCHS8 had reduced growth when grown on agar supplemented with either 0.025% SDS or 0.9 mM salicylic acid. Delta FgCHS8 produced significantly less deoxynivalenol and exhibited reduced pathogenicity in wheat spikes. Re-introduction of a functional FgCHS8 gene into the Delta FgCHS8 mutant strain restored the wild-type phenotypes. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that FgCHS8 protein was initially expressed in the septa zone, and then gradually distributed over the entire cellular membrane, indicating that FgCHS8 was required for cell wall development. Our results demonstrated that FgCHS8 is important for cell wall sensitivity to environmental stress factors and deoxynivalenol production in F. graminearum. (C) 2016 The British Mycological Society.

Plants treated with or without spermidine (50 mu m) were subjected to 20% PEG 6000 nutrient solution to induce drought stress (50% leaf relative water content). The results showed that increased endogenous spermidine induced by exogenous spermidine altered endogenous phytohormones in association with improved drought tolerance, as demonstrated by the delay in water-deficit development, improved photosynthesis and water use efficiency, and lower oxidative damage. As compared to untreated plants, Spd-treated plants maintained a higher abundance of DEPs under drought stress involved in (1) protein biosynthesis (ribosomal and chaperone proteins); (2) amino acids synthesis; (3) the carbon and energy metabolism; (4) antioxidant and stress defense (ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, and dehydrins); and (5) GA and ABA signaling pathways (gibberellin receptor GID 1, ABA-responsive protein 17, and ABA stress ripening protein). Thus, the findings of proteome could explain the Spd-induced physiological effects associated with drought tolerance. The analysis of functional protein protein networks further proved that the alteration of endogenous spermidine and phytohormones induced the interaction among ribosome, photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis. These differences could contribute to improved drought tolerance.

However, conjugation of GnRH peptide to carrier protein has many drawbacks, hampering the further commercialization of GnRH vaccines. In this study, a new nonconjugated GnRH vaccine, D-Lys6-GnRH-tandem-dimer peptide (TDK), emulsified in Specol adjuvant was investigated for its immunocastration efficacy in young male rats. Prepubertal male rats were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 12): control (no treatment), surgically castrated or immunized against 100 mu g TDK in Specol adjuvant at 6 weeks of age (with a booster 8 weeks later). Blood samples (for antibody titers and hormone concentrations) were collected at 2-week intervals until rats were killed (18 weeks of age). Compared to intact controls, active immunization against TDK reduced (P < 0.05) serum concentrations of testosterone, inhibin B, LH and FSH, prevented the onset of spermatogenesis at puberty. Furthermore, mRNA expressions of GnRH receptor, LH-beta and FSH-beta in the pituitary, LH receptor, FSH receptor, inhibin alpha beta(A), and beta(B) subunit in the testes were decreased in immunocastrated rats compared to intact controls (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate for the first time that GnRH-tandem-dimer peptide emulsified in Specol is a promising veterinary sterilization medicine.

A total of 540 grass carp (264.37 +/- 0.66 g) were fed six diets with graded levels of vitamin C (2.9, 44.2, 89.1, 133.8, 179.4 and 224.5 mg/kg diet) for 10 weeks. Subsequently, a challenge test was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila and the survival rate recorded for 14 days. The results indicated that compared with optimal vitamin C supplementation, vitamin C deficiency (2.9 mg/kg diet) decreased lysozyme (LA) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, and complement 3 and complement 4 (C4) contents (P < 0.05), down-regulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides [liver expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin, beta-defensin] and anti-inflammatory cytokines-related factors, interleukin (IL) 4/13A, IL-4/13B (only in head kidney), IL-10, IL-11, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1, TGF-beta 2, inhibitor of kappa B alpha and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (P < 0.05), and up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines-related factors, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma 2, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 P35 (only in spleen), IL-12 P40, IL-15, IL-17D, nuclear factor kappa B p65, I kappa B kinases (IKK alpha, IKK beta, IKK gamma), target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 mRNA levels (P < 0.05) in the head kidney and spleen under injection fish of A. hydrophila, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency could decrease fish head kidney and spleen immunity and cause inflammation. Meanwhile, compared with optimal vitamin C supplementation, vitamin C deficiency decreased the activities and mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferases and glutathione reductase (P < 0.05), and down-regulated zonula occludens (ZO) 1, ZO-2, Claudin-b, -c, -3c, -7a, -7b, B-cell lymphoma-2, inhibitor of apoptosis protein, NF-E2-related factor 2 mRNA levels (P < 0.05), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl contents (P < 0.05), and up-regulated Claudin-12, 15a, -15b, Fas ligand, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, B-cell lymphoma protein 2 associated X protein, apoptotic protease activating factor-1, caspase-3, -7, -8, -9, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein (Keap) 1a and Keap 1b mRNA levels (P < 0.05) in the head kidney and spleen under injection fish of A. hydrophila, suggesting that vitamin C deficiency could decrease fish head kidney and spleen structural integrity through depression of antioxidative ability, induction of apoptosis and disruption of tight junctional complexes. In addition, except the activities of ACP and MnSOD, and mRNA expression levels of TGF-beta 1, Occludin and MnSOD, the effect of vitamin C on fish head kidney, spleen and skin immunity and structural integrity other indicators model are similar under infection of A. hydrophila. Finally, the vitamin C requirement for the growth performance (PWG) of young grass carp was estimated to be 92.8 mg/kg diet. Meanwhile, the vitamin C requirement for against skin lesion morbidity of young grass carp was estimated to be 122.9 mg/kg diet. In addition, based on the biochemical indices [immune indices (LA activity in the head kidney and C4 content in the spleen) and antioxidant indices (MDA content in the head kidney and ROS content in the spleen)] the vitamin C requirements for young grass carp were estimated to be 131.2, 137.5, 135.8 and 129.8 mg/kg diet, respectively.

The results showed that optimal dietary choline supplementation significantly improved lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, complement component 3 (C3) content, and the liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and Hepcidin mRNA levels in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). In addition, appropriate dietary choline significantly decreased the oxidative damage, which might be partly due to increase copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and increased glutathione content in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). Moreover, appropriate dietary choline significantly up-regulated the mRNA levels of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor 01, Zonula occludens 1, Occludin, Claudin-b, c, 3 and 12, inhibitor of kappa B alpha, target of rapamycin, Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GR, GPx, GST and NF-E2-related factor 2 in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). Conversely, appropriate dietary choline significantly down-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 8, interferon gamma, interleukin 1 beta, and related signaling factors, nuclear factor kappa B p65, I kappa B kinase beta, I kappa B kinase gamma, myosin light chain kinase and Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keap1a) in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). However, choline did not have a significant effect on the mRNA levels of I kappa B kinase alpha, Claudin-15 and Keap1b in the gills of fish. Collectively, appropriate dietary choline levels improved gill antibacterial properties and relative gene expression levels of tight junction proteins, and decreased inflammatory status, as well as up-regulated the mRNA levels of related signaling molecules in the gills of fish. Based on gill C3 content and AHR activity, the dietary choline requirements for young grass carp (266.5-787.1 g) were estimated to be 1191.0 and 1555.0 mg/kg diet, respectively.

In this study, 269DUF1313 genes from 81 photoautotrophic species were identified; they were classified into three major types based on the amino acid substitutions in the conserved region: IARV, I(S/T/F)(K/R)V, and IRRV. Phylogenic tree constructed from 51 DUF1313 genes from graminoids revealed three clades: A, B1, and B2. Clade B1 was found to have undergone episodic positive selection after a gene duplication event and included four amino acid sites under positive selection. The association between DUF1313 family members and traits investigated in maize indicated that three of four genes (GRMZM2G025646, GRMZM5G877647, GRMZM2G359322, and GRMZM2G382774) were associated with the target traits such as days to silking, days to tasselling, and plant height. The nucleotide diversity of the most primitive and highly conserved DUF1313 gene, ELF4-like4, was the highest in Tripsacum and the lowest inmaize. Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D tests revealed that significant purifying selection had occurred in the coding sequence region of this DUF1313 gene in teosinte and maize. No significant signal was detected in the 5'-untranslated region of this gene in each of the three species (maize, teosinte, and Tripsacum) or in any gene regions of Tripsacum. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the 103 accessions of maize, teosinte, and Tripsacum can be grouped into four clades based on the ELF4- like4 gene sequence similarity. Thus, this gene can be used to determine the relationships between maize and its relatives, and the DUF1313 family members and alleles identified in this study might be valuable genetic resources for molecular marker-assisted breeding in maize.

The CuNCs were stabilized by tannic acid and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis, time-correlated single photon counting and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is found that the fluorescence of CuNCs (at excitation/emission peaks of 355/430 nm) is quenched by ferric ion due to electron-transfer between CuNCs and Fe(III) ions. If ascorbic acid is added, Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and quenching is suppressed. The process is completed within 5 min. Under optimal conditions, a linear relation exists between fluorescence recovery and the concentration of ascorbic acid in the 0.5 mu M to 10 mu M concentration range. The detection limit is 0.11 mu M. The method was applied to the determination of ascorbic acid in (spiked) fruit and vegetables and gave recoveries ranging from 89 to 110 %.

However, there is not much information available about the intestinal bacteria composition in captive giant pandas with different ages. In this study, we compared the intestinal bacterial community of 12 captive giant pandas from three different age groups (subadults, adults, and geriatrics) through PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR analysis. Results indicated that microbial diversity in the intestine of adults was significantly higher than that of the geriatrics (p<0.05), but not significant compared to the subadults (p>0.05). The predominant bands in DGGE patterns shared by the twelve pandas were related to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Additionally, in comparison to healthy individuals, antibiotic-treated animals showed partial microbial dysbiosis. Real-time PCR analyses confirmed a significantly higher abundance of the Lactobacillus in the fecal microbiota of adults (p<0.05), while other bacterial groups and species detected did not significantly differ among the three age groups (p>0.05). This study revealed that captive giant pandas with different ages showed different intestinal bacteria composition.

Two hundred and eighty-one-day-old broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed on a control diet and three experimental diets supplemented with 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. Lesions were observed in the NiCl2-treated groups. Histopathologically, lymphocytes were decreased in lymphoid follicles with thinner cortices and wider medullae. Concurrently, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical and glutathione (GSH) contents were significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) decreased, while malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were increased in the NiCl2-treated groups. The serum IgG, IgM, and bursa IgG and IgM contents were significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) lower in the NiCl2-treated groups than those in the control group. The above-mentioned results show that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg can cause histopathological lesions via oxidative damage, which finally impairs the function of the bursa of Fabricius and reduces IgG and IgM contents of the serum and the bursa of Fabricius. The study is aimed to provide helpful materials for studies on Ni- or Ni compounds-induced B cell toxicity in both human and other animals in the future.

It is proven that for each continuous selfmap r on J, the topological entropy of such a coupled lattice system with alpha = 0 is not less than the topological entropy of r, and that for each continuous selfmap on J with positive topological entropy, the above system with alpha = 0 is p-chaotic, where is one of the three properties: Li-Yorke chaos, distributional chaos, p-chaos. Moreover, we deduce that for each continuous selfmap r on J and any , if r is -chaotic, then so is the above system.

The CVPs yield was 34.59 +/- 0.51%, which was in accordance with the predicted value of 35.54%, under the following optimum conditions: microwave power of 466 W, extraction temperature of 64.5 degrees C, extraction time of 15 min, and water-raw material ratio of 40 mL/g. Two CVPs fractions (CVPs-I and CVPs-II) were obtained via stepwise ethanol precipitation. CVPs-II was further purified using DEAE cellulose-52 chromatography to obtain the major fraction of CVPs-IIa. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and GC-MS analysis revealed that crude CVPs, CVPs-I, and CVPs-II were neutral polysaccharides and were mainly composed of glucose and galactose. The molecular weights of CVPs-I and CVPs-IIa were 233.69 and 11.02 kDa, respectively. Furthermore, all samples exhibited certain antioxidant activity or reducing power to scavenge the DPPH and ABTS radicals, among which CVPs-II was the strongest.

J	Wang, SQ; Li, TX; Zheng, ZC				Wang, Shenqiang; Li, Tingxuan; Zheng, Zicheng			Effect of tea plantation age on the distribution of soil organic carbon and nutrient within micro-aggregates in the hilly region of western Sichuan, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tea plantation age; Micro-aggregates; Organic carbon; Total nitrogen; Available phosphorus; Available potassiuma	AGGREGATE-SIZE FRACTIONS; DIFFERENT CLAY MINERALOGY; VEGETATION SUCCESSION; NITROGEN; MATTER; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; TILLAGE; SEQUESTRATION; DENSITY	Pool of micro-aggregate-associated carbon (C) play a highly accurate and general diagnostic role for change in soil organic C pool in response to changes in management practices. However, effects of different chronosequence phases on the pools of organic C and nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) in micro-aggregates of different sizes in tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plantations have not been studied in detail. This study was to investigate the organic C and nutrient pools in micro-aggregates of different sizes as affected by age of tea plantation. Surface (0-20 cm) soil samples were collected from four tea plantations with different ages (16, 23, 31, and 53 years) in Zhongfeng town of Mingshan county, which is in the hilly region of western Sichuan, China. Micro-aggregates were isolated from samples through a standard wet-sieving procedure and then separated by ultrasonic dispersion into five fractions (250-50, 50-10, 10-5, 5-1, and <1 mu m). For all tea plantations, the distribution of micro-aggregate fractions showed that the dominant class was 250-50 mu m fractions with a mean value of 52.98%, and these fractions were the predominant pools of organic C and nutrient in micro-aggregates. Mean weight diameter (MWD) in 53 years of tea plantation was the highest in all tea plantations, suggesting that micro-aggregates in 53 years of tea plantation had more stability than other tea plantations. More important fractions for organic C and total nitrogen (N) retention would be the 250-50 fractions, and higher levels of available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were observed in the <1 mu m fractions. Successive planting of tea (from 16 years to 53 years) induced a significant increase in pools of organic C and nutrient in whole soils, except for the available K pool that showed an inverse trend. These changes were reflected in parallel and predominant changes in pools of these elements in micro-aggregates, especially in the 250-50 pan fractions, which validated the importance of micro-aggregates (in particular the 250-50 pm fractions) as soil organic C and nutrient protection and stabilization sites in such tea plantations.

La-BC and its pristine biochar (CK-BC) were comparatively characterized using zeta potential, BET surface area, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The adsorption ability and the mechanisms during adsorption process for the La-BC samples were also investigated. La loaded on the surface of biochar can be termed as La-composites (such as LaOOH, LaONO3 and La(OH)(3)), leading to the decrease of negative charge and surface area of biochar. La-BC exhibited the high adsorption capacity to phosphate compared to CK-BC. Adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetic studies showed that the Langmuir isotherm and second order model could well describe the adsorption process of La-BC, indicating that the adsorption was dominated by a homogeneous and chemical process. The calculated maximum adsorption capacity was as high as 46.37 mg g(-1) (computed in P). Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic. SEM, XRD, XPS and FT-IR analysis suggested that the multi-adsorption mechanisms including precipitation, ligand exchange and complexation interactions can be evidenced during the phosphate adsorption process by La-composites in La-BC.

Impact of tillage erosion on water erosion in a hilly landscape	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water erosion; Hydrodynamic characteristic; Tillage erosion; Landscape position	SOIL SHEAR-STRENGTH; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; RAINFALL CONDITIONS; SIMULATED RAINFALL; STEEP HILLSLOPE; SEDIMENT YIELD; REDISTRIBUTION; RUNOFF; CHINA; TRANSLOCATION	Little has been known of the interaction between tillage erosion and water erosion, while the two erosion processes was independently studied. Can tillage-induced soil redistribution lead to exaggerated (or retarded) runoff flow and sediment concentrations in steeply sloping fields? A series of simulated tillage and artificial rainfall events were applied to rectangular runoff plots (2 m x 8 m) with a slope of 15 degrees to examine the impacts of tillage erosion intensities on water erosion in the Yangtze Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. Mean flowvelocity, effective/critical shear stress, and soil erodibility factor K were calculated to analyze the differences in hydrodynamic characteristics induced by tillage. Our experimental results suggest that mean runoff rates were 2.26, 1.19, and 0.65 L min(-1) and that mean soil detachment rates were 1.53, 1.01, and 0.61 g m(-2) min(-1) during the 70-min simulated rainfall events for 52-, 31-, and 10-year tillage, respectively. A significant difference (P < 0.05) in cumulative detachment amounts was found among different tillage intensities. Compared with the soil flux of 0 kg m(-1), cumulative detachment amounts for the soil fluxes of 9.86 and 24.72 kg m(-1) increased by 40.02% and 100.94%, respectively, during the 30-min rainfall event. The results imply that soil and water losses tended to increase with increasing tillage intensity. A significant difference in mean flow velocity occurred near the upper and lower slope boundaries of the field, while significant differences (P < 0.05) in runoff depth and effective shear stress were observed among different slope positions. Soil erodibility factor K for the soil fluxes of 9.86 and 24.72 kg m(-1) were 2.40 and 5.11 times higher, respectively, than that for the soil flux of 0 kg m(-1). As tillage intensity increased, critical shear stress trended to gradually decrease for all soil fluxes. Our results indicate that tillage erosion increases soil erodibility and delivers the soil for water erosion in sloping fields, accelerating water erosion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four experimental diets were supplemented with histamine at 0, 1, 2, 4 g/kg. Histamine supplementation had no effect on growth. The activities of digestive enzyme decreased significantly at first (days 7 and 14) (p < 0.05) and then increased or finally slightly recovered in the hepatopancreas and intestinal tract on the 28th day. Tryptase and amylase activities were inhibited significantly in each histamine-treated group on day 7 as compared to the control (p < 0.05). On day 7, 14 and 28, tryptase mRNA relative expression in the histamine treatments correlated positively with the histamine concentration (p < 0.05). Histopathologic analyses showed serious alterations in hepatopancreas, moderate alterations in the hindgut and intestinal bulb, and no alterations in the midgut. In hepatopancreas, low levels (1 g/kg) of histamine caused an increase in the number of B-cells. High levels (4 g/kg) of histamine increased the number of R-cells, which were also highly vacuolized. In extreme cases, the basal lamina was detached from the tubule. In the intestinal bulb and hindgut, high levels of histamine (4 g/kg) decreased the density of reserve inclusion cells. Thus, this indicated that histamine had dose-dependent effect on the activity of digestive enzymes and the morphology of the intestine and hepatopancreas.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coil (UPEC) is the leading cause of UTIs. Accurate and rapid discrimination of UPEC lineages is useful for epidemiological surveillance. Fimbriae are necessary for the adherence of UPEC strains to host uroepithelia, and seem to be abundant and diverse in UPEC strains. By analyzing all the possible fimbrial operons in UPEC strains, we found that closely related strains had similar types of chaperone-usher fimbriae, and the diversity of fimbrial genes was higher than that of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) genes. A typing assay based on the polymorphism of four gene sequences (three fimbrial genes and one housekeeping gene) and the diversity of fimbriae present was developed. By comparison with the MLST, whole-genome sequence (WGS) and fumC/fimH typing methods, this was shown to be accurate and have high resolution, and it was also relatively inexpensive and easy to perform. The assay can supply more discriminatory information for UPEC lineages, and have the potential to be applied in epidemiological surveillance of UPEC isolates.

This study evaluated whether dietary beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate Ca (HMB-Ca) supplementation during the early postnatal period could improve muscle growth in IUGR neonates using piglets as a model. A total of twelve pairs of IUGR and normal-birth-weight (NBW) male piglets with average initial weights (1.85 (SEM 0.36) and 2.51 (SEM 0.39) kg, respectively) were randomly allotted to groups that received milk-based diets (CON) or milk-based diets supplemented with 800 mg/kg HMB-Ca (HMB) during days 7-28 after birth. Blood and longissimus dorsi (LD) samples were collected and analysed for plasma amino acid content, fibre morphology and the expression of genes related to muscle development. The results indicate that, regardless of diet, IUGR piglets had a significantly decreased average daily weight gain (ADG) compared with that of NBW piglets (P < 0.05). However, IUGR piglets fed HMB-Ca had a net weight and ADG similar to that of NBW piglets fed the CON diet. Irrespective of body weight (BW), HMB-Ca supplementation markedly increased the type II fibre cross-sectional area and the mRNA expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), insulin-like growth factor-1 and myosin heavy-chain isoform IIb in the LD of piglets (P < 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the effects of BW and HMB on mTOR expression in the LD (P< 0.05). In conclusion, HMB-Ca supplementation during the early postnatal period could improve skeletal muscle growth and maturity by accelerating fast-twitch glycolytic fibre development in piglets.

Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are important modulators of gene expression and involved in pathogenesis and stress adaptation of Brucella. In this study, using a strand-specific RNA deep-sequencing approach, we identified a global set of sRNAs expressed by B. melitensis 16M. In total, 1321 sRNAs were identified, ranging from 100 to 600 nucleotides. These sRNAs differ in their expression levels and strand and chromosomal distributions. The role of BSR0441, one of these sRNAs, in the virulence of B. melitensis 16M was further characterized. BSR0441 was highly induced during the infection of macrophages and mice. The deletion mutant of BSR0441 showed significantly reduced spleen colonization in the middle and late phases of infection. The expression of the BSR0441 target mRNA genes was also altered in the BSR0441 mutant strain during macrophage and mice infection, which is consistent with its reduced intracellular survival capacity. In summary, Brucella encodes a large number of sRNAs, which may be involved in the stress adaptation and virulence of Brucella. Further investigation of these regulators will extend our understanding of the Brucella pathogenesis mechanism and the interactions between Brucella and its hosts.

Drought transcriptional profiles of resistant and susceptible lines were studied to understand the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.). A total of 4718 genes exhibited significantly differential expression in two L. multiflorum lines. Additionally, up-regulated genes associated with drought response in the resistant lines were compared with susceptible lines. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses revealed that genes partially encoding drought-responsive proteins as key regulators were significantly involved in carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. Comparable gene expression was used to identify the genes that contribute to the high drought tolerance in resistant lines of annual ryegrass. Moreover, we proposed the hypothesis that short-term drought have a beneficial effect on oxidation stress, which may be ascribed to a direct effect on the drought tolerance of annual ryegrass. Evidence suggests that some of the genes encoding antioxidants (HPTs, GGT, AP, 6-PGD, and G6PDH) function as antioxidant in lipid metabolism and signal transduction pathways, which have indispensable and promoting roles in drought resistance. This study provides the first transcriptome data on the induction of drought-related gene expression in annual ryegrass, especially via modulation of metabolic homeostasis, signal transduction, and antioxidant defenses to improve drought tolerance response to short-term drought stress.

PCR-based 6RL-specific markers can facilitate the detection of elite genes on 6RL in wheat breeding. However, only a limited number of 6RL-specific markers have been developed. In the present study, 300 new PCR-based 6RL-specific markers were identified using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, and were further physically mapped to four regions on the 6RL arm using 6R and 6RL deletion lines. Interestingly, 127 of the 300 markers were physically localized to a region from the site between 2.3 and 2.5 to the telomere, the same region where the powdery mildew resistance gene was mapped. In addition, 95 of the 300 markers exhibit polymorphisms, which can be used to investigate the diversity of rye 6RL arms. The markers developed in this study can be used to identify given segments of 6RL in wheat backgrounds and accelerate the utilization of elite genes on 6RL in wheat breeding.

Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Z armaturn are both commonly recognized as Szechuan peppers, but they have different tastes and effects. The chemical components, genetic characteristics, and suitable habitat of six cultivars were analyzed in this study. The results indicated that Z armatum contained a larger proportion of volatile oil, whereas Z. bungeanum produced a more non-volatile ether extraction. The average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. armatum were 11.84 and 11.63%, respectively, and the average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. bungeanum were 6.46 and 14.23%, respectively. Combined with an internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence characters and chemical RCA results, six cultivars were classified into their own groups, for the two species in particular. The temperature in January and July were the most significant ecological factors influencing the contents of the Z. armatum volatile oil. However, annual precipitation, temperature in January and relevant humidity had a significant positive correlation with the content of non-volatile ether extract in Z. bungeanum. Thus, the most suitable areas for producing Z. bungeanum cultivars ranged from the Hengduan Mountains to the Ta-pa Mountains, and the regions suitable for Z armatum cultivars were found to be in the Sichuan Basin and Dalou-Wu mountains. The predicted suitable habitat could be used as a preliminary test area for Szechuan pepper cultivar production.

Results: In this study, a high level of genetic variation was observed in the switchgrass samples and they had an average Nei's gene diversity index (H) of 0.311. A total of 793 bands were obtained, of which 708 (89.28 %) were polymorphic. Using a parameter marker index (MI), the efficiency of the three types of markers (ISSR, SCoT, and EST-SSR) in the study were compared and we found that SCoT had a higher marker efficiency than the other two markers. The 134 switchgrass samples could be divided into two sub-populations based on STRUCTURE, UPGMA clustering, and principal coordinate analyses (PCA), and upland and lowland ecotypes could be separated by UPGMA clustering and PCA analyses. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed an average r(2) of 0.035 across all 51 markers, indicating a trend of higher LD in sub-population 2 than that in sub-population 1 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The population structure revealed in this study will guide the design of future association studies using these switchgrass samples.

Br. is an important genus of perennial forage grasses that is widely used in subtropical and tropical regions. Hemarthria grasses have made remarkable contributions to the development of animal husbandry and agro-ecosystem maintenance; however, there is currently a lack of comprehensive genomic data available for these species. In this study, we used Illumina high-throughput deep sequencing to characterize of two agriculturally important Hemarthria materials, H. compressa "Yaan" and H. altissima "1110." Sequencing runs that used each of four normalized RNA samples from the leaves or roots of the two materials yielded more than 24 million high-quality reads. After de novo assembly, 137,142 and 77,150 unigenes were obtained for "Yaan" and "1110," respectively. In addition, a total of 86,731 "Yawn" and 48,645 "1110" unigenes were successfully annotated. After consolidating the unigenes for both materials, 42,646 high-quality SNPs were identified in 10,880 unigenes and 10,888 SSRs were identified in 8330 unigenes. To validate the identified markers, high quality PCR primers were designed for both SNPs and SSRs. We randomly tested 16 of the SNP primers and 54 of the SSR primers and found that the majority of these primers successfully amplified the desired PCR product. In addition, high cross-species transferability (61.11-87.04%) of SSR markers was achieved for four other Poaceae species. The amount of RNA sequencing data that was generated for these two Hemarthria species greatly increases the amount of genomic information available for Hemarthria and the SSR and SNP markers identified in this study will facilitate further advancements in genetic and molecular studies of the Hemarthria genus.

In this study, we constructed a novel and universal DNA vaccine vector (pSS898) that can be used to build DNA vaccines against duck enteritis virus (DEV) and other viruses that require DNA vaccines to provide protection. This vaccine vector has many advantages, including innate immunogenicity, efficient nuclear trafficking and resistance to attack from nucleases. UL24 and tgB from DEV were chosen as the antigens, and the heat labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) from Escherichia coli and the IL-2 gene (DuIL-2) from duck were used as adjuvants for the construction of DNA vaccine plasmids. Ducklings that were orally immunized with S739 (Salmonella Typhimurium Delta asd-66 Delta crp-24 Delta cya-25) and harboring these DEV DNA vaccines produced strong mucosal and systemic immune responses, and they resisted an otherwise lethal DEV challenge. More importantly, S739 (UL24-LTB) provided 90% protection after a priming-boost immunization. This study shows that our novel and universal DNA vaccine vector can be used efficiently in practical applications and may provide a promising method of orally inoculating ducks with a DEV DNA vaccine delivered by attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium for prevention of DVE.

The DREB transcription factor family genes contains candidate genes for improving plant stress tolerance. Results: From cold-treated H. compressa plants, a putative DREB2 gene (HcDREB2) was cloned using the RACE-PCR method. HcDREB2 was 1296 bp in length and encoded a putative protein 264 amino acid residues long. HcDREB2 shared the highest sequence identity with DREB2 in sorghum. The expression of HcDREB2 was independent of ABA treatment, but inducible by low temperatures as well as drought and high salinity treatments. Yeast one-hybrid assays showed that HcDREB2 directly bound the DRE cis-acting element to transactivate the expression of the downstream reporter genes. Conclusions: HcDREB2, a stress-inducible but ABA-independent transcription factor gene, can transactivate downstream genes by binding to the DRE cis-element. The current results are a foundation for making use of this stress tolerance gene in future H. compressa studies.

However, the yield of fall potatoes showed a linear relationship with plant density, and the highest value was observed at 18 x 10(4) tubers per hectare; (2) Density had a greater influence on the tuber weight of spring potatoes and fruit number of single fall potatoes; (3) The number of potato tubers in the longitudinal concentration exhibited a negative linear relationship with density, whereas the average vertical distribution distance of tubers exhibited a positive incremental hyperbolic relationship. For spring and fall potato tubers, the maximum distances were 8.4152 and 6.3316 cm, and the minimum distances 8.7666 and 6.9366 cm, respectively; and (4) Based on the artificial neural network model of the spatial distribution of tuber weight, density mainly affected the number and spatial distribution of tubers over 80 g. Tubers over 80 g were mainly distributed longitudinally (6-10 cm) and transversely (12-20 cm) within the high density treatment, and the transverse distribution scope and number of tubers over 80 g were reduced significantly. Spring potato tubers over 80 g grown at the lowest density were mainly distributed between 12 and 20 cm, whereas those at the highest density were primarily distributed between 10 and 15 cm.

There was a significant correlation between leaf color and anthocyanin pigment content in the leaves. A distinct allocation of metabolic flow for B-ring trihydroxylated anthocyanins and catechins in 'Ziyan' was observed. Delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonidin (88.15 mg/100 g FW in total) but no other anthocyanin pigments were detected in 'Ziyan', and delphinidin (70.76 mg/100 g FW) was particularly predominant. An analysis of the catechin content in 'Ziyan' and eight other cultivars indicated that 'Ziyan' exhibits a preference for synthesizing B-ring trihydroxylated catechins (with a proportion of 74%). The full-length cDNA sequences of flavonoid pathway genes were isolated by RNA-Seq coupled with conventional TA cloning, and their expression patterns were characterized. Purple-leaved cultivars had lower amounts of total catechins, polyphenols, and water extract than ordinary non-anthocyanin cultivars but similar levels of caffeine. Because dark-purple-leaved Camellia species are rare in nature, this study provides new insights into the interplay between the accumulations of anthocyanins and other bioactive components in tea leaves.

The chemical composition and physicochemical properties of RSM before and after fermentation were compared. To further understand possible mechanism of solid state fermentation, the composition of extracellular enzymes secreted by Aspergillus niger during fermentation was analysed using two-dimentional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS). Results of the present study indicated that SSF had significant effects on chemical composition of RSM. The fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) contained more crude protein (CP) and amino acid (AA) (except His) than unfermented RSM. Notably, the small peptide in FRSM was 2.26 time larger than that in unfermented RSM. Concentrations of anti-nutritional substrates in FRSM including neutral detergent fiber (NDF), glucosinolates, isothiocyanate, oxazolidithione, and phytic acid declined (P < 0.05) by 13.47, 43.07, 55.64, 44.68 and 86.09%, respectively, compared with unfermented RSM. A. niger fermentation disrupted the surface structure, changed macromolecular organic compounds, and reduced the protein molecular weights of RSM substrate. Total proteins of raw RSM and FRSM were separated and 51 protein spots were selected for mass spectrometry according to 2D-DIGE map. In identified proteins, there were 15 extracellular hydrolases secreted by A. niger including glucoamylase, acid protease, beta-glucanase, arabinofuranosidase, xylanase, and phytase. Some antioxidant related enzymes also were identified. These findings suggested that A. niger is able to secrete many extracellular degradation enzymes (especially lignocellulosic hydrolyzing enzymes, acid proteases and phytase) during fermentation of RSM, thus altering chemical composition and physicochemical properties of RSM.

However, the mechanisms of underlying Ni nephrotoxicity are still elusive, and also Ni- and Ni compound-induced ER stress has been not reported in vivo at present. Our aim was to use broiler chickens as animal model to test whether the ER stress was induced and UPR was activated by NiCl2 in the kidney using histopathology, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Two hundred and eighty one-day-old broiler chickens were divided into 4 groups and fed on a control diet and the same basal diet supplemented with 300 mg/kg, 600mg/kg and 900mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. We found that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg induced ER stress, which was characterized by increasing protein and mRNA expression of ER stress markers, e.g., GRP78 and GRP94. Concurrently, all the three UPR pathways were activated by dietary NiCl2. Firstly, the PERK pathway was activated by increasing eIF2a and ATF4 mRNA expression. Secondly, the IRE1 pathway was activated duo to increase in IRE1 and XBP1 mRNA expression. And thirdly, the increase of ATF6 mRNA expression suggested that ATF6 pathway was activated. The findings clearly demonstrate that NiCl2 induces the ER stress through activating PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 UPR pathways, which is proved to be a kind of molecular mechanism of Ni- or/and Ni compound-induced nephrotoxicity.

The brains of stillborn pigs were collected and a previously unknown Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), namely SCYA201201, was isolated. According to the results of agarose gel diffusion precipitation, indirect immunofluorescence analysis, neutralization testing, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification, and physical and chemical testing, the virus was conformed to have the characteristics of JEV. The virus titer in BHK-21 cells was 10(8.47) PFU/ml and the median lethal dose (LD50) to 3 -week-old and 7-day-old mice was 1.99 log10 and 1.02 log10 PFU/LD50, respectively. The results of tissue tropism for mice showed that the viral load in the brain was significantly higher than other organs, indicating that the isolate was strongly neurotropic. Additionally, the complete genome sequence of the isolate was determined and compared with other JEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate belongs to genotype I and may be an imported virus. The isolate had 88.4% nucleotide identity with the Chinese vaccine strain SA14-14-2. However, there were 69 amino acid substitutions compared with the strain SA14-14-2. Some substitutions indicated that SCYA201201 was highly neurovirulent and infective, in accordance with the results of animal testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A large number of microRNAs are involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation, many of which remain undiscovered. In this study, we found that miR-143-3p was upregulated during C2C12 myoblast differentiation and over-expression of miR-143-3p significantly inhibited the relative expression levels of MyoD, MyoG, myf5, and MyHC genes, especially in the later stages of differentiation. In addition, miR-143-3p inhibited expression of genes involved in the endogenous Wnt signaling pathway during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, including Wnt5a, LRP5, Axin2, and -catenin. These results indicate that miR-143-3p represents a new myogenic differentiation-associated microRNA that can inhibit C2C12 myoblast differentiation, especially in the later stages of differentiation.

STUDY DESIGN: Studies were carried out on Tianfu ducks on days 14, 18, 22, and 26 of embryogenesis (E14, E18, E22, and E26) as well as at 0 (neonatal stage), 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 26, 29, and 32 weeks of postnatal development (P0, P1, P3, P5, P8, P11, P14, P17, P20, P26, P29, and P32). RESULTS: NPY-like immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) was detected mainly in the epithelial reticular cells and vascular smooth muscles, slightly in the lymphocytes from E26 onwards. On E26, NPY-ir was restricted to the epithelial reticular cells of diffuse forms of Hassall's corpuscle (DHC). The integral optical density (IOD) values of NPY-ir cells in the cortex and medulla did not significantly change from P0 to P17, but then dramatically rose from P20 to P32. NPYY1-like immunoreactivity (NPYY1-ir) was observed mainly in the lymphocytes, slightly in the epithelial reticular cells of DHC and the vascular smooth muscles from E18 onwards. The IOD values of NPYY1-ir cells significantly increased from E18 to E22, then kept unchanged until P0, greatly increased on P3, and then remained stable until P17 but dramatically increased from P20 to P32. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the possible interaction between NPY and NPYY1 may take place within the duck thymus chiefly during postembryonic development, which might be of great importance for the function of thymocytes, as well as duck thymus involution.

The results showed that: (1) Roegneria alashanica-1 grouped with the Y-type sequences and Roegneria alashanica-2 grouped with the St-type sequences, confirming that Roegneria alashanica has the StY genomes. (2) Roegneria grandis-1 grouped with the Y-type sequences and Roegneria grandis-2 grouped with the St-type sequences, confirming that Roegneria grandis has the SOY genomes, where the St genome from R. grandis is different from the St genome but is homologous with the Y genome. (3) Two Roegneria elytrigioides sequences grouped with the St-type sequences, confirming that Roegneria elytrigioides has the St(1)St(2) genomes and should therefore be classified as Pseudoroegneria elytrigioides.

Additionally, the joint effects of the two compounds on cytochrome P450 enzyme activity and on the expression levels of mRNA of three P450 genes (including CYP9A9, CYP6B, and CYP4G37) and an NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase gene (HQ852049) were investigated. The toxicity of the mixture of chlorantraniliprole and sinigrin to fourth-instar S. exigua larvae was 1.60-fold higher than the toxicity of the chloran-traniliprole-only treatment after 24 h. Induced by chlorantraniliprole and sinigrin, the specific activity of the P450 O-deethylase was affected in a time-, dose-, and organ-specific manner in fifth-instar S. exigua larvae. The effects were more pronounced in the midgut than in the fat body. The specific activity of the P450 O-deethylase in almost all treatments increased at 12, 24, and 36 h posttreatment compared with that in the control. Based on real-time PCR analyses, the expression levels of the P450 genes CYP9A9, CYP6B, and CYP4G37 and the NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase gene HQ852049 in fifth-instar S. exigua larvae were induced by chlorantraniliprole and sinigrin, and the trends were similar to the specific activity of the P450 O-deethylase. Therefore, the CYP9A9, CYP6B, and HQ852049 in the tested genes were the most inducible genes that were expressed when the S. exigua larvae were exposed to chlorantraniliprole and sinigrin.	[Wang, X.

Based on morphological methods and a phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences, this strain was identified as Chaetomium globosum. An antifungal activity bioassay demonstrated that the crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts of strain 28 had a wide antifungal spectrum and strong antimicrobial activity, particularly against Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) Leonard et Suggs, Botrytis cinerea persoon and Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. Furthermore, the fermentation conditions, extraction method and the heat stability of antifungal substances from strain 28 were also studied. The results showed that optimal antifungal activity can be obtained with the following parameters: using potato dextrose broth (PDB) as the base culture medium, fermentation for 4-8 d (initial pH: 7.5), followed by extraction with EtOAc. The extract was stable at temperatures up to 80 degrees C. This is the first report on the isolation of endophytic C. globosum from H. cordata to identify potential alternative biocontrol agents that could provide new opportunities for practical applications involving H. cordata.

Jian). A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp with an average initial weight of 6.33 +/- 0.03 g were fed graded levels of arginine (9.8-24.5 g kg(-1) diet) for nine weeks. The study showed that arginine deficiency up-regulated interleukin 1, interleukin 8 and transforming growth factor-beta and down-regulated tumour necrosis factor alpha gene expression (P < 0.05). Additionally, arginine deficiency increased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) and glutathione contents and decreased the activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, arginine deficiency significantly increased claudin 7, occludin, protein kinase C, NF-E2-related factor 2 and Kelch-like-ECH- associated protein 1 mRNA expression and decreased SOD1, CAT and GR mRNA expression (P < 0.05). All of these results indicated that arginine deficiency impaired intestinal immune function via the regulation of mRNA expression of cytokines, tight junction proteins, antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2/Keap1 and PKC in fish intestine.

A total of 1260 juvenile grass carp with an average initial weight of 8.78 +/- 0.03 g were fed diets with different ALA/LNA ratios (0.01, 0.34, 0.68, 1.03, 1.41, 1.76 and 2.15) for 60 days. Results indicated that ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 significantly increased acid phosphatase, lysozyme activities and complement C3 contents, promoted interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta 1 and KB inhibitor alpha mRNA abundance, whereas suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma 2) and signal molecules (I kappa B kinase beta, I kappa B kinase gamma and nuclear factor kappa B p65) mRNA levels in the intestine (P < 0.05), suggesting that optimal dietary ALA/LNA ratio improved intestinal immune response of juvenile fish. Additionally, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 significantly promoted Claudin-3, Claudin-b, Claudin-c, Occludin and ZO-1 gene transcription, whereas reduced Claudin-15a and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA levels in the intestine, suggesting that appropriate dietary ALA/LNA ratio strengthened tight junctions in the intestine of juvenile fish. Meanwhile, ALA/LNA ratio of 1.03 noticeably elevated glutathione contents, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities and mRNA levels, as well as signaling molecule nuclear factor erythoid 2-related factor 2 gene transcriptional abundance in the intestine, suggesting that proper, yatio of dietary ALA/LNA ameliorate the intestinal antioxidant status of juvenile fish. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of the complement C3 content in the distal intestine and malondialdehyde content in the whole intestine, optimal ALA/LNA ratio for maximum growth of juvenile grass carp (8.78-72.00 g) were estimated to be 1.13 and 1.12, respectively.

Fish were fed diets that contained 0.12-2.04 mg thiamin kg(-1) for 8 weeks. We found that dietary thiamin deficiency resulted in reduced complement 3 content, lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, mRNA levels of hepcidin, liver-expressed antimicrobial peptides 2, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, interleukin (IL)-10, inhibitor protein-kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha), ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 and target of rapamycin (TOR) and increased expression of interferon-gamma 2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TGF-beta 2, IL-1 beta, IL-8, I kappa B kinases (IKK beta and IKK gamma) and nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65). Our findings showed that thiamin deficiency reduced the immune status of fish gills. Furthermore, thiamin deficiency resulted in reduced mRNA transcript levels of claudin b, claudin 3, claudin 12, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin and increased mRNA transcript levels of claudin 15a, myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in fish gill tissues. These data suggested that thiamin deficiency disrupted tight junction-mediated fish gill barrier function. Additionally, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels and both the activities and expression levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferases and glutathione reductase, as well as NF-E2-related factor 2 gene expression in fish gills, were lower in fish fed a thiamin deficient diet. By contrast, thiamin deficiency increased levels of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein I a (Keap1a) and Keapib mRNA transcript expression in fish gills. Taken together, our findings indicated that thiamin deficiency impaired fish gill health by effects on the expression of genes encoding cytokines, tight junction proteins, antioxidant enzymes, NF-kappa B p65, MLCK and Nrf2.

JIAN; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; GENE-EXPRESSION; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; MACROBRACHIUM-ROSENBERGII; EPINEPHELUS-COIOIDES; TRANSCRIPT ABUNDANCE	This investigation used the same growth trial as the previous study, which showed that folic acid deficiency retarded growth in young grass carp (the percent weight gain of Groups 1-6 were 10232 +/- 3.41%, 137.25 +/- 10.48%, 179.78 +/- 3.95%, 164.33 +/- 321%, 14335 +/- 8.12% and 115.28 +/- 2.66%) 11]. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dietary folic acid on the immune response, antioxidant status and tight junctions in the intestine of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 540 young grass carp were fed diets containing graded levels of folic acid at 0.10, 0.47, 1.03, 1.48, 1.88 and 3.12 mg kg(-1) diet for 8 weeks. The results indicated that acid phosphatase and lysozyme activities, and the complement component 3 content in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) were decreased with folic acid deficiency (0.1 mg kg(-1)) (P < 0.05). Folic acid deficiency (0.1 mg kg(-1)) up-regulated interleukin 10, interleuldn 8, tumor necrosis factor a, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), IKB kinase alpha (IKK-alpha), IKK-beta and IKK-gamma gene expression, meanwhile down-regulated interleulcin 10, transforming growth factor beta, I kappa B and target of rapamycin gene expression in the PI, MI and DI (P < 0.05). These data suggested that folic acid deficiency decreased fish intestinal innate immune function may be partly contributed to the regulation of NF-kappa B p65 pathway. Moreover, the activities and corresponding gene expression of glutathione content, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione s-transferases and glutathione reductase in fish intestine were depressed by deficient folic acid diet (0.1 mg kg(-1)) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, folic acid deficiency (0.1 mg kg(-1)) down-regulated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene expression, up-regulated Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keapla) and Keaplb gene expression in fish intestine (P < 0.05). These data indicated that deficient folic acid diet damaged fish intestinal antioxidant capacity partly by regulating Nrf2/Keapl pathway. Additionally, folic acid deficiency (0.1 mg kg(-1)) down-regulated claudin-b, claudin-c, claudin-3, occludin and zonula occludens 1 gene expression; whereas folic acid deficiency (0.1 mg kg-1) up-regulated claudin-12, claudin-15, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) gene expression in the PI, MI and DI (P < 0.05), suggesting that folic acid deficiency may damage fish intestinal tight junctions associated with the mediation of MLCK and p38 MAPK gene expression.

However, their clinical applications are generally limited by scarce natural resources, various side effects and multidrug resistance. Therefore, it is significant to develop paclitaxel-mimics with simplified structure, fewer side effects and improved pharmaceutical properties. Based on our investigation on chemistry of paditaxel, the current review summarized the most recent advances in the design, synthesis and biological activities of paclitaxel-mimics, which could be appealing to researchers in the field of medicinal chemistry and oncology. Meanwhile, smart design, interesting synthesis and potential bioactivities of these novel compounds may also provide valuable reference for the wider scientific communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Development of wheat -P. huashanica translocation lines will facilitate its practical utilization in wheat breeding. In the present study, a wheat -P. huashanica small segmental translocation line, K-13-835-3, was isolated and characterized from the BC1F5 population of a cross between wheat -P. huashanica amphiploid PHW-SA and wheat cultivar CN16. Cytological studies showed that the mean chromosome configuration of K-13-835-3 at meiosis was 2n = 42 = 0.10 I + 19.43 II (ring) + 1.52 II (rod). GISH analyses indicated that chromosome composition of K-13-835-3 included 40 wheat chromosomes and a pair of wheat -P. huashanica translocation chromosomes. FISH results demonstrated that the small segment from an unidentified P. huashanica chromosome was translocated into wheat chromosome arm 5DS, proximal to the centromere region of 5DS. Compared with the cultivar wheat parent CN16, K-13-835-3 was highly resistant to stripe rust pathogens prevalent in China. Furthermore, spikelets and kernels per spike in K-13-835-3 were significantly higher than those of CN16 in two growing seasons. These results suggest that the desirable genes from P. huashanica were successfully transferred into CN16 background. This translocation line could be used as novel germplasm for high-yield and, eventually, resistant cultivar breeding.

J	Du, JG; Sun, XY; Jiang, G				Du, Jiguang; Sun, Xiyuan; Jiang, Gang			Exploring the Interaction Natures in Plutonyl (VI) Complexes with Topological Analyses of Electron Density	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						plutonyl complexes; chemical bondings; QTAIM; NCI	BASIS-SETS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; CHEMICAL-BONDS; METAL; ATOMS; IONS; POTENTIALS; SPECTRA; SCHEME	The interaction natures between Pu and different ligands in several plutonyl (VI) complexes are investigated by performing topological analyses of electron density. The geometrical structures in both gaseous and aqueous phases are obtained with B3LYP functional, and are generally in agreement with available theoretical and experimental results when combined with all-electron segmented all-electron relativistic contracted (SARC) basis set. The Pu Oy1 bond orders show significant linear dependence on bond length and the charge of oxygen atoms in plutonyl moiety. The closed-shell interactions were identified for Pu-Ligand bonds in most complexes with quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analyses. Meanwhile, we found that some Pu Ligand bonds, like Pu OH, show weak covalent. The interactive nature of Pu ligand bonds were revealed based on the interaction quantum atom (IQA) energy decomposition approach, and our results indicate that all Pu Ligand interactions is dominated by the electrostatic attraction interaction as expected. Meanwhile it is also important to note that the quantum mechanical exchange-correlation contributions can not be ignored. By means of the non-covalent interaction (NCI) approach it has been found that some weak and repulsion interactions existed in plutonyl(VI) complexes, which can not be distinguished by QTAIM, can be successfully identified.
