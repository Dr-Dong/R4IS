Microstructures, mechanical and tribological properties of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/BN/GNPs nanocomposites were investigated. Microstructures were examined by optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mechanical properties were determined by the relative density, micro-Vickers hardness, as well as tensile strength, compressive strength and shear strength. Tribological behavior of the Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/BN/GNPs composite against the GCr15 steel ring was evaluated using an M-2000 wear tester with high tangential sliding velocity. Results demonstrated that BN and graphene nano-platelets (GNPs) have an impact on the microstructures and mechanical properties of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/BN/GNPs nanocomposites. Based on microstructures, and mechanical and tribological properties of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/BN/GNP nanocomposites, strengthening, fracture and wear mechanisms for synergistic enhancement by multi-phase reinforcements were analyzed.

However, some experiments found that GPCRs also give rise to constitutive activity through some mutations (viz., CAM), which are usually associated with different kinds of diseases. However, the mechanisms of CAMs and their roles in interactions with drug-ligands are unclear in experiments. Herein, we used microsecond molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of one important F282L mutation on beta 2AR in order to address the questions above. With the aid of principle component and correlation analysis, our results revealed that the F282L mutation could increase the instability of the overall structure, increase the dramatic fluctuations of NPxxY and extracellular loops, and decrease restraint of the helices through weakening interhelical H-bonding and correlations between residues, which could partly contribute to the constitutive activity reported by the experiments. The observations from the protein structure network (PSN) analysis indicate that the mutant exhibits less information flow than the wild beta 2AR and weakens the role of TM5 and TM6 in the signal transmission, but it enhances the impact of TM3 on the orthosteric pathway and TM4 on the allosteric one. In addition, the results from the virtual screening reveal that the mutant prefers to select agonists rather than antagonists, similar to the active state but opposite of the inactive state, further confirming that the F282L mutation advances the activation of beta 2AR. Our observations provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of the mutation-caused constitutive activity of GPCR and related drug-design.

Interfacial microstructures of diffusion-bonded joints were characterized by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The inter-diffusion of the elements across the diffusion interface was revealed via electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The mechanical properties of the joints were investigated via micro Vickers hardness and tensile strength. The results show that an Ni interlayer can serve as an effective diffusion barrier for the bonding of 316L stainless steel and the 4J29 Kovar alloy. The composition of the joints was 316L/Ni s. s (Fe-Cr-Ni)/remnant Ni/Ni s. s (Fe-Co-Ni)/4J29. The highest tensile strength of 504.91 MPa with an elongation of 38.75% was obtained at 900 degrees C for 240 min. After the width of nickel solid solution (Fe-Co-Ni) sufficiently increased, failure located at the 4J29 side and the fracture surface indicated a ductile nature.

The Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns, microstructure, static magnetic properties and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of NiCuZn ferrites have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), B-H analyzer and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer, respectively. The FMR linewidth was investigated by an approximate calculation based on spin wave approach. The results revealed that all the samples were a single NiCuZn spinel phase. With the increase of iron-deficient amount, the lattice parameter (a) displayed a decreasing trend. However, the bulk density first increased rapidly and then trended to go up slightly. The saturation magnetization of stoichiometric NiCuZn ferrites was much lower than that of iron-deficient samples. This phenomenon is ascribed to the combined effect between molecule magnetic moment and bulk density. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant, derived from the law of approach to saturation, has been discussed. The anisotropy and porosity linewidth broadening models were adopted to identify the linewidth contribution. The results manifested that the porosity linewidth broadening was much larger than the anisotropy linewidth broadening. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we employ the probability density functions (PDFs) derived from the extreme Fisher information (EFI) method in the view of information theory for estimating the measurement uncertainty of the measurement result. By considering the physical essence of EFI, a differential equation model is established for the measurement practice and the explicit form of the solution PDF corresponding to EFI is given, which guarantees the dynamics and the practicability of the estimation of the measurement uncertainty (MU). The obtained the PDF can describe the combined performance of the system and all the measurement effects, then, with the PDF and the confidence, MU can be estimated more dynamically and efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed EFI method is demonstrated by the numerical results of two practical instances.

One approach to enhance the DOF is applying the amplitude-modulating method on the microlens arrays. However, the conventional amplitude-modulating methods usually suffer some collateral effects such as lateral resolution reductions or contrast reversals. In this paper, we propose a gradient-amplitude-modulating (GAM) method to enhance the DOF of the II pickup system when recording large-depth 3D scenes. This method is practical and not accompanied by any obvious lateral resolution deteriorations or contrast reversals. Experimental results obtained from the optical pickup process and computational reconstruction process finally demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

However, FCM_S has high computational complexity and still lacks enough robustness to noise and outliers, which will limit its usefulness. To overcome these difficulties, a local correntropy-based fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm with spatial constraints (LCFCM_S) and its simplified model (LCFCM_S-1) are proposed in this paper. By utilizing the correntropy criterion, the clustering algorithm can efficiently emphasize the weights of the samples that are close to their corresponding cluster centers. Then, the proposed clustering algorithms are incorporated into a variational level set formulation with a level set regularization term. Finally, the iteratively re-weighted algorithm is adopted to solve the LCFCM_S and LCFCM_S-1 based level set method. Experimental results on synthetic and real images show the superiority of our methods in terms of accuracy and robustness for segmenting images with intensity inhomogeneity and noise, when compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.

This has been calculated to the sixth order in experiments. Corresponding theoretical studies on the sixth order cumulant are necessary. Based on the universality of the critical behavior, we study the temperature dependence of the sixth order cumulant of the order parameter using the parametric representation of the three-dimensional Ising model, which is expected to be in the same universality class as QCD. The density plot of the sign of the sixth order cumulant is shown on the temperature and external magnetic field plane. We found that at non-zero external magnetic field, when the critical point is approached from the crossover side, the sixth order cumulant has a negative valley. The width of the negative valley narrows with decreasing external field. Qualitatively, the trend is similar to the result of Monte Carlo simulation on a finite-size system. Quantitatively, the temperature of the sign change is different. Through Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model, we calculated the sixth order cumulant of different sizes of systems. We discuss the finite-size effects on the temperature at which the cumulant changes sign.

The sensitivity jump of micro accelerometers in the calibrating process is recognized as an important abnormal behavior and investigated in this paper. The characteristics of jumping output in the centrifuge test are theoretically and experimentally analyzed and their underlying mechanism is found to be related to the varied stiffness of supporting beam induced by the convex defect on it. The convex defect is normally formed by the lithography deviation and/or etching error and can result in a jumping stiffness of folded microbeams and further influence the sensitivity when a part of the bending beams is stopped from moving by two surfaces contacting. The jumping level depends on the location of convex and has nothing to do with the contacting properties of beam and defects. Then the location of defect is predicted by theoretical model and simulation and verified by the observation of micro structures under microscopy. The results indicate that the tested micro accelerometer has its defect on the beam with a distance of about 290 mu m from the border of proof mass block.

However, whether this working memory-driven attentional modulation takes place on early perceptual processes remains unclear. Our present results showed that working memory-driven attention improved identification of a brief Landolt target presented alone in the visual field. Because the suprathreshold target appeared without any external noise added (i.e., no distractors or masks), the results suggest that working memory-driven attention enhances the target signal at early perceptual stages of visual processing. Furthermore, given that performance in the Landolt target identification task indexes spatial resolution, this attentional facilitation indicates that working memory-driven attention can boost early perceptual processing via enhancement of spatial resolution at the attended location.

In order to manifest the variation of permeability, the dominant magnetization mechanism was investigated by resolving the complex permeability spectra into two components including domain wall movement and spin rotation magnetization. The results show that, with grain size increasing, the dominant contribution to magnetization mechanism changes from spin rotation magnetization to domain wall movement due to the increase of amount of domain wall, and the amount of domain wall is observed by Lorentz microscopy to measure the critical diameter of magnetic domain which is around 3 mu m in NiZn ferrite. The temperature dependence of the magnetization mechanism has been discussed for the sake of thermal stability. As the operating temperature increases, the ratio between two magnetization mechanism components appears to be stable around 4 after a shift from 1.76, and the domain wall movement totally dominates the variation of permeability as the main magnetization mechanism.

This display consists of an RLS and a 2D display panel. The 2D display panel is located in front of the RLS. The RLS consists of a light source, a light guide plate (LGP), and a reflection cavity. The light source and the LGP are located in the reflection cavity. Light from the light source can enter into the LGP and reflect continuously in the reflection cavity. The reflection cavity has a series of slits, and light can exit only from these slits. These slits can work as a postpositional parallax barrier, so when they modulate the parallax images on the 2D display, 3D images are formed. Different from the conventional 3D display based on a parallax barrier, this RLS has less optical loss, so it can provide higher brightness. A prototype of this display is developed. Experimental results show that this RLS-based 3D display can provide higher brightness than the conventional one.

The calculations demonstrated that at 0 K, the magnetic ions Cu2+ preferentially occupy Fe3+ at the 4f(2)(0) and 4f(2)(1) configurations. For the site occupancy at the higher temperature (0-1500 K, except 0 K), we computed the formation probability of twenty inequivalent configurations using the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistical distribution. Correspondingly, the Cu2+ ions prefer to enter the 4f(2) and 2b sites, especially close to lanthanum layer. In order to confirm the computational conclusions, La-Cu substituted barium hexaferrites with the chemical formula of Ba1-xLaxFe12-xCuxO19 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), prepared by a conventional ceramic method, were investigated by the Raman spectra and Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD). The experiments revealed that the Cu2+ ions are partitioned at the 2b and 4f(2) sites in the ratio of around 1:2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of different structures on the crystallographic, morphological, magnetic properties and stress were investigated in details. For the structure of d(s100), BaM film processes platelet-like grains, which shows excellent magnetocrystalline anisotropy and large squareness ratio S-perpendicular to (0.62). For the structure of d(s200), there are a lot of acicular grains. Thus, the c-axis in-plane oriented and/or randomly oriented grains induce poor magnetocrystalline anisotropy. For the structure of d(b200), the platelet-like grains dominate the microstructure. Both squareness ratio S-perpendicular to (0.67) and coercivity H-c perpendicular to (98.6 kA/m) of the d(b200) show the highest values among the three kinds of the film structures. In addition, with the increase of film thickness from 100 nm to 200 nm, the stress in film decreases gradually. Compared with the other structures, the bilayer 200 nm thick film (d(b200)) obtains the smallest stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Long-Range Motion Trajectories Extraction of Articulated Human Using Mesh Evolution	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Articulated motion; mesh evolution; motion trajectories	SPACE-TIME SHAPES	This letter presents a novel approach to extract reliable dense and long-range motion trajectories of articulated human in a video sequence. Compared with existing approaches that emphasize temporal consistency of each tracked point, we also consider the spatial structure of tracked points on the articulated human. We treat points as a set of vertices, and build a triangle mesh to join them in image space. The problem of extracting long-range motion trajectories is changed to the issue of consistency of mesh evolution over time. First, self-occlusion is detected by a novel mesh-based method and an adaptive motion estimation method is proposed to initialize mesh between successive frames. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm to efficiently adjust vertices of mesh for a physically plausible deformation, which can meet the local rigidity of mesh and silhouette constraints. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods on a set of challenging sequences. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance in terms of both accuracy and integrity of extracted trajectories.

X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the crystal structures of the films. Transmission electronic microscope was used to analyze the surface and the interface morphology of the films. Ferroelectric properties were showed by measuring the remnant polarization and the leakage current dependence of electric field. The results indicated that it was good for reducing lead loss and annealing temperature of PZT films by microwave plasma assisted annealing. Ferroelectric properties of the film could also be enhanced by this pilot annealing method.

The phase structure, surface morphology and magnetic property of NZFs were investigated using the X-ray diffractometer (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. All the NZFs deposited on three kinds of substrates possess spinel structure, while only the film deposited on MgAl2O4(100) substrate [NZF/MgAl2O4(100)] has a preferred orientation along the direction of (100) because of the strong inducing effect of substrate. NZF/MgAl2O4(100) owns smoother surface than that of the film deposited on Si(111) substrate [NZF/Si(111)]. However, NZF/MgAl2O4(100) possesses larger grain size and much inhomogeneous distribution of grain size than that of NZF/Si(111). NZF/MgAl2O4(100) has the greatest saturation magnetization (M-s) of 345 kA/m and coercivity (H-c) of 5.80 kA/m. According to the stress model, the coercivity of NZFs deposited on various substrates has been calculated and discussed, which matches with the experiment results.

Traditional failure sample selection generally causes the omission of some failures during the selection and this phenomenon could lead to some fearful risks of usage because these failures will lead to serious propagation failures. This paper proposes a new failure sample selection method to solve the problem. First, the method uses a directed graph and ant colony optimization (ACO) to obtain a subsequent failure propagation set (SFPS) based on failure propagation model and then we propose a new failure sample selection method on the basis of the number of SFPS. Compared with traditional sampling plan, this method is able to improve the coverage of testing failure samples, increase the capacity of diagnosis, and decrease the risk of using.

First, nominal and faulty response waveforms of a circuit are measured, respectively, and then are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with the EEMD method. Second, through comparing the nominal IMFs with the faulty IMFs, kurtosis and relative entropy are calculated for each IMF. Next, a feature vector is obtained for each faulty circuit. Finally, an ELM classifier is trained with these feature vectors for fault diagnosis. Via validating with two benchmark circuits, results showthat the proposed method is applicable for analog fault diagnosis with acceptable levels of accuracy and time cost.

We prove that if 0 < lambda <= 2 then the number of forts does not increase under iteration and that if lambda > 2 then the number of forts is not bounded under iteration. Furthermore, we focus on the case of lambda > 2 and give for each k = 1,..., 7 some critical values of lambda for the change of numbers of forts.

The proposed I DII display is composed of a display panel, a barrier array and a parallax barrier. The barriers, which are located at the junction of adjacent elemental images on the display panel, are perpendicular to the display panel and the parallax barrier. It is different from the previous 1DII display using the barrier array that the aperture centers of the slits aren't aligned with the centers of the corresponding element images. Moreover, the most important difference is that the pitch of the slit is small than that of the elemental image. The widths of all viewing zones reconstructed by elemental images are identical at the optimal viewing distance. Thus, the viewing angle of the proposed 1DII display isn't affected by the number of the slits and the elemental images. A prototype of the proposed I DII display is developed, and good experimental results are obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the dispersion states and effect of MWNTs. FTIR results demonstrate that concentration of gallic acid has great effect on the surface modification of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. With the content of gallic acid increasing, modification effect were firstly increased and then decreased in that the optimal concentration is about 10 mu g/ml as it is its solubility in water. SEM and TEM results also show that gallic acid not only can ensure the integrity of the MW-CNTs, but also can purify it. These results confirmed achievement of a good dispersion state and effect of MW-CNTs with gallic acid. The dispersion mechanism of non-covalent surface modification and covalent surface modification was analyzed.

The cation distribution has been investigated by the Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, fracture microstructure by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and magnetic property by LCR and BeH analyzer, respectively. The results show that Ti4+ and Sn4+ ions prefer to occupy octahedron sublattices (B sites), which leads to an increase in lattice parameter. Sn4+ ions substituted MnZn ferrite has much denser and more uniform microstructure with smaller grains than that of Ti4+ ions substituted and unsubstituted MnZn ferrites. The Curie temperature (T-c) of Ti4+ and Sn4+ substituted MnZn ferrites is higher than that of unsubstituted sample. In addition, both Ti4+ and Sn4+ substitutions, due to the compensation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant, can move the secondary peak of mu(i) similar to T curve to low temperature. However, the opposite variation trend has been observed in a P-L similar to T curve. Also, the DC-bias superposition characteristics have been discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CuO contents affect the grain size and microstructure of NiZn ferrite obviously, which also result in the variation of saturation magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and porosity. Along with these relevant magnetic properties, the superposition of magnetizing mechanisms was testified to be predominant in determining the value of permeability. To manifest the increase of initial permeability, the permeability spectra of NiZn ferrite were resolved into two components, including domain wall movement and spin rotation magnetization. The fitting results show that, with the increasing amounts of CuO, the dominant contribution to dynamic magnetization changes from spin rotation magnetization mechanism to domain wall movement.

The phase, microstructure, hysteresis loop, and angular dependence of FM resonance (FMR) linewidth are investigated by X-ray diffractometer, field-emission scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, vibrating sample magnetometer, and electron spin resonance spectrometer, respectively. The Si/NiO(220) film has much smaller grain size than that of Si/NiO(200) film, which is beneficial to grow a high quality NiFe film on Si/NiO(220)/NiFe bilayer structures. The hysteresis loop of Si/NiO(220)/NiFe films shows an obvious exchange bias and a relatively smaller coercivity. The FMR linewidth (Delta H) of Si/NiO(220)/NiFe films is much smaller than that of Si/NiO(200)/NiFe films, which is caused by the different structural properties and morphologies of the NiO buffer layer. The Lande g factors and effective damping parameters alpha(eff) are also discussed.

The cation distribution has been investigated by the Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns, the microstructure has been observed using a scanning electron microscope, and the magnetic property has been measured using superconductor quantum interference devices and B-H analyzer. The results show that Zn2+ and Ni2+ ions prefer to occupy the tetrahedron site (A sublattice) and octahedron site (B sublattice), respectively. However, Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions can enter into A and B sublattices, where the ratio of Mn2+ ions occupying A and B sublattices is 4:1. The lattice parameter (a) of the samples decreases with the increase of Ni-substituted content. Meanwhile, based on the Neel model of collinear-spin ferrimagnetism, the molecular-field coefficients.AA,.BB, and.AB of the Ni-substituted MnZn ferrites have been calculated, and the magnetic moment of A and B sublattices versus temperature T has also been investigated. The fitting results match well with the experimental data. Both.AB and.BB increase with the increase of the Ni-substituted content, but.AA shows the opposite variation trend. The Curie temperature also increases with the increasing of the Ni-substituted content, which is attributed to the enhancement of superexchange interaction for A-B sublattice. In addition, the temperature dependence of initial permeability and core loss has been discussed.

The results manifest that Bi2O3 additives mainly concentrate on the grain boundary regions, while CuO additives could both enter into the grain and segregate at the grain boundary regions. The appropriate sintering temperature of barium hexaferrites with Bi2O3 and Bi2O3 + CuO additives reaches 1020 degrees C and 920 degrees C, respectively. As the amount of Bi2O3 is 3 wt%, the specimens of BaFe12O19 show saturation magnetization (Ms) of 346 kA/m, remanence (Mr) of 227 kA/m, and density (d) of 5.06 g/cm(3). Meanwhile, the combination of 3 wt% Bi2O3 and 3 wt% CuO additives significantly promotes grain growth and sintering densification, with a high saturation magnetization of 371 kA/m and density of 5.23 g/cm(3) for BaFe12O19, which are pretty close to the theoretical values (380 kA/m, 5.28 g/cm(3)). Moreover, the corresponding remanence could also rise by 10% compared with that in the sintered samples with 3 wt% Bi2O3.

The influence of Ta2O3-Co2O3 (TC) additives on the microstructure, static magnetic properties and core losses (P-CV) at high frequency of NiMgCuZn ferrites has been investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), LCR meter and B-H analyzer. The results revealed that the composite additives reduce the sintering density via inhibiting the grain growth. According to Zagg's report, the average grain sizes are smaller than 2.4 mu m for different TC contents, hence all the samples have single domain structures. In addition, the saturation induction and initial permeability of the samples reduce monotonously with the increase of TC contents. While the coercivity and cutoff frequency show an opposite trend. For the samples with different TC contents, the core losses at high frequency have been discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate and compare the biological responses of phosphorene and graphene. In this paper, with large scale molecular dynamics simulations, the villin headpiece (HP35) was used as a model protein to investigate the disruption of protein's structure (and function) caused by both phosphorene and graphene, for comparison of their biological responses. The results show that graphene's disruption to the structure of HP35 is more severe, indicating that phosphorene's interactions with HP35 are weaker as compared to graphene. Further analysis with two additional model materials, pseudo-phosphorene and pseudo-graphene, reveal that the puckered surface can have a significant effect in weakening the materials' ability to disrupt proteins. These findings might shed light on understanding/designing the protein-nanomaterial interactions and would be helpful for the bioapplications of the new nanomaterial, phosphorene.

The result manifests that all the compounds are crystallized in magnetoplumbite hexagonal structure. Trivalent cobalt ions prevailingly occupy the 2a, 4f(1), and 12k sites. According to Neel model of collinear-spin ferrimagnetism, the molecular-field coefficients omega(bf2), omega(kf1), omega(af1), omega(kf2), and omega(bk) of La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites have been calculated using the nonlinear fitting method, and the magnetic moment of five sublattices (2a, 2b, 4f(1), 4f(2), and 12k) versus temperature T has been also investigated. The fitting results are coincided well with the experimental data. Moreover, with the increase of La-Co substitution amount x, the molecular-field coefficients omega(bf2) and omega(af1) decrease constantly, while the molecular-field coefficients omega(kf1), omega(kf2), and omega(bk) show a slight change.

Tribological behavior of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/MWCNTs composite against Cu ring was evaluated using a special triboelectric tester with high tangential sliding velocity and electric current charges. The influences of electric current, normal force, sliding velocity on tribological behavior of the composite were investigated, and their interacting mechanism was analyzed. Orthogonality analysis was used to study the mutual influence by electric current, normal force and sliding velocity. The testing results were obtained through variance analysis and analysis of range. The morphologies of worn surfaces have been observed and analyzed by means of optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and stereomicroscope. Results demonstrated that during the progress of friction and wear with electric current, sliding velocity is the main factor affecting tribological performance in this experiment because sliding velocity affects wear characteristics of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/MWCNTs composite by changing the shear stress between the friction pair. Based on morphologies of worn surfaces of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/MWCNTs composites, it can be concluded that electric current affects tribological properties of Cu/Ti3SiC2/C/MWCNTs composite by influencing temperature of the surface material and surface lubricant film is enabling to form by MWCNTS. Friction and wear mechanism with electric current have been analyzed.

The coated samples were characterized by Optical Microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hardness tests. The oxidation behavior of unborosiliconized and borosiliconized pure nickel was studied with the kinetics curves of cyclic oxidation. The results show that boride (Ni2B) and silicide phases (Ni3Si, Ni5Si2 and Ni2Si) are formed on the surface of borosiliconized pure nickel, which are confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Depending on boronizing time and temperature, the thickness of coating layer ranges from 36 to 237 mu m. The hardness of the coating layer is much higher than that of pure nickel. Dry-sliding wear tests show that the wear resistance of borosiliconized pure nickel is greater than that of pure nickel. However, the oxidation test at 950 degrees C indicates that unborosiliconized sample possesses higher oxidation resistance than the borosiliconized sample.

The effects of Fe-deficiency content on magnetic properties and Brillouin function characteristics for NiCuZn ferrites have been investigated in details. With the increase of Fe-deficiency content, the opposite variation trend are observed for the saturation magntic induction B-s and the coercivity H-c. More importantly, based on the Neel molecular field theory, for the spinet ferrites which do not only contain Fe3+ but also some other multiple magnetic ions (Ni2+ and Cu2+), the molecular field coefficients omega(aa), omega(bb) and omega(ab) = omega(ba) are calculated by non-linear fitting method, and the Curie temperature T-c formula has been modified. With the increase of Fe-deficiency content, the values of omega(aa) and omega(bb) increase gradually, however, the value of omega(ab) = omega(ba) has a contrary trend which results in the decrease of the Curie temperature. In addition, the fitting Curie temperatures values are coincided well with the Curie temperatures calculated by the modified formula. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the dispersion states and effects of MWNTs and CNFs. FTIR results demonstrate that oxygen plasma has great effect on the surface modification of multi-walled carbon nanotubes while the oxygen plasma treatment does not have significant effect on modification of CNFs. The plasma treatment time has greater effect on the modification result and the optimal modification plan for treating CNFs with oxygen plasma can be explored by increasing the gradient of oxygen plasma treatment provided that oxygen plasma treatment power is moderate. SEM and TEM results also show that oxygen plasma not only can ensure the integrity of the MW-CNTs, but also can purify it. These results confirmed achievement of a good dispersion state and effect of MW-CNTs with oxygen plasma. Under the conditions of this experiment, oxygen plasma is not ideal for surface modification for CNFs. The dispersion mechanism of CNTs' and CNF's surface modification was analyzed.

Microstructure and creep properties of as-cast Mg-5LPC alloy	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Magnesium alloy; LPC rare earth; Microstructure; Compressive creep; Creep properties	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MAGNESIUM ALLOY; BEHAVIOR	The microstructure of as-cast Mg-5 lanthanum-praseodymium-cerium alloy was investigated by using a scanning electron microscopy and a transmission electron microscopy. The compressive creep curves of as-cast Mg-5 lanthanum-praseodymium-cerium alloy were tested under different temperatures and stresses, and high-temperature creep behaviour of as-cast Mg-5 lanthanum-praseodymium-cerium alloy was discussed. The results show that the microstructure of as-cast Mg-5 lanthanum-praseodymium-cerium alloy consists of alpha-Mg solid solution and beta-MgxLa phase. La enriches at grain boundary and forms MgxLa intermetallic compound by reacting with alpha-Mg. The working temperature of Mg-5 lanthanum-praseodymium-cerium alloy is determined from room temperature to 473 K under the compressive stress of 85.9-117.1 MPa. When creep temperature is 473 K and below, intermetallic compound which consists of Mg and La can prevent grain boundary sliding and improve the creep performance of as-cast Mg-5 lanthanum-praseodymium-cerium alloy.

This method focuses on extracting the entropy information contained in the probability density function (PDF) of the output of the circuit under test (CUT), which is sensitive to the parameters of circuits. Firstly, using the Lagrange multiplier method with R,nyi's entropy deduces PDF. Then the parameter alpha of R,nyi's entropy is estimated adaptively by employing the output of CUT through the maximum likelihood estimation method. Finally, the value of R,nyi's entropy can be calculated using the PDF and alpha parameter. The divergence between the R,nyi's entropy corresponding to the fault and fault free circuits is adopted to detect the fault. The method can detect soft fautls, including the single fault and multiple faults, without complicated models and mass of data, and also without interrupting the inherent connections. We conduct experiments respectively on two circuits that are implemented on an actual circuit board. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the result of the experiment.

This 3D display uses the MSL array to project the parallax images on a 2D display panel into different spatial directions. Each MSL can work as a conventional micro-lens. However, the MSL has a much shorter focal length than the conventional micro-lens. The shorter focal length is helpful for increasing the viewing angle. A prototype of the 3D display is developed. Experiment result shows that the proposed display has a large viewing angle and the crosstalk is also limited in a low level.

According to the tetrahedral A sites and the octahedral B sites of spinel structure model which do not only contain Fe3+ but also some other multiple magnetic ions (Ni2+ and Cu2+), molecular-field coefficients omega(aa), omega(bb), and omega(ab) = omega(ba) have been calculated; furthermore, the ferrimagnetism and paramagnetism Curie temperature T-c calculation formula has been modified, respectively. The magnetic moment versus temperature T (below the Curie temperature T-c) and the reciprocal of paramagnetism magnetic susceptibility 1/chi(m) versus temperature T (beyond the Curie temperature T-c) have been investigated, respectively. The values of the calculated ferrimagnetism Curie temperature are very close to the values of the testing Curie temperature, and with the same zinc content t, the values of paramagnetic Curie point are all bigger than that of ferrimagnetism Curie point. With regard to different zinc contents, the fitting results are coincided well with the experimental data. With the increasing of zinc content, omega(aa) increases constantly. However, omega(ab) = omega(ba) shows an opposite trend and omega(bb) is invariant. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

In this work, multiphased Al-Simatrix nanocomposites reinforced with Al2O3 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been sintered by an in situ vacuum hot-pressing method. The alumina Al2O3 nanoparticles were introduced by an in situ reaction of Al with SiO2. Microstructure and mechanical properties of the sintered Al/Si/Al2O /SiO2/MWCNTs nanocomposites with different alumina contents were investigated. The mechanical properties were determined by micro-Vickers hardness and compressive and shear strength tests. The results demonstrated that in situ alumina and MWCNTs had impacts on microstructure and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.

U(VI) sorption to illite strongly depended on pH values, ionic strength and temperature. At pH < 6.0, the presence of HA obviously improved U(VI) sorption on illite, because of the strong complexation between HA and U(VI) on illite surface. However, a slight inhibiting effect appeared at pH > 6.0. The thermodynamic parameters (Delta HA degrees, Delta SA degrees and Delta GA degrees) calculated from the temperature dependent sorption isotherms indicated that U(VI) sorption on illite was endothermic and spontaneous. Desorption investigation indicated that U(VI) sorption on illite was reversible in the absence of HA. However, in the presence of HA, U(VI) sorption on illite was irreversible due to the strong complexation between HA and U(VI). U(VI) sorption on illite was mainly dominated by ion-exchange and outer-sphere complexation. The results are very important for estimating the uptake and transfer of U(VI) in the natural environment.

The compositions of polarization beam splitters and half-wave plates with tilted functioning as NOT gates convert the entanglement modes between the polarization and spatial degree of freedom. The appropriate and available optical elements are applied, by which the protocol can be feasibly implemented without the influence resulting from arbitrary collective noise. Furthermore, the successful probability of the entangled state distribution equals to unity for unitary collective noise model.

This display consists of a 2D display panel and a parallax barrier. On the 2D display panel, subpixels have a special arrangement, so they can redefine the formation of color pixels. This subpixel arrangement can bring about triple horizontal resolution for a conventional 2D display panel. Therefore, when these pixels are modulated by the parallax barrier, the 3D images formed also have triple horizontal resolution. A prototype of this display is developed. Experimental results show that this display with triple horizontal resolution can produce a better display effect than the conventional one.

Fault-Tolerant Routing Algorithm Simulation and Hardware Verification of NoC	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY			English	Article						Network-on-Chip; XY routing algorithm; fault tolerant; ISE; router		Various software and hardware faults can destroy data transmission on the network, so it is essential to study fault-tolerant methods of Network-on-Chip (NoC). In this paper, a modified fault-tolerant routing algorithm is proposed based on the XY algorithm, which can achieve an efficient route way by resetting the route rule when error occurred on the path of chain or between the nodes. This performance shows that the fault tolerant bypassed the fault path of chain or the error nodes. A hardware design of the modified fault-tolerant routing algorithm is also introduced, aimed at the elaborating of hardware structure principle and simulating of fault tolerant routing algorithm of NoC based on FPGA. The proposed algorithm was simulated and verified on the platform of ISE Design Suite 13.3. The simulation results showed that the proposed modified algorithm is feasible. Because of the algorithm, the overall performance has improved obviously without using virtual channel, especially for the area and power consumption. At last, the proposed algorithm was verified on the FPGA platform of Nexys2 multiple sets of validate data proved that the proposed modified algorithm was reliable and feasible, and the quality of this NoC performed very well.

The proposed method organizes the discrete samples of response signals of the circuits under test (CUT) into a square matrix and calculates out the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of the square matrix. According to the one-to-one correspondence relationship between the matrix elements and fault cases, fault detection and fault location are achieved by using the maximal and minimal eigenvalues as fault signatures. Two experimental results show that the proposed method has better fault coverage, higher computational efficiency and needs fewer test points than the other state-of-the-art methods. Without the necessary of node-voltage equation or internal structure analysis, solely, depending on the analysis of the output response of CUT to achieve the fault diagnosis, the presented method is particularly suitable for the analog integrated circuit fault diagnosis, and can be extended to solve the fault diagnosis for superconductor digital circuits with finite accessible nodes.

A Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Based on Entanglement Swapping of Quasi-Bell Entangled Coherent States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Continuous variable quantum key distribution; Entanglement swapping; Quasi-Bell entangled coherent state	TELEPORTATION; CRYPTOGRAPHY; DECOHERENCE; DETECTORS; SUPERPOSITIONS; COMMUNICATION; GENERATION; THEOREM; SCHEME; PAIRS	A continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol with entanglement swapping of quasi-Bell entangled coherent states is proposed. As the preliminary step, a sender shares quasi-Bell entangled coherent states with a receiver. After their measurements to distinguish the cases of a zero response, a nonzero even-photon response and an odd-photon response, two legitimate participants fulfill the task of key distribution. The correlations resulting from entanglement swapping of quasi-Bell entangled coherent states and the order rearrangement of transmitted states provide the possibility to protect secret key distribution. In the ideal channel, the success probability increases with the amplitude of the coherent state, and approaches unity when the amplitude of the coherent state is larger than two. However, in the loss channel, the decoherence will introduce error in the generated key, and the error rate increases with the amplitude of the coherent state. When the amplitude of the coherent state is smaller than 0.2 (or so), the error rate approaches zero, although the success probability is less than 0.5 in this case.

Molecular dynamics simulation of interaction between deformation twin and annealing twin in iron crystal	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Molecular dynamics simulation; Dislocation emission; Crack propagation; Porous layer; Stress intensity	NANOCRYSTALLINE ALUMINUM; METALS	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is performed to study the interaction between deformation twin and annealing twin in iron crystal. Two samples are simulated in this paper. The annealing twin in each sample is considered pre-existing automatically and the deformation twin is formed in the process of mode-I type loading and emitted from the crack tip. The distances between the twin boundary of the annealing twin and the crack tip in two samples are different. The applied stress is imposed to the top and the bottom of each sample. When the stress intensity is K-I=0.94 MPa m(1/2), the partial dislocation is emitted from the crack tip of each sample, but the sample with larger annealing twin grain size will move a greater distance. As K-I is increased to 2 MPa m(1/2), the larger the annealing twin grain size is, the faster it will grow and the smaller the size of the deformation twin from the crack tip. That is to say, the size of the annealing twin will hinder the formation of the deformation twin and then affect the mechanical property of the material.

In this study, we employed a series of laboratory microcosm experiments to explore effects of temperature on growth and cell characteristics of 12 species. The research results indicted a wide range of responses of population demographic rates and physiology of phytoplankton cells to temperature. Chlorophyta could grow at a wide range of temperature from 15 to 35 degrees C, with the optimum temperature of 20 to 30 degrees C, mainly around 25 degrees C; whereas cyanobacteria had a higher tolerance to high temperature than chlorophyta, the optimum temperature for growth was between 30 and 35 degrees C. At the optimum temperature, most species (mainly large-sized green algae) generally showed grow rapidly with slightly high lipid and chlorophyll a contents in algal cell, whereas chlorophyll a content in algal cell was not completely determined by algal size and volume. In conclusion the study identifies key tradeoffs among functional traits to determine the suitability of diverse algal species as biofuel feedstock, further to provide scientific basis on screening successfully the potential candidate species for use in bio-oil production under temperature stress.

The influence of Ta2O5 additive on the microstructure, static magnetic properties and high frequency losses (P-cv) of NiCuZn ferrites were investigated. The results reveal that Ta2O5 can refine the grain of NiCuZn ferrites, and consequently reduce the sintering density. At the same time, the saturation induction and initial permeability of samples reduce monotonously with the increase of Ta2O5 content. The coercive force and resonance frequency, however, increase gradually. Furthermore, the high frequency losses (P-cv) firstly decrease and then increase, and the dominant factor of P-cv transforms from residual loss (P-r) to hysteresis loss (P-h), so the P-cv has a valley value when Ta2O5 content is 0.12wt%. The lowest P-cv is 139 mW/cm(3) at the conditions of 100 degrees C, 3 MHz and 10 mT, where P-h and P-r are 93 mW/cm(3) and 46 mW/cm(3), respectively.

For achieving the transmission target of the single-photon state, the first protocol needs to encode it to a nonmaximally entangled Bell state. Exploiting the interaction of the polarization entanglement with spatial entanglement between two photons, its success probability is 100 %. Different from the first protocol, the second one utilizes the idea of teleportation with an auxiliary Bell state. By performing quantum nondemolition measurement to analyze the parity, conventional measurement, and unitary transformation operations, the success probability of the second protocol is approximately unity. Furthermore, the second protocol can be generalized to the error-tolerance transmission of an arbitrary mixed state or the distribution of an arbitrary multi-photon entangled state.

The method is able to locate the faulty elements and evaluate their parameters. It employs the information contained in the frequency response function (FRF) measurements and focuses on finding models of the circuit under test (CUT) as exact as possible. Consequently, the method is capable of getting different sets of the parameters which are consistent with the diagnostic test, rather than only one specific set. To fulfil this purpose, the local plolynomial approach is applied and the associated normalized FRF is developed.The proposed method is especially suitable at the pre-production stage, where corrections of the technological design are important and the diagnostic time is not crucial. Two experimental examples are presented to clarify the proposed method and prove its efficiency.

The FMR linewidth had been separated to anisotropy and porosity line broadening contributions by an approximate calculation based on spin-wave approach. The results manifest that, Bi2O3 content significantly affects FMR linewidth via promoting grain growth and densification. With Bi2O3 concentration increasing, anisotropy contribution is changeless with a constant about 80 Oe. The variation of the porosity line broadening contribution, however, is unanimous with the FMR linewidth. Meanwhile, the mechanism of dielectric polarization and dielectric loss of the samples were discussed. When the amount of Bi2O3 is 1.00 wt%, the sample shows low FMR linewidth (Delta H, 133 Oe) and low dielectric loss tangent (tan delta(epsilon), 5 x 10(-4)) at 9.2 GHz, high saturation magnetization (M-s, 415 kA/m), and high squareness ratio (B-r/B-s, 0.87).

The results show that grain size of 8 mu m samples becomes finer and more equiaxial after high temperature compression deformation under the action of AC current, equiaxial alpha phase increases and flake beta phase decreases. In addition, the distribution of equiaxial alpha phase and flake beta phase becomes narrow. Both low current and high current heated TC4 titanium alloys of 20 mu m have honeycomb structures, and honeycomb structures of low current heated TC4 titanium alloy is more pronounced. With the same grain site of TC4 titanium alloy, the higher the current, the finer the microstructure, and the more equiaxial.

This display consists of a 2D display panel and a parallax barrier. The basic element of the parallax barrier has three narrow slits. They can show three columns of subpixels on the 2D display panel and form 3D pixels. The parallax barrier can provide multiview zones. In these multiview zones, the proposed 3D display can use a small number of views to achieve a high density of views. Therefore, the distance between views is the same as the conventional ones with more views. Considering the proposed display has fewer views, which bring more 3D pixels in the 3D images, the resolution and brightness will be higher than the conventional ones. A 12-view prototype of the proposed 3D display is developed, and it provides the same density of views as a conventional one with 28 views. Experimental results show the proposed display has higher resolution and brightness than the conventional one. The cross talk is also limited at a low level.

The characteristic results of three kinds of HMCMs indicated that various process parameters containing feeding gas and initial agglomerate size in this study can result in the change of surface organization, composition, morphology, and dimension. Investigation of microwave electromagnetic (EM) characteristics of three kinds of HMCMs showed that intrinsic characteristics play an important role in the determining the resulting properties. At 10-14.5 GHz, No. 3 HMCMs possess weak absorption intensity and narrow effective bandwidth (<-10 dB) owing to smaller dimension, but in higher-frequency band (14.5-17 GHz), an obvious absorption peak appears due to good EM match and nano-effects. Compared with No. 1 (O-2 coarse) and No. 3 (O-2 fine) HMCMs, enhanced absorption intensity and effective bandwidth (<-10 dB) were observed in No. 2 (N-2 coarse) HMCMs. Enhancements of absorption intensity and effective bandwidth are associated with extra nitride (AlN, FeN), partial open microspheres, M-hexagonal crystal and micro-nano thick dendrite. No. 2 HMCMs presented excellent microwave-absorption property, with the minimum reflectivity (R (L)) of -27.7 dB at 12.9 GHz. The effective bandwidth (<-10 dB) could reach to 4.1 GHz (10.9-15 GHz). This may be ascribed to the increased conductance loss, multiple scattering, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and shape anisotropy.

EEG signals are generally unstable, complex and have low signal-noise ratio, which is difficult to be analyzed and processed. To solve this problem, this paper disassembles EEG signals with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm, extracts the characteristic values of the major intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and then classifies them with fuzzy C-means (FCM) method. Also, comparison research is done between the proposed method and several current EEG classification methods. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy based on the EEG signals of the second BCI competition in 2003 is up to 78%, which is superior to those of the comparative EEG classification methods.

Selecting methyl orange (MO) as an organic pollutant model, the hierarchical GOs/Fe3O4/PANI magnetic composites showed high adsorption capacity toward MO (585.02 mg g(-1)), which was superior to that of other adsorbents. The nitrogen-containing functional groups of PANI decorated on GOs/ Fe3O4/PANI provided numerous effective adsorption sites and thus increased the adsorption capacity for MO. Moreover, PANI protected the Fe3O4 nanoparticles from dissolution, and therefore improved the stability of GOs/Fe3O4/PANI in solution. The results show that the GOs/Fe3O4/PANI magnetic composites are promising magnetic nanomaterials for the preconcentration and separation of ionic dye pollutants from aqueous solutions for environmental pollution cleanup.

However, the conventional parallax barrier 3D display has a disadvantage of low brightness. Therefore, a parallax barrier 3D display based on shared pixels is proposed. The shared pixels have adapted pixel values which limit crosstalk in a low level, so that they can be displayed simultaneously in both two parallax images. These pixels increase aperture ratio of the parallax barrier. Therefore, they can bring high brightness. A prototype of the proposed 3D display is developed and it has higher brightness than those based on the conventional one. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that the adsorption of Sr(II) on Na-rectorite was strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength. The presence of HA enhanced the adsorption of Sr(II) on Na-rectorite at low pH, whereas suppressed Sr(II) adsorption on Na-rectorite at high pH. The Langmuir model simulated the adsorption isotherms of Sr(II) better than the Freundlich model at three different temperatures of 293, 313 and 333 K. The thermodynamic parameters (Delta H-0, Delta S-0 and Delta G(0)) calculated from the temperature dependent adsorption isotherms indicated that the adsorption process of Sr(II) on Na-rectorite was spontaneous and endothermic. The adsorption of Sr(II) was dominated by outer-sphere surface complexation and ion exchange at low pH, whereas inner-sphere surface complexation was the main adsorption mechanism at high pH. The results indicate that Na-rectorite may be a promising candidate for the treatment of radionuclides from large volume solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The surface modified samples were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction, microhardness tester and ring-on-block wear tester. Samples boronized had Co2B phase or Co2B plus Co2Si phases depending on the process temperatures. The depth of modified layer ranged from 40 to 186 mu m, depending on treatment temperature and time. The hardness of boride layer is much higher than that of silicide layer and substrate, and the wear resistance of the boride layer is more excellent than that of the silicide layer.

Therefore, a multi-view 3D display with high brightness based on a parallax barrier is proposed. The parallax barrier in the 3D display has a gradient transmittance with enhanced frequency characteristic, which indicates that the aperture ratio of the parallax barrier can be increased, thereby improving brightness. Gradient transmittance is also helpful in reducing crosstalk. A prototype of the 3D display is developed. Experimental result shows that the 3D display has higher brightness than a conventional display. In addition, crosstalk is limited at a low level.

Employing weak cross-Kerr nonlinear interactions and Homodyne measurement, two individual photons entangle together based on the bus function of coherent states. Assisted by optical elements mainly including polarization beam splitters, the entanglement of the signal photons is converted from the spatial mode to the polarization mode. The application of classical feed forward provides the high-efficiency to the preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and four-photon cluster-type polarization-entangled states. With regard to the four-photon cluster-type state, it can be generated in two distributed nodes with less experimental requirements, integrating the features of three logical gates.

When the variable parallax barrier changes its aperture width, the viewing angle and the optical efficiency of the proposed 1-DII display are compared. The viewing angle is increased by decreasing the aperture width of the variable parallax barrier, while the optical efficiency is increased by increasing the aperture width of the variable parallax barrier.

B2O3 addition could reduce the sintering temperature of Li2ZnTi3O8 ceramics from 1,150 to 900 A degrees C, which is attributed to the formation of liquid phases during the sintering process observed by SEM. The 1.5 wt% B2O3 doped Li2ZnTi3O8 ceramics sintered at 900 A degrees C have epsilon (r) = 23.3, Q x f = 48,817 GHz, and resonant frequency tau (f) = -15.35 x 10(-6)/A degrees C. Further, due to the compensating effect of rutile TiO2 (tau(f) = 450 ppm/A degrees C), the temperature coefficient of tau(f) for with TiO2 was adjusted to near zero value. The 1.5 wt% B2O3 doped Li2ZnTi3O8 ceramics with 3 wt% TiO2 dielectrics sintered at 900 A degrees C exhibited the optimal microwave properties: epsilon(r) = 25.9, Q x f = 46,487 GHz, and tau(f) = -0.35 ppm/A degrees C.

However, the vertical and horizontal resolution of the 3D images displayed on it will be seriously nonuniform as this display has a large number of views. It will worsen the display quality; therefore, a 3D display that consists of a 2D display panel and dual parallax barriers is proposed. With a 2D display panel, the proposed 3D display provides the synthetic images with square pixel units in which the arrangement of pixels can make the 3D image have uniform resolution. With the dual parallax barriers, the proposed 3D display shows the pixels in square pixel units for different horizontal views. Therefore, this display has uniform resolution of 3D images. A four-view prototype of the proposed 3D display is developed, and it provides uniform 3D resolution in the vertical and horizontal directions.

In the cases of x >= 8, Fe3Si phase with D03-type structure was observed, and the powders became amorphous completely. A crystallization temperature of 685 K was found for x = 8. Coercivity force and saturation magnetization of the powders decreased with the increasing of Cr content. As an electromagnetic wave absorbing material, the minimum reflectivity was - 15.5 dB at 8.5 GHz and the absorption band was broad for x = 8 powders. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The gradient-aperture pinhole array is symmetrical in both horizontal and vertical directions. The leftmost and rightmost pinholes are used to fix the horizontal viewing angle, and the uppermost and nethermost pinholes are used to fix the vertical viewing angle. To increase the optical efficiency, the aperture widths of other pinholes are gradually increased from both sides to the middle in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. A prototype of the proposed II display is developed. Its horizontal viewing angle is equal to that of the conventional one, while its optical efficiency is higher than that of the conventional one.

Tunable triple-band negative permeability metamaterial consisting of single-loop resonators and ferrite	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							CHIRAL METAMATERIAL; ABSORBER; REFRACTION; INDEX; ANGLE; CLOAK	We numerically propose a novel tunable metamaterial with triple bands of negative permeabilities. This metamaterial is composed of an array of single-loop resonators (SLRs) and ferrite slabs, where the SLRs provide two magnetic resonances while the ferrite slabs under an applied dc magnetic bias give rise to the third magnetic resonance. By adjusting the intensity of the dc magnetic bias, it is able to tune all the three magnetic resonances. The -negative features of these resonant bands are investigated by retrieving the constitutive parameters from simulated -parameters. The results in this paper open a new approach for designing tunable multiband metamaterials, which is sure to find extensive applications in fields such as tunable multiband notched ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas, tunable multiband perfect lens, and tunable multiband absorbers.

A 1DII based on a parallax barrier is proposed in this paper. The 1DII consists of a parallax barrier and a display panel. The operation principle and parameter calculation of the 1DII are described in detail. Two prototypes of the proposed 1DII and conventional 1DII based on a lenticular lens array are developed.

J	Mu, D; Shen, BL				Mu, Dong; Shen, Bao-luo			The Kinetics and Dry-Sliding Wear Properties of Boronized Gray Cast Iron	ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURE; DIFFUSION; STEEL	Some properties of boride formed on gray cast iron (GCI) have been investigated. GCI was boronized by powder-pack method using Commercial LSB-II powders at 1123, 1173, and 1223 K for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy showed that boride formed on the surface of boronized GCI had tooth-shaped morphology. The hardness of boride formed on surfaces of GCI ranged from 1619 to 1343 HV0.025, and quenched and tempered GCI ranged from 400 to 610 HV0.025. The boride formed in the coating layer confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis was Fe2B single phase. Depending on boronizing time and temperature, the thickness of coating layers on boronized GCI ranged from 26 to 105 mu m. The activation energy was 209 kJ/mol for boronized GCI. Moreover, the possibility of predicting the iso-thickness of boride layers variation was studied. Dry-sliding wear tests showed that the wear resistance of boronized sample was greater than that of quenched and tempered sample.

The results showed that appropriate concentration range of REE could promote Spirodela polyrhiza absorbing N, P effectively, improve the carbonic anhydrase activity (a maximum value of 0.684 EU/mu g) and improve the efficiency of light energy utilization and transformation which made photosynthesis improved and thus it could promote plant growth, with the highest rate of growth of Spirodela polyrhiza reaching 63.85% and maximum value of chlorophyll up to 9.594 mg/L and further, with the increase of Spirodela polyrhiza breeding density, dissolved oxygen (DO) reduced but chemical oxygen demand (COD) raised (a maximum value of 6.448 mg/L) in water, which eventually led to the water quality worsen. The research results demonstrate that the suitable contents of REE can promote small aquatic plants such as Spirodela polyrhiza growing, thereby contributing a positive catalytic effect to the development process of eutrophication. This no doubt provides basic theory for sustainable development and utilization of rare earth and provides a scientific basis for the study of rare earth influencing on the promoting regularity of water eutrophication and integrated control of water pollution.

J	He, M; Zhang, HW; Wan, J; Su, H				He, Ming; Zhang, Huaiwu; Wan, Jing; Su, Hua			Calculation on the permittivity of the wollastonite ceramic matrix	SOLID STATE SCIENCES			English	Article						Ceramic matrix; Permittivity; Additivity; Glasses	SYSTEM GLASS-CERAMICS; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; POLARIZABILITIES; DENSIFICATION; MINERALS	Wollastonite ceramic matrix composites are multi-materials including the crystalline wollastonite and the residual glass phases. The relative permittivity (simplified as permittivity) of the crystalline wollastonite is used to evaluate the dielectric properties of the wollastonite ceramic matrix. Usually, the permittivity of the crystalline wollastonite is estimated to be 8.6, however, the residual glasses in wollastonite ceramic matrix are often unknown. In this study, the Clausius-Mosotti model is utilized to calculate the permittivity of the crystalline wollastonite from molecular polarizability. Molecular polarizabilities as the crystalline wollastonite polarizability are calculated by the ionic and oxide additivity rules. The permittivity of prepared glasses is used instead of that of the remaining glasses and estimated to 4.65. The composite permittivity of the wollastonite ceramic matrix is calculated by Lichnetecker logarithm rules. Compared with measurements, the calculated permittivity of wollastonite ceramic matrix corresponds well with measurements. The application of this simple calculation technique allows the assessment of the relative permittivity for ceramic matrix. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
