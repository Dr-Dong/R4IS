Semilattices of hesitant fuzzy sets with union and intersection are discussed, respectively. By using circle plus and circle times operators, the commutative monoid of hesitant fuzzy sets is provided, moreover, the lattice and distributive lattice of hesitant fuzzy sets are defined on the equivalence class of hesitant fuzzy sets. Based on the distributive lattice of hesitant fuzzy sets, the residuated lattices of hesitant fuzzy sets are constructed by residual implications, which are induced by intersection and circle times, respectively. From the theoretical point of view, algebraic structures of hesitant fuzzy sets are useful for approximate reasoning and decision making to deal with hesitancy of information.

We show that the deformed hyperbolic Kratzer-like potential model is equivalent to the Tietz potential model for diatomic molecules.

The approach is based on maximizing the image sharpness function that induces the solution to maximum-posterior estimation. In this letter, closed-form expressions are derived for the gradients of the sharpness function with respect to the coefficients of the polynomial expansion, which makes the use of conjugate gradient algorithm available. Additionally, we also design a modified adaptive-order searching strategy, and it helps to remarkably reduce the computational load while maintaining the accuracy. Real airborne SAR data experiments and comparisons demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Further studies on linear, nonlinear optics and electrochemical properties demonstrated their photophysical features respectively. Compound LT1 shows good two-photon absorption cross-section (6) up to similar to 1200 GM at 810 nm in tetrahydrofuran, which is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer effect, as supported by density functional theory theoretical calculations. Compound L12 and LT3 show considerable molar extinction coefficients, which are more than 10(5), and higher quantum yields. Structure function relationship is further discussed, suggesting a rational strategy to develop ladder-conjugated small molecules. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Bel-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells with high expression of VEGF and VEGFR were screened. Bel-7402 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were treated with FG for 48 h. CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Wound healing assay was used to investigate effect of FG on the migration of HMECs. Tube formation assay was done to test influence of FG on the angiogenesis of HMECs, and qRT-PCR and western blot assay were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, Fit-1 and KDR. Nude mice were inoculated with Bel-7402 cells, and influence of FG on tumor growth, microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF expression in tumor was investigated. Results: Bel-7402 cells had a significantly higher expression of VEGF and VEGFR when compared with HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells. FG could markedly reduce the mRNA and protein expressions of VEGF, Fit-1 and KDR in Bel-7402 cells and inhibit the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, FG was able to remarkably inhibit the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of HMECs, exerting anti-angiogenetic effect. In cancer-bearing nude mice, FG was found to inhibit the tumor growth, reduce MVD in tumors and decrease the VEGF in tumors. Conclusions: FG can inhibit proliferation of liver cancer cells and suppression angiogenesis in liver cancer in a VEGF/VEGFR dependent manner.

Generally, weights for experts or criteria are considered in linguistic aggregation processes. In this paper, we provide a method to discovery new forms to compute weights and new interpretations in the linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator. In linguistic decision analysis, it can be noticed that some of initial linguistic values used by experts have priority over others linguistic values in evaluation processes. We formalize the priority over initial linguistic values as weights for linguistic values, by considering weights for linguistic values as well as weights for experts, we provide an alternative method to discovery weights information of the linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator, its properties show that such linguistic aggregation operator is extensions of the 2-tuple arithmetic mean, the 2-tuple weighted aggregation operator and the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging operator. By an illustrative example, we compare the linguistic aggregation operator with the 2-tuple weighted aggregation operator and the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging operator in a decision making problem. From the practical point of view, we provide an optimization model to obtain such weights information in linguistic aggregation processes, examples show the linguistic aggregation operator as an alternative linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator in practice.

Some texture-based methods such as directional energy method and wavelet method are available nowadays. However, directional energy method is insufficient to capture the detail information of fingerprint and it is also improper to directly use wavelet method to extract the feature since the complex and rich edge information of fingerprint. In this work we propose a texture-based method called DFB-Wavelet for fingerprint recognition via combining directional filter banks (DFB) and wavelet. The region of interest (ROI) composed of nonoverlapping square blocks, is decomposed into eight directions by employing DFB. Wavelet signatures are calculated as the features of a fingerprint image from each directional subband of DFB. The feature matching is performed on the global normalized Euclidean distance between the input fingerprint features and the templates features. Experimental results show that DFB-Wavelet method has the higher accuracy compared to the traditional texture-based methods.

The bound state energy eigenvalues and the unnormalized radial wave functions are approximately obtained in a closed form by using the supersymmetric shape invariance approach and the function analysis method. The numerical experiments show that our analytical results are in better agreement with those obtained by using the numerical integration approach than the analytical results obtained by using the conventional approximation scheme to deal with the centrifugal term.

J	Li, KJ; Chen, WB				Li, Kejian; Chen, Wenbin			A new convenient way to synthesize 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl urea derivatives under microwave irradiation	HETEROATOM CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ESTERS; ACIDS	A simple and efficient method was developed for the synthesis of 1-(substituted)-3-(5(substituted)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ureas from. heterocyclic amino compounds and phenyl-5-(pyridine-3- yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylcarbamate(2) or phenyl-5-(trifluoro-methyl)- 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylcarbamate(5) under solvent conditions using microwave irradiation. The products were obtained in satisfactory yield as we expected. The reactions can be realized by conventional heating, but we find that the condition of microwave is better according to the reaction time. New I - (substituted)-3- (5-(Substituted)- 1, 3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) urea derivatives are reported. The products were characterized by (1)H NMR, ESI-MS, and Elemental analysis. The crystal structure of compound 6h was determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
