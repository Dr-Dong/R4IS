There is a controversy that whether the IGFBP-3 level is associated with the clinical pathological characteristics and overall survival of esophageal cancer patients. Herein, we aimed to comprehensively assess the association between the low IGFBP-3 level and the risk, overall survival and clinical pathological characteristics of esophageal cancer. Method: We conducted a meta-analysis using seven eligible studies. The overall odds ratios (OR)/relative risk (RR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each parameter. Results: For the risk of esophageal cancer, the OR was 2.342 (p = 0.000), indicating that individuals with lower IGFBP-3 level were more likely to suffer from esophageal cancer, compared to those with relatively high IGFBP-3 level. With respect to the 3-year survival rate, the RR was 2.163 (p = 0.027), which demonstrated that esophageal cancer patients with low IGFBP-3 level had significantly lower 3-year survival rate; in terms of clinical pathological characteristics, significantly lower IGFBP-3 level was found for patients in all categories; for survival status, patients in low IGFBP-3 level are more likely to be in the dead survival status (OR = 4.480, p = 0.000). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that for esophageal cancer, the low IGFBP-3 level is associated with high cancer risk, poor prognosis, and unfavorable tumor stage and metastasis.

Materials and methods: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the experimental group (40 g, n = 30) and the sham group (0 g, n = 30). Closed coil springs were ligated between maxillary incisor and molars to achieve experimental tooth movement. Rat grimace scale (RGS) scores were assessed at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after the placement of the springs. ASIC3 immunostaining was performed and the expression levels of ASIC3 were measured through integrated optical density/area in Image-Pro Plus 6.0. Moreover, 18 rats were divided into APETx2 group (n = 6), amiloride group (n = 6), and vehicle group (n = 6), and RGS scores were obtained compared among them to verify the roles of ASIC3 in orofacial pain following tooth movement. Results: ASIC3 expression levels became significantly higher in the experimental group than in sham group on 1, 3, and 5 days and became similar on 7 and 14 days. Pain levels (RGS scores) increased in both groups and were significantly higher in the experimental group on 1, 3, 5, and 7 days and were similar on 14 days. Periodontal ASIC3 expression levels were correlated with orofacial pain levels following experimental tooth movement. Periodontal administrations of ASIC3 antagonists (APETx2 and amiloride) could alleviate pain. Limitation: This study needs to be better evidenced by RNA interference of ASIC3 in periodontal tissues in rats following experimental tooth movement. Moreover, we hope further studies would concentrate on the pain perception of ASIC3 knockout (ASIC3(-/-)) mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that periodontal ASIC3 plays an important role in orofacial pain induced by experimental tooth movement.

FAT tumor suppressor homolog 4 (FAT4), a cadherin-related protein, is involved in a variety of biological processes as a tumor suppressor; however, the role of FAT4 in TNBC is still unclear. The aim of our study was to identify the role of FAT4 in TNBC and examine the underlying molecular mechanisms. The expression of FAT4 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR in a series of TNBC tissues. The effects of FAT4 on the ability of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed by MTT assay and migration and invasion assays. We demonstrated that the repression of FAT4 by shRNA could promote TNBC progres-sion. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for a role of the FAT4 cluster as a tumor suppressor in TNBC patients and may serve as potential novel targets for the treatment of TNBC.

Sichuan is a province in the west of China with a population of 81.4 million. This is the first statistical report of central nervous system (CNS) tumors surgically treated and histologically diagnosed in a large Chinese population. Methods. All the patient data were obtained from 86 medical facilities, which covered the Sichuan province population. Data from patients who underwent surgery between 2008 and 2013 and corresponding histology samples were re-reviewed in the major pathology centers. All the CNS tumors were categorized according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 and ICD-O-3 classifications and reviewed manually. The tumor distribution was analyzed and stratified by gender, age, race, and tumor sites. Tumors in some ethnic minorities, such as the Tibetan people, also were analyzed. Results. The final analytic dataset included 35,496 records. The top four histologic tumors were meningioma (28.51 %), pituitary adenoma (15.00 %), nerve sheath (13.77 %), and glioblastoma (11.82 %). There was a dramatically high incidence of malignant tumor in males. The median age at diagnosis ranged from 13 years (pineal region tumors) to 56 years (metastatic brain tumors). Most of the tumors in the insular lobe or cerebellum were low grade, whereas those in the thalamus or basal ganglia were likely to be high grade. The incidence of malignant tumors or high-grade gliomas in the Tibetans was significantly lower than in the Chinese Han population. Conclusion. This report is a preliminary statistical analysis of brain and spinal tumors in a large Chinese population and may serve as a useful resource for clinicians, researchers, and patients' families.

To evaluate the anti-tumor and radical-scavenging activities of X. sorbifolia husks polyphenols and determine their structure-activity relationships, 37 polyphenols 1-37 were obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation. Two new compounds 1-2, and compounds 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14-17, 21-25, 27-29, 31, 33, 34, 36, and 37 were isolated from the genus Xanthoceras for the first time. Compounds 1-37 did not show strong cytotoxicity against the four tested tumor cell lines (A549, HepG2, MGC-803, and MFC) compared to paclitaxel and under the conditions tested in the anti-tumor assay, but compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 18-20, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32, and 35 exhibited stronger radical-scavenging activity than ascorbic acid in a 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt assay. This was the first report on the anti-tumor and radical-scavenging activities of the polyphenols isolated from X. sorbifolia husks. Overall, the present study contributed valuable information concerning X. sorbifolia husks use in medicine and pharmacology.

Methods: The expression of TUG1 in breast cancer tissues and cells was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability was examined using a 3-(4,5-dimethy1-2-thiazolyI)-2,5-dipheny1-2-Htetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. A dual luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the relationship between TUG1 and miR-9. The expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) was measured by western blot. Results: Higher expression of TUG1 was observed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines than in the corresponding controls. TUG1 knockdown reduced proliferation, suppressed cell cycle progression, and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that TUG1 could negatively regulate the expression of miR-9. MiR-9 inhibition abrogated the effect of TUG1 knockdown on the proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. TUG1 positively regulated the expression of MTHFD2 in breast cancer cells. Conclusion: TUG1 knockdown was significantly associated with decreased cell proliferation and it promoted apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the regulation of miR-9.

Methods: This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42013003200). A systematic literature search of 8 core electronic databases and 3 clinical trial registries in Chinese and English, yielded 10 trials whose randomness verified by contacting the authors. The included trials were assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Wenxin Keli might be more efficacious than placebo (Change of VPBs numbers, RR, 1.61, 95%CI, 1.48-1.76, P < 0.00001, I-2 = 0%;VPBs-related symptom, RR, 2.10, 95%CI, 1.91-2.30, P < 0.00001, 12 = 0%), and the dual therapy of Wenxin Keli plus amiodarone might also be more effective than the monotherapy of amiodarone (Change of VPBs numbers, RR, 1.23, 95%CI, 1.10-1.39, P = 0.0005, 12 = 0%; VPBs-related symptom, RR, 1.51., 95%CI, 1.30-1.76, P<0.00001, I-2 = 0%), whereas Wenxin Keli might be comparable to metoprolol, propafenone or mexiletine (Change of VPBs numbers: metoprolol, RR, 1.01, 95%CI, 0.91-1.11, P=0.88, I-2 = 0%; propafenone, RR, 1.05, 95%CI, 0.93-1.19, P = 0.44, I-2 = 0%; mexiletine, RR, 1.06, 95%CI, 0.96-1.17, P = 0.28. VPBs- related symptom: metoprolol, RR, 0.95, 95%CI, 0.87-1.04, P = 0.27,12 = 0%, propafenone. RR, 1.10, 95%CI, 0.93-1.30, P = 0.29,I-2 = 29%, mexiletine,RR, 0.94, 95%CI, 0.78-1.12, P = 0.47). Participants with ventricular premature beats' numbers < 360 beats/h or with coronary heart disease benefited the most of the Wenxin Keli therapy (Change of VPBs numbers:RR, 1.10, 95%CI, 1.02-1.20, P = 0.02, I-2=44%; RR, 1.71, 95%CI, 1.18-2.49, P=0.005, I-2 = 54%, respectively). The safety analysis revealed that Wenxin Keli did not statistically significant differed from the Western medicine in respect of the incidence of total adverse drug reactions (RR, 0.59, 95%CI, 0.35-1.01, P=0.05, I-2 = 0%), but Wenxin Keli might be associated with a reduced risk of proarrhythmic reactions (P=0.007). The quality of the methodology of included trials was generally low. Several limitations existed that affected the validity of the findings, including the small sample size, insufficient randomization methods, poorly defined eligibility criteria, short duration of follow-up, absence of hard endpoints, and high risk of publication bias(P = 0.013). Conclusions: Wenxin Keli might be a promising alternative and complementary medicine for ventricular premature beats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the impact of BADGE on a new and more clinically relevant physiological model, the ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. Forty female Wistar rats were divided into four treatment groups for 12 wk (n =10/group): sham + vehicle, sham + BADGE, OVX + vehicle, and OVX + BADGE. Postmortem analyses included MRI, micro-CT, serological test, histomorphometry, biomechanical tests, RT-PCR, and Western blot. Overall, OVX induced a sequential marrow fat expansion accompanied by bone deterioration. Compared with OVX controls, BADGE reduced fat fraction of the distal femur by 36.3%, adipocyte density by 33.0%, adipocyte size by 28.6%, adipocyte volume percentage by 57.8%, and adipogenic markers PPAR gamma 2 and C/EBP alpha by similar to 50% in OVX rats. Similar results were observed in sham rats vs. vehicle. BADGE could promote bone quality in sham rats; however, BADGE did not significantly improve trabecular microarchitecture, biomechanical strength, and dynamic histomorphometric parameters except for trabecular separation in OVX rats. We concluded that early BADGE treatment at a dose of 30 mg/kg attenuates marrow adiposity in ovary-intact and OVX rats and stimulates bone formation in ovary-intact rats but does not significantly rescue bone quality in OVX rats.

The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of preexisting diabetes on the prognosis in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse-free period (RFP) in women with breast cancer. Methods: We searched the Embase and PubMed databases until June 2016 for cohort or case-control studies assessing the impact of diabetes on the prognosis of women with breast cancer. The pooled multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS, DFS, and RFP were used to analyze the impact of diabetes on the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Results: Seventeen studies involving 48,315 women with breast cancer met our predefined inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the pooled adjusted HR was 1.51 (95% CI 1.34-1.70) for OS and 1.28 (95% CI 1.09-1.50) for DFS in breast cancer patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. However, RFP did not differ significantly between patients with and without diabetes (HR 1.42; 95% CI 0.90-2.23). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis suggests that preexisting diabetes is independently associated with poor OS and DFS in female breast cancer patients. However, the impact of diabetes on RFP should be further verified. More prospective studies are warranted to investigate whether appropriate glycemic control with modification of antihyperglycemic agents can improve the prognosis of female breast cancer patients with diabetes.

Effective MUC4 gene knockdown in PC may contribute to the elucidation of pancreatic tumor development and metastasis, and may be valuable in new therapeutic approaches. Thus to confirm this, in the present study, the BxPC-3 cell line was transfected with eight pairs of shRNA lentiviral vectors for MUC4. The qPCR results showed that expression of MUC4 mRNA in the BxPC-3 cells was significantly decreased at 96 h after transfection. One of these shRNA lentiviral vectors (shRNA-A141) had showed the strongest suppressive effect on MUC4 mRNA expression and was used for MUC4 knockdown in BxPC-3 cells. After stable transfection, BxPC-3 cells showed a significantly lower expression of MUC4 mRNA and MUC4 protein, and were suppressed on cell growth and migration. In vivo, lower tumor growth rates and tumor volume were observed in the tumors derived from the MUC4-knockdown cells, whereas the transplanted tumors derived from the control group cells, grew rapidly. Thus, inhibition of MUC4 expression may be an effective means for mitigating metastasis and invasion of PC.

Semi-quantitative assessment of the presence and Child-Pugh class of hepatitis B related cirrhosis by using liver lobe-based dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							FIBROSIS; RATIO; STAGE; SIZE	AIM: To determine whether liver lobe-based DCE-MRI can be used to detect the presence and Child-Pugh class of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B and 20 healthy participants underwent liver DCE-MRI, and the positive enhancement integral (PEI), time to peak (TTP), maximum slope of increase (MSI) and maximum slope of decrease (MSD) of the left lateral liver lobe (LLL), left medial liver lobe (LML), right liver lobe (RL), and caudate lobe (CL) were measured and analysed statistically to evaluate cirrhosis. RESULTS: TTP values of the LLL, LML, RL and CL were positively correlated with the Child-Pugh class of cirrhosis (r=0.452 to 0.55, all p<0.05). PEI values of the LLL, LML, RL and CL, as well as the MSI of the CL and the MSD of the RL, were inversely correlated with the Child-Pugh class (r= -0.349 to -0.72, all p<0.05). PEI values of the LLL and CL, or TTP values of the RL had the most area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 for identifying the presence of liver cirrhosis. The PEI of the RL had the largest AUC of 0.975 and 0.78 for distinguishing the Child-Pugh class A of cirrhosis from class B-C and class A-B of cirrhosis from class C, respectively. CONCLUSION: Liver lobe-based DCE-MRI parameters are associated with the presence and Child-Pugh class of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. (C) 2016 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Triptolide (TP) can elevate the expression of Foxp3, but its effects on cardiac hypertrophy remain unclear. In the present study, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) were isolated and stimulated with angiotensin II (1 mu mol/L) to induce hypertrophic response. The expression of Foxp3 in NRVM was observed by using immunofluorescence assay. Fifty mice were randomly divided into five groups and received vehicle (control), isoproterenol (Iso 5 mg/kg, s.c.), one of three doses of TP (10, 30, or 90 mu g/kg, i.p.) for 14 days, respectively. The pathological morphology changes were observed after Hematoxylin and eosin, lectin and Masson's trichrome staining. The levels of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence, respectively. The mRNA and protein expressions of alpha- myosin heavy chain (MHC), beta-MHC and Foxp3 were determined using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. It was shown that TP (1, 3, 10 mu g/L) treatment significantly decreased cell size, mRNA and protein expression of beta-MHC, and upregulated Foxp3 expression in NRVM. TP also decreased heart weight index, left ventricular weight index and, improved myocardial injury and fibrosis; and decreased the cross-scetional area of the myocardium, serum cardiac troponin and BNP. Additionally, TP markedly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of myocardial beta-MHC and elevated the mRNA and protein expression of alpha-MHC and Foxp3 in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, TP can effectively ameliorate myocardial damage and inhibit cardiac hypertrophy, which is at least partly related to the elevation of Foxp3 expression in cardiomyocytes.

Identification of the critical genes and biological processes specifically and/or commonly changed in DCIS or IBC can help us understand more about breast cancer development and provide more critical targets and signal transduction pathways for the diagnosis and treatments for breast cancer patients. Aim and methods: We aimed to gain more understanding about the whole process of IBC development, especially in the early stage. Here we systematically analyzed an online breast cancer patient database to identify those significantly changed genes and biological processes in epithelium from normal stage to DCIS stage or from DCIS stage to IBC stage. Results: 344 specific genes, such as FN1, AURKA and HSPA8, were found to be significantly changed (both upregulated and downregulated) in DOS group in comparison with normal tissue group, which represents the gene profile changes in early stage of breast cancer development. Meanwhile, 304 specific genes were significantly changed (both upregulated and downregulated) in IBC group in comparison with normal tissue group, which represents the gene profile changes in late stage of breast cancer development. Importantly, seven genes were identified to have consistent changes in both early stage and late stage, indicating they might play "driving" roles in the breast cancer development. Of these 7 genes, 5 have been shown to be involved in breast cancer progression by previous studies, which demonstrates the validity of our analyses. Notably, DNAPTP3 was identified for the first time to play an oncogenic role in breast cancer development. In the GO term analyses, cell cycle genes was found to play more important roles in the early stage while biological adhesion was indicated to be more specifically involved in late stage of breast cancer development. Significance: Our systematic analyses provide better understanding of the unique gene profiles and biological processes during the breast cancer development and identify more potentially important targets for future studies, such as DNAPTP3.

In this study different radiotherapy optimization regimens are compared to assess their effectiveness and toxicity rates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 112 patients with modified radical mastectomy participated, and were randomly assigned to one of three groups, all receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for 4-6 weeks prior to radiotherapy: group A received intensity modulated radiotherapy (radiation dose (DT) 50 Gy, 2.0 Gy/fraction, 25 times, during the course of 33-35 days); group B received concurrent radio chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy; and group C adopted concurrent radio chemotherapy and hypofractionation (DT of 42.56 Gy, 2.66Gy/fraction, 16 times, during the course of 2224 days) with 37 cases. The occurrence of acute and chronic radiation injuries, the cancer recurrence and the survival rates were compared, and a dose volume histogram (DVH) was created. RESULTS: The total prevalence and survival rates of Group C were significantly better than those of the other two groups (p = 0.05); in spite of the fact that the local recurrence and distant metastasis rates separately were all statistically the same (p = 0.05). Also, the total radiation injury occurrence of group C was significantly lower (p < 0.05); but no significant differences were found when singling out acute and chronic injury occurrences or injury severity between the three groups. The values of V5, V10, V20 and V30 increased gradually in all of the groups, and V5 and V10 in Group C were higher than those in the other two groups, but the comparison between V20 and V30 yielded no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the concurrence of hypo-fractionation radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be an effective and safe approach for cancer treatment after modified radical mastectomy, and larger studies are warranted given the convenience of the method.

Because of the relatively unstable molecular structure, STRs show a high mutation rate. In the current study, we report 169 mutation events of 13 CODIS and 15 non-CODIS STR loci that were found in 5569 cases of trios and duos paternity test. Our result indicated that locus-specific mutation rate varied among different populations, geometric means of the longest run of perfect repeats (LRPR) and heterozygosity. Along with previous published data, a forensic dataset for allele frequencies and locus-specific mutation rates of 13 CODIS and 15 non-CODIS STR loci from southwest Chinese Han population has been established. The mutation rate data have important implications in interpreting forensic individual identification and paternity testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Results: Medulloblastoma are located in the cerebellar hemisphere, including 8 cases on the right side, left 4 cases, partial involvement of cerebellar vermis, tumor shape is irregular, cerebellar involvement at the same time, cortex and medulla, substantial part of the distribution, 7 cases of male, onset age so much as the age of 64. Most tumors typically showed slightly low signal intensity on T1WI, slightly high or isointensity signal intensity on T2WI, compared with normal gray matter of the cerebellum. The expression level of NSE in medulloblastomas group was significantly higher than those in normal human brain tissues (P < 0.01), NSE of Medulloblastoma in 12 cases shows strong positive expression, the positive expression rate were strong positive (++++). Pathology shows that the original organization under optical microscope, undifferentiated tumor cells, the nuclear spindle, forming many chrysanthemum mass of tumor cells. Some smaller, to the marrow cell differentiation. Partial differentiation for the ganglion cells. Conclusions: Cerebellar medulloblastomas in adults have some characteristic MR features, it might be discriminated from other cerebellar tumor by analyzing MRI features. NSE might be as a markers of neurological injury in medulloblastomas.

However, very little is known about the relationship between levels of serum sE-cadherin and HBV-related disorders. The overall goal of the study is to get a better insight into whether or not serum sE-cadherin is involved in HBV-related diseases. Design and methods: Serum levels of sE-cadherin and IFN-gamma, from 113 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 101 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, 75 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 125 healthy individuals were measured with commercial available sandwich ELISA kits. Results: sE-cadherin values were significantly higher in patients compared to healthy control (p < 0.0001). The levels of serum sE-cadherin were significantly positively correlated with the serum levels of IFN-gamma, alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase in chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients, serum sE-cadherin concentrations were only significantly positively correlated with the serum levels of ALT and AST. Conclusions: Serum sE-cadherin levels maybe an important indicator of the pathogenesis of progression of HBV-related disorders. (C) 2016 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Methods This retrospective study was conducted in Tongliao, China. Couples who were married during the time period between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 2003 were considered eligible for this study. A total of 27,413 individuals provided valid information via house-tohouse interviews. The 12-month cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR) and annual percentage change were used as the outcome measurements. Results There was a significant increase in the CPR over the five successive time groups. A break point in 1988 divided the entire study period into two distinct segments: 1981-1988, during which the CPR increased from 72.2% to 84.2%, and 1988-2003, during which the CPR increased from 84.2% to 87.2%. Conclusions The findings were unlikely to be the result of biases, and could not be explained by increased medical treatment for infertility and changes in the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases. Dramatic societal and behavioral changes due to the unique family planning policy and economic reform policies in China might have been the plausible reason for the results.

The expression of miR-940 has been shown to play an important role in various cancers; however, the role of miR-940 in TNBC remains unknown. Material/Methods: The expression of miR-940 in TNBC tissues or cells were tested by qRT-PCR; the expression of miR-940 in cells were overexpressed by miR-940 mimics, and suppressed by anti-miR-940. Bioinformatics algorithms from TargetScanHuman were used to predict the target genes of miR-940. The interaction between miR-940 and ZNF24 was confirmed by dual luciferase assays. The protein level was assayed by Western blot. Results: TNBC tissues and cells showed lower miR-940 levels. Conclusions: MiR-940 inhibited cellular proliferation and migration in TNBC.

Under conventional conditions of isothermal crystallization without nucleating agents, homogeneous nucleation is the key factor for the compatibility of this equation. On account of structural characteristics, the homogeneous nucleation of polymers is possibly affected by several factors. In this study, we investigated the isothermal crystallization of four PPDOs end-capped with amino acids, followed by the Avrami equation analysis. After employing the method reported by Malek and Mitsuhashi, the L-Gly-end-capped PPDO and L-Leu-, L-Phe-end-capped PPDO crystallized at higher temperatures were not suitable for analysis by the Avrami equation. In addition, this result was substantiated by reasoning the polymer chains' mobility which could be affected by the terminated amino acids' steric hindrance and crystallization temperatures, subsequently affecting homogeneous nucleation.

J	Tu, FP; Li, JX; Li, Q; Wang, J				Tu, Fa-Ping; Li, Jun-Xiang; Li, Qiang; Wang, Ji			Effects of hydrogen sulfide on cognitive dysfunction and NR2B in rats	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Hydrogen sulfide; Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion; Cognitive dysfunction; NR2B	HEPATIC ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION; NMDA RECEPTOR; NONCARDIAC SURGERY; MICE; INJURY; MEMORY; MITOCHONDRIA; HIPPOCAMPUS; EXPRESSION; DEFICITS	Background: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (hepatic I/R) has been found to induce cognitive dysfunction. The NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is a major factor in memory and learning processes, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may modulate this NMDA receptor. Therefore, in this study, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) was administered in an animal model of hepatic I/R to investigate the effects of H2S on cognitive impairment and expression of NR2B. Materials and methods: NaHS (5 mg/kg) or normal saline was administered intraperitoneally once a day for 11 consecutive days, during which a rat model of 70% hepatic I/R was established on the fourth day. Cognitive function was evaluated using a Morris water maze, mRNA and protein levels of the NR2B subunit were detected in the hippocampus by RT-PCR and Western blotting. All these tests were performed on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Results: Cognitive dysfunction was detected in the hepatic I/R group, and this dysfunction was associated with a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus. In contrast, treatment with NaHS significantly ameliorated the impairment of cognitive function caused by hepatic I/R, and an increase in mRNA and protein levels of the NR2B subunit was detected in the corresponding hippocampus tissues. Conclusions: The present data suggest that H2S exerts a protective effect on hepatic I/R-induced cognitive impairment, and this effect may be associated with the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptors. H2S may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after liver surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we investigated the role of CDK5 in CRC and found that its expression was much higher in CRC tissues than that in normal tissues with a higher expression level of CDK5 closely correlating to advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, poor differentiation, increased tumor size and poor prognosis of CRC. Biological function experiments showed that CDK5 regulated CRC cell proliferation and metastasis ability. Whole-genome microarray analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro kinase assay, western blotting, luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that CDK5 could directly phosphorylate ERK5 at threonine (Thr) 732 and finally modulate the oncogenic ERK5-AP-1 axis. Further researches showed that CDK5-ERK5-AP-1 axis could promote progression of CRC carcinogenesis and had a significant correlation in human CRC samples. In summary, this study revealed the functional and mechanistic links between CDK5 and the oncogenic ERK5-AP-1 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CRC. These findings suggest that CDK5 has an important role in CRC development and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

Methods: Four hundred and seventy-eight angiografically defined subjects (325 CHD patients and 153 CHD-free controls) were enrolled in this study. The rs662799 polymorphism was genotyped, and the fasting lipid data were collected for all participants. The severity of CHD was evaluated for the CHD patients by using Gensini scores. Results: The variant C allele of the rs662799 polymorphism was associated with lower levels of HDL-C in CHD-free women, and higher levels of TG and TG/HDL-C in women with CHD (P < 0.05 for all). The C allele was associated with higher prevalence of dyslipidemia and higher levels of Gensini scores only in women (P < 0.05 for both), but not in men. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the rs662799 polymorphism was independently associated with the Gensini scores in women after adjustment for other potential CHD risk factors (Beta = 0.157, 95 % CI: 0.017-0.298, P = 0.028). Conclusion: Our data indicate that the rs662799 polymorphism is associated with dyslipidemia and the severity of CHD in Chinese women.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant insight into the genetic architecture and identified plenty of robust genetic variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex disease. A major current challenge is to convert those resources into causal variants and target genes. We used RegulomeDB and HaploReg to annotate regulatory information onto associated SNPs derived from the two largest RE GWAS, and additional SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS significant SNPs. Overall 868 SNPs were investigated, out of which 662 returned RegulomeDB scores of 1 to 6. It was observed that 36 out of those SNPs show strong evidence of regulatory effects with a RegulomeDB score of 1, while only four of them were GWAS significant SNPs (CD55/rs1652333, CNDP2/rs12971120, RDH5/rs3138142 and rs3138144). The results encourage us to explore those putative pathogenic variants, both GWAS significant SNPs as well as the SNPs in LD, for future discernment of functional consequence. This study offers the attractive approach for prioritizing potential functional variants by combining ENCODE data and GWAS information, and provide further insights into the pathogenesis and mechanism and ultimately therapeutics.

Methods: A literature search was performed using The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and Google Scholar. Literature reviewed included meta-analyses, and randomized and nonrandomized prospective studies. We utilized weight mean difference (WMD) to measure hospital stay, time to return normal activity, postoperative pain and improvement of semen parameters and odds ratio (OR) to postoperative complications and cosmetic satisfaction. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.1 software for statistical analysis. Results: We identified six publications which strictly met our eligibility criteria. Meta-analysis of extractable data showed that LESS-V was better than CTL-V in postoperative pain (WMD: -0.46; 95 % CI -0.75 to -0.17; p = 0.002), time to convalescence (WMD: -1.4 days; 95 % CI -2.55 to -0.25; p = 0.02) and cosmetic satisfaction (OR 6.86; 95 % CI 2.89-16.28; p < 0.00001). However, CTL-V was better than LESS-V in operative time (WMD 1.96 min, 95 % CI 0.96-2.96; p = 0.0001). There were no differences between LESS-V and CTL-V in hospital stay (WMD: -0.02 days, 95 % CI -0.39 to 0.35; p = 0.92) and postoperative complications (OR 1.13, 95 % CI 0.57-2.21; p = 0.73). Conclusions: This meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of LESS-V and CTL-V showed that LESS-V was safe, with significantly reduced postoperative pain, shorter recovery time, and better cosmetic outcome.

Design A prospective observational study. Setting The study was conducted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Population The final,sample involved 1200 Chinese parturients with singleton, vertex and term gestation; spontaneous onset. of labour; vaginal delivery; and without adverse perinatal outcomes. Methods A repeated-measures analysis was used to depict labour curves while an interval-censored regression was used to estimate the duration of labour centimetre by centimetre. Main outcome measures Labour curves and the duration of labour at. the 50th and 95th percentiles. Results Among 1091 nulliparous women, 57.7% had cervical dilation of 3 cm or less at the time of admission, and the mean duration of the first stage of labour was 9.1 +/- 3.3 hours. From 5 to 9 cm of cervical dilation it sometimes took more than 2 hours for dilation to advance 1 cm. No obvious inflection points appeared in the labour curve of Chinese nulliparac, and no deceleration was observed. Conclusion Progress of labour in Chinese parturients was more gradual than in their Western counterparts. Obstetric practice standards based on data generated from Western countries may not be appropriate for Chinese women.

More and more findings have shown that alteration in telomere length may involve in normal somatic cells and some diseases, however, whether the telomere length is associated with the development and/or progression of hepatic diseases remains poorly understood.Methods:A case-control study was employed to illustrate the correlation of relative telomere length (RTL) with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, 152 patients with HCC, 212 patients with CHB, and 184 healthy controls were recruited. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes, and fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was used to detect telomere repeated numbers and 36B4 copy numbers. The RTL was calculated by telomere repeat copy number to single-copy gene number ratio in each sample compared with a reference DNA sample.Results:We found that the RTL in HCC group was the longest, followed by CHB group, and healthy control group was the shortest, showing significant statistical differences. When participants were categorized into longer and shorter group according to medium value in healthy controls, individuals who had longer RTL had a significant increased risk of CHB (odds ratio [OR]: 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-2.73) when the healthy control was used as the reference groups; furthermore, longer RTL also showed higher incidence of HCC (OR: 3.22, 95% CI: 2.01-5.17; OR: 1.58, 95% CI:1.03-2.41) when healthy control and CHB were used as the reference groups, respectively. When participants were categorized further into 4 groups according to quartile values of RTL in healthy controls, it showed that the longest RTL was also associated with an increased risk of CHB (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.17-3.74) and HCC (OR: 4.31, 95% CI: 2.18-8.52; OR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.53-5.34) when control and control/CHB group were used as the reference groups, respectively.Conclusion:Our results suggest that the alteration of telomere length in peripheral leukocytes might be involved in the hepatitis B virus infection and HCC events, and RTL might be a potential useful predictor of CHB and HCC.

Material and Methods 66 patients diagnosed with AP and 20 normal controls (NC) underwent DTI sequences and routine pancreatic MR sequences on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Average ADC and FA values of the pancreatic were measured. Differences of FA and ADC values between the AP group and the NC group with AP and healthy pancreas were compared by two-sample independent t-test. The severity of AP on MRI was classified into subgroups using MR severity index (MRSI), where the mean FA and ADC values were calculated. Relationship among the FA values, ADC values and MRSI were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results The pancreatic mean ADC value in the AP group (1.68 +/- 0.45x10(-3)mm(2)/s) was significantly lower than in the NC group (2.09 +/- 0.55x10(-3)mm(2)/s) (P = 0.02); the same as mean FA value (0.39 +/- 0.23 vs 0.54 +/- 0.12, P = 0.00). In the subgroup analysis, the pancreatic ADC and FA value of edema AP patients was significantly higher than necrosis AP patients with P = 0.000 and P = 0.001 respectively. In addition, as severity of pancreatitis increased according to MRSI, lower pancreatic ADC (r = -0.635) and FA value (r = -0.654) were noted. Conclusion Both FA and ADC value from DTI can be used to differentiate AP patients from NC. Both ADC and FA value of pancreas have a negative correlation with the severity of AP.

By now, the molecular mechanism for spontaneous resolution of acute GA remains unclear; this study was undertaken to evaluate whether IL-37 is involved in spontaneous resolution of AGA. A total of 45 acute GA (AGA),29 non-acute GA (NAGA) male patients and 82 male health control (HC) were involved in this study, we measured IL-7 expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 in the serum. Further, we either inhibited IL-37 expression in human PBMCs with siRNA or over-expressed the cytokine in human macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expressions were significantly higher in the AGA group than in the NAGA or HC group (P < 0.05, respectively). However, anti-inflammatory IL-37, TGF-beta 1, and IL-10 were greater in the NAGA group than in the AGA and HC groups (P < 0.05, respectively). Expression of IL-37 in MSU crystal-treated macrophages inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the abundance of these cytokines increased with silencing of endogenous IL-37 in human blood cells. However, anti-inflammatory TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 expressions in these supernatants were unaffected by over-expression or knockdown of IL-37. Our study indicates that IL-37 is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine in AGA by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, IL-37 may provide a novel research target for the pathogenesis and therapy of GA.

However, biological conclusions based on density were difficult to interpret because the changes in density could be due to an alteration of total quantity and/or an alteration in the reference volume. In the present study, we used unbiased stereological methods to investigate the effects of type 1 diabetes on the total volume of CA(1) and dentate gyrus (DG), the total number of neurons and the total number of Spinophilin/NeurabinII-positive boutons in CA(1) and DG of streptozotocin-treated rat model. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sodium citrate buffer-treated group (control group) and streptozotocin (STZ)-treated group (diabetes group), in which type 1 diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection. Learning and memory were measured using the Morris water maze test. Our results indicated that diabetes induced deficit in learning/memory, decrease in total CA(1) volume (by 51.5%) and degeneration in synaptic structures in CA(1)sr (by 30.2%). While there were no significant changes in total DG volume, total neuron number in CA(1) and DG, total Spinophilin/NeurabinII-positive bouton number in DG. The present study provided the first evidence of changes in the total volume, the total neuron number and the total Spinophilin/NeurabinII-positive bouton number in CA(1) and DG of STZ-induced diabetic rats.

We conducted a meta-analysis of available epidemiological data to address this issue. Results: Compared with nondrinkers, the pooled relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CIs) of thyroid cancer were 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.90) for any drinkers, 0.81 (95% CI 0.70-0.93) for light and 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.79) for moderate drinkers. The dose-response analysis suggested that there is no evidence of a dose-risk relationship between alcohol intaking and thyroid cancer risk (P = 0.112). Methods: Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMbase databases. A total of 24 studies, included 9,990 cases with thyroid cancer, were included in this meta-analysis. We defined light alcohol intake as <= one drink/day and moderate as > one drink/day. The summary risk estimates were calculated by the random effects model. A dose-response analysis was also conducted for modeling the dose-risk relation. Conclusion: This meta-analysis confirmed an inverse association between alcohol consumption and thyroid cancer risk. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential mechanisms underlying this association.

METHODS: All association studies on COL1A1 and high myopia reported up to June 10, 2014 in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedical Database were retrieved. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were analyzed for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using fixed- and random - effects models according to between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias analyses were conducted by Eggers test. RESULTS: A total of four studies from reported papers were included in this analysis. The Meta-analyses for COL1A1 rs2075555, composed of 2304 high myopia patients and 2272 controls, failed to detect any significant association with high myopia. A total of 971 cases and 649 controls were tested for COL1A1 rs2269336. The association of COL1A1 rs2269336 with high myopia was observed in recessive model (CC vs CG+GG, P = 0.03) and in heterozygous model (CG vsGG, P = 0.04), but not in other models. CONCLUSION: This Meta-analysis shows that COL fill rs2269336 (CC vs CG +GG) affects individual susceptibility to high myopia, whereas there is no association detected between SNPs rs2075555 and high myopia. Given the limited sample size, further investigations including more ethnic groups are required to validate the association.

DNA vaccination is an attractive approach for antigen-specific immunotherapy against P. aeruginosa. We explored the feasibility of employing Herpes simplex virus type 1 tegument protein, VP22, as a molecular tool to enhance the immunogenicity of an OprF DNA vaccine against P. aeruginosa. Recombinant DNA vaccines, pVAX1-OprF, pVAX1-OprF-VP22 (encoding a n-OprF-VP22-c fusion protein) and pVAX1-VP22-OprF (encoding a n-VP22-OprF-c fusion protein) were constructed. The humoral and cellular immune responses and immune protective effects of these DNA vaccines in mice were evaluated. In this report, we showed that vaccination with pVAX1-0prF-VP22 induced higher levels of IgG titer, T cell proliferation rate. It also provided better immune protection against the P. aeruginosa challenge when compared to that induced by pVAX1-OprF or pVAX1-VP22-OprF DNA vaccines. Molecular mechanistic analyses indicated vaccination with pVAX1-OprF-VP22 triggered immune responses characterized by a preferential increase in antigen specific IgG2a and IFN-gamma in mice, indicating Th1 polarization. We concluded that VP22 is a potent stimulatory molecular tool for DNA vaccination when fused to the carboxyl end of OprF gene. Our study provides a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of P. aeruginosa infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, we detected that IK6 existed in 20 of 42 (47.6%) adult BCR-ABL1-positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL) by using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. IK6-positive patients had an unfavorable outcome compared with IK6-negative ones. Further study showed that the level of HO-1 expression was higher in IK6-positive patients' samples than that in IK6-negative ones. And there was a strong correlation between the expression of IK6 and HO-1. The growth of primary CD34(+) leukemic cells derived from our IK6-positive patients' pool was prohibited by silencing HO-1, further promoting their apoptosis. Furthermore, primary CD34+ leukemic cells derived from IK6-positive patients shown poor responses to imatinib in comparison with wild-type (IK1) patients, suggesting that the expression of IK6 resisted to imatinib in adult BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL. Importantly, inhibition of HO-1 also increased their sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Finally, we found that IK6 activated downstream STAT5, and HO-1 was one of the downstream target genes of STAT5. In conclusion, HO-1 is an essential survival factor in BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL with IK6, and targeting HO-1 can attenuate the negative impact of IK6.

A daphnetin-containing traditional Chinese medicine tablet, named Zushima-Pian, is available in China for treating rheumatoid arthritis. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolism of daphnetin through sulfation in cultured human cells and to identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferase(s) (SULT(s)) that is(are) capable of mediating the sulfation of daphnetin. Materials and methods: Cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells were labeled with [S-35]sulfate in the presence of different concentrations of daphnetin. Thirteen known human SULTs, previously expressed and purified, as well as cytosols of human kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine, were examined for daphnetin-sulfating activity using an established sulfotransferase assay. Results: [S-35]sulfated daphnetin was found to be generated and released by HepG2 cells and Caco-2 cells labeled with [S-35] sulfate in the presence of daphnetin. Among the 13 known human SULT5, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, and SULT1C4 displayed significant sulfating activity toward daphnetin. Of the four human organ samples later tested, small intestine and liver cytosols displayed considerably higher daphnetin-sulfating activity than those of lung and kidney. Conclusion: The results derived from the present study showed unequivocally that daphnetin could be sulfated in cultured human cells and by purified human SULT enzymes as well as human organ cytosols. The information obtained provided a basis for further studies on the metabolism of daphnetin through sulfation in vivo. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective was to observe a further possible role of CS in the protection of insulin-secreting cells. Methods: A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus was developed with streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-energy fat diet (HFD). CS was administered in the successful model of rats with type 2 diabetes. After 4 weeks, the biochemistry index of blood samples was measured, and pathologic observation was performed by immunohistochemistry. Results: In the rats with type 2 diabetes induced by a HFD and STZ, the levels of fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin were elevated, and the insulin sensitivity index was decreased. Pathologic examination found an increased number of apoptotic cells, an elevated protein expression of pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and an increased c-Jun level by means of JNK phosphorylation, responsive to the endoplasmic reticulum stress of islet beta cells. With treatment by CS for 4 weeks, the elevated levels of both fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin in the rats with type 2 diabetes were significantly lower, and the decreased insulin sensitivity index was reversed. Compared to the control rats with type 2 diabetes, CS application significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells and decreased protein expression of both CHOP and c-Jun. Conclusions: The herbal compound CS could protect pancreatic beta cells from the pro-apoptotic endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by HFD-STZ. This suggests an alternative approach to treating type 2 diabetes. (C) 2016 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Two databases (PubMed and Emabse) were searched for prospective cohort studies regarding nut intake and stroke risk. Studies were included if they fulfilled the predefined criteria. Eleven articles encompassing fourteen cohort studies were included in final analysis. The pooled relative risk (RR) of stroke for the highest versus (vs.) lowest category of nut intake was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.97). The power to detect a RR of 0.88 for the highest versus vs. lowest category of nut intake was 86.2%. In multiple subset analyses by gender, location, and stroke subtype, the inverse association was only found in women (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) and Asia (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.93). In the dose-response meta-analysis, evidence for a nonlinear association between nut intake and stroke risk was observed and a RR of 0.86 was conferred for 12 g/day. Based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, the quality of evidence was moderate. In conclusions, finding from current meta-analysis of fourteen cohort studies indicates that nut intake may be related to decreased risk of stroke.

The authors present the largest series in an Asian population. Methods: Between 2000 and 2015, 26 genetically confirmed PPMSSs were included. The clinicopathologic features of all of the cases were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using the following antibodies: TLE1, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), EMA, CD99, Bcl-2, CK7, CD34, S-100 protein, and Ki-67. The chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We compared the clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of this series with that of the previous series and soft tissue synovial sarcomas. Results: This series included 17 males and nine females. The median age was 36.5 years (range, 16-72 years). The tumors involved the lung (76.9 %), pleura (15.4 %), and mediastinum (7.7 %). The median tumor size was 6 cm (range 2.3 similar to 24 cm). The majority of the tumors were well-circumscribed. The tumors were classified as monophasic (84.6 %), biphasic (3.8 %), and poorly differentiated (11.5 %) types. The tumors were graded as French Federation of Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) grade 2 (62.5 %) and FNCLCC 3 (37.5 %). Diffuse immunostaining for TLE1, BCL-2, and CD99 was identified in 91.7, 95.7, and 56.0 % of the tumors, respectively. Focal positivity was seen with EMA (84.6 %), CK7 (55. 6 %), cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) (68.0 %), CD34 (5.0 %), and S-100 protein (21.7 %). A high Ki-67 index (>= 10 %) was observed in 91.3 % of the tumors. The fusion transcripts included SS18-SSX1 (15/22, 68.2 %), SS18-SSX2 including variants (6/22, 27.3 %), and SS18-SSX4 (1/22, 4.5 %) fusions. The remaining four cases showed positivity for SS18 rearrangement by FISH. Surgical excision of tumors or lobectomy were performed in 20 patients, and seven of the patients underwent adjuvant therapy. Clinical follow-up was available in 73.1 % cases, with a median follow-up of 12.0 months. The median survival time was 14.5 months. Tumor resection (p = 0.024) and no residual tumor (p = 0.004) were associated with an improved overall survival time. Conclusions: PPMSS is a highly aggressive neoplasm. Extensive surgical resection of the tumor and more effective adjuvant therapy should be advocated. PPMSS must be differentiated from similar diseases.

A metabolic labeling study showed the generation and release of [S-35]sulfated 6-OH-Mel, NAS and 4-OH-Ram by HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells labeled with [S-35]sulfate in the presence of these drug compounds. Cytosols of human lung, liver, kidney and small intestine were examined to verify the presence of 6-OH-Mel-, NAS- and 4-OH-Ram-sulfating activity in vivo. Of the four human organ samples tested, small intestine and liver cytosols displayed considerably higher 6-OH-Mel-, NAS- and 4-OH-Ram-sulfating activities than those of lung and kidney.3.Collectively, these results provided a molecular basis for the metabolism of 6-OH-Mel, NAS and 4-OH-Ram through sulfation.

The tail was coordinated intramolecularly to zinc porphyrin, leading to the formation of a cavity. In the cavity, tailed porphyrins formed a complex with di-n-hexylammonium salts. The binding affinities of the tailed porphyrins were studied by H-1 NMR and UV-visible titration experiments. The selectivity of complexation was attributed to the induced fit and lipophilic interactions.

Materials and Methods: MFN1 gene expression in guinea pigs was examined during the development of minus LIM, 15 tri-colored guinea pigs were obtained, and one eye of each pig was randomly selected and treated with -7.00D lenses. Ocular refraction and axial length were collected before intervention and 1, 2, and 3 weeks after intervention. After the refraction and axial length measurements at 1, 2, and 3 weeks of lens intervention, five guinea pigs were randomly selected. MFN1 expression in the retina of both eyes was tested by immunohistochemistry technique. Results: MFN1-positive cells could be observed in the retina of both eyes. The positive cells in the LIM eyes were staining deeper, and much more positive cells could be observed. Furthermore, MFN1-positive expression could be seen mainly in ganglion cells after 1 week of minus lens intervention, and with time extension, more and more positive cells appeared in the rod-cone cell and bipolar cell layer, and this phenomenon could not be found in the normal control eyes. Conclusion: This study suggested that MFN1 might be correlated to the development of myopia.

Methods: The lentivirus vector with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing consistently high levels of FOXC1 (FOXC1-MDA-MB-231) were established. The parental MDA-MB-231 cells served as controls. Western blot analysis was used to determine the FOXCl expression. The invasion capability was tested using the Trans-well assay. The tumorigenicity and the pulmonary metastatic ability were determined in mice in vivo. Histopathology and microarray processing and analysis were performed, and the various pathways involved and the related genes were analyzed. Results: The invasion ability of FOXC1-MDA-MB-231 cells was enhanced significantly (p<0.01). Pulmonary metastases were observed in vivo in 3 of 5 mice administered FOXC1-MDA-MB-231 cells through tail vein injection. However, no pulmonary metastatic lesions were observed with MDA-MB-231 cells. The average tumor volume was larger in the mice injected with FOXC1-MDA-MB-231 than in the control mice (p<0.05). The expression of Ki-67 in the FOXCl-MDA-MB-231 injected mice was higher than in the control mice. Ten of the most gene-enriched pathways and the critical genes (IL-6 and SNAI2) were found to be related to BLBC. Conclusion: Elevated expression of FOXC1 enhanced the invasion ability of BLCB cells in vitro and promoted tumor growth and metastatic ability in vivo. This function may be regulated by many gene-enriched pathways and some critical genes.

Sex differences for the variables were tested by Student's t-test. Fisher's method has been followed for discriminant analysis. Regression analysis was applied to match the six linear parameters against stature. The stepwise analysis of all measurements yielded a sex classification accuracy rate of 86.7% and a sex bias of 3.1%. All the classification accuracy rates of the univariate discriminant function analyses are of more than 80%. For stature estimation, the accuracy of stature prediction ranged from 5.252 to 7.210 cm for male, from 4.630 to 6.484 cm for female, respectively. This paper provides indications that the scapula is an important bone for sex diagnosis and it could be effectively used as alternatives in forensic cases. Furthermore, the equations presented for stature estimation in this study should be used as alternatives in forensic cases when long bones were unavailable for stature estimation.

However, allo-PBSCT is commonly complicated with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), characterized by host tissues being attacked by the grafted donor lymphocytes due to disparities of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) between the donor and host. By contrast, cord blood transplantation (CBT) is typically associated with low-grade severity of aGVHD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Donor-derived CD4(+) alloreactive T cells (ATs) are of a specific lymphocyte subset, which can be activated by the recipient's HLA, and play a crucial role in the onset of aGVHD. In the present study, we aimed to explore the difference in the property of CD4(+)ATs between cord blood (CB) and adult peripheral blood (APB). We thus found that CB and APB CD4(+)ATs contained not only effector T cells (Teffs) that execute aGVHD, but also a distinct subset of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) that may alleviate aGVHD. Importantly, CB CD4(+)ATs contained higher percentage of FoxP3(+) Tregs, compared to APB CD4(+) ATs (P < 0.001), while lower percentage of Teffs (Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells) was detected in CB CD4(+) ATs (P < 0.05, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Our findings suggest that FoxP3(+) Tregs in CB CD4(+) ATs may contribute to attenuating the severity of aGVHD observed after CBT.

Despite therapeutic strategies including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival of patients is only 14.6 months. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered as a novel type of gene regulator. Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of miRNA-34a (miR-34a) is significantly associated with the grade and prognosis of glioma. However, the exact function of miR-34a on glioma progression and underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the function of miR-34a in U87 human glioma cells by exogenously transfecting cells with an miR-34a mimic. Overexpression of miR-34a inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis of U87 cells. The current study also demonstrated that B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was the target gene of miR-34a, as demonstrated by luciferase assays. Furthermore, restoring the expression of Bcl-2 was indicated to partially block the miR-34a-induced apoptosis. Thus, data from the present study identified miR-34a as a tumor suppressor in glioma by, at least partially, targeting Bcl-2. This may provide future novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for human glioma.

Overall, 297, including 292 single-step, 4 double-step and 1 triple-step mutation events were observed. The average mutation rate was 0.70 x 10(-3). Most of the locus-specific mutation rates (varied from 0.20 x 10(-3) to 1.96 x 10(-3)) were lower than the other datasets (p < 0.05). Mutations of 7 loci are reported for the first time. Mutation rates varied with population from different ethnicities and geographical regions. There was no significant difference between mutation expansion and contraction (similar to 1.04:1). Paternal origin mutations occurred more frequently than maternal origin ones (similar to 5.02:1). In addition, mutation rates indicated positive correlation with the expected heterozygosity (He) and geometric mean of longest run of perfect repeats (LRPR), respectively. Short alleles showed a trend toward mutation gain while long alleles trended toward mutation loss. A credible forensic dataset for locus-specific mutation rates of 33 loci has been established based upon strict inclusion criteria of large-sized parents/child-trio cases.

No clinical features can accurately diagnose TCV. Thus, the results of histocytology, immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics tests have important clinical implications for diagnosis. Given the aggressiveness and the increased recurrence and poor survival rates, more aggressive treatment approach and rigorous follow-up is required for patients with TCV. In the present article, we undertook a comprehensive review to summarize and discuss the various aspects of this variant, from morphology to immunohistochemistry, and molecular abnormalities from a practical and daily practice-oriented point of view.

Early diagnosis and treatment of LSTs is clinically challenging. To overcome this problem, we employed iTRAQ to identify LST-specific protein biomarkers potentially involved in LST progression. In this study, we identified 2,001 differentially expressed proteins in LSTs using iTRAQ-based proteomics technology. Lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) was the most up-regulated protein. LSTs expression levels of LCN-2 and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) showed positive correlation with worse pathological grading, and up-regulation of these proteins in LSTs was also reflected in serum. Furthermore, LCN-2 protein overexpression was positively correlated with MMP-9 protein up-regulation in the tumor tissue and serum of LST patients (former r(s) = 0.631, P = 0.000; latter r(s)= 0.815, P = 0.000). Our results suggest that LCN-2 constitutes a potential biomarker for LST disease progression and might be a novel therapeutic target in LSTs.

The current study aimed to identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme(s) capable of mediating the sulfation of rotigotine. Of the 13 known human SULTs examined, 6 of them (SULT1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1B1, 1C4, 1E1) displayed significant sulfating activities toward rotigotine. pH dependence and kinetic parameters of the sulfation of rotigotine by relevant human SULTs were determined. Of the 6 human organ samples tested, small intestine and liver cytosols displayed considerably higher rotigotine-sulfating activity than did brain, lung, and kidney. Moreover, sulfation of rotigotine was shown to occur in HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells under metabolic conditions. Collectively, the results obtained provided a molecular basis underlying the previous finding of the excretion of sulfated rotigotine by patients undergoing treatment with rotigotine.

The antagonism between the 2 networks might indicate a dynamic interaction in the brain that is associated with development. To evaluate the alterations in the relations of the 2 networks in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), resting state fMRI was performed in 17 patients with BECTS and 17 healthy controls. The functional and effective connectivities of 29 nodes in the TPN and DMN were analyzed. Positive functional connectivity (FC) within the networks and negative FC between the 2 networks were observed in both groups. The patients exhibited increased FC within both networks, particularly in the frontoparietal nodes such as the left superior frontal cortex, and enhanced antagonism between the 2 networks, suggesting abnormal functional integration of the nodes of the 2 networks in the patients. Granger causality analysis revealed a significant difference in the degree of outflow to inflow in the left superior frontal cortex and the left ventral occipital lobe. The alterations observed in the combined functional and effective connectivity analyses might indicate an association of an abnormal ability to integrate information between the DMN and TPN and the epileptic neuropathology of BECTS and provide preliminary evidence supporting the occurrence of abnormal development in children with BECTS.

Thus, it is important to perform early prognostic evaluations in CA patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for determining the prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to its real-time measurement of brain function. Based on EEG, burst suppression, a burst suppression ratio > 0.239, periodic discharges, status epilepticus, stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic or ictal discharges, non-reactive EEG, and the BIS value based on quantitative EEG may be associated with the prognosis of CA after successful CPR. As measures of neural network integrity, the values of small-world characteristics of the neural network derived from EEG patterns have potential applications.

Methods:In a cohort consisting of 80 rectal cancer patients who received potentially curative resection of rectal carcinoma with implantation of I-125 brachytherapy or radical resection of rectal carcinoma underwent total mesorectal excision. The incidences of AL, fecal incontinence, urinary dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction were calculated for comparison, and risk factors for these complications were analyzed by logistic regression. Rates of tumor recurrence and overall survival were evaluated. Results:Six out of 17 (35.29%) patients in the I-125 implant group and 1 out of 34 (2.94%) patients in the non-implant group were complicated with AL (P=0.006). The incidences of urinary dysfunction (P=0.005) and fecal incontinence (P=0.023) were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analyses revealed that I-125 brachytherapy was an independent risk factor for AL (odds ratio, 18.702; 95%CI, 1.802-194.062; P=0.014) and urinary dysfunction (odds ratio, 4.340; 95%CI, 1.158-16.264; P=0.029), respectively. At postoperative 2-year, the recurrence rates were 5.56% in the I-125 implant group and 9.09% in the non-implant group (P=0.029). Conclusions:Intraoperative implantation of I-125 brachytherapy significantly increases the risk of AL, fecal incontinence, urinary dysfunction, and improves local control and do not improve overall survival after total mesorectal excision.

The chimeric virus (JEV/DENV1) was successfully recovered from primary hamster kidney (PHK) cells by transfection with the in vitro transcription products of JEV/DENV1 cDNA and was identified by complete genome sequencing and immunofluorescent staining. No neuroinvasiveness of this chimeric virus was observed in mice inoculated by the subcutaneous route (s.c.) or by the intraperitoneal route (i.p.), while some neurovirulence was displayed in mice that were inoculated directly by the intracerebral route (i.c.). The chimeric virus was able to stimulate high-titer production of antibodies against DENV1 and provided protection against lethal challenge with neuroadapted dengue virus in mice. These results suggest that the chimeric virus is a promising dengue vaccine candidate.

However, the toxicity of QDs is largely unknown and the underlying mechanism is still undefined. This study was conducted to examine the hepatotoxicity of CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs and the underlying mechanism. In hepatic L02 cells, the QDs caused cytotoxicity in a dose dependent manner. The QDs were then shown to activate the NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in hepatocytes, leading to a novel pro-inflammatory form of cell death named pyroptosis. Further experiments demonstrated that the QDs induced mitochondria( reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, and that both a mtROS and a total ROS scavenger attenuated QDs-induced NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis. In addition, QDs increased cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+) levels, while a Ca2+ release antagonist and chelator alleviated QDs-induced mtROS, NLRP3 activation and subsequent pyroptosis in hepatocytes. In vivo, QDs administration induced liver inflammation and dysfunction. Moreover, the QDs also resulted in NLRP3 activation in liver tissue. However, QDs-induced liver inflammation and dysfunction were abolished in NLRP3 knockout mice. Also, an elevation in mtROS was observed in liver after QDs administration, and the mtROS scavenger suppressed liver NLRP3 activation, inflammation and dysfunction induced by QDs. Our data suggest that QDs induced hepatocyte pyroptosis, liver inflammation and dysfunction via NLRP3 activation, which was caused by QDs-triggered mtROS production and Ca2+ mobilization. Our results provide novel insights into QDs-induced hepatotoxicity and the underlying mechanism, facilitating control of the side effects of QDs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exosomes, entities carrying microRNAs (miRNAs) to target locations, participate in the cross-talk between myeloma cells and nonmalignant components of the in vivo environment. This study disclosed the emerging roles of circulating exosome-associated miRNAs in drug resistance (DR) of MM. To this end, the medical records of consecutively hospitalized MM patients, who received novel agents-based therapies, were analyzed. Then, an optimized procedure was established for exosome isolation and exosomal RNA analysis. The exosome-associated miRNA expression patterns for predicting bortezomib (Bz) resistance of MM were further examined using a microarray. In total, 204 patients were enrolled with DR rates of 36.5%, 73.1% and 81.8% in the bortezomib (Bz), thalidomide and lenalidomide containing groups. The serum total light chain ratio >= 100, CRP >= 20 mg/L, and the second-line usage increased risks of acquired Bz-resistance. Among 68 cases having genetic tests, a high risk factor for predicting de novo DR was 1q21 amplification, which also correlated with lower levels of cholesterol and LDL-C. Moreover, nano-sized exosomes were isolated with significantly increasing internal RNAs and down-regulation of exosomal miR-16-5p, miR-15a-5p and miR-20a-5p, miR-17-5p was revealed in the patients resistant to Bz. The routine workup of MM hardly suggested a value for DR prediction. The circulating exosomes carrying miRNAs provided a window that permits a better understanding of the in vivo intercellular crosstalk in MM patients.

In this study, SPIO nanoparticles were stabilized with amphiphilic low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) in an aqueous phase to form monodispersed nanocomposites with a controlled clustering structure. The iron-based nanoclusters with a size of 115.3 +/- 40.23 nm showed excellent performance on cellular uptake and cell labeling in different types of cells, moreover, which could be tracked by MRI with high sensitivity. The SPIO nanoclusters presented negligible cytotoxicity in various types of cells as detected using MTS, LDH, and flow cytometry assays. Significantly, we found that ferritin protein played an essential role in protecting stress from SPIO nanoclusters. Taken together, the self-assembly of SPIO nanoclusters with good magnetic properties provides a safe and efficient method for universal cell labeling with noninvasive MRI monitoring capability.

Methods Fifty-six patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and 23 healthy control individuals were enrolled in this study and underwent upper abdominal T-2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. T-2* values of the left lateral lobe (LLL), left medial lobe (LML), right lobe (RL) and caudate lobe (CL) were measured on T-2*-weighted imaging. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the association between liver lobe based T-2* values and the presence and Child-Pugh class of cirrhosis. Results The T-2* values of the LLL, LML and RL decreased with the progression of cirrhosis from Child-Pugh class A to C (r = -0.231, -0.223, and -0.395, respectively; all P < 0.05), except that of the CL (r = -0.181, P > 0.05). To a certain extent, Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction for multigroup comparisons showed that the T2* values of the LLL, LML and RL could distinguish cirrhotic liver from healthy liver (all P < 0.05), whereas the T-2* values of the CL could not (P > 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that the T-2* value of the RL could best distinguish cirrhosis from healthy liver, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.713 among T-2* values of the liver lobes, and that only the T-2* value of the RL could distinguish Child-Pugh class C from A-B, with an AUC of 0.697 (all P < 0.05). Conclusion The T-2* value of the RL can be associated with the presence and Child-Pugh class of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis.

However, the underlying mechanism of RIPC remains elusive. To address whether RIPC protects against brain damage by regulating TLR4 and the NF-kappa B pathway, focal I/R rat (SD) model induced by 1h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was used in this study. RIPC treatment was generated by three cycles of 10min occlusion and 10min release of the bilateral hind femoral arteries. The Garcia JH score was used to evaluate neurobehavioral function and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to estimate the infarct size of the brain. The expression levels of TLR4 and NF-kappa B were determined by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that RIPC treatment significantly improved neurological deficits and decreased infarct volume. Furthermore, it also inhibited the overexpression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion. Thus, we suggested that RIPC might protect ischemic brain against I/R injury in rats by suppressing the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

This study investigated whether ELS contributes to differences in regional brain activity between MDD patients and healthy controls (HC), as measured by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)/fractional (f)ALFF. Eighteen first-episode, treatment-naive MDD patients and HC were assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compared ALFF/fALFF between MDD patients and HC, with or without controlling for ELS, and determined whether ELS level was correlated with regional brain activity in each group. After regressing out ELS, we found that ALFF increased in bilateral amygdala and left orbital/cerebellum, while fALFF decreased in left inferior temporal and right middle frontal gyri in MDD patients relative to controls. ELS positively correlated with regional activity in the left cerebellum in MDD and in the right post-central/inferior temporal/superior frontal cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral cerebellum in HC. Our findings indicate that there is only very limited region showing correlation between ELS and brain activity in MDD, while diverse areas in HC, suggesting ELS has few impacts on MDD patients.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether the status of the false lumen was a predictor of poor long-term survival in AAD. Methods and Results-Eleven cohort studies (2924 participants) exploring the association between the false lumen status and long-term outcomes (>1 year) in AAD were included. All studies reported multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for long-term outcomes, according to false lumen status. Pooled HRs for mortality and aortic events were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. Residual patent false lumen was an independent predictor of long-term mortality in AAD type A (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16-2.52; P=0.007) and type B (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.80-4.32; P<0.001). AAD patients with residual patent false lumen exhibited an increased risk of aortic events (HR, 5.43; 95% CI, 2.95-9.99; P<0.001). Partial false lumen thrombosis was independently associated with long-term mortality in type B AAD (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.37-3.65; P=0.001). This association was not observed in AAD type A patients (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.88-3.45; P=0.211). Conclusions-The false lumen status influences late outcomes in AAD. Residual patent false lumen is independently associated with poor long-term survival in AAD. However, only type B AAD patients with partial false lumen thrombosis had an increased late mortality risk.

However, it remains a challenge to modify the capillary network in the decompensated heart. A mechanical stress model was used in this study to mimic the hemo-dynamic and hormonal states of the decompensated heart in vitro. The angiogenesis role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) under stress has been well-recognized in vascular repair. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of EPCs in this model. We found that expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in EPCs was significantly decreased by mechanical stress, and this effect was accompanied by a decrease in angiogenesis in vitro. Interestingly, the defective angiogenesis can be reversed by upregulating the membrane VEGF receptor (VEGFR) endocytosis. An atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) inhibitor can promote the VEGFR internalisation in EPCs and enhance the formation of vascular networks. Thus, the upregulation of VEGFR endocytosis in EPCs could be a potential therapy for the cell-based treatment of chronic heart failure by enhancing the cardiomyocytes.

This study aimed to investigate XPF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and protein levels in plasma and to analyze the 30028T/C polymorphism (rs1799801) in ischemic stroke patients and controls. Levels of both mRNA and protein in ischemic stroke patients were significantly lower than in controls (P < 0.05). The C allele of the 30028T/C polymorphism significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke (OR = 1.512, 95 % CI = 1.219-1.875). The CT and CC/CT genotypes of 30028T/C were observed significantly more frequently in ischemic stroke patients than in controls (CT: OR = 1.916, 95 % CI = 1.446-2.539; CC/CT: OR = 1.877, 95 % CI = 1.427-2.468). Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status. Additionally, XPF plasma protein levels were significantly decreased in the CC/CT genotype compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.025). These data indicate that XPF might play an important role in the pathophysiological process of ischemic stroke, and the 30028T/C polymorphism might be associated with ischemic stroke susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.

As such, the delivery of the PTEN gene represents a powerful strategy for ESCC therapy. The tegument protein VP22 of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been reported to act as a transporter of heterologous proteins across the host cell membrane, thereby enhancing the biological functions of these proteins. In the present study, the intercellular delivery and antitumor activity of the fusion protein PTEN-VP22 were examined in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line Eca109 both in vitro and in vivo. VP22-mediated PTEN intercellular delivery was confirmed in the Eca109 cells by western blot analysis and by quantitation of immunofluorescence. VP22 alone did not exert antiproliferative effects or induce cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, blockage of the Akt and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathways, tumor growth inhibition, or antiangiogenic effects in Eca109 cells. However, compared with PTEN alone, PTEN-VP22 exerted significantly higher antiproliferative effects and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 stage, apoptosis and antiangiogenic effects in Eca109 cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that VP22 alone does not exert antitumor activity directly; however, this protein mediates the intercellular delivery of PTEN and thereby increases its intracellular concentration to achieve a therapeutic steady state, leading to an overall increase in the antitumor activity of PTEN. This study provides further experimental data to confirm the potential of VP22-based intercellular delivery strategies for enhancing the efficacy of gene therapy for cancer treatment.

The mechanisms of epilepsy are still not fully understood. Dock3 (dedicator of cytokinesis 3) is one of the new kinds of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and plays an important role in neuronal synaptic plasticity and cytoskeleton rearrangement; the same mechanisms were also found in epilepsy. However, little is known regarding the expression of Dock3 in the epileptic brain and whether Dock3 interventions affect the epileptic process. In this study, we showed that the expression of Dock3 significantly increased in IE patients and a lithium-pilocarpine epilepsy model compared with the controls. Inhibition of Dock3 by Dock3 shRNA impaired the severity of status epilepticus in the acute stage and decreased the spontaneous recurrent seizures times in the chronic stage of lithium-pilocarpine model and decreased the expression of rac1-GTP. Consistent with decreased expression of Dock3, the latent period in a pentylenetetrazole kindling model also increased. Our results demonstrated that the increased expression of Dock3 in the brain is associated with epileptogenesis and specific inhibition of Dock3 may be a potential target in preventing the development of epilepsy in patients.

Methods: We searched the published literature in the Medline and Scopus from inception to May 2015. A meta-analysis was performed by the programs RevMan 5.1 and Stata 12.0, and the Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in fixed or random effect model based on heterogeneity test among studies. Results: Nineteen studies with a total of 10,676 subjects were included in the present meta-analysis. A statistical significant association was observed between AMD risk and CFH -543G > A polymorphism with OR of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.47-2.12), 2.24 (95% CI, 1.71-2.94), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.38-0.62) and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.18-0.37) in additive, dominant, recessive and codominant models, respectively. Similar results were obtained in polymorphisms A473A, -257C > T, IVS15. Furthermore, stratified analysis for ethnicity showed a significantly strong association between -543G > A, A473A polymorphisms and AMD risk. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis suggested that CFH -543G > A, A473A, -257C > T, and IVS15 polymorphisms might be moderately associated with AMD risk. This conclusion warrants confirmation by further studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Naturally occurring CPPs, such as the tegument protein VP22 of the Herpes simplex virus type 1, can potentiate protein-drug delivery into living cells. The aim of the present study was to construct anti-VP22 antibodies that can be used to detect VP22-fusion drugs. Therefore, 60- and 45-amino acid peptides corresponding to the N-terminus and C-terminus of VP22, respectively, were cloned, expressed and purified. Subsequently, polyclonal antisera against them were generated. The DNA sequence, cloned into the pGEX-5X-1 vector, was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). After inducing expression with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25 degrees C for 4 h, the recombinant VP22 proteins were purified by electroelution. The high titers of polyclonal antisera obtained subsequent to immunization of mice with the purified recombinant truncated VP22 was confirmed by ELISA. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that the antisera detected both the truncated and full-length VP22 protein. Therefore, the polyclonal antisera against VP22 may be used in the detection of the intracellular location of VP22-fusion protein drugs.

To investigate prostate cancer susceptibility in the under-investigated Chinese population, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on a cohort of Chinese cases and controls and then meta-analysis with data from the existing Chinese prostate cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genotyping 211,155 SNPs in 495 cases and 640 controls of Chinese ancestry identified several new suggestive Chinese prostate cancer predisposition loci. However, none of them reached genome-wide significance level either by meta-analysis or replication study. The meta-analysis with the Chinese GWAS data revealed that four 8q24 loci are the main contributors to Chinese prostate cancer risk and the risk alleles from three of them exist at much higher frequencies in Chinese than European populations. We also found that several predisposition loci reported in Western populations have different effect on Chinese men. Therefore, this first extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism study of Chinese prostate cancer in comparison with European population indicates that four loci on 8q24 contribute to a great risk of prostate cancer in a considerable large proportion of Chinese men. Based on those four loci, the top 10% of the population have six-or two-fold prostate cancer risk compared with men of the bottom 10% or median risk respectively, which may facilitate the design of prostate cancer genetic risk screening and prevention in Chinese men. These findings also provide additional insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

The aim of this study was to clarify the feasibility of first-pass perfusion imaging using 3 T cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for evaluating the difference in left ventricular (LV) regional myocardial microvascular function among normal subjects and in patients with AL-CA. The amyloidosis patients were classified into those with impaired systolic function [LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50 %] and those with preserved systolic function. Methods: In total, 32 patients with biopsy-proven AL-CA, including 11 AL-CA patients with systolic dysfunction, 21 AL-CA patients with preserved systolic function, and 25 healthy subjects, underwent CMR examination. LV regional myocardial perfusion parameters included upslope, time to maximum signal intensity (TTM) and max signal intensity (MaxSI) were compared among the three patient groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine whether perfusion parameters could be used in discriminating regional myocardial microvascularity between AL-CA patients and normal subjects. Results: The patients with AL-CA had significantly reduced first-pass perfusion upslope and MaxSI, and increased TTM compared with the normal subjects (all P < 0.01). Compared with the patients with AL-CA and preserved LVEF, the patients with AL-CA and impaired systolic function had a longer TTM in the basal (47.05 +/- 16.59 vs. 39.68 +/- 19.11; P = 0.002) and mid-ventricular (44.61 +/- 16.34 vs. 37.74 +/- 18.25; P = 0.002) segments; lower upslope in the basal (2.41 +/- 1.32 vs. 3.60 +/- 1.68; P < 0.0001), mid-ventricular (2.82 +/- 1.34 vs. 4.15 +/- 2.02; P < 0.0001), and apical (3.71 +/- 1.38 vs. 4.97 +/- 2.55; P = 0.004) segments; and lower MaxSI (31.67 +/- 15.23 vs. 37.96 +/- 11.15; P < 0.0001) in the basal segment. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the first-pass upslope, TTM, and MaxSI may be used as indicators for differentiating microcirculation between AL-CA patients with preserved or impaired systolic function and normal subjects. Conclusions: The differences in LV regional myocardial microvascular function among normal subjects, AL-CA patients with systolic dysfunction, and AL-CA patients with preserved systolic function can be monitored using first-pass perfusion CMR.

However, little is known about the roles of MicroRNA-199 and HIF-1 in the human epileptogenic process.Design and methods: In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-199a-5p, miR-199b-5p and HIF-1 using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blots in the temporal neocortex of twenty four patients with intractable epilepsy and twelve control subjects.Results: Compared with the control group, the expression of miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p was significantly lower in epileptic brain tissues (p < 0.05). The levels of HIF-1 mRNA and protein were highly up-regulated in epileptic brain tissues compared with those of control subjects (p < 0.05).Conclusion: These data suggest that the abnormal expression of miR-199 and HIF-1 in epileptic brain tissue may be involved in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy and that the expression of HIF-1 may be regulated by miR-199. These findings may provide new insights into the treatment of epilepsy.

This retrospective study included 150 patients who received radical resection of PSCCE. Data were retrieved from 4 centers in Western China. Thirty-nine of 150 patients received postoperative chemo-radiotherapy, 62 received postoperative chemotherapy, and 49 received radical resection only. The median radiation dosage was 50 Gy. The chemotherapeutic regimen was platinum-based and lasted for 2 to 6 cycles (median, 3). Median disease-free survival (mDFS) and overall survival (mOS) were 12.0 and 18.3 months, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that postoperative therapy did not improve survival in limited stage I (LSI) disease, whereas postoperative chemotherapy improved survival in limited stage II (LSII) disease. Relative to chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy did not improve survival in patients with completely resected LSII disease. A multivariate analysis indicated an association of no postoperative chemotherapy with shorter DFS (P = 0.050) and OS (P = 0.010). Higher lymph node stage and length of disease longer than 3 cm were poor prognostic factors for both DFS and OS. Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in PSCCE patients with completely resected LSII disease. Adjuvant treatment with postoperative chemotherapy alone or postoperative chemo-radiotherapy does not increase survival in completely resected LSI disease.

We compare the occurrence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism between CT and TT for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), and explore the predictive factors for postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 221 consecutive patients underwent CT or TT for DTC between February 2012 and March 2014. Patients' demographic and clinical data of the two groups were analyzed. Results: There were 57 CTs and 164 TTs. Temporary hypoparathyroidism occurred in 12.3% (7 of 57) and 28.0% (46 of 164) of patients in the CT and TT groups, respectively. In univariate analysis, type of surgical procedure (CT or TT) and extent of central lymph node dissection (CND) (unilateral or bilateral) were significantly associated with the postoperative temporary hypoparathyroidism (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that only the extent of CND was an independent risk factor for temporary hypoparathyroidism. Conclusions: Although temporary hypoparathyroidism was lower in the CT group, our analysis indicates the difference is due to the extent of CND rather than type of surgical procedure (CT vs. TT). Only bilateral CND is an independent risk factor for temporary hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Accordingly, targeting killing the lung CSCs has been suggested to be an effective approach for lung cancer treatment. In this study, we showed that rapamycin inhibited the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction in A549 cells and improved the sensitivity to cisplatin (DDP). The mechanisms involve inhibition of the SOX2 expression, cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, and sphere formation. Interestingly, knocked down SOX2 was a similar effect with rapamycin in A549 sphere. Furthermore, we showed that ectopic expression of Sox2 in A549 cells was sufficient to render them more resistant to rapamycin treatment in vitro. These data suggested that rapamycin inhibited the function of lung CSCs via SOX2. It will be of great interest to further explore the therapeutic strategies of lung cancer.

The current study aimed to identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferase(s) (SULT(s)) that is(are) capable of sulfating doxorubicin and its analog epirubicin, and to verify whether sulfation of doxorubicin and epirubicin may occur under metabolic conditions. A systematic analysis of thirteen known human SULTs, previously cloned, expressed, and purified, revealed SULT1C4 as the only human SULT capable of sulfating doxorubicin and epirubicin. Cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells were labeled with [S-35] sulfate in the presence of different concentrations of doxorubicin or epirubicin. Analysis of spent labeling media showed the generation and release of [S-35] sulfated doxorubicin and epirubicin by HepG2 cells and Caco-2 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed the expression of SULT1C4 in both HepG2 cells and Caco-2 cells. These results provided a molecular basis underlying the previous finding that sulfate-conjugated doxorubicin was excreted in the urine of patients treated with doxorubicin.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that Cd impairs the cardiovascular system by targeting vascular endothelial cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we observed that Cd treatment led to cell death and the generation of inflammatory cytokines. The Cd-induced cell death was identified as pyroptosis, a novel pro-inflammatory form of cell death depending on caspase-1 activation. In addition, exposure of HUVECs to Cd resulted in NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by cleavage of caspase-1 and downstream interleukin (IL)-1 beta production. Moreover, knockdown of NLRP3 by small interfering RNA efficiently suppressed Cd-induced caspase-1 cleavage, IL-1 beta production and pyroptosis in HUVECs. Additional experiments demonstrated that treatment with Cd significantly increased the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and intracellular ROS in HUVECs. Accordingly, pre-treatment with mtROS scavenger or total ROS scavenger reduced Cd-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptotic cell death. Taken together, our data suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome, activated by the generation of mtROS, mediates Cd-induced pyroptosis in HUVECs. Our results provide novel insights into Cd-induced cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanism by which Cd induces endothelial injury. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, few systematic reviews and meta-analyses have assessed their effects in the newest studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the role of gemcitabine and pemetrexed in the maintenance treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Methods We performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases from their inceptions to September 16, 2015. We also searched the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) databases from 2008 to 2015. Two authors independently extracted the data. The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias graph was used to assess the risk of bias. The GRADE system was used to assess the grading of evidence, and a meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 11.0 software. Results Eleven randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies were collected. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis and divided into the following 4 groups: gemcitabine vs. best supportive care (BSC)/observation, pemetrexed vs. BSC/placebo, pemetrexed + bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab and pemetrexed vs. bevacizumab. Gemcitabine exhibited significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with BSC (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.62, p = 0.000). Pemetrexed exhibited significantly improved PFS (HR = 0.54, p = 0.000) and OS (HR = 0.75, p = 0.000) compared with BSC. Pemetrexed + bevacizumab almost exhibited significantly improved PFS (HR = 0.71, p = 0.051) compared with bevacizumab. Pemetrexed exhibited no improvement in PFS or overall survival (OS) compared with bevacizumab. Regarding the grade, the GRADE system indicated that the gemcitabine group was "MODERATE", the pemetrexed group was "HIGH", and both the pemetrexed + bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab groups and pemetrexed vs. B groups were "LOW". Conclusions Gemcitabine or pemetrexed compared with BSC/observation/placebo significantly improved PFS or OS. Whether pemetrexed + bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab alone significantly improves PFS requires further investigation.

Aims: To investigate the temporal profile of mental fatigue during the first year after MTBI and examine the impact of perceived social support on the recovery from post-MTBI fatigue. Study Design: Observational case-control study. Methods: This study was conducted among post-MTBI patients admitted to the emergency department in a tertiary-care hospital in Sichuan, China. During four waves of assessments at 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months, mental fatigue was assessed through Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS) whereas social support was assessed by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results: There were 65.1%, 37.1%, 34.8% and 32.5% individuals being identified as those with mental fatigue at 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. The scores of MFS didn't change substantially since 3 months post-injury. Compared to non-fatigued MTBI patients, those with long-lasting post-MTBI fatigue reported extremely lower level of perceived social support. Moreover, improved social support at 1 week was negatively associated with the occurrence of long-lasting fatigue. Conclusion: Sufficient social support could significantly decrease the occurrence of long-lasting mental fatigue among MTBI cases. It seemed of great importance to modify the emphasis of rehabilitation to include assessment and improvement of perceived social support at earlier stages after injury.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) attenuates hepatectomy induced cognitive deficits and also protects against cognitive dysfunction induced by neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we aim to determine whether sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H2S donor, could alleviate hepatic I/R-induced cognitive impairment and the underlying mechanisms. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with NaHS (5 mg/kg/d) for 11 days. A segmental hepatic I/R model was established on the fourth day. Cognitive function, proinflammatory cytokines levels, and hippocampal ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) expression was analyzed. We found hepatic I/R increased proinflammatory cytokines levels in serum and hippocampus, up-regulated Iba1 expression, leading to cognitive impairment in rats. However, treatment with NaHS alleviated hepatic I/R induced these neuroinflammatory changes and effectively improved cognitive function. Thus, NaHS appears to protect against cognitive impairment in rats undergoing hepatic I/R by attenuating neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.

Association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin-27 gene and increased cryptorchidism risk	ANDROLOGIA			English	Article						cryptorchidism; cytokine; IL-27; polymorphism; susceptibility	TESTICULAR DESCENT; IL-27; TESTIS; CELLS	Growing evidences have suggested the association between interleukin-27 and cryptorchidism. We aimed to investigate the relationship between IL-27 polymorphisms and cryptorchidism susceptibility. A total of 519 males were enrolled in a case-control study (150 cases and 369 normal subjects). The variants were discriminated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. The proportions of the major allele for rs153109 and rs17855750 were A and T with frequencies of 0.56 and 0.85 in cases and 0.51 and 0.91 in controls respectively (P values=0.002, P value=0.002). The heterozygous genotype of rs153109 and 17855750 was A/G and T/G with frequencies of 0.62 and 0.25 in cases and 0.39 and 0.17 in controls respectively (P values <0.001, P values <0.001). The A allele and A/G genotype of rs153109 polymorphisms contribute to increase cryptorchidism susceptibility, and G allele and T/G genotype of rs17855750 also contribute to increase cryptorchidism susceptibility, which implies that these allele and genotypes may be risk factors for the development of cryptorchidism.

The current study was designed to systematically identify the major human cytosolic sulfotransferase enzyme(s) capable of mediating the sulfation of 6-gingerol. Of the 13 known human cytosolic sulfotransferases examined, six (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1C4, SULT1E1) displayed significant sulfating activity toward 6-gingerol. Kinetic parameters of SULT1A1, SULT1A3, SULT1C4, and SULT1E1 that showed stronger 6-gingerol-sulfating activity were determined. Of the four human organ samples tested, small intestine and liver cytosols dis-played considerably higher 6-gingerol-sulfating activity than those of the lung and kidney. Moreover, sulfation of 6-gingerol was shown to occur in HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells under the metabolic setting. Collectively, these results provided useful information relevant to the metabolism of 6-gingerol through sulfation both in vitro and in vivo.

Methods: We studied two groups of patients with stenosis attribute to inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Group A had placed self-expanding metal stent alone insertion; group B encountered radioactive stent embedded with I-125 seeds. Patients were followed up by monthly home visits or telephone interview. Survival time was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Log rank test was used to analyze factors of survival time for all significant differences. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups of all baseline characteristics. There was no statistical difference in complications including massive hematemesis, pain more than 1 month, stent migration, and restenosis. Survival time and causes of death such as tumor metastasis, massive hemorrhage, non-tumor-related factors, and restenosis were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). The medical costs were significantly less in group A than those in group B (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Radioactive stent embedded with I-125 seeds was not significant in improving survival rate, but showed to increase hospitalization costs compared to self-expandable metal stent alone in treating inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma stricture.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal disease and carotid atherosclerosis. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for relevant observational studies up to February 20, 2015. Two authors independently extracted data from included studies, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for overall and subgroup meta-analyses. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by the chi-squared test (P < 0.1 for statistical significance) and quantified by the I-2 statistic. Data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Results: Fifteen observational studies involving 17,330 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled result showed that periodontal disease was associated with carotid atherosclerosis (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.14-1.41; P < 0.001) but statistical heterogeneity was substantial (I-2 = 78.90%). Subgroup analysis of adjusted smoking and diabetes mellitus showed borderline significance (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.18; P = 0.05). Sensitivity and cumulative analyses both indicated that our results were robust. Conclusions: Findings of ourmeta-analysis indicated that the presence of periodontal disease was associated with carotid atherosclerosis; however, further large-scale, well-conducted clinical studies are needed to explore the precise risk of developing carotid atherosclerosis in patients with periodontal disease.

The meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk in A vs. G (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.04-1.44), AA vs. GG (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.11-3.87), and AA vs. AG+GG genetic models (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.13-3.86); however, the non-significantly increased risk was shown in AG vs. GG (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.85-1.32) and AA+AG vs. GG genetic models (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.85-1.31). Cumulative analysis showed that the association changed from non-significant to significant with new studies accumulated and the CIs became more and more narrow, sensitivity analysis indicated results were statistically robust. Stratified analyses of confirmed of HWE, Asians, Caucasians, and population-based controls obtained results similar to that of overall analysis. There was no evidence of publication bias. In summary, current evidence demonstrates that TNF-a G-308A polymorphism might be associated with AgP susceptibility, especially in Asians and Caucasians.

However, imperfect mechanical behavior is the main drawback of the nHA/PA66 composite, and this is a limitation for further applications. Meanwhile, zirconia has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, owing to its excellent mechanical behavior and biocompatibility. A novel ternary biomaterial composed of nHA/PA66/yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (YTZ) was prepared in the present research. The material was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry; mechanical behavior was also tested. The results of the mechanical-behavior testing showed that the mechanical behaviors of nHA/PA66/YTZ were significantly better than those of nHA/PA66. Besides, the cross-section of this biocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and bioactivity were evaluated in vitro using MC3T3-E1 cells. From the results of the biocompatibility and bioactivity experiments (cell counting kit-8 tests, cell immunofluorescence analysis, alizarin red S staining and western blotting), it was observed that nHA/PA66/YTZ could facilitate the biological function of MC3T3-E1 cells. The results showed that the attachment, proliferation, spreading, calcium nodule formation, and expression of osteogenic-related proteins (collagen 1, osteopontin, osteocalcin) of cells cultured with the nHA/PA66/YTZ composite were better than for control groups. The ternary biomaterial has promising mechanical properties, biocompatibility and bioactivity. Thus, it deserves more attention and is worthy of further research.

Methods: A total of 303 patients were enrolled in this study. The patients with > 50% stenosis in one or more coronary arteries by angiography were included in the case group (150), while others with < 10% stenosis in any coronary artery were included in the control group (153). The target genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected by improved Multiplex Ligation Detection Reaction (iMLDR). Stata 12.0 was used for data analyses. Results: Differences in genotype and allele frequency distributions of GPIaC807T were statistically significant (genotype: P=0.036, allele: P=0.017) as compared to the control group. For GPVIT13254/C, the differences in allele frequency distributions between the two groups were statistically significant (P=0.004), but not the genotype distributions (P=0.059). The genotype and allele frequency distributions of GPIbaKOZAK-5T/C, HPA-1a/b and HPA-2a/b were comparable in the two groups. Polymorphisms of GPIaC807T had the greatest influence on CHD in the additive model (OR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.18-6.71), followed by the recessive model (OR=2.48, 95% CI: 1.11-5.83) and the allele model (OR=1.52, 95% CI: 1.06-2.17). Polymorphisms of GPIbaKOZAK-5T/C were not associated with the risk of CHD in all gene analysis models. The numbers of mutant alleles were associated with coronary lesions (OR=1.36, P=0.008, 95% CI: 1.082-1.707). Logistic analysis showed that TT genotype of GPIaC807T had higher risk of CHD than CC genotype (OR=4.00, P=0.020, 95% CI: 1.24-12.88) after adjusting for gender, smoking, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG) and fibrinogen (Fib). Conclusion: Polymorphisms of GPIaC807T were significantly correlated with the risk of CHD in China, and the TT genotype was independently associated with CHD. The C allele of GPVIT13254/C may increase the risk of CHD. The numbers of mutant alleles were positively correlated with the risk of CHD. However, polymorphisms of GPIbaKOZAK-5T/C, HPA-1a/b and HPA-2a/b were not associated with CHD.

Methods: The cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rat model was established by clipping common carotid artery. HE staining was applied to observe the morphological changes of cerebral cortex cells in rats. qRT-PCR was applied to detect the changes of NOS2 mRNA and miRNA-185 expressions in rat cerebral cortex tissue specimens and blood samples. Immunohistochemical staining, Western blot and ELISA were also applied to detect the changes of NOS protein in these two specimens. Results: Compared with those in sham operation group, obvious pathological changes in cerebral cortex cells were shown by HE staining. The expression of NOS2 mRNA and protein in cerebral cortex and blood were significantly up-regulated. The expression of miRNA-185 was down-regulated in model group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The expression levels of NOS mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated in cerebral cortex tissues and blood in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats, and these up-regulations may be related to the down-regulation of miRNA-185 expression. Our findings suggest that miRNA-185 may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury through the regulation of NOS2.

The present study was conducted to describe the level of perceived social support and to identify its predictors among Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors during the first year post operation. Methods: Newly diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer aged 18 and above who were admitted for curative surgery in a tertiary care hospital between January 2012 and July 2014 were consecutively recruited. This cohort study included five assessment waves over the first year post surgery (at baseline, 4-6 weeks, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months follow-up) regarding social support level among 189 CRC survivors. ANOVA and linear mixed models were applied to determine the change in social support and its predictors using SPSS version 18.0. Results: Social support level remained relatively stable and high in the first three months post surgery, but decreased significantly at 6 months and then remained low afterwards, displaying an overall decreasing trend over time.

Conclusions: These findings suggested that the future intervention programs should commence at the early stage after surgery, despite the fact that it was high before this time point.

Methods: One hundred and ninety-six newly diagnosed patients with SLE (all-SLE), including 105 non-anemic patients (na-SLE) and 91 patients with anemia (a-SLE) were prospectively studied. Baseline RDW of SLE patients was compared with that of control subjects. Correlations between RDW and disease activity, traditional laboratory parameters, clinical features, therapeutic outcomes, and disease flare were examined. Results: RDW was exclusively higher in all-SLE, na-SLE, a-SLE than in controls (p < 0.001), but no significant difference of RDW was found between na-SLE and a-SLE (p = 0.27). More active disease scored with SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was present in patients with elevated RDW (> 15%) than normal RDW (= 11 - 15%) irrespective of anemia status (p < 0.001), and positive correlation between RDW with SLEDAI-2K was also disclosed independent of anemia status (r = 0.576, 0.614, 0.542, respectively for all-, na- and a-SLE, all with p < 0.001). Additionally, RDW positively correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in all-SLE (r = 0.352, p < 0.001), na-SLE (r = 0.430, p < 0.001), and a-SLE (r = 0.315, p = 0.002). Among all clinical features, only the incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was likely to be higher in elevated-RDW SLE than in normal-RDW SLE (chi(2) = 4.135, p < 0.05). Patients received stratified therapy of remission induction based on their disease activity. A significantly higher rate of response (complete and partial response) was observed in normal-RDW than in elevated-RDW patients (all-SLE: 92.2% vs. 74.1%, p = 0.001; na-SLE: 92.3% vs. 77.5%, p = 0.04; a-SLE: 92% vs. 70.7%, p = 0.012). During a 12-month follow-up of the 166 responders, significantly greater flare-free survival was observed in normal-RDW than in elevated-RDW patients (68.8% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.002; 53.6% vs. 28.1%, p = 0.027; 55.9% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.032, respectively, for all-, na- and a-SLE). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that baseline RDW is an easily available parameter not only capable of reflecting SLE overall activity, but also predicting therapeutic outcomes and the risk of disease flare irrespective of anemia status.

This metaanalysis aimed to investigate the associations of the rs2854116 and rs2854117 polymorphisms and their interaction with fasting APOC3 and lipid levels. The following information was extracted from each study: age, gender, ethnicity, health condition, sample size, genotypes, lipid assay methods, mean and standard deviation or standard error of plasma APOC3 and lipids by genotypes. There were 23 eligible studies with 17493 subjects included in this meta-analysis. A dominant model was used for this meta-analysis. The carriers of the rs2854116 variant allele (C) had higher levels of APOC3 [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01-0.15, P = 0.024] and triglycerides (TG) (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.09-0.51, P = 0.004), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.31--0.02, P = 0.028) than the non-carriers. The carriers of the rs2854117 variant allele (T) had higher levels of TG (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.00-0.48, P = 0.047) than the non-carriers. No significant differences in plasma lipid levels between the wild-type homozygotes (rs2854116 TT and rs2854117 CC) and the carriers of one or more variant alleles (rs2854116 C and rs2854117 T) were detected under the dominant model. The rs2854116 polymorphism is significantly associated with higher levels of APOC3 and TG, and lower levels of HDL-C. The rs2854117 polymorphism is marginally significantly associated with higher levels of TG. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Nuclear magnetic resonance-based study reveals the metabolomics profile of nasopharyngeal carcinoma	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Metabolomics; NMR spectroscopy	NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; CANCER; METABOLISM; GENERATION; DISEASE; H-1	Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ([H-1]-NMR) spectroscopy has been used to investigate metabolites in serum and several types of tissue. We used NMR spectroscopy to explore the differential metabolic profiles in serum from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Moreover, metabolites with potential as biomarkers for identifying NPC patients were primarily identified. Serum samples were collected from 40 enrolled participants comprising 20 healthy subjects and 20 NPC patients. Samples were analyzed using a 600-MHz NMR spectrometer. The [H-1]-NMR spectra were further analyzed with partial least squares-discriminant analysis for screening differential metabolites. NMR spectroscopy identified a total of eight metabolites that were present at different levels when the sera of NPC patients were compared with those of healthy individuals. Methionine, taurine (P < 0.05), and choline-like metabolites (P < 0.05) were mostly elevated in the sera of NPC patients. In contrast, the levels of lipids (P < 0.01), isoleucine (P < 0.05), unsaturated lipids (P < 0.01), trimethylamine oxidase (P < 0.05), and carbohydrates (P < 0.05) were lower in the sera of the NPC patients than in the healthy controls. We explored the differential metabolic profiles in sera from NPC patients. [H-1]-NMR spectroscopy can be used to identify specific metabolites, and is capable of distinguishing between NPC patients and healthy individuals.	[Wang, Y.; Zhang, G. H.; Li, S.

These were randomly divided into control, OGD, bpV+OGD, As+OGD, Se+OGD and Mock treatment groups. The neuron viability was assessed by MTT, the cell apoptosis was detected using TUNEL staining. The expression of Phospho-PTEN/PTEN, Phospho-Tau/Tau, Phospho-Akt/Akt and Phospho-GSK-3/GSK-3 were detected by Western blotting.Results: OGD induced Tau phosphorylation through PTEN and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activation, together with a decrease in AKT activity. Pre-treatment with bpv, a potent PTEN inhibitor, and PTEN antisense nucleotides decreased PTEN and GSK-3 activity and caused alterations in Tau phosphorylation. Neuronal apoptosis was also reduced.Conclusions: The PTEN/Akt/GSK-3/Tau pathway is involved in the regulation of neuronal injury, providing a novel route for protecting neurons following neonatal HI.

Plenty of studies reported that Qiliqiangxin (QL), a traditional Chinese medicine, had therapeutic efficacy in chronic heart failure, but the underlying mechanism was not clear. Here we investigated whether QL prevented hypoxia-induced cardiac myocytes apoptosis and the possible mechanism. Isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs) were transfected by Lentiviral-ErbB4-siRNA, treated by a specific PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), and subjected to hypoxia with or without QL. Cell apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotide transferased UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assay, respectively. ErbB4 mRNA level was detected by real-time PCR, protein expressions of ErbB4 and phosphorylated Akt were examined by Western blot. The results showed that hypoxia induced significant increase of apoptotic NRCMs, which was significantly attenuated by QL treatment. Further, QL induced the upregulation of ErbB4 and phosphorylation of Akt in hypoxic NRCMs. However, knocking down ErbB4 abolished these effects induced by QL. Furthermore, decrease of NRCMs apoptosis induced by QL was also abrogated by blocking PI3K/Akt signaling. Our data suggested that QL protected cardiac myocytes against hypoxia-induced apoptosis via regulating ErbB4-dependent PI3K/Akt pathway.

Materials and methods: Six hundred and seventy-nine patients with angiographically defined CHD were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Fasting lipids were measured, and the severity of CHD was quantitatively assessed for each patient according to the number of stenotic coronary branches and the Gensini scoring system. Results: The levels of Lp(a), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and apolipoprotein (apo) B100 increased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoAI decreased significantly with the number of stenotic vessels. The levels of Lp(a) increased and HDL-C and apoAI decreased significantly with the Gensini scores. The logistic regression analyses showed that Lp(a) and HDL-C were independently associated with the number of stenotic coronary vessels after adjusting for age, weight, body mass index, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, triglycerides, TC, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apoAI, and apoB100. However, only Lp(a) was independently associated with the Gensini scores after adjustment. Conclusion: Our data indicate that Lp(a) might be a useful marker in predicting the severity of coronary heart disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 202 consecutive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who had undergone gastrectomy 1 week after contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography were retrospectively identified. The gross tumor volume was evaluated on multidetector computed tomography images. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine whether the gross tumor volume could predict regional lymph node metastasis, and the Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the gross tumor volume among N categories. Additionally, a receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to identify the accuracy of the gross tumor volume in differentiating N categories. RESULTS: The gross tumor volume could predict regional lymph node metastasis (p<0.0001) in the univariate analysis, and the multivariate analyses indicated that the gross tumor volume was an independent risk factor for regional lymph node metastasis (p=0.005, odds ratio=1.364). The Mann-Whitney U test showed that the gross tumor volume could distinguish N0 from the N1-N3 categories, N0-N1 from N2-N3, and N0-N2 from N3 (all p<0.0001). In the T1-T4a categories, the gross tumor volume could differentiate N0 from the N1-N3 categories (cutoff, 12.3 cm(3)), N0-N1 from N2-N3 (cutoff, 16.6 cm(3)), and N0-N2 from N3 (cutoff, 24.6 cm(3)). In the T4a category, the gross tumor volume could differentiate N0 from the N1-N3 categories (cutoff, 15.8 cm(3)), N0-N1 from N2-N3 (cutoff, 17.8 cm(3)), and N0-N2 from N3 (cutoff, 24 cm(3)). CONCLUSION: The gross tumor volume of resectable gastric adenocarcinoma on multidetector computed tomography could predict regional lymph node metastasis and N categories.

A comprehensive understanding of cognitive dysfunction and its correlative factors in Chinese PD patients were not available. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 454 PD patients. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Non-motor symptoms were assessed using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), and depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, respectively. Results: Cognitive dysfunction was observed in 58.1% of the patients. The mean age, age of onset, scores of rigidity, bradykinesia, axial impairment, tremor, speech and facial expression, total Unified PD Rating Scale part III and H&Y stage, and NMSS scores were significantly higher in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction than in those without cognitive dysfunction. The prevalence of sleep/fatigue domain with the item 'difficulty falling asleep', mood/apathy domain with the item 'feelings of nervousness', perceptual problems/hallucinations domain with the item 'delusions', attention/memory domain with the items 'concentration' and 'forget to do things', gastrointestinal domain with the items 'dribbling saliva' and 'swallowing', urinary domain with the item 'nocturia', and the item 'taste or smell' in the miscellaneous domain were significantly higher in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction. Logistic regression indicated that female sex, older age, lower education level, higher bradykinesia score, and presence of the urinary domain were associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD. Conclusions: Age, sex, education level, bradykinesia score, and presence of urinary symptoms are correlative factors of cognitive dysfunction in Chinese PD patients.

A dose-response meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies was performed. Pertinent studies were identified by searching database and reference lists. Random-effects model was employed to pool the estimates of the relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 19 case-control and 6 cohort studies were included. Overall, compared with those who never smoked, the pooled RR and 95% CI was 0.98 (0.92-1.05) for ever smoker. The subgroups were not significantly different regarding risk of glioma except the group of age at start smoking (RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.93-1.48 for age < 20; RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.52 for age >= 20). Dose-response analysis also suggested no significant association between smoking and the risk of glioma, although some evidence for a linear relationship between smoking and glioma risk was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides little support for a causal relationship between smoking and risk of glioma.

We therefore performed a meta-analysis to clarify this issue. Materials and methods: An updated meta-analysis using PubMed and Web of Knowledge databases for the eligible case-control studies was performed. Random- or fixed-effects model was used. Results: A total of 10,067 cancer cases and 12,276 controls in 41 independent case-control studies from 19 articles were included in this meta-analysis. Significant increase in risk of breast cancer for Asians was found in GSTM1-null genotype (P=0.012, odds ratio [OR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.32) and GSTT1-null genotype (P=0.039, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.01-1.41). In addition, our results showed that the GSTP1 (rs1695) polymorphisms can significantly increase the risk among Caucasians (P=0.042, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.01-1.34). Sensitivity analysis and publication bias further confirmed the dependability of the results in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that both GSTM1-and GSTT1-null polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Asians and that GSTP1 Val105Ile (rs1695) polymorphism is associated with an increased breast cancer risk in Caucasians.

In this study, we measured serum levels of SOD, MDA, IL-17A, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and HADAS score in HADAS subjects at baseline and 50th and 100th days and to evaluate the relationship between interleukins, including IL-17A, and HADAS. Our data showed that and the serum IL-17A levels and HADAS score decreased over time in the HADAS group, and serum IL-17A levels were significantly higher in the HADAS group at baseline and 50th day compared with controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, baseline serum levels of MDA and TNF-alpha were significantly higher, while SOD and IL-10 levels were lower in HADAS subjects compared with controls (p < 0.05). It is interesting that serum levels of IL-17A were clearly interrelated with HADAS incidence and severity (p < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that combined serum IL-17A and IL-10 levels were a better predictor of HADAS incidence than serum levels of IL-17A or IL-10 alone. These data suggest that serum levels of IL-17A are a novel predictive index of HADAS.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) is one of promising stem cell sources for cell replacement therapy. Here, we modeled the BMSC implantation with co-culture systems in vitro to provide a basis for cell replacement therapy. Methods: The study includes two parts: First, basal membranes and BMSCs were isolated separately, and indirectly co-cultured in Transwell system. Second, GFP-BMSCs were added into basal membranes to perform direct co-culture. Results: BMSCs exhibited expression of tublin, a marker of SGNs in the indirect co-culture system. GFP-BMSCs formed a line just in the location of SGNs in the direct co-culture system. Conclusion: BMSC can differentiate into SGN-like cells in the micro environment with basal membranes, and trend for the site of injured SGNs. This may provide an in-vitro theoretical basis for cell replacement therapy.

Although the pathophysiology of renal functional impairment in the setting of AKI remains poorly understood, previous studies have identified changes in renal hemodynamics, perfusion, and oxygenation as key factors in the development and progression of AKI. The early assessment of these changes remains a challenge. Many established approaches are not applicable to humans because of their invasiveness. Functional renal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers an alternative assessment tool that could be used to evaluate renal morphology and function noninvasively and simultaneously. Thus, the purpose of this review is to illustrate the principle, application, and role of the techniques of functional renal MR imaging, including blood oxygen level-dependent imaging, arterial spin labeling, and diffusion-weighted MR imaging, in the management of AKI. The use of gadolinium in MR imaging may exacerbate renal impairment and cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging will not be discussed in this paper.

More studies with the more commonly used rat model have shown, however, controversial results on whether and why the damage occurs. In this study, 12 mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to unilateral vasectomy: double ligation (without severing) of the vas deferens exposed via a small inguinal incision; 37 days after the operation, the testes, epididymides, vasa deferentia (juxta-epididymal segments), and sperm granulomas (at the vasectomy site) were removed to obtain methacrylate resin-embedded sections and morphometric studies carried out with light microscopy. Marked spermatogenic damage with spermatids and spermatocytes depleted in the seminiferous epithelium in 43% of the seminiferous tubule profiles was demonstrated in 5 of the 12 testes on the vasectomized side, and the damage was associated with smaller or absent sperm granulomas; in the other 7 testes with essentially normal spermatogenesis, there was an increase (by 111% on average) in the volume of the tubule lumen, associated with larger granulomas or granulomas containing more spermatozoa. There was an overall increase (by 66%) in the thickness of the rete testis in the 12 testes; the epididymis or vas deferens showed no distension. It seems therefore that the spermatogenic damage induced by vasectomy in rats is pressure-mediated as well, and that variation in the damage depends mainly on the postoperative development of the sperm granuloma.

In particular, acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) is expressed in the central nervous system and is most sensitive to extracellular pH. However, whether ASIC3 plays a role in epilepsy is unknown. In this study, qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence labeling, and slice recordings were used. We first detected elevated ASIC3 expression patterns in the brains of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and epileptic rats. ASIC3 was expressed in neurons and glia in both humans and in an experimental model of epilepsy, and ASIC3 was colocalized with inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. By blocking ASIC3 with its antagonist APETx2, we observed that injected APETx2 shortened the latency to seizure and increased the incidence of generalized tonic clonic seizure compared to the control group in models of both pilocarpine- and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. Additionally, blocking ASIC3 significantly decreased the frequency of action potential (AP) firing in interneurons. Moreover, APETx2 significantly reduced the amplitudes and frequencies of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) while showed no differences with the APETx2 + bicuculline group and the bicuculline group. These findings suggest that elevated levels of ASIC3 may serve as an anti-epileptic mechanism via postsynaptic mechanisms in interneurons. It could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for epilepsy treatment.

With the theoretical calculation method is more reasonable and calculation accuracy continues to improve, Theoretical calculate advantage is more obvious in the infrared spectrum simulation and vibration modes attributable identified. And it has important reference value for experimental study of infrared spectral analysis. Using density functional theory, geometry optimizations and frequencies calculation of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were performed at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), the stable structure and all vibration modes of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were attained. The results show that the infrared absorption peak of 7-hydroxycoumarin is mainly distributed in the several regions in wave number of 3 700 similar to 3 500, 3 150 similar to 3 000, 1 750 similar to 1 400, 1 400 similar to 1 000, 1 000 similar to 50 cm(-1). In addition to the vibration in a wave number range of 3 700 similar to 3 500, 3 150 similar to 3 000 cm(-1) is relatively independent, and were attributed to OH stretching vibration and benzene ring CH stretching vibration, the other several vibration regions are more complex, the different degree of spectral peaks is composed of multiple vibration modes. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis of the vibration mode, the vibration modes of 7-Hydroxycoumarin molecule were assigned, and in order to discuss the reliability of theoretical calculation method, the correlation diagram of the main absorption peak of 7-hydroxyl group was drawn from the theoretical value of X axis and the experimental value of Y axis, the correlation between experimental IR data and calculated IR data of 7-Hydroxycoumarin was analyzed through the linear regression method. Results show that they have good correlation, correlation coefficient values "r" equals 0. 998 5, and the theory calculation of 7-Hydroxycoumarin IR by density functional theory at the base set level is reliable.

Human NP cells of a degenerative disc were isolated, cultured, and infected with Ad-GDF-5 using the AdEasy-1 adenovirus vector system. On Days 3, 7, 14, and 21, the contents of the sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and hydroxyproline (Hyp), synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen II, gene expression of collagen II and aggrecan, and NP cell proliferation were assessed. The adenovirus was an effective vehicle for gene delivery with prolonged expression of GDF-5. Biochemical analysis revealed increased sGAG and Hyp contents in human NP cells infected by Ad-GDF-5 whereas there was no conspicuous change in basal medium (BM) or Ad-green fluorescent protein (GFP) groups. Only cells in the Ad-GDF-5 group promoted the production of ECM, as demonstrated by the secretion of proteoglycan and up-regulation of collagen II and aggrecan at both protein and mRNA levels. The NP cell proliferation was significantly promoted. The data suggest that Ad-GDF-5 gene therapy is a potential treatment for IDD, which restores the functions of degenerative intervertebral disc through enhancing the ECM production of human NP cells.

Elevated miR-150 level was also detected in cervical carcinoma, whereas its function in cancer progression has not been studied yet. Methods: The expression of miRNA-150 in cervical carcinoma was compared with normal cervical tissue and using qRT-PCR. The effects of miR-150 on cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as the expression of cycle-and apoptosis-related genes, were determined using flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot, respectively. The direct target of miR-150 was confirmed using 3' untranslated region (UTR) luciferase reporter assay. Results: miR-150 promotes cervical cancer cell survival and growth, while the inhibition of miR-150 suppresses these actions. miR-150 also induced the cell cycle progression from G1/G0 to S phase, resulting in an enhancement of growth. Several cell cycle-and apoptosis-related genes, CyclinD1, p27, BIM, and FASL were modulated by miR-150. Moreover, miR-150 directly reduced the expression of FOXO4, which regulates the expression of CyclinD1, p27, BIM, and FASL, by targeting its 3' UTR. Conclusion: Taken together, our data demonstrated that elevated miR-150 targets FOXO4 expression and therefore regulates multiple genes expression, resulting in cervical cancer cell growth and survival.

METHODS: The case-control association analysis was used. The study included 100 independent myopia patients (-0.75 D <= spherical refraction <= -8.00 D) and 100 sex -matched healthy controls (with binocular spherical equivalent ranges between -0.50 D and +0.50 D). Four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tags (rs3976523, rs13098637, rs6762399 and rs7618348) were selected for genotyping by direct sequencing. The frequencies of genotypes and their alleles were calculated based on the number of SNP genotypes in each sample. The Chi-square test was used to examine the difference in the frequency between the myopia cases and controls. RESULTS: Genotype distributions in the four SNPs were all in accordance with the Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium; analysis showed that rs13098637 was significantly associated with low to moderate myopia (P=0.003 and empirical P=0.010). There were no statistically significant differences observed for the genotype or allele frequencies of the other three SNPs between the myopia cases and controls in the Chinese population in this study. CONCLUSION: The current study has revealed that the C allele of rs13098637 in MFN1 had a significant association with low to moderate myopia.

Wavelet transform (WT) is a powerful tool that partitions a signal into components with different frequency. The property of multi-resolution enables WT a very effective and natural tool for analyzing spectrum-like signal. In this study, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based variable selection procedure was proposed to search for a set of informative wavelet coefficients for constructing a near-infrared (NIR) spectral diagnosis model of cancer. The CWT provided a fine multi-resolution feature space for selecting best predictors. A measure of discriminating power (DP) was defined to evaluate the coefficients. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used as the classification algorithm. A NIR spectral dataset associated to cancer diagnosis was used for experiment. The optimal results obtained correspond to the wavelet of db2. It revealed that on condition of having better performance on the training set, the optimal PLS-DA model using only 40 wavelet coefficients in 10 scales achieved the same performance as the one using all the variables in the original space on the test set: an overall accuracy of 93.8%, sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 96.3%. It confirms that the CWT-based feature selection coupled with PLS-DA is feasible and effective for constructing models of diagnostic cancer by NIR spectroscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Arteriovenous shunts within hemangiomas, however, may result in pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The authors report 2 young infants suffering from multifocal IHH associated with CHF were both treated with glucocorticoid and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), but had different outcomes. The PAH decreased immediately and the symptoms of CHF were alleviated after TAE for both of them. For the Tibetan infant, the development was normal with tumor regression by follow-up. For the Han ethnic neonate, PAH increased again in the seventh day with progressive cardiovascular insufficiency. Ultrasound showed a persisting perfusion caused by collateralization around occluded main feeders. Furthermore, a pulmonary infection occurred and ventilation was performed. As a result, the infant died from multiorgan failure caused by CHF and infection. TAE is a treatment of reducing shunting for hemangiomas. Fistula recanalization in multifocal IHH, however, might be an important risk factor affecting the outcome of TAE. TAE should be further evaluated with special attention to anatomy of feeding and draining vessels, and cardiopulmonary conditions. In addition, the patients were susceptible to secondary pulmonary infection because of lung congestion. As well, the infant from the high altitude area showed better adaptability to hypoxia.

However, recent studies have suggested that IGF-1 regulates neuronal firing and excitatory neurotransmission. In the present study, focusing on temporal lobe epilepsy, we found that IGF-1 levels and IGF-1 receptor activation are increased in human epileptogenic tissues, and pilocarpine-and pentylenetetrazole-treated rat models. Using an acute model of seizures, we showed that lateral cerebroventricular infusion of IGF-1 elevates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signalling before pilocarpine application had proconvulsant effects. In vivo electroencephalogram recordings and power spectrogram analysis of local field potential revealed that IGF-1 promotes epileptiform activities. This effect is diminished by co-application of an IGF-1R inhibitor. In an in vitro electrophysiological study, we demonstrated that IGF-1 enhancement of excitatory neurotransmission and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptor-and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated currents is inhibited by IGF-1R inhibitor. Finally, activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1/2 and protein kinase B (Akt) in seizures in rats is increased by exogenous IGF-1 and diminished by picropodophyllin. A behavioural study reveals that the ERK1/2 or Akt inhibitor attenuates seizure activity. These results indicate that increased IGF-1 levels after recurrent hippocampal neuronal firings might, in turn, promote seizure activity via IGF-1R-dependent mechanisms. The present study presents a previously unappreciated role of IGF-1R in the development of seizure activity.

Here, we reported significantly higher HDAC6 levels in GBM from the patients. GBM cell growth was significantly inhibited by ACY-1215, a specific HDAC6 inhibitor. Further analyses show that HDAC6 may promote growth of GBM cells through inhibition of SMAD2 phosphorylation to downregulate p21. Thus, our data demonstrate a previously unrecognized regulation pathway in that HDAC6 increases GBM growth through attenuating transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) receptor signaling.

Using these methods, this study was performed to investigate VAE incidences and to test whether VAEs are associated with poorer outcomes in China. DESIGN A 4-month, prospective multicenter surveillance study between April and July 2013. SETTING Our study included 15 adult intensive care units (ICUs) of 15 hospitals in China. PATIENTS Patients admitted to ICUs during the study period METHODS Patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) were monitored for VAEs: ventilator-associated conditions (VACs), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVACs), and possible or probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Patients with and without VACs were compared with regard to duration of MV, ICU length of stay (LOS), overall hospital LOS, and mortality rate. RESULTS During the study period, 2,356 of the 5,256 patients admitted to ICUs received MV for 8,438 ventilator days. Of these patients, 636 were on MV >2 days. VACs were identified in 94 cases (4.0%; 11.1 cases per 1,000 ventilator days), including 31 patients with IVACs and 16 with possible VAP but none with probable VAP. Compared with patients without VACs, patients with VACs had longer ICU LOS (by 6.2 days), longer duration on MV (by 7.7 days), and higher hospital mortality rate (50.0% vs 27.3%). The mortality rate attributable to VACs was 11.7%. Compared with those with VACs alone, patients with IVACs had longer duration on MV and increased ICU LOS but no higher mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS In China, surveillance of VACs and IVACs is able to identify MV patients with poorer outcomes. However, surveillance of possible and probable VAP can be problematic. Infect. Control Hosp.

J	Jia, FY; Ran, M; Zhang, B				Jia Fei-yun; Ran Ming; Zhang Bo			Theoretical study on the influence of different para-substituents on C-13 NMR of the single carbonyl curcumin analogues	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article						NMR; theoretical study; curcumin analogues; chemical shift	CHEMICAL-SHIFTS; HYDROGEN	The structure of eight kinds of different para-substituents curcumin analogues has been optimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), under which the stability has been verified by means of vibration analysis. Moreover, NMR spectra of curcumin analogues compounds have been studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) by GIAO method. The results show that the structure of eight compounds, a larger conjugated system, has good planarity. The effect of ortho-substituents on bond lengths and bond angles is greater than para and meta. Different substituents and different positions of substituents all have different influence on NMR of the single carbonyl curcumin analogues. In general, after the hydrogen atom on the benzene ring is substituted by other groups, the delta value of alpha-C changes significantly, the delta value of ortho-carbon atom may also have great change, but the delta value change of meta-carbon atoms is not too obvious. The effect of substituent electronegativity on alpha-C atoms presents obvious regularity, while the influence of conjugate effect on carbon atoms of benzene ring is more complex. Finally, the bigger substituted alkyl is, the more the delta value of alpha-C increases.

Aberrant methylation of tumor-related genes at the promoter regions can inactivate genes, which is important in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer. However, the role of GSTP1 promoter methylation in the occurrence of breast cancer and its relationship with tumor stage and histological grade has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we carried out a meta-analysis to yield a more accurate association. Methods: A systematically literature search was made on PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases for eligible studies. The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated by RevMan 5.2 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the source of heterogeneity. Results: Eventually, 17 articles involving 19 case-control studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled results indicated that aberrant GSTP1 promoter methylation was significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer (OR = 7.85, 95 % CI = 5.12-12.01; Caucasians OR = 7.23, 95 % CI = 3.76-13.90 and Asians OR = 11.71, 95 % CI = 5.69-24.07). Furthermore, our results revealed that GSTP1 promoter methylation was more often observed in late-stage breast cancer patients compared with early-stage ones (OR = 1.84, 95 % CI = 1.32-2.58). However, no significant association was identified between GSTP1 promoter methylation and histological grade (OR = 0.74, 95 % CI = 0.43-1.26). Conclusions: The results indicated that GSTP1 promoter methylation probably plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis, which could serve as an effective biomarker for the diagnosis and monitor of breast cancer.

Methods: A total of 792 angiographically defined CHD patients were enrolled following their admission. Patients were stratified into three groups based on the tertile of the Gensini scores (<= 33rd percentile, 33rd to 66th percentile and >= 66th percentile) or the number of stenotic coronary branches (single-branch stenosis, double-branch stenosis and multi-branch stenosis). Demographic and biochemical data were collected and lipoprotein ratios were calculated. Logistic regression and path analysis were employed to examine the relationships between the lipoprotein ratios and the severity of CHD. Results: The ratios of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100)/apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) increased with the tertile of the Gensini scores (P < 0.05 for both). The ratios of triglyceride (TG)/HDL-C, total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB100/apoAI increased with the number of stenotic coronary branches (P < 0.05 for all). The univariate logistic regression showed that the ratios of TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB100/apoAI were positively associated with both the tertile of the Gensini scores and the number of stenotic vessels (P < 0.05 for all), and the ratio of TG/HDL-C was positively associated with the number of stenotic vessels (P < 0.05). In multivariate logistic analysis, only the ratio of apoB100/apoAI was independently and positively associated with the tertile of the Gensini scores (OR = 2.93, 95 % CI = 1.17-7.34, P = 0.022) and the number of stenotic vessels (OR = 3.14, 95 % CI = 1.01-6.47, P = 0.048) after adjusting for the possible confounding variables. The apoB100/apoAI ratio was also shown to be a direct mediator between the risk factors including age, BMI, HDL-C, LDL-C, apoB100 and apoAI and the severity of CHD by path analysis. Conclusion: Our data indicate that the apoB100/apoAI ratio could be a useful predictor for evaluating the severity of coronary stenosis in CHD patients.

It is essential to develop a novel therapeutics for gastric cancer. In the recent years, cytokine-induced killer cells (CIKs)-based adoptive immune therapy has been explored in gastric cancer patients. Due to the small number of patients included in each clinical trial and low-power statistical analysis, the effectiveness of this approach is still unclear. To address this issue, we systemically analyzed the relevant clinical trial data published in recent years by powerful statistical meta-analysis. Material/Methods: Clinical data was searched by multiple electronic databases with a term "gastric cancer" and "cytokine-induced killer cells". Six relevant clinical trials with case-control studies were extracted for our meta-analysis, including 318 patients receiving CIK cell therapy and 369 patients receiving conventional therapy. Results: Overall survival (OS) and odds ratio (OR) were analyzed for patients at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years post-CIK cell therapy and post-conventional therapy. Heterogeneity and publication bias were analyzed for included data quality and publication bias. Our meta-analysis from 6 clinical trials suggests that CIK cell therapy significantly increased 5-year OS from 27 +/- 2.44% to 49 +/- 7.62% (p<0.05) and 5-year OR up to 1.77 (p<0.05). The increased 5-year survival rate was also highly correlated with the increased CD3+ T cell number and ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in the CIK treated patients. Conclusions: CIK cell therapy significantly increased 5-year survival rate compared to conventional chemotherapy among gastric cancer patients. The study provides powerful statistical evidence for large-scale clinical trials with CIK cell therapy.

From January 2009 to June 2011, 247 patients who suffered from gastric angle cancer with metastasis in No. 3 group lymph nodes were divided randomly into groups A and B. Methylthioninium chloride was injected into the peripheral tissue of the metastatic No. 3 group lymph nodes of 138 patients in group A before tumor resections. SSLNs were traced and individual lymphadenectomies were carried out based on the biopsy results of the SSLNs. Standard D2 radical gastrectomies were carried out directly on 109 patients in group B. Postoperative follow-up and survival analysis were carried out for patients in both groups. SSLNs were found in 114 (82.6%) patients in group A. Ninety of those patients (78.9%) demonstrated existing metastasis in SSLNs. According to Kaplan-Meier's method, the postoperative 3-year cumulative survival rates were 63.5% and 47.5%, and the median survival time were 40 and 36 months for the patients of groups A and B, respectively (P < 0.05). The SSLN tracing technique is feasible in radical gastrectomy for AGC. It gives surgeons important information about the terminal status of lymph node metastasis and provides some scientific basis for individual lymphadenectomy.

Usefulness of normal saline for sealing the needle track after CT-guided lung biopsy	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							COAXIAL CUTTING NEEDLE; CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT; BLOOD PATCH TECHNIQUE; ASPIRATION BIOPSY; POSTBIOPSY PNEUMOTHORAX; RISK-FACTORS; LESIONS; COMPLICATIONS; PREVENTION; ACCURACY	AIM: To determine whether the use of normal saline for sealing the needle track can reduce the incidence of pneumothorax and chest tube placement after computed tomography (CT)-guided lung biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomised, controlled trial enrolling 322 patients was conducted. All patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those in whom the needle track was not sealed with normal saline (n = 161, Group A) and those who did receive normal saline (n = 161, Group B). CT-guided biopsy was performed with coaxial technique. Normal saline, which ranged from 1-3 ml, was injected while the trocar needle was being withdrawn. Patient characteristics, lesion, and procedure variables were analysed as potential risk variables for occurrence of pneumothorax and chest tube placement. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumothorax was 26.1% in Group A and 6.2% in Group B (p<0.001). Nine patients in Group A and one patient in Group B required chest tube placement (p = 0.010). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, smaller lesion size, greater needle epleural angle, longer lesionepleural distance, presence of emphysema, and no sealing the needle track with normal saline were significantly associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax, and that the latter three factors were also associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. CONLUSION: Normal saline for sealing the needle track significantly reduces the incidence of pneumothorax and prevents subsequent chest tube placement after CT-guided lung biopsy.

The coding sequence of MYOC was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by direct DNA sequencing. Results: The son, who was the proband of this family, was diagnosed as early-onset POAG in both eyes. His mother was diagnosed as POAG ten years ago. A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.761C<G (p.P254R) in the MYOC gene, was identified as being co-segregated with the phenotype of this family. This mutation was detected in the two affected patients, but not present in the other normal family members or 384 normal controls. Conclusions: This study provides a mutation spectrum of MYOC resulting in POAG development in a Chinese population, which may help to better understand the molecular pathogenesis and clinical diagnosis of MYOC-associated POAG.

Hence, we performed this meta-analysis to ascertain a more comprehensive and accurate association. Materials and Methods Relevant studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases up to February 28, 2015. After two independent reviewers screened the studies and extracted the necessary data, meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.2 software. Results Nineteen eligible articles, including 20 studies, were included in our analysis. Compared to non-cancerous controls, the frequency of RAR beta 2 methylation was 7.27 times higher in patients with breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 7.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.01-17.52). Compared to late-stage RAR beta 2 methylated patients, the pooled OR of early-stage ones was 0.81 (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.55-1.17). The OR of low-grade RAR beta 2 methylated patients was 0.96 (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.74-1.25) compared to high-grade RAR beta 2 methylated patients. Conclusion RAR beta 2 methylation is significantly increased in breast cancer samples when compared to non-cancerous controls. RAR beta 2 could serve as a potential epigenetic marker for breast cancer detection and management.

Growing evidence indicates that increased immune genetic diversity and dysfunction of immune system cause aging-related pathophysiological process with the growth of age. In the present study, we observed that LPS-induced higher activation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 promoter is associated with the upregulated binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) in peritoneal macrophages of aged mice than young ones. Additionally, COX-2 is a direct target of miR-101b and miR-26b in the macrophages. Significant upregulation of miR-101b and miR-26b effectively prevented LPS-induced excessive expression of COX-2 in the young mice. Because these negative regulatory factors were unresponsive to LPS stimulation, the levels of COX-2 were markedly higher in the macrophages of aged mice. Further study showed that NF-kappa B activation contributed to the increase in the expression of miR-101b and miR-26b in the LPS-stimulated macrophages of young mice, but not aged	[Liu, Dan; Wang, Dongsheng; Xu, Zhenbiao; Gao, Jing; Liu, Min; Liu, Yanxin; Jiang, Minghong; Zheng, Dexian] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Basic Med Sci, Natl Lab Med Mol Biol, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dan; Wang, Dongsheng; Xu, Zhenbiao; Gao, Jing; Liu, Min; Liu, Yanxin; Jiang, Minghong; Zheng, Dexian] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dongsheng] North Sichuan Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Nanchong 637000, Peoples R China	Jiang, MH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Basic Med Sci, Natl Lab Med Mol Biol, 5 Dong Dan San Tiao, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China.	jiangminghong@163.com; zhengdx2008@gmail.com			State Key Basic Research Program of China [2013CB530805]; Natural Science Foundation of China [81001315, 30972684]	This work was partially supported by the State Key Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2013CB530805) and the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 81001315 and 30972684).		46	3	3	0	5	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0161-9152	1574-4647		AGE	Age	OCT	2015	37	5							UNSP 97	10.1007/s11357-015-9836-3		14	Geriatrics & Gerontology	Geriatrics & Gerontology	CU0VX	WOS:000363238100014	26371058

However, long-term administration of antiretroviral drugs can result in various drug-associated toxicities. Among them, nucleoside analogues were confirmed to inhibit DNA polymerase gamma, resulting in mitochondrial toxicity. Our previous study indicated that long-term exposure of mice to nucleoside analogue could induce mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) loss in cortical neurons. Herein, we further identify mitochondrial toxicity of four nucleoside analogues (zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (D4T), lamivudine (3TC), and didanosine (DDI)) by cloning and sequencing mtDNA D-loop region in mice neurons captured with laser capture microdissection. The results showed that mutation of neuronal mtDNA D-loop sequences increased in mice treated with each of the four nucleoside analogues for 4 months and D4T and DDI induced more severe D-loop lesion than the other two nucleoside analogues. The major type of D-loop point mutations induced by four nucleoside analogues was transition, in particular of "A -> G" and "T -> C" transition, but the point transition sites were variable. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to nucleoside analogue can result in mtDNA D-loop region lesion in mouse cortical neurons.

The proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and Tregs in the peripheral blood between healthy volunteers and patients with HCC were detected by flow cytometry prior to (1 day) and one month following TACE. The level of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood was examined by ELISA. In the peripheral blood of patients with HCC, the proportion of CD4(+) T cells in the total T lymphocytes was significantly lower compared with that of healthy volunteers (26.71 +/- 5.57, vs. 34.74 +/- 2.86%; P<0.05) and the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes in patients with HCC was lower compared with that of healthy adults prior to TACE (1.03 +/- 0.14, vs. 1.68 +/- 0.16, P<0.05). The ratio markedly increased following TACE treatment (30.52 +/- 4.19, vs. 1.29 +/- 0.14). The percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells in the total CD4(+) T cells isolated from the patients with HCC was markedly higher compared with that of healthy adults prior to TACE (11.12 +/- 3.58%, vs. 4.98 +/- 1.45%, P<0.05) and it was significantly decreased following TACE (7.58 +/- 2.65%; P<0.05). No statistically significant difference in the expression of IL-35 was detected prior to or following TACE in patients with HCC and healthy adults (369.66 +/- 95.53, 352.28 +/- 107.50 and 316.24 +/- 89.21 pg/ml, respectively). The level of AFP, an oncofetal protein of similar to 72 kDa, which is produced by normal gastrointestinal cells, yolk sac cells and fetal hepatocytes immediately following birth, was increased in patients with HCC (1674 +/- 1649 ng/ml) and was significantly decreased following TACE (827 +/- 981 ng/ml). Treg cells changed in positive correlation with the change of APP, with a correlation coefficient of 0.401. TACE markedly improved the immune function of patients with HCC.

J	Lee, Y; Liu, X; Wang, XM				Lee, Yujun; Liu, Xin; Wang, Xiaoming			Do metrical incongruities disrupt semantic processing in modern Chinese? An event-related potential study	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						metrical incongruities; semantic processing; V2+N1; V2+N2	SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATIONS; FRENCH; MEMORY	The present study examined the relationship between prosody and semantic processing in the written form of modern Chinese by analysing behavioural data and event-related potential data. By manipulating the number of noun syllables in verb-objection, we compare the dynamic neural mechanisms of the structure bisyllabic verb (V2)+monosyllabic noun (N1) (i.e. V2+N1) with V2+N1 (N2, bisyllabic noun). In Chinese, the rhythmic pattern V2+N1 is considered to be a metrical incongruity, whereas V2+N2 is considered to be a metrical congruity. For example, the verb yunshu (to transport) can be followed by liangshi (cereals). However, if yunshu is followed by liang (cereals), yunshu liang is usually considered to be metrically incongruous. This paper shows that (i) V2+N1 elicited more negative amplitudes than V2+N2 in the 90-170ms and 450-500ms windows, which indicates that metrical incongruities affect semantic processing in Chinese, and (ii) the acceptance rate for V2+N1 is significantly lower than that of V2+N2, which implies that metrical incongruities disrupt semantic processing in modern Chinese. These results are in agreement with previous studies. This is the first study to find that metrical incongruities disrupt semantic processing in Chinese. This study provides convergent evidence that metrical congruities facilitate semantic processing, whereas metrical incongruities disrupt semantic processing.Video abstract available (Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/WNR/A340).

METHODS: Two hundred and five cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B and 40 healthy volunteers underwent abdominal triphasic-enhancement MRI and laboratory examination of PLT in 109/L. Cirrhotic patients underwent endoscopy for detecting EV. Spleen maximal width (W), thickness (T) and length (L) in mm together with spleen volume (SV) and RV in mm(3) were measured by MRI, and spleen volume index (SI) in mm3 was obtained by W x T x L. SV/PLT, SI/PLT and RV x PLT/SV (RVPS) were calculated and statistically analyzed to assess cirrhosis and EV. RESULTS: SV/PLT (r = 0.676) and SI/PLT (r = 0.707) increased, and PLT (r = -0.626) and RVPS (r = -0.802) decreased with the progress of Child-Pugh class (P < 0.001 for all). All parameters could determine the presence of cirrhosis, distinguish between each class of Child-Pugh class, and identify the presence of EV [the areas under the curve (AUCs) = 0.661-0.973]. Among parameters, RVPS could best determine presence and each class of cirrhosis with AUCs of 0.973 and 0.740-0.853, respectively; and SV/PLT could best identify EV with an AUC of 0.782. CONCLUSION: The combination of PLT with SV and RV could predict Child-Pugh class of liver cirrhosis and identify the presence of esophageal varices.

METHODS: A total of 55 cases were retrospectively collected, including 18 cases undergoing ADTR and 37 cases of Roux-en-Y reconstruction (RY) for AEG (Siewert types II and III) at North Sichuan Medical College. The cases were divided into two groups. The clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative outcomes, postoperative complications, morbidity and overall survival (OS) were compared for the two different reconstruction methods. RESULTS: Basic characteristics including sex, age, body mass index (BMI), Siewert type, pT status, pN stage, and lymph node metastasis were similar in the two groups. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of perioperative outcomes (including the length of postoperative hospital stay, operating time, and intraoperative blood loss) and postoperative complications (consisting of anastomosis-related complications, wound infection, respiratory infection, pleural effusion, lymphorrhagia, and cholelithiasis). For the ADTR group, perioperative recovery indexes such as time to first flatus (P = 0.002) and time to resuming a liquid diet (P = 0.001) were faster than those for the RY group. Moreover, the incidence of reflux esophagitis was significantly decreased compared with the RY group (P = 0.048). The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates for overall postoperative complications and the rates of tumor recurrence and metastasis were not significantly different between the two groups. Survival curves plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test demonstrated similar outcomes for the ADTR and RY groups. Multivariate analysis of significantly different factors that presented as covariates on Cox regression analysis to assess the survival and recurrence among AEG patients showed that age, gender, BMI, pleural effusion, time to resuming a liquid diet, lymphorrhagia and tumor-node-metastasis stage were important prognostic factors for OS of AEG patients, whereas the selection of surgical method between ADTR and RY was shown to be a similar prognostic factor for OS of AEG patients. CONCLUSION: ADTR by jejunal interposition presents similar rates of tumor recurrence, metastasis and long-term survival compared with classical reconstruction with RY esophagojejunostomy; however, it offers considerably improved near-term quality of life, especially in terms of early recovery and decreased reflux esophagitis. Thus, ADTR is recommended as a worthwhile digestive tract reconstruction method for Siewert types II and III AEG.

Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and 2 (TTF2) were thyroid-specific transcription factors, and regulated expression of the thyroid-specific genes. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between gene variants of TTF1 and TTF2 and the risk of PTC in Chinese population.Two tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) on TTF1 and TTF2 were selected and genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDITOF) mass spectrometry in a hospital-based case-control study of 297 PTC patients and 594 healthy controls. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the association between TTF1 and TTF2 and PTC risk was also performed.We found that the rs944289 on the TTF1 was significantly associated with increased PTC risk (TT vs CC, OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.05-2.24; CT+TT vs TT, OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.00-1.79; T vs C, OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.04-1.55). Similarly, the rs965513 on the TTF2 can also elevate the risk of PTC significantly (GA vs GG, OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.07-2.59; AA+GA vs AA, OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.09-1.82; A vs G, OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.05-1.59). Furthermore, results of stratified analysis revealed that the risk effects of rs944289 and rs965513 were more overpowering in the subgroups of patients with MNG, as well as subjects without metastasis. Results of meta-analysis from the previous study and our new data indicated that variants of rs944289 and rs965513 might be the genetic susceptible factors both in Asians and Caucasians.We get the conclusion that mutations of TTF1 and TTF2 are significantly associated with an increasing risk of PTC in Chinese. However, more detailed investigations and further large-scale studies on genetic functions to provide more conclusive and accurate evidence are required in the future.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between diet and lifestyle habits and IBS. Methods: A food frequency and lifestyle habits questionnaire was used to record the diet and lifestyle habits of 78 IBS subjects and 79 healthy subjects. Crosstabulation analysis and logistic regression were used to reveal any association among lifestyle habits, eating habits, food consumption frequency, and other associated conditions. Results: The results from logistic regression analysis indicated that IBS was associated with irregular eating (odds ratio [OR], 3.257), physical inactivity (OR, 3.588), and good quality sleep (OR, 0.132). IBS subjects ate fruit (OR, 3.082) vegetables (OR, 3.778), and legumes (OR, 2.111) and drank tea (OR, 2.221) significantly more frequently than the control subjects. After adjusting for age and sex, irregular eating (OR, 3.963), physical inactivity (OR, 6.297), eating vegetables (OR, 7.904), legumes (OR, 2.674), drinking tea (OR, 3.421) and good quality sleep (OR, 0.054) were independent predictors of IBS. Conclusions: This study reveals a possible association between diet and lifestyle habits and IBS.

FOXJ1 is a member of the FOX family; however, its function in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has remained to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study evaluated the expression of FOXJ1 in human clear cell RCC and the effect of FOXJ1 on the proliferative ability of RCC cells. The RCC specimens analyzed in the present study were obtained from 286 patients with RCC who underwent nephrectomy. FOXJ1 mRNA expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and FOXJ1 protein expression levels were determined using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. To determine the effect of FOXJ1 on the proliferative ability of RCC cells, the expression of FOXJ1 was decreased using small interfering (si) RNA, and a FOXJ1 vector was stably transfected into RCC cell lines. The proliferative ability of RCC cells was then examined using a WST-1 assay and xenograft experiments with BALB/c nude mice, where the association between FOXJ1 expression and patient survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. FOXJ1 expression was significantly higher in RCC tissues compared with that of healthy renal tissues. Furthermore, FOXJ1 expression was associated with tumor stage, histologic grade and size. In addition, FOXJ1 significantly enhanced the proliferation of RCC cells in vitro and in vivo. The present study identified that FOXJ1 expression was upregulated in RCC and enhanced the proliferative ability of RCC cells. Therefore, FOXJ1 may serve as an independent prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with RCC.

We investigated quantitative evidence regarding brain morphology and functional connectivity features to provide insight into the neuroanatomical foundation of this disorder, using high resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting state functional MRI in 21 patients with BECT and in 20 healthy children. The functional connectivity analysis, seeded at the regions with altered gray-matter (GM) volume in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, was further performed. Then, the observed structural and functional alteration were investigated for their association with the clinical and behavior manifestations. The increased GM volume in the striatum and fronto-temporo-parietal cortex (striato-cortical circuit) was observed in BECT. The decreased connections were found among the motor network and frontostriatal loop, and between the default mode network (DMN) and language regions. Additionally, the GM of striatum was negatively correlated with age at epilepsy onset. The current observations may contribute to the understanding of the altered structural and functional feature of striato-cortical circuit in patients with BECT. The findings also implied alterations of the motor network and DMN, which were associated with the epileptic activity in patients with BECT. This further suggested that the onset of BECT might have enduring structural and functional effects on brain maturation.

Material and Methods All subjects underwent an abdominal examination on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Two radiologists independently scored the image quality (IQ). An optimal set of DTI parameters was obtained from a group of fifteen volunteers with multiple b-values (100, 300, 500, and 800 s/mm(2)) and various diffusion-encoding directions (NED = 6, 9, and 12) using two way ANOVA analysis. Eighteen Patients with HCC underwent DTI scans with the optimized parameters. Fractional anisotropy(FA) and average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured. The differences of FA and ADC values between liver healthy region and HCC lesion were compared through paired t tests. Results There were no significant changes in liver IQ and FA/ADC values with increased NED (P > 0.05), whereas the liver IQ and FA/ADC values decreased significantly with increased b-values(P < 0.05). Good IQ, acceptable scan time and reasonable FA/ADC values were acquired using NED = 9 with b-value of (0,300) s/mm(2). Using the optimized DTI sequence, ADC value of the tumor lesion was significantly lower than that of the healthy liver region (1.30 +/- 0.34x10(-3) vs 1.52 +/- 0.27x10(-3) mm(2)/s, P = 0.013), whereas the mean FA value of the tumor lesion (0.42 +/- 0.11) was significantly higher than the normal liver region (0.32 +/- 0.10) (P = 0.004). Conclusion Either FA or ADC value from DTI can be used to differentiate HCC from healthy liver. HCC lead to higher FA value and lower ADC value on DTI than healthy liver.

Because functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is non-invasive and is characterized by the integration of different brain areas in terms of functional connectivity (FC), fMRI has been widely used in PD research. Non-motor symptom (NMS) features are also frequently present in PD before the onset of classical motor symptoms with pain as the primary NMS. Considering that PD could affect the pain process at multiple levels, we hypothesized that pain is one of the earliest symptoms in PD and investigated whether FC of the pain network was disrupted in PD without pain. To better understand the pathogenesis of pain in PD, we combined resting state and pain-stimuli-induced task state fMRI to identify alterations in FC related to pain in PD. Methods: Fourteen early drug-naive PD without pain and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in our testing task. We used independent component analysis to select seven functional networks related to PD and pain. We focused on abnormalities in FC and in functional network connectivity (FNC) in PD compared with HC during the task (51 degrees C heat pain stimuli) and at rest. Results: Compared with HC, PD showed decreased FC in putamen within basal ganglia network (BGN) in task state and decreased FC in putamen of salience network (SN) and mid-cingulate cortex of sensorimotor network in rest state. FNC between the BGN and the SN are reduced during both states in PD compared with HC. In addition, right frontoparietal network (RFPN), which is considered as a bridge between the SN and default-mode network, was significantly disturbed during the task. Conclusion: These findings suggest that BGN plays a role in the pathological mechanisms of pain underlying PD, and RFPN likely contributes greatly to harmonization between intrinsic brain activity and external stimuli.

The metabolic mechanisms of CA catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) were systematically explored in this study based on DFT calculation. Four possible metabolic pathways were investigated, namely 1-N, 3-N, 7-N demethylations, and C-8 hydroxylation. The results determined the mechanistic details and revealed some notable features. The rate-limiting C-alpha-H hydroxylation for the N-demethylation mechanism proceeded predominantly through a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism with two-state reactivity. The generated carbinolamine decomposed in a nonenzymatic environment, especially through the adjacent heteroatom-assisted proton transfer. The rate-limiting step for C-8 hydroxylation involved the nucleophilic attack of the active Cpd I's oxygen atom. Intriguingly, CA metabolic performance depended on the multiplicity of Cpd I. The 3-N demethylation metabolic mechanism predominated over the C-8 hydroxylation on the high-spin quartet state. Paraxanthine was the most energetically feasible metabolic product of CA. On the low-spin doublet state, however, C-8 hydroxylation had the lowest activation energy; hence, 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid was the optimum metabolic product of CA. All the results were in agreement with the experimental observation and can supply rational clues for the different metabolic performances of CA catalyzed by CYP1A2 in humans and rats.

A feasible and reproducible method for detecting and staging LEL will facilitate decision-making about appropriate management strategies. Purpose: To determine whether the thickness of the soft tissues of the lower extremities, measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could stage unilateral secondary LEL. Material and Methods: Seventy-two women with unilateral LEL and 22 participants without LEL underwent lower extremity MRI after treatment of uterine malignancies. LEL was classified clinically as stage 0, 1, 2, or 3. On fat-suppressed T2-weighted mid-axial images of calves and thighs, the total thickness of the soft tissue (TT), muscle thickness (MT), subcutaneous tissue thickness (STT), and the differences in TT (DTT), MT (DMT), and STT (DSTT) values and corresponding measurements in the contralateral lower extremity, were obtained and analyzed statistically for staging LEL. Results: There was a trend for the TTand STT of the affected calf and thigh to increase with increasing LEL stage. These parameters were strongly and moderately correlated with LEL stage, respectively (P < 0.001). Both the DTT and DSTT of the calves or thighs were strongly correlated with LEL stage (P < 0.001). Among the parameters, the DSTT of the calves could best stage LEL, with an area under the receiver operating curve of more than 0.89. Conclusion: The DSTT of the calves could be recommended as an informative indicator for staging LEL.

Between January 2012 and September 2014, 2-D US and PUSB were prospectively performed in 135 patients with suspected rotator cuff tears from among 2,169 patients with clinically diagnosed subacromial impingement syndrome. Sixty-three patients who had undergone arthroscopy were included. The PUSB findings were compared with those from 2-D US using the McNemar test, with arthroscopy as a standard. Of a total of 19 full-thickness tears (FTTs), 2-D US correctly diagnosed 12 and PUSB correctly diagnosed 18 (P = 0.031). With regard to partial-thickness tears, 2-D US correctly diagnosed 31 and PUSB 35 of a total of 41 tears (P = 0.375).Accuracy in diagnosing FTTs was 81.0 % for 2-D US and 98.4 % for PUSB. 2-D US and PUSB yielded sensitivity of 63.2 % and 94.7 %, respectively, for full-thickness tears, with specificity of 88.6 % and 100.0 %, respectively. PUSB is a safe and feasible procedure, with greater sensitivity and specificity than 2D US in diagnosing FTTs As such, PUSB improves the value of ultrasound for assessing rotator cuff pathology. aEuro cent PUSB allows new application of CEUS and offers a new form of bursography. aEuro cent PUSB appears to facilitate diagnosis of full -thickness rotator cuff tears. aEuro cent PUSB outlines the rotator cuff tears more clearly than 2-D US.

Aberrant miR-106b expression has been reported in several cancers. However, the role and underlying mechanism of miR-106 in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been addressed. Methods: Quantitative RT-PCR(qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate miR-106b levels in CRC cell lines and patient specimens. Cell proliferation was detected using MTT assay, and cell migration and invasion ability were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The target gene of miR-106b was determined by qRT-PCR, western blot and luciferase assays. Results: miR-106b was significantly up-regulated in metastatic CRC tissues and cell lines, and high miR-106b expression was associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. In addition, miR-106b overexpression enhances, whereas miR-106b depletion reduces CRC cell migration and invasion. Moreover, we identify DLC1 as a direct target of miR-106b, reveal its expression to be inversely correlated with miR-106b in CRC samples and show that its re-introduction reverses miR-106b-induced CRC cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, survival analyses showed the patients with high mi-106b/low DLC1 had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates, and confirmed miR-106b may be an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in CRC patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that miR-106b promotes CRC cell migration and invasion by targeting DLC1. This miRNA may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC.

Methods The frequencies of all types of advertisements (ads) on forty TV channels in mainland China, the exact ad broadcast times, and the name and brand of all snacks and western fast foods advertised were recorded from 0800 hours to 2400 hours on both a weekday and a weekend day in a week. The difference in the frequencies of the diverse types of ads over eight time intervals (each time interval was 2 hours) were compared, and the trends in ad frequencies during the time intervals were described. Results The TV channels broadcast 155 (91-183) (expressed as median [P-25-P-75]) food ads, 87 (38-123) snack ads, 49 (11-85) beverage ads, and 58 (25-76) ads of snacks suitable for limited consumption (SSLCs) in a day. The proportion of snack ads among food ads (SPF%) was 55.5% (40.3%-71.0%), and the proportion of SSLC ads among snack ads (LPS%) was 67.4% (55.4%-79.3%). The ad frequencies for food, snacks, SSLCs, and beverages demonstrated significant differences among the eight time intervals (all P=0.000). TV channels broadcast the most frequent ads for food, snacks, SSLCs, and beverages during the time interval from 2000 hours to 2200 hours among the eight time intervals. Conclusions Chinese children and adolescents may be at a high risk of exposure to unhealthy food advertising on TV. Reducing the exposure risk strongly requires multisectoral cooperation.

The current study was designed to systematically identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) that are capable of sulfating raloxifene, fulvestrant, and two active metabolites of tamoxifen, afimoxifene and endoxifen. A systematic analysis using 13 known human SULTs revealed SULT1A1 and SULT1C4 as the major SULTs responsible for the sulfation of afimoxifene, endoxifen, raloxifene and fulvestrant. Kinetic parameters of these two human SULTs in catalyzing the sulfation of these drug compounds were determined. Sulfation of afimoxifene, endoxifen, raloxifene and fulvestrant under metabolic conditions was examined using HepG2 human hepatoma cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, human intestine, kidney, liver, and lung cytosols were examined to verify the presence of afimoxifene/endoxifen/raloxifene/fulvestrant-sulfating activity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: A total of 52 patients with unilateral mono-radiculopathy received a single intradiscal (3 mL) and periganglionic (5 mL) injection of an O-2-O-3 mixture. An ADC index of the involved side to the intact side was calculated using the following formula: pre-treatment ADC index = ([ADC involved side - ADC intact side] / ADC intact side) x 100. We analyzed the relationship between the pre-treatment Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the ADC index. In addition, the correlation between ODI recovery ratio and ADC index was investigated. The sensitivity and specificity of the ADC index for predicting response in O-2-O-3 therapy was determined. Results: Oswestry Disability Index and the ADC index was not significantly correlated (r = -0.125, p = 0.093). The ADC index and ODI recovery ratio was significantly correlated (r = 0.819, p < 0.001). When using 7.10 as the cut-off value, the ADC index obtained a sensitivity of 86.3% and a specificity of 82.9% for predicting successful response to therapy around the first month of follow-up. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that the patients with decreased ADC index tend to show poor improvement of clinical symptoms. The ADC index may be a useful indicator to predict early response to CT-guided O-2-O-3 injection therapy in patients with unilateral mono-radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation.

In addition, the proliferation, apoptosis and invasiveness of BT-549 breast cancer cells was studied following knockdown of UBE3A. Three pairs of small interfering RNA (siRNA) fragments targeting UBE3A were designed and transfected into the BT-549 cells. The effects of silencing UBE3A were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, and the same methods were used to detect the expression levels of annexin A2. Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Counting kit-8, and flow cytometry and a Transwell chamber assay were used to assess the rate of cell apoptosis and invasion, respectively. Following transfection with the three siRNAs targeting UBE3A for 72 h, the mRNA expression levels of UBE3A were downregulated, as compared with those in the untreated groups, and siRNA1 was the shown to be the most effective siRNA for silencing UBE3A expression. The protein expression levels were concordant with the mRNA expression levels of UBE3A. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression levels of annexin A2 were downregulated. Cellular proliferation and invasion of the siRNA1 group was inhibited as compared with those in the untreated groups, and apoptosis of UBE3A-siRNA1 cells was increased as compared with that in the untreated groups. The results of the present study indicated that UBE3A may regulate the expression of annexin A2, resulting in promotion of proliferation and invasion and suppression of apoptosis in BT-549 cells.

J	Yu, X; Xu, ZM; Lei, J; Li, TT; Wang, Y				Yu, Xian; Xu, Zhengmin; Lei, Jun; Li, Tingting; Wang, Yan			VP22 mediates intercellular trafficking and enhances the in vitro antitumor activity of PTEN	MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS			English	Article						PTEN; VP22; breast tumor; intercellular trafficking; fusion proteins; gene therapy	TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; PROSTATE-CANCER; PROTEIN; GENE; BREAST; APOPTOSIS; CELLS	PTEN acts as a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase with a possible role in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Mutations in PTEN are frequent and their presence is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, which is the most common type of non-cutaneous malignancy in females. Delivery of the tumor suppressor PTEN gene represents a powerful strategy for breast cancer therapy, but a present limitation of gene therapy is the ability to deliver sufficient quantities of active proteins to target cells. The capacity of HSV-1VP22 fusion proteins to spread from the primary transduced cell to surrounding cells could improve gene therapeutics, particularly in cancer. To assess the potential efficacy of VP22 as a gene therapy for breast cancer, expression vectors for N- and C-terminal PTEN-VP22 fusion proteins were constructed. VP22-mediated intercellular transport and antitumor efficacy in BT549 (PTEN-null) breast tumor cells were investigated. The results showed that PTEN-VP22 has the same spreading abilities as VP22. In cell proliferation and apoptosis assays, PTEN-VP22 gene transfer induces a stronger anti-proliferative effect and apoptotic activity compared with PTEN gene transfer alone. In addition, VP22 enhanced the PTEN-mediated decrease in the level of phosphorylated AKT. The results show that PTEN-VP22 can spread in vitro and PTEN-VP22 gene induces significantly greater antitumor activity than the PTEN gene alone. This study confirms the utility of VP22-mediated delivery in vitro and suggests that PTEN-VP22 may have applications in breast cancer gene therapy.

Thus, it is easily misdiagnosed and an optimal treatment regimen has not yet been established. The present study reports the case of a 43-year-old female who presented with a PC of the parotid region and reviews the associated published literature. The patient underwent three surgical excisions prior to the tumor being completely removed, and was misdiagnosed four times prior to the correct diagnosis. Once the tumor was completely removed, the patient received radiation therapy (RT). At the 2-year follow-up, the patient remained free of local recurrence and metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 cases of PC on the parotid region have been reported. Although an optimal treatment regimen has not been established, surgery with wide margins is recommended, with RT and chemotherapy producing mixed results.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the expression and activity of numerous molecules involved in cancer initiation and progression. Notably, HDAC3 is overexpressed in the majority of carcinomas. However, thus far, no data are available to support the role of HDAC3 in VM. In this study, we subjected glioma specimens to immunohistochemical and histochemical double-staining methods and found that VM and HDAC3 expression were related to the pathological grade of gliomas. The presence of VM correlated with HDAC3 expression in glioma tissues. The formation of tubular structures, as determined by the tube formation assay to evaluate VM, was impaired in U87MG cells when transfected by siRNA or treated with an HDAC3 inhibitor. Importantly, the expression of VM-related molecules such as MMP-2/14 and laminin52 was also affected when HDAC3 expression was altered. Furthermore, U87MG cells were treated with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor or/and ERK inhibitor and found that the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways play key roles in VM; whereas, in VM, the two signaling pathways did not act upstream or downstream from each other. Taken together, our findings showed that HDAC3 contributed to VM in gliomas, possibly through the PI3K/ERK-MMPs-laminin52 signaling pathway, which could potentially be a novel therapeutic target for gliomas.

However, autoreactive CD8(+) T-cell responses targeting ChgA haven't been studied yet. Here several HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides derived from mChgA and hChgA were selected by an integrated computational prediction approach, followed by an HLA-A*0201 binding assay. MChgA(10-19) and mChgA(43-52) peptides, which bound well with HLA-A*0201 molecule, induced significant proliferation and IFN-gamma-releasing of splenocytes from diabetic NOD.beta 2m(null).HHD mice. Notably, flow cytometry analysis found that mChgA(10-19) and mChgA(43-52) stimulated the production of IFN-gamma, perforin, and IL-17 by splenic CD8(+) T cells of diabetic NOD.beta 2m(null).HHD mice. Furthermore, hChgA(10-19) and hChgA(43-52)-induced IFN-gamma releasing by specific CD8(+) T cells were frequently detected in recent-onset HLA-A*0201-positive T1D patients. Thus, this study demonstrated that autoreactive CD8(+) T cells targeting ChgA were present in NOD.beta 2m(null).HHD mice and T1D patients, and might contribute to pathogenesis of T1D through secreting proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules.

Strong evidence has indicated that mitochondrial fission participates in the regulation of apoptosis in many diseases; however, whether mitochondrial fission regulates cisplatin sensitivity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MFF mediated mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cells after cisplatin treatment and that miR-593-5p was downregulated in this process. miR-593-5p attenuated mitochondrial fission and cisplatin sensitivity by targeting the 3' untranslated region sequence of MFF and inhibiting its translation. In exploring the underlying mechanism of miR-593-5p downregulation, we observed that BRCA1 transactivated miR-593-5p expression and attenuated cisplatin sensitivity in vitro. The BRCA1-miR-593-5p-MFF axis also affected cisplatin sensitivity in vivo. Importantly, in a retrospective analysis of multiple centers, we further found that the BRCA1-miR-593-5p-MFF axis was significantly associated with cisplatin sensitivity and the survival of patients with TSCC. Together, our data reveal a model for mitochondrial fission regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels; we also reveal a new pathway for BRCA1 in determining cisplatin sensitivity through the mitochondrial fission program.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the biological characteristics of patients with FNMTC by a meta-analysis. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library databases, and the Web of Science) were searched to identify studies published before September, 2014. All original studies that compared clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with FNMTC and SNMTC were included. The pooled effect sizes of interesting parameters were calculated by odds ratio (OR), standard mean difference (SMD), or hazard ratio (HR). Results: Twelve studies with a total of 12 741 participants were included in this analysis. FNMTC patients had an increased rate of recurrence (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.20) and decreased disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.52) in comparison with SNMTC patients. FNMTC possessed more aggressive biological behaviors, characterized by younger age at diagnosis (SMD = -0.91, 95% CI: -1.59 to -0.22), higher risk of multifocal (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32 to 1.71), bilateral (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.66), extrathyroidal invasion (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.41), and lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.38). Conclusion: FNMTC is a more aggressive disease and possesses higher recurrence rate and lower DFS. More attention and careful consideration should be paid regarding the decision about treatment for patients with FNMTC.

Although the mechanism responsible for the pathophysiology of cryptorchidism has not yet been well addressed, the Wnt signaling pathway has been involved in the development of cryptorchidism. Axin1 is a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway and may play a critical role in the development of cryptorchidism. Objective We assumed that cryptorchidism risk and the AXIN1 gene may have an association. Thus we picked out three tag SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the AXIN1 gene and aimed to investigate whether cryptorchidism risk is associated with polymorphisms in the AXIN1 gene. Study design The variants were discriminated using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. A total of 113 cases and 179 controls were recruited to participate in this study, including 92 unilateral cryptorchidism and 21 bilateral cases. In bilateral cases, the position of the testis was decided by the higher one. Results A significantly increased cryptorchidism risk was found to be associated with both the T allele (p = 2e(-4), OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.37-2.78) and T/T genotype (p = 6e(-4), OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.79-9.09) of rs370681 polymorphism, and, compared with the C/C genotype, a significantly increased cryptorchidism risk was associated with the C/TeT/T genotype (p = 4e(-4), OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.47-4.00) of rs370681 polymorphisms. Discussion Among the three tag SNPs we have chosen in AXIN1, two SNPs are located in the intron region, the other SNP is located in the synonymous codon region. Evidential research has indicated that introns and other non-protein-coding RNAs may have evolved to function as network control molecules in higher organisms. Therefore, we suspected that the tag SNPs may work as controls influencing the conduct of other genes rather than affecting the structure of the protein by influencing the coding of amino acid. There were limitations in our study. One is that we did not test the expression level of Axin1. Secondly, the number of the study subjects is limited. Finally, the molecular mechanisms by which AXIN1 is involved in susceptibility to cryptorchidism should be characterized. Conclusions We assessed the impact of the genetic variability of the AXIN1 gene on cryptorchidism. We have offered primary evidence that the T allele and T/T genotype of rs370681 polymorphisms and C/T genotype of rs1805105 polymorphisms in AXIN1 gene are more frequent in patients with cryptorchidism.

Materials and methods: Eighty-eight consecutive patients with cirrhosis resulting from chronic hepatitis B graded by Child-Pugh classifications were recruited and undergone MR portography. Patterns of the collaterals (presented as no collateral, isolated esophageal varices, and esophageal varices combined with other shunts), and diameters of portal venous system including portal vein (PV), left portal vein (LPV), right portal vein (RPV), splenic vein (SV) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) were assessed statistically to determine associations of patterns of collaterals and diameters of the portal veins with Child-Pugh classification. Results: From no collateral, to isolated esophageal varices, and to the varices combined with other shunts, the Child-Pugh classifications tended to increase (r = 0.516, P < 0.001). Diameters of PV, LPV, RPV, SV and SMV tended to increase from Child-Pugh A to B but decrease from B to C. Differences in diameter of LPV and SV were significant between Child-Pugh A-B and C (all P < 0.05) while no differences in diameters of other portal veins were found (all P > 0.05). For discriminating Child-Pugh A-B from C, either a cut-off LPV diameter of 8.98 mm or SV diameter of 9.10 mm achieved a sensitivity of 67%-70%, specificity of 51%-53%. Conclusion: Patterns of portosystemic collaterals and diameters of LPV and SV tend to be associated with Child-Pugh classifications of cirrhosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Many proteins and molecules are involved in the regulation of the pathologic process, however the mechanism has still remained unclear. Our study was intended to look for the related protein markers involved in the regulation of vascular reactivity after hemorrhagic shock. Methods: Differential in-gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry were applied to quantify the differences of protein expression in the superior mesenteric arteries from hemorrhagic shock and normal rats. Results: A total of 2317 differentially expressed protein spots in the superior mesenteric arteries of rats before and after hemorrhagic shock were found, and 146 protein spots were selected for tandem mass spectrometry identification. Thirty-seven differentially expressed proteins were obtained, including 3 uncharacterized proteins and 34 known proteins. Among them, heat shock protein beta-1 and calmodulin were the known proteins involved in the occurrence of vascular hyporesponsiveness. Bioinformatics analysis results showed that 18 proteins were related to vasoconstriction, 11 proteins may be involved in other vascular functions such as regulation of angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. Conclusions: The changes of vascular responsiveness after hemorrhagic shock in rats may be associated with the upregulation or downregulation of previously mentioned protein expressions. These findings may provide the basis for understanding and further study of the mechanism and treatment targets of vascular hyporeactivity after shock. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The issue of surgical site infection (SSI) after appendectomy needs to be re-investigated and analyzed along with this trend. This study aimed to identify risk factors of SSI after appendectomy in recent years. This retrospective study was conducted among patients with acute appendicitis who underwent either laparoscopic or open appendectomy (OA) at 7 general hospitals in China from 2010 to 2013. The incidence of SSI, classified as incisional SSI and organ/space SSI, was investigated. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess independent risk factors associated with overall, incisional, and organ/space SSI, respectively. Among 16,263 consecutive patients, 3,422 (21.0 %) and 12,841 (79.0 %) patients underwent LA and OA, respectively. The incidences of overall, incisional, and organ/space SSI were 6.2, 3.7, and 3.0 %, respectively. The proportion of LAs among both procedures increased yearly from 5.3 to 46.5 %, while the incidences of overall and incisional SSI after appendectomy simultaneously decreased yearly from 9.6 to 4.5 % and from 6.7 to 2.2 %, respectively. In comparison with OA, LA was associated with lower incidences of overall and incisional SSI (4.5 vs 6.7 %, P < 0.001; and 1.9 vs 4.2 %, P < 0.001), but a similar incidence of organ/space SSI (3.0 vs 3.0 %, P = 0.995). After multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, LA was found to be independently associated with a decrease in development of overall SSI [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) OR (95 % CI), 1.24 (1.03-1.70); P = 0.04] or incisional SSI [OR (95 % CI), 1.32 (1.10-1.68); P = 0.01]. With the increasing application trends of laparoscopic procedure, the incidence of SSI after appendectomy declined accordingly. Compared with OA, LA was independently associated with a significantly lower incidence of incisional SSI, but a similar incidence of organ/space SSI.

Few studies have investigated polymorphisms and serum/plasma levels of IL-27 in diseases including cancers. This study has analyzed the associations of IL-27 gene polymorphisms, as well as plasma levels of IL-27, with susceptibility to bladder cancer and clinical outcome. Methods: Three hundred and thirty-two patients (nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)/muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC): 176/156) included in a 60-month follow-up program and 499 controls were enrolled. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs153109 and rs17855750, were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. Plasma concentration of IL-27 was determined by ELISA in 124 patients (NMIBC/MIBC: 50/74) and 151 controls. Results: Significantly increased risk for bladder cancer was associated with AG/GG genotypes of rs153109 (P = 0.029). No GG genotype of rs17855750 was observed in controls, while 4 patients were found to be GG homozygotes, suggesting GG genotype may be associated with bladder cancer risk (P = 0.006). For bladder cancer patients, SNP rs17855750 was also associated with increased risk for MIBC. For MIBC patients, but not NMIBC, TG/GG genotypes of rs17855750 turned out to be a protective factor for overall survival (P = 0.035). Significantly reduced plasma levels of IL-27 were observed in both NMIBC and MIBC patients compared with controls (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our data suggest that polymorphisms and reduced plasma levels of IL-27 may predict the susceptibility to bladder cancer, and rs17855750 may be a useful marker to distinguish patients with high risk of death.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many genetic loci associated with raised serum urate concentrations. However, hyperuricemia alone is not sufficient for the development of gout arthritis. Here we conduct a multistage GWAS in Han Chinese using 4,275 male gout patients and 6,272 normal male controls (1,255 cases and 1,848 controls were genome-wide genotyped), with an additional 1,644 hyperuricemic controls. We discover three new risk loci, 17q23.2 (rs11653176, P = 1.36 x 10(-13), BCAS3), 9p24.2 (rs12236871, P = 1.48 x 10(-10), RFX3) and 11p15.5 (rs179785, P = 1.28 x 10(-8), KCNQ1), which contain inflammatory candidate genes. Our results suggest that these loci are most likely related to the progression from hyperuricemia to inflammatory gout, which will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of gout arthritis.

Patients and methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to October, 2014. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies comparing the clinical outcomes between additional CDT and anticoagulation alone were included. The primary outcomes were postthrombotic syndrome and major bleeding complications. The secondary outcomes included the iliofemoral patency rate, deep venous function, mortality, pulmonary embolism, and recurrent DVT. Results: Three RCTs and 3 non-randomized studies were included. Compared with standard anticoagulation treatment, additional CDT was associated with a significantly higher rate of complete lysis within 30 days (OR = 91; 95% CI 19.28 to 429.46), a higher rate of 6-month patency (OR = 5.77; 95% CI 1.99 to 16.73), a lower rate of postthrombotic syndrome (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96), and a lower rate of venous obstruction (OR = 0.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44). More major bleeding episodes occurred in the CDT group (Peto OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.62 to 2.62). CDT was not found to reduce mortality, pulmonary embolism, or recurrent DVT. Conclusions: Additional CDT therapy appeared to be more effective than standard anticoagulation treatment in improving the venous patency and preventing venous obstruction and postthrombotic syndrome. Caution should be taken when performing CDT given the increased risk of major bleeding. However, no evidence supported benefits of CDT in reducing mortality, recurrent DVT, or pulmonary embolism.

Recent studies revealed that differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into myofibroblasts played an important role in cardiac remodelling and development of heart failure, however, little was known about the underlying mechanism and whether QL treatment being involved. This study aimed to investigate the effects of QL on angiotensin II (AngII)-induced CFs transdifferentiation. Study was performed on in vitro cultured CFs from Sprague-Dawley rats. CFs differentiation was induced by AngII, which was attenuated by QL through reducing transforming growth factor-(1) (TGF-(1)) and -smooth muscle actin (-SMA). Our data showed that AngII-induced IL-6 mRNA as well as typeI and typeIII collagens were reduced by QL. IL-6 deficiency could suppress TGF-(1) and -SMA, and both IL-6 siRNA and QL-mediated such effect was reversed by foresed expression of recombined IL-6. Increase in actin stress fibres reflected the process of CFs differentiation, we found stress fibres were enhanced after AngII stimulation, which was attenuated by pre-treating CFs with QL or IL-6 siRNA, and re-enhanced after rIL-6 treatment. Importantly, we showed that calcineurin-dependent NFAT3 nuclear translocation was essential to AngII-mediated IL-6 transcription, QL mimicked the effect of FK506, the calcineurin inhibitor, on suppression of IL-6 expression and stress fibres formation. Collectively, our data demonstrated the negative regulation of CFs differentiation by QL through an IL-6 transcriptional mechanism that depends on inhibition of calcineurin/NFAT3 signalling.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether angiotensin II (Ang II) could promote the specialization of CSCs into pacemaker-like cells. Mouse CSCs were treated with Ang II from day 3-5, after cell sorting. The differentiation potential of the cells was then analyzed by morphological analysis, flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and patch clamp analysis. Treatment with Ang II resulted in an increased number of cardiac muscle-like cells (32.7 +/- 4.8% vs. 21.5 +/- 4.8%; P<0.05), and inhibition of smooth muscle-like cells (6.2 +/- 7.3% vs. 20.5 +/- 5.1%; P<0.05). Following treatment with Ang II, increased levels of the cardiac progenitor-specific markers GATA4 and Nkx2.5 were observed in the cells. Furthermore, the transcript levels of pacemaker function-related genes, including hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)2, HCN4, T-box (Tbx)2 and Tbx3, were significantly upregulated. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the increased number of pacemaker-like cells. The pacemaker current (I-f) was recorded in the cells derived from CSCs, treated with Ang II. In conclusion, treatment of CSCs with Ang II during the differentiation process modified cardiac-specific gene expression and resulted in the enhanced formation of pacemaker-like cells.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in a more robustly designed larger scale trial. Methods-This is a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Eight hundred sixty-two hospitalized patients with limb paralysis between 3 to 10 days after ischemic stroke onset were allocated acupuncture plus standard care or standard care alone. The acupuncture was applied 5 times per week for 3 to 4 weeks. The primary outcomes were defined as follows: (1) death/disability according to Barthel index and (2) death/institutional care at 6 months. Results-There was a tendency of fewer patients being dead or dependent in acupuncture group (80/385, 20.7%) than in control group (102/396, 25.8%) at 6 months (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.05). The benefit was noted in subgroup receiving >= 10 sessions of acupuncture (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.98). There was no statistical difference in death or institutional care between the 2 groups (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.79). Severe adverse events occurred in 7.6% and 8.3% of patients in the 2 groups, respectively. Conclusions-Acupuncture seemed to be safe in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke. If the potential benefits observed are confirmed in future larger study, the health gain from wider use of the treatment could be substantial.

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the associations of the rs5128 polymorphism with fasting APOC3 and lipid levels. Methods: The following information was abstracted for each study: ethnicity, age, sex, health condition, sample size, genotyping and lipid assay methods, mean and standard deviation or standard error by genotypes for APOC3 and lipid variables. There were 42 eligible studies with 23846 subjects included in this meta-analysis. A dominant model was used for this meta-analysis. Results: The results showed that the carriers of the variant allele G had higher levels of APOC3 [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.31, P < 0.00001], triglycerides (TG) (SMD: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23-0.44, P < 0.00001), total cholesterol (TC) (SMD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.09-0.22, P < 0.00001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (SMD: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.04-0.17, P = 0.001) than the non-carriers. No significant association between the APOC3 rs5128 polymorphism and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was detected under the dominant model (SMD: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.06-0.01, P = 0.156). Conclusions: The results from the present meta-analysis demonstrate a significant association between the APOC3 rs5128 polymorphism and higher levels of APOC3, TG, TC and LDL-C, but further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Eradication of H. pylori can effectively reduce the risk of gastric cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the expression levels of FHIT, IL-8 and P73 in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Methods One hundred and thirty-two patients with functional dyspepsia having first-degree relatives with gastric cancer were prospectively recruited in this study. Nine patients presented with H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer, 61 with H. pylori infection and without family histories of gastric cancer, 6 without H. pylori infection and with family histories of gastric cancer, and 56 without H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer. The protein and mRNA expression levels of FHIT, IL-8 and P73 in gastric mucosa of the subjects were detected by immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results Compared with the patients without H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer, both the protein and mRNA levels of FIHT significantly decreased in patients with H. pylori infection and/or family histories of gastric cancer, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL-8 significantly increased. After eradication of H. pylori, both the protein and mRNA levels of FHIT were significantly higher, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL-8 were significantly lower. However, H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer had no major effect on P73 expression. Conclusions Down-regulation of FHIT and up-regulation of IL-8 may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in the first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients.

To investigate the effects of different target plasma remifentanil concentrations on the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane (MAC) for blocking adrenergic response (BAR) during laparoscopic gynaecological surgery with carbon dioxide insufflation. Methods. Seventy-five gynaecological patients with ASA I-II undergoing laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to three groups. Anaesthesia was induced by sevoflurane, and 0.1 mg kg(-1) of vecuronium i.v. was injected to facilitate tracheal intubation. After intubation the target plasma concentrations of remifentanil in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were adjusted to 0, 1, and 2 ng ml(-1), respectively. The changes in haennodynannics were observed before and after the creation of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. The MAC BAR of sevofiurane in each group was determined by using an up-and-down sequential-allocation technique, and blood samples were collected at corresponding time points to determine the concentrations of remifentanil, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Results. In Groups 1, 2 and 3, the MAC BAR of sevoflurane was 4.6% (CI 95%: 4.3-4.9%), 2.4% (CI 95%: 2.2-2.6%), and 1.7% (CI 95%: 1.4-2.1%), respectively. No significant differences were found in the increase of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and mean arterial pressure after compared with before insufflation of pneumoperitoneum among the three groups. Conclusions. Remifentanil can effectively decrease the sevoflurane concentration to block sympathetic adrenergic response to CO2 pneumoperitoneum stimulus. At similar MAC BAR the haemodynamic and adrenergic response is not affected by the infused remifentanil concentration.

Pathological cardiac hypertrophy increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases while it compensates for poor heart function. This study was designed to investigate the effects of GCIP-27 on heart function in rats with heart failure induced by doxorubicin. Methods and Results Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into the following six groups receiving vehicle (control), doxorubicin (Dox), losartan (6 mg/kg, i.g.) and three doses of GCIP-27 (10, 30, 90 mu g/kg; i.p., bid), respectively. Heart failure was induced by Dox, which was administered at a 20 mg/kg cumulative dose. After 10 weeks of treatment, we observed that GCIP-27 (30, 90 mu g/kg) significantly increased ejection fraction, fraction shortening, stroke volume and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase activity of Dox-treated hearts. Additionally, GCIP-27 decreased myocardial injury, heart weight index and left ventricular weight index, fibrosis and serum cardiac troponin-I concentration in Dox-treated mice. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and real-time PCR experiments indicated that GCIP-27 (10-90 mu g/kg) could markedly upregulate the protein expression of myocardial alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC), Bcl-2, protein kinase C (PKC) epsilon and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) 1/2 as well as the mRNA expression of alpha-MHC, but downregulated the expression of beta-MHC, Bax and PKC beta II, and the mRNA expression levels of beta-MHC in Doxtreated mice. It was also found that GCIP-27 (30, 90 mu g/L) decreased cell size and protein content of cardiomyocytes significantly in vitro by comparison of Dox group. Conclusions GCIP-27 could effectively ameliorate heart failure development induced by Dox. PKC-ERK1/2 signaling might represent the underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of GCIP-27.

Methods > Hepatoma-22 (H22) cells were cultured in RPMI1640. Establish tumor-bearing mice model of liver cancer by injecting intraperitoneally 1 x 10(6)/mL cells into the above-mentioned Balb/c mice. 5-FU alone, BLTA alone or BLTA in combination with 5-FU were used to treat tumor-bearing mice. The tumor size were observed and measured regularly. The growth-inhibiting rate (IR) of tumor was detected. Real-Time PCR and Western blot were used to detect Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 expressions of mRNA and protein in tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice. Detection of apoptotic cells in tumor tissue by HE staining analysis. Detection of the organ index was for evaluate the added-activity of immune organs in mouse. FCM was used to detect T subgroup ratio of spleen cells of tumor-bearing mice. Expression change of mRNA and proteins of Foxp3 and TIM-3 were detected by Real-Time PCR and Western blot in tumor-bearing mice tumor tissue. Results > BLTA and 5-FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of tumor and induced obvious apoptosis, the combined effects were greater than those of the individual agents (P < 0.01). The underlying molecular mechanism of apoptotic process could be up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3. The HE staining indicated that combined treat could both induce tissue cells necrosis and increase immune cells infiltration. Organ index showed that BLTA can enhance the proliferation of immune organs. The ratio of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg significantly decreased and CD4(+) T cell increased in BLTA and 5-FU group (P < 0.01). Compared to NS group, mRNA and proteins expression of Foxp3 and TIM-3 down regulated in BLTA and 5-FU group (P < 0.01). Conclusions > These results show that combined effects of Bifidobacteria lipoteichoic acid and 5-FU on H22 cells were superior to the individual. The combination did not only increase anti-tumor effect, but also could alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy, with inhibiting TIM-3/TIM-3L pathway, cutting down immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg and enhancing cell-mediated immunity.

We retrospectively examined whether there was an association between the selected six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of five DNA repair genes (PARP1-Val762Ala, XRCC1-Arg194Trp, XRCC1-Arg399Gln, XPC-Lys939Gln, BRCA1-Lys1183Arg, and BRCA2-Asn372His) and the clinical outcome of patients with primary small cell carcinoma of esophagus (SCCE), and it showed that the median progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) were 11.8 versus 9.7 months (P = 0.041) and 17.4 versus 14.8 months (P = 0.032) for patients carrying the variant allele (T/C + C/C) and the wild-type allele (T/T) of PARP1-Val762Ala polymorphism, respectively. However, no statistical significance was observed in the other five polymorphic loci (P > 0.05). When these six SNPs were combined, however, patients with at least three variant genotypes had significantly longer PFS and OS compared with those carrying less than three variant genotypes (P = 0.009 and P = 0.007, respectively). The presence of at least three polymorphic variants in certain DNA repair genes may impact on patient survival and could be a potential genomic predictor of clinical response to DNA-damaging treatment in SCCE patients.

However, the use of ESD for tumors of an intermediate size (7-16 mm) is less well documented. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD compared with endoscopic mucosal resection using a cap (EMR-C) for the treatment of 7-16-mm rectal carcinoids. From September 2007 to August 2012, 55 patients with large rectal carcinoid tumors were treated by EMR-C (30 cases) or ESD (25 cases). The en bloc resection rate, pathological complete response (pCR) rate, procedure time, and incidence rates of complications, local recurrence, and distant metastasis were evaluated. The basic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the two groups did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). The mean procedure time was longer for ESD than EMR-C (24.79 +/- 4.89 vs. 9.52 +/- 2.14 min, p < 0.001). The rates of en bloc resection and pCR were higher with ESD than with EMR-C (100 vs. 83.33 %, and 100 vs. 70.00 %, respectively). No patients in the EMR-C group experienced complications. However, in the ESD group, two cases of perforation occurred, and one patient experienced delayed bleeding. These complications were successfully managed via endoscopical therapy. Five cases of local recurrence were detected after EMR-C, whereas no patients experienced recurrence after ESD. Compared with EMR-C, ESD appears to be a more favorable therapeutic option for the treatment of rectal carcinoid tumors less than 16 mm in diameter based on improved rates of pCR and local recurrence.

Emerging evidence suggests that long-term effective antiviral therapy restores the HBV-specific T-cell response from exhaustion. However, the extent to which the cellular immune response can be restored following the persistent suppression of HBV replication by antiviral therapy remains unclear. In order to investigate this question, 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with nucleos(t) ide analogues who demonstrated persistent suppression of HBV replication [defined as undetectable HBV DNA, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative and adherence to antiviral therapy], 22 untreated CHB patients, 15 patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB) and 10 healthy adults were recruited. HBV-specific interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-gamma ELISPOT) assay and HBV-specific T-cell proliferation analysis were performed with a panel of overlapping peptides covering the envelope and core antigens. Data from this study showed that the HBV-specific immune responses to the peptide pools of the envelope and core protein in the treated patients were stronger than those in the untreated CHB patients, but significantly weaker than those in the AHB patients and healthy adults. A higher frequency of response to S than C peptide pools was confirmed by the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the treated CHB patients. The restoration of antiviral immunity was clearly associated with a reduction in HBV DNA and the duration of HBV DNA suppression. In conclusion, the HBV-specific immune responses in the CHB patients can be significantly restored from exhaustion following the persistent suppression of HBV replication as a result of antiviral treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues.

Furthermore it has been demonstrated to possess the ability to induce apoptosis of tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether SMI can induce apoptosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), which are hyperplastic in RA due to defective apoptosis. There is also evidence that allogenic serum may be associated with the induction of apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of serum during SMI-induced apoptosis in RA FLS. The results demonstrated that SMI could induce apoptosis of RA FLS, cultured with fetal bovine serum (FBS), in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, SMI decreased the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B in RA FLS nuclear extracts and inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Fas ligand expression was not detected in RA FLS, in either the presence or absence of SMI. The pro-apoptotic genes B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bc1-2) associated X protein (Bax) and Fas, were shown to be upregulated following SMI stimulation, whereas the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic gene Bc1-2, were downregulated. Upon replacement of FBS with normal human serum, the apoptotic rate and Bax mRNA expression levels following SMI stimulation, were unchanged. However, culturing RA FLS with patient' serum (RPS), restored the apoptotic rate and Bax mRNA expression levels following SMI stimulation. There may be numerous mechanisms by which SMI inhibits RA FLS proliferation. The present study demonstrated that SMI can restore apoptosis of RA FLS cultured with RPS. These results indicate that SMI may have a potential role in the treatment of synovial hyperplasia of RA.

METHODS: A pilot investigation was conducted among 103 migrant individuals with PTB in Nanchong Region, Sichuan Province, China. The QOL and social support of the patients were investigated using a short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire and the Social Support Rating Scale, respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores of the QOL of the migrant population were respectively 12.1, 12.9 and 11.7 for the physical, psychological and environmental domains; these were significantly lower than those of the general Chinese population. Non-parametric tests detected the significant effects of the following: 1) educational levels on all domains, including social relationship; 2) age on all domains, except psychological; 3) personal income on the physical and environmental domains; and 4) subjective support on all domains, except psychological. Multivariate logistic regression analyses confirmed that educational levels and subjective support were significantly associated with the global health status of the migrant population. CONCLUSIONS: The QOL of patients with TB among the migrant population in West China was poor; education and subjective support were important influential factors.

METHODS: Seventy-one cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B and 21 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. All the participants underwent abdominal enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to measure each liver lobe volume, and biochemical workup for testing ALB and Child-Pugh class. All cirrhotic patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to show the presence of cirrhotic esophageal varices. Right liver lobe volume (RV), left medial liver lobe volume (LMV), left lateral liver lobe volume (LLV), and caudate lobe volume (CV) were measured using enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The ratios of RV to ALB (RV/ALB), LMV to ALB (LMV/ALB), LLV to ALB (LLV/ALB) and CV to ALB (CV/ALB) were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether and how the combination of liver lobe volume measured using magnetic resonance imaging and albumin could predict the presence and severity of liver cirrhosis, and the presence of esophageal varices. RESULTS: RV, LMV, LLV and CV decreased (r = -0.51-0.373; all P < 0.05), while RV/ALB increased (r = 0.424; P < 0.05), with the progress of Child-Pugh class of liver cirrhosis. RV, LMV, CV, LLV/ALB and CV/ALB could identify presence of liver cirrhosis; LLV and LMV could distinguish Child-Pugh class A from B; RV, LMV, LLV, CV, RV/ALB and LLV/ALB could distinguish class A from C; RV and LLV/ALB could differentiate B from C; and RV, RV/ALB and CV/ALB could identify presence of esophageal varices (all P < 0.05). Among these parameters, CV/ALB could best identify the presence of liver cirrhosis, with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.860, a sensitivity of 82.0% and a specificity of 83.0%. LLV could best distinguish class A from B, with an AUC of 0.761, a sensitivity of 74.4% and a specificity of 73.1%. RV could best distinguish class A from C, with an AUC of 0.900, a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 84.5%. LLV/ALB could best distinguish class B from C, with an AUC of 0.900, a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 81.5%. RV/ALB could best identify esophageal varices, with an AUC of 0.890, a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 83.5%. CONCLUSION: The combination of liver lobe volume and ALB has potential to identify presence and severity of cirrhosis, and presence of esophageal varices.

However, the relationship between these signaling pathways and CRC has not been clearly described. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Notch1, Jagged1, NF-kappa B and MMP-9 in CRC patients and analyze their correlation with clinicopathological factors. METHODS: Expression of Notch1, Jagged1, NF-kappa B and MMP-9 was visualized by immune-histology in the tumor tissue, adjacent and distant normal tissues from 47 CRC patients without receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. RESULTS: Notch1 (80.8%), Jagged1 (80.8%), NF-kappa B (70.2%) and MMP-9 (76.6%) were overexpressed in cancer tissues compared normal tissues (P < 0.05). The intensity of Notch1, Jagged1 and NF-kappa B expression was associated with histological grading, depth of invasion, TNM staging and lymph node metastasis of CRC. MMP-9 was intimately correlated with depth of invasion, TNMstaging and lymph node metastasis. NF-kappa B, MMP-9 and Notch1 expression was positively correlated (P < 0.05), and the same positive correlation was found among NF-kappa B, MMP-9 and Jagged1 expression (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Notch1, Jagged1, NF-kappa B and MMP-9 probably play a pivotal role during the CRC development, serving as biomarkers for early detection of the recurrence and metastasis and prognosis of CRC.

Method: One hundred and eight patients of thoracalgia were randomly divided into two groups; 60 cases (group A) received dual-source CT scan in flash model at 100KV and contrast medium dose of 74 ml combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination; 48 cases (group B) received retrospectively. ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral acquisition at 120 KV and contrast medium dose of 101 ml. Several image reconstruction techniques were adopted for coronary artery, pulmonary artery and aorta. The imaging quality and the diagnostic value of this technique were evaluated. Coronary artery stenosis of group A was compared against the results of DSA examination. Results: The scan time in group A was obviously shorter than that of group B, i.e., t= 0.7 +/- 0.1 s in group A and t= 7.7 +/- 1.7 s in group A. The image reconstruction phase of coronary artery was 70.4 +/- 15.6% in group A, and the systolic phase accounted for 13.3% of the optimal reconstruction phase. Compared with group B, the radiation dose of group A decreased obviously, i. e. ED=2.7 +/- 0.7 mSv for group A and ED=21.6 +/- 6.0 mSv for group B. Moreover, less contrast agent was consumed in group A than in group B, which was 74 ml in group A and 101 ml in group B. The image quality of aorta and pulmonary artery & vein was grade 1 for all cases in group A, which was the same as with group B. The coronary artery images of group A had better quality, with score of 2.9 +/- 0.1. Of 780 segments, only 2 segments could be effectively diagnosed, showing no statistically significant differences from group B (P>0.05). The coronary artery stenosis revealed by dual-source CT for group A was not significantly different from that by DSA (P>0.05). Conclusion: FLASH dual-source CT scan at reduced radiation dose and reduced contrast medium dose used for triple-rule-out (TRO) examination achieved good image quality and clear visualization of blood vessels. Moreover, this CT scan technique is fast and rapid in diagnosis and suitable for extensive clinical settings.

Plasma lipid levels are conventionally used to predict coronary risk globally, but further studies are required to investigate whether the lipoprotein ratios are superior to conventional lipid parameters as predictors for CHD. Methods: A hospital-based case-control study consisting of 738 CHD patients and 157 control subjects was conducted in a Chinese Han population. Demographic characteristics and plasma lipid or apolipoprotein data were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between the lipoprotein ratios and CHD risk. Results: The CHD group had significantly higher age, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], triglyceride (TG)/HDL-C, total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)/HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B100/apolipoprotein AI (apoB100/apoAl) than the control group (p < 0.05 for all). Moreover, the prevalence of male sex, smoking, and hypertension in the CHD group was significantly higher than in the control group. The results from univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the ratios of TC/HDL-C (OR 1.135, 95% CI 1.019-1.265), LDL-C/HDL-C (OR 1.216, 95% CI 1.033-1.431), non-HDL-C/HDL-C (OR 1.135, 95% CI 1.019-1.265), and apoB100/apoAl (OR 1.966, 95% CI 1.013-3.817) significantly increased the risk for CHD. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the results were not materially altered and each of the four ratios was independently associated with CHD after adjustment for non-lipid coronary risk factors. ApoB100/apoAl showed the strongest association with CHD in both the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the lipoprotein ratios are superior to conventional lipid parameters as predictors for CHD. Of the ratios, apoB100/apoAl is the best to predict CHD risk.

We used a pellet culture model with the aim of determining the applicability of iPS cell-based therapy to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVD). The cell pellet was cultured in an NP cell basal medium comprising Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with transforming growth factor beta 1, dexamethasone, ascorbate-2-phosphate, and 1% ITS-Premix. The pellet was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical staining, and biochemical composition. The differentiation of iPS cells into NP cells was demonstrated by the protein and mRNA expression levels of proteoglycan, collagen II, aggrecan, and CD24. Furthermore, increased hydroxyproline content and dimethylmethylene blue staining demonstrated that the collagen II and glycosaminoglycan content in the NP cells increased with time. We have shown that cultured mouse iPS cells can be induced to differentiate into NP cells. Such proof-of-concept opens up the possibility of producing patient-specific NP cells in a relatively simple and straightforward manner with high efficiency. We are confident that such cells could be immediately useful for the study of IVD disease.	[Liu, K.; Chen, Z.; Zhao, M.; Han, X. W.; Bai, Y.

As well, an elevated rate of emergence delirium (ED) in children has been associated with the application of sevoflurane. The current study's intent is to administer dexmedetomidine, in a single dosage administration, at the initial phase of sevoflurane based anesthesia with regard to the occurrence and severity of ED in children afflicted with cerebral palsy. Participating in the study (American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II) are eighty children ranging in ages two through twelve years. They would be anaesthetised with sevoflurane based anesthesia while undergoing lower limb surgical procedures. The participants were equally distributed to either Group c or Group D. Group C was administered 10 ml saline 0.9%, and Group D was administered dexmedetomidine 0.5 mu g center dot kg(-1). Five minutes prior to commencement of the surgical procedures, the participants received the prescribed pharmaceutical dosages under the anesthesia of sevoflurane. In order to sustain the BIS values in a range of 45 and 55, at 60 second increments, endtidal sevoflurane concentrations (ETsev) were modified. After conclusion of the surgical procedures, in post anesthesia care unit (PACU), the frequency of ED was gauged with Aonos four point scale and the severity of ED was gauged with pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale upon admission (T0), after intervals of five minutes (T5), fifteen minutes (T15) and thirty minutes (T30). Extubation time, emergence time and length of at stay at the PACU were assessed. Relative to Group C, participants of Group D exhibited noticeably shortened times of emergence, extubation and PACU duration of stay. Prior to surgical incision, ETsev was elevated in the control group, (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs 1.6 +/- 0.3; P = 0.023) and amid the initial 20 minutes following the surgical incision (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs 1.1 +/- 0.2; P = 0.016). At intervals of commencement, T0, of five minutes (T5) and fifteen minutes T15, Group D exhibited lower occurrences and severity of ED than those participants in Group C. Dexmedetomidine, given as a bolus dose post induction, was effective in reducing the occurrence and severity of emergence delirium in children with cerebral palsy who were undergoing lower limb surgical procedures under sevoflurane anaesthesia.

Methods: A total of 120 females (age range, 20-40 years) at 35-40 weeks gestation who delivered by cesarean between September, 2014 and December, 2014 were enrolled in our study. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups that received intravenously physiological saline 20 mL (placebo group), lower dose (0.5 mu g kg(-1)) of dexmedetomidine (low-dex gruop) and higher dose (1 mu g kg(-1)) of dexmedetomidine (high-dex group) during cesarean section, following the delivery of the infant and intramuscular hemabate injection. Results: Nausea, vomiting, chest congestion and elevated blood pressure were the most common adverse events of placebo group. Compared with placebo group, the above mentioned adverse reactions decreased significantly in both low-dex group and high-dex group (P<0.05), whereas there were no significant difference between low-dex group and high-dex group (P>0.05). As to patient satisfaction score, low-dex group and high-dex group were all higher than placebo group (P<0.05). Furthermore, there were more patients satisfied with high-dex group than low-dex group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine (0.5 mu g kg(-1) and 1 mu g kg(-1)) were all effective in preventing adverse reactions introduced by hemabate and improve parturients' satisfaction in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. And higher dose (1 mu g kg(-1)) of dexmedetomidine is superior to lower dose (0.5 mu g kg(-1)) in patient satisfaction.

Methods: Inhalation of combustion smoke was administered in rats to induce airway inflammation. Alveolar macrophages (AM) of healthy and smoking rats were isolated at different time points, cultured and then treated with different concentrations of MSP for 24 h. Results: When compared with healthy rats, MSP increased in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of smoking rats in a time dependent manner. In smoking rats, the RON expression in the lung and AM was higher than in healthy rats, and these increases were time dependent. MSP stimulated the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in rat AM cells in a dose dependent manner. MSP also stimulated the release of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-1 beta and IL-10 in rat AM in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, at the same MSP concentration, the contents of MDA, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-1 beta in the AM of smoking rates were higher than in healthy rats, while the IL-10 content and SOD activity were lower than in healthy rats. Conclusion: MSP and its receptor RON are involved in the smoke-induced airway inflammation in rats via promoting AM to release inflammatory cytokines and inducing the increase of oxygen free radical.

The lack of early detection and effective interventions is the main reason. Therefore, considerable ongoing efforts aimed at identifying early PC are currently being pursued using a variety of methods. In recent years, the development of molecular imaging has made the specific targeting of PC in the early stage possible. Molecular imaging seeks to directly visualize, characterize, and measure biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels. Among different imaging technologies, the magnetic resonance (MR) molecular imaging has potential in this regard because it facilitates noninvasive, target-specific imaging of PC. This topic is reviewed in terms of the contrast agents for MR molecular imaging, the biomarkers related to PC, targeted molecular probes for MRI, and the application of MRI in the diagnosis of PC.

Our study mainly analyzed the expression level and function of CASP1 gene transcript variant mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with gout in different TCM syndromes. The expression of CASP1 gene transcript variant and IL-1 beta mRNA in PBMCs were detected in patients with PG [acute phase (AP: 44 cases); nonacute phase (NAP: 52 cases)] and healthy controls (HC: 30 cases) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and/or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expressions of plasma IL-1 beta in patients with PG and HC were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dysregulated expression of the CASP1 gene and its transcript variant, plasma proinflammatory cytokines in all patients with primary gout in different TCM syndromes, correlation analysis showed that there was negative correlation between the expression of CASP1-gamma gene transcript variant mRNA and IL-1 beta protein in APPG group. The study suggested that CASP1 gene and its transcript variant may play a critical role in the inflammatory response of patients with PG in different phases and TCM syndromes.

Plasma miR-23 levels of participants were examined by real-time quantitative PCR. We further detected the correlation of miR-23 and VEGF by molecular and animal assays. Result miR-23 was enriched in not only diseased endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) but also the plasma of CAD patients. Besides, we found out miR-23 was able to suppress VEGF expression and EPC activities. Reporter assays confirmed the direct binding and repression of miR-23 to the 3'-UTR of VEGF mRNA. Knock down of miR-23 not only restored VEGF levels and angiogenic activities of diseased EPCs in vitro, but further promoted blood flow recovery in ischemic limbs of mice. Conclusion Circulating miR-23 may be a new biomarker for CAD and as a potential diagnostic tool. And increased miR-23 level may be used to predict the presence and severity of coronary lesions in CAD patients.

Currently, the primary methods of treatment include pharmacological and surgical treatment. However, approximately one-third of patients exhibit refractory epilepsy. Therefore, a novel approach to epilepsy treatment is necessary. Several studies have confirmed that music therapy can be effective at reducing seizures and epileptiform discharges, thus providing a new option for clinicians in the treatment of epilepsy. Although the underlying mechanism of music therapy is unknown, it may be related to resonance, mirror neurons, dopamine pathways and parasympathetic activation. Large sample, multicenter, randomized double-blind and more effectively designed studies are needed for future music therapy studies.

However, whether and how it reverses cardiac remodeling in rats post myocardial infarction (MI) remains unknown. This study aims to explore related mechanisms linked with cardiac function improvement and attenuation of cardiac remodeling by QL in rats with experimental MI. Methods: MI was induced by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats with LVEF < 50% at four weeks after procedure were treated for another 6 weeks with placebo, QL and captopril. Echocardiography and plasma NT-proBNP were measured at the end of study, and histological studies were performed. Protein expressions of Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), total-Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), hydroxy-HIF-1 alpha (Pro564), VEGF, Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase 3 were examined by Western blot. mRNA expression of NRG-1 and p53 was detected by real-time PCR. Results: Compared with the placebo group, QL improved cardiac function, reduced left ventricular dimension, inhibited interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, increased neovascularization, and attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Meanwhile QL significantly upregulated the expression of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and Caspase 3 expression. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of NRG-1 and downregulation of p53 after QL treatment. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of QL on improving cardiac function and attenuating cardiac remodeling post MI are associated with angiogenesis enhancement and apoptosis inhibition, which may be mediated via activation of NRG-1/Akt signaling and suppression of p53 pathway.

Molecular identity of ramie germplasms using simple sequence repeat markers	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Molecular identity; Ramie; Simple sequence repeat		DNA identity is highly effective and efficient for distinguishing crop varieties regardless of their phenotypic similarities. To establish DNA identity in ramie, 21 simple sequence repeat primers were amplified in 108 accessions of domestic and exotic ramie germplasms. Sixty polymorphic bands were obtained, with an average of 2.9 bands per locus and 2-8 band types per primer locus (average of 5.19 band types). The Simpson's diversity index of the 21 simple sequence repeat loci ranged from 0.158 to 0.808 with an average of 0.612. There was large difference in the specific index in the germplasm tested, from 44.082 to 218.163, with an average of 83.620. Based on allele band type, 8 primer pairs were selected for DNA fingerprinting of the 108 genotypes. The combination of the 8 primer pairs were found to be very effective for distinguishing these genotypes, indicating that they can be used in the molecular DNA identity of ramie.	[Luan, M.

METHODS: Seventy-four cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B and 25 healthy volunteers underwent diffusion-weighted imaging using b values of 0, 500, 800 and 1000 sec/mm(2). The apparent diffusion coefficients of individual liver lobes for b((0,500)), b((0,800)) and b((0,1000)) were derived from the signal intensity averaged across images obtained using b values of 0 and 500 sec/mm(2), 0 and 800 sec/mm(2), or 0 and 1000 sec/mm(2), respectively, and were statistically analyzed to evaluate cirrhosis. RESULTS: The apparent diffusion coefficients for b((0,500)), b((0,800)) and b((0,) (1000)) inversely correlated with the Child-Pugh class in the left lateral liver lobe, the left medial liver lobe, the right liver lobe and the caudate lobe (r=-0.35 to -0.60, all p < 0.05), except for the apparent diffusion coefficient for b((0,1000)) in the left medial liver lobe (r=-0.17, p > 0.05). Among these parameters, the apparent diffusion coefficient for b((0,500)) in the left lateral liver lobe best differentiated normal from cirrhotic liver, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.989. The apparent diffusion coefficient for b((0,800)) in the right liver lobe best distinguished Child-Pugh class A from B-C and A-B from C, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.732 and 0.747, respectively. CONCLUSION: Liver lobe-based apparent diffusion coefficients for b((0,500)) and b((0,800)) appear to be associated with the presence and Child-Pugh class of liver cirrhosis.

Insertion of carmustine wafers into the resection cavity as a treatment for malignant glioma is currently a controversial topic among neurosurgeons. Our meta-analysis focused on whether carmustine wafer treatment could significantly benefit the survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Method: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases without any restrictions on language using the keywords "Gliadel wafers", "carmustine wafers", "BCNU wafers", or "interstitial chemotherapy" in newly diagnosed GBM for the period from January 1990 to March 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies/clinical trials that compared treatments designed with and without carmustine wafers and which reported overall survival or hazard ratio (HR) or survival curves were included in this study. Moreover, the statistical analysis was conducted by the STATA 12.0 software. Results: Six studies including two RCTs and four cohort studies, enrolling a total of 513 patients (223 with and 290 without carmustine wafers), matched the selection criteria. Carmustine wafers showed a strong advantage when pooling all the included studies (HR =0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.49-0.81; P=0.019). However, the two RCTs did not show a statistical increase in survival in the group with carmustine wafer compared to the group without it (HR =0.51, 95% CI =0.18-1.41; P=0.426), while the cohort studies demonstrated a significant survival increase (HR =0.59, 95% CI =0.44-0.79; P<0.0001). Conclusion: Carmustine-impregnated wafers play a significant role in improving survival when used for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. More studies should be designed for newly diagnosed GBM in the future.

To investigate the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine Duliang soft capsule (DSC) in prophylactic treatment for patients with chronic daily headache (CDH). Methods. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted at 18 Chinese clinical centers. The participants received either DSC or placebo for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was headache-free rate (HFR) in a 4-week period between the pretreatment and posttreatment stages. The secondary efficacy measures were the decrease of headache days, the duration of headache attacks, the frequency of analgesic usage, quality of life, disability, and the headache severity (VAS scores). The accompanying symptoms and adverse events were also assessed. Results. Of 584 CDH patients assessed, 468 eligible patients were randomized. 338 patients received DSC, while 111 patients were assigned in the placebo group. Following treatment, there was a 16.56% difference in HFR favoring DSC over placebo (P < 0.01). Significant differences were also observed between DSC and placebo groups in the secondary measures. However, no statistical difference was found between the two groups in the associated symptoms. No severe adverse effects were observed in the study. Conclusions. DSC might be an effective and well-tolerated option for the prophylactic treatment of patients with CDH.

Our recent study has demonstrated that AT-101 enhanced the antitumor effect of cisplatin (CDDP) in a murine model of NSCLC via inhibition of the interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. This study explored the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced anticancer activity of CDDP by AT-101. Our results show that, when compared with monotherapy, AT-101 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of CDDP on proliferation and migration of A549 cells and on tube formation and migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. AT-101 promoted the proapoptotic activity of CDDP in A549 cells. AT-101 also enhanced the inhibitory effect of CDDP on DNA repair and redox activities of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in A549 cells. In tumor tissues from nude mice treated with AT-101 plus CDDP or monotherapy, the combination therapy resulted in greater inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation than the monotherapy. These results suggest that AT-101 can enhance the antitumor activity of CDDP in NSCLC via inhibition of APE1 DNA repair and redox activities and by angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis, but other mechanisms cannot be excluded. We are now conducting a Phase II trial to examine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of combined use of AT-101 plus CDDP in advanced NSCLC patients.

J	Xiong, F; Mou, YZ; Xiang, XY				Xiong, Fen; Mou, Yun-Zhu; Xiang, Xiao-Yan			Inhibition of mouse B16 melanoma by sodium butyrate correlated to tumor associated macrophages differentiation suppression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Sodium butyrate (NaB); TAMs; B16	HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS; MEDIATED APOPTOSIS; CELL-LINE; INDUCTION; POLARIZATION; EXPRESSION; PATHWAY	Objective: As one member of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) family, Sodium butyrate (NaB) was found out that could be used as a differentiation inducer of much cancer cell. But its effects on tumor microenvironment cells are not well recognized. The goal of this research is to investigate the effect of NaB on B16 melanoma and analysis its relevant mechanism. Methods: We observed the effect of sodium butyrate on B16 melanoma in vivo and in vitro. MTT method was performed to detect cell apoptosis rate after treatment. Tumor associated macrophage infiltration condition was detected by flow cytometry. Western-blotting and immunohistochemical method were used to detect the expression of tumor associated macrophage cytokines. Results: A certain concentration of sodium butyrate could effectively inhibit B16 melanoma growth in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition effects related to the suppression of tumor associated macrophage differentiation. At the same time we observed the relevant macrophage factors were down-regulated compared to the control. Conclusion: Sodium butyrate could effectively inhibit B16 melanoma growth through suppressing tumor associated macrophage proliferation and reduce relevant pro-tumor macrophage factors expression, which may help to promote the clinical study of melanoma epigenetic therapy.

Yet, TCM acts as an important complement to modern Western medicine for facilitating drug discovery and development. However, many questions have emerged with TCM development, highlighting the chemical complexity, the fact that TCM preparations contain undefined bioactive compounds that lead to unidentified mechanisms of action, toxicity and adverse effects. These questions concerning the therapeutic efficacy, molecular mechanisms of action and safety issues have prevented broader applications of TCM in the biomedical niche related to drug discovery and development. This review explores the applicability of metabolomics as a systems biology strategy for addressing the above questions associated with the TCM field, which is supposed to considerably promote modern drug discovery and development.

A prospective, randomized, controlled design was used with 180 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy. Subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Group A received visual distraction, Group B received audiovisual distraction, Group C with routine care. Outcome variables included pain, anxiety, and willingness to undergo colonoscopy again if the procedure was to be repeated. No signifi cant difference was found on the pain scores of the 3 groups. However, when groups A and B were further divided into groups A1, A2, A3 (low-, middle-, high-involvement groups), and B1, B2, B3 (low-, middle-, high-involvement groups) according to the level of distraction involvement, signifi cant differences in pain scores were found between 7 groups (A1 and A3, A2 and A3, A1 and B3, A2 and B3, A3 and C, B1 and B3, B3 and C). The pain score of Group A3 was signifi cantly lower than those of groups A1, A2, and C, and the pain score of Group B3 was signifi cantly lower than those of groups B1 and C. The reduction of anxiety levels after procedure was insignifi cant between the 2 intervention groups and control group. The rates of willingness to undergo colonoscopy again if the procedure was to be repeated of the 2 intervention groups were signifi cantly higher than that of the control group. Visual and audiovisual distraction is effective in promoting pain control for patients undergoing colonoscopy and improving their tolerance of the procedure.

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the polymorphism and common illicit drug dependence risk. Method: A total of 25 available studies (26 subgroups) testing the association between the polymorphism and common illicit drug dependence were examined through Oct 2013. Pooled-odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cl) were estimated using fixed- and random-effects models when appropriate. Heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated. Results: We found the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of opioid dependence under homozygote, dominant, and recessive genetic model, respectively (homozygote: OR = 1.546, 95%CI = 1.279-1.87; dominant: OR = 1.265, 95%CI = 1.055-1.516; recessive: OR = 1.409, 95%CI = 1.182-1.680). Subgroup analyses were similar to the results of the total population by ethnicity and quality score. Besides, we also found that Caucasian and low-quality studies were major sources of heterogeneity for opioid dependence. We failed to find any significant association between the polymorphism and stimulants or marijuana neither in total population nor subgroup analyses under any genetic model. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis suggested that DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA polymorphism might be associated with opioid dependence risk, but not associated with stimulants or marijuana dependence.

Materials and Methods: From September 2007 to June 2013, 88 consecutive patients (60 men and 28 women; mean [+/- standard deviation] age, 51.1 +/- 14.4 years; range, 19-78 years) underwent CT-guided CNB, which was performed by two experienced chest radiologists in our medical center. Out of 88 cases, 56 (63%) were diagnosed as malignant, 28 (31%) as benign and 4 (5 h) as indeterminate for CNB of pleural lesions. The final diagnosis was confirmed by either histopathological diagnosis or clinical follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and complication rates were statistically evaluated. Influencing factors (patient age, sex, lesion size, pleural-puncture angle, patient position, pleural effusion, and number of pleural punctures) were assessed for their effect on accuracy of CT-guided CNB using univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis. Results: Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 89.2%, 86.1%, 100%, 100%, and 67.8%, respectively. The influencing factors had no significant effect in altering diagnostic accuracy. As far as complications were concerned, occurrence of pneumothorax was observed in 14 (16%) out of 88 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed lesion size/pleural thickening as a significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR]: 8.744, p = 0.005) for occurrence of pneumothorax. Moreover, presence of pleural effusion was noted as a significant protective factor (OR: 0.171, p = 0.037) for pneumothorax. Conclusion: CT-guided CNB of pleural lesion is a safe procedure with high diagnostic yield and Low risk of significant complications.

Polymorphisms in the eNOS gene may influence the risk of intracranial aneurysm (IA), but the results of existing researches are still inconsistent. Thus, we performed the present meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation between eNOS polymorphisms (T786C, G894T, 27-bp-variable number of tandem repeat [VNTR]) and IA risk. Case-control studies evaluating the association between the eNOS polymorphisms and IA risk were searched in PubMed, Ovid & Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese Wanfang datasets with the last search up to July 15, 2014. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the association between eNOS polymorphisms and IA and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the random or fixed-effects model. Finally, 10 studies for T786C polymorphism (1819 cases and 1893 controls), 9 studies for G894T polymorphism (1393 cases and 1508 controls), and 7 studies for 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism (1281 cases and 1406 controls) were included in the meta-analyses. In the overall analysis, no evidence of association between eNOS polymorphisms and susceptibility of IA was found. When subgrouped by race descent, significantly increased risk was detected among Asians for T786C polymorphism( heterozygous comparison of codominant model: OR = 1.294, 95% CI = 1.025-1.634; dominant model: OR = 1.277, 95% CI = 1.019-1.600), but not in Caucasians or the other 2 polymorphisms. Our meta-analysis suggested that T786C polymorphism was associated with increased risk of IA among Asians, whereas G894T and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms might have no influence on the susceptibility of IA.

The present paper proposed an analytical strategy for distinguishing between normal and malignant colorectal tissues by combining the use of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with chemometrics. The successive projection algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (SPA-LDA) was used to seek a reduced subset of variables/wavenumbers and build a diagnostic model of LDA. For comparison, the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) based on full-spectrum classification was also used as the reference. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for a preliminary analysis. A total of 186 spectra from 20 patients with partial colorectal resection were collected and divided into three subsets for training, optimizing, and testing the model. The results showed that, compared to PLS-DA, SPA-LDA provided more parsimonious model using only three wavenumbers/variables (4065, 4173, and 5758 cm(-1)) to achieve the sensitivity of 84.6%, 92.3%, and 92.3% for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, and the specificity of 100% for each subset. It indicated that the combination of NIR spectroscopy and SPA-LDA algorithm can serve as a potential tool for distinguishing between normal and malignant colorectal tissues.

The present study aimed to examine whether AT-101 could increase the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells to cisplatin (CDDP) and the underlying mechanisms. We evaluated the efficacy of the sequential treatment with AT-101 and CDDP using both in vitro and in vivo models. Our results showed that as compared to AT-101 or CDDP monotherapy, or AT-101 plus CDDP concurrent treatment, the sequential treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and induced tumor cell death. Moreover, the efficacy of the sequential treatment was also confirmed in a mouse A549 xenograft model. Our study revealed that AT-101 inhibited the reduced status of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and attenuated APE1-mediated IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation by decreasing IL-6 protein expression; suppressing the STAT3-DNA binding; and reducing the expression of the downstream antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In conclusion, AT-101 enhances the sensitivity of A549 cells to CDDP in vitro and in vivo through the inhibition of APE1-mediated IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation, providing a rationale for the combined use of AT-101 and CDDP in non-small cell lung cancer chemotherapy.

However, the results have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate whether DW-MR imaging can differentiate between these two diseases. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were utilized to find relevant articles published between January 2001 and January 2014. A Stata version 12.0 and a Meta-Disc version 1.4 were used to describe primary results. Twelve studies with 594 patients, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were enrolled for the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of DW imaging was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.95) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93) respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy women with unilateral LEL and 25 without LEL after cervical or endometrial cancer treatments underwent MRI examinations of their calves. Total thickness of soft-tissue (TT), muscle thickness (MT), and subcutaneous tissue thickness (STY) of the calf, and the difference between the affected and contralateral unaffected calf regarding TT (DU), MT (DMT), and STY (DSTT) were obtained using fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging in the middle of the calves. The volume of the calf and difference in volume (DV) between calves were obtained by the method of water displacement. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the validity of MRI measurements by volume measurements in staging LEL. RESULTS: There was a close correlation between volume and TT for the affected (r = 0.927) or unaffected calves (r = 0.896). STY of the affected calf, and DU or DSTT of the calves were closely correlated with volume of the affected calf or DV of the calves (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed significant differences in TT, SIT, volume of the affected calf, DU, DSTT, and DV between stages except in volume of the affected calf or in DV between stage 0 and 1. For staging LEL, DSTT showed the best discrimination ability among all the parameters.

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used for genotyping. Genotype distribution and allelic frequencies between patients and controls were compared. In all three single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL23R studied, the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of rs10889677 differed significantly between patients and controls. The frequency of allele C of rs10889677 was significantly increased in cases compared with controls (0.2898 vs. 0.1833, odds ratio 1.818, 95 % confidence interval 1.349-2.449). The result indicates that IL23R may play an important role in the susceptibility of bladder cancer in Chinese population.

Totally 240 patients with advanced esophageal cancer were randomly divided into experimental group (endoscopic sequential treatment, 126 cases) and control group (traditional treatment, 114 cases) with a 2-year follow-up period. The experimental group was randomly divided into three subgroups: group A: local chemotherapeutic drug injection with ordinary metal stent implantation; group B: local chemotherapeutic drug injection with iodine-125 particle implantation; and group C: radiofrequency (RF) therapy with ordinary metal stent group. The control group was also randomly divided into three subgroups: group D: local chemotherapeutic drug injection group; group E: RF therapy group; and group F: common metal stent implantation group. The survival rate, survival quality, adverse reactions, and complications were compared among these groups. A significant improvement of curative effect was found in the experimental group. Group A and B had higher survival rate and survival quality, and lower esophagotracheal fistula incidence and metastasis rate, compared with group C. There was no significant difference in survival rate between group A and group B, while the quality of life was higher in group B than in group A. While patients in group B had lower esophagotracheal fistula incidence and metastasis rate comparing with group A. Local chemotherapeutic drug injection combined with iodine-125 particle stent might be an effective sequential treatment to improve the life quality of advanced esophageal cancer patients.

We investigated the effects of in vitro cyclic stretch on cultured spinal ligament cells derived from OPLL (OPLL cells) and non-OPLL (non-OPLL cells) patients. The expression levels of the osteoblast-specific genes encoding osteocalcin (OCN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and type I collagen (COL I) were assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Vimentin protein expression in OPLL cells was detected by Western blotting. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) interference targeting vimentin was performed in OPLL cells induced by mechanical stress, and the expression levels of OCN, ALP and COL I were assessed. In response to mechanical stretch, the expression levels of OCN, ALP, and COL I were increased in OPLL cells, whereas no change was observed in non-OPLL cells. Furthermore, knockdown of vimentin protein expression by siRNA resulted in an increase in the mRNA expression levels of OCN, ALP, and COL I. The down-regulation of vimentin induced by mechanical stress plays an important role in the progression of OPLL through the induction of osteogenic differentiation in OPLL cells.

Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether individual components that constitute CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score contribute equally to the ischemic stroke risk, particularly in patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1. The objective was to describe and compare the risk of ischemic stroke of the six individual components constituting CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc among AF patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1. Methods and ResultsWe studied all patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 and no antithrombotic therapy from our cohort of 9,727 Chinese AF patients. A total of 548 patients were studied: 190 patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 and 358 patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1. Of those with a baseline CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1, 51.1% patients aged 65-75; 29.3% patients were female; 12.0% had hypertension; 4.5% had heart failure; 2.5% had diabetes; and 0.6% had vascular disease. After 1,758 patient-years of follow-up, the annual incidence of stroke was 2.4% and 6.6% for patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 and 1, respectively. Compared with patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0, patients with hypertension leading to CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 were at the highest risk of stroke (Hazard ratio [HR]: 9.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-35.6), followed by patients aged 65-74 (HR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.3-6.6) and female gender (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8). Heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease were not associated with stroke. ConclusionIn AF patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1, hypertension confers the highest risk for stroke among other risk factors comprising the score. A more aggressive thromboprophylaxis strategy may be justified among AF patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 due to hypertension.

The CNTs were purified under mild optimal experimental conditions, and the characteristics of the purified CNTs were kept well. After purification, the content of nickel in the CNT materials was reduced from 1% to 0.4%, with a removal efficiency of 60%. The produced volatile nickel carbonyl was separated and introduced into an argon/hydrogen flame atomizer-atomic fluorescence spectrometer for measuring nickel atomic fluorescence signal to real-time monitor the purification process.

Methods: We conducted a survey among medical students at six universities across southwest China using a 58-item questionnaire regarding knowledge and perceptions of HPV, cervical cancer, and HPV vaccines. Results: We surveyed 1878 medical students with a mean age of 20.8 years (standard deviation: 1.3 years). Of these, 48.8% and 80.1% believed cervical cancer can be prevented by HPV vaccines and screening respectively, while 60.2% and 71.2% would like to receive or recommend HPV vaccines and screening. 35.4% thought HPV vaccines ought to be given to adolescents aged 13-18 years. 32% stated that women should start to undergo screening from the age of 25. 49.2% felt that women should receive screening every year. Concern about side effects (38.3% and 39.8%), and inadequate information (42.4% and 35.0%) were the most cited barriers to receiving or recommending HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. Females were more likely to accept HPV vaccines (OR, 1.86; 95% CI: 1.47-2.35) or cervical cancer screening (OR, 3.69; 95% CI: 2.88-4.74). Students with a higher level of related knowledge were much more willing to receive or recommend vaccines (P<0.001) or screening (P<0.001). Students who showed negative or uncertain attitudes towards premarital sex were less likely to accept either HPV vaccines (OR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47-0.96), or screening (OR, 0.68; 0.47-0.10). Non-clinical students showed lower acceptability of cervical screening compared to students in clinical medicine (OR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56-0.96). Conclusions: The acceptability of HPV vaccines and cervical cancer screening is relatively low among medical students in southwest China. Measures should be taken to improve knowledge about cervical cancer and awareness of HPV vaccines and screening among medical students at university.

The dendrimer comprises six tyrosine-derived [Mn(EDTA)(H2O)](2-) moieties coupled to a cyclotriphosphazene core. Variable temperature (ONMR)-O-17 spectroscopy revealed a single water co-ligand per Mn-II that undergoes fast water exchange (k(ex)=(3.0 +/- 0.1)x10(8)s(-1) at 37 degrees C). The 37 degrees C per Mn-II relaxivity ranged from 8.2 to 3.8mM(-1)s(-1) from 0.47 to 11.7T, and is sixfold higher on a per molecule basis. From this field dependence a rotational correlation time was estimated as 0.45(+/- 0.02)ns. The imaging and pharmacokinetic properties of the dendrimer were compared to clinically used [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)](2-) in mice at 4.7T. On first pass, the higher per ion relaxivity of the dendrimer resulted in twofold greater blood signal than for [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)](2-). Blood clearance was fast and elimination occurred through both the renal and hepatobiliary routes. This Mn-II containing dendrimer represents a potential alternative to Gd-based contrast agents, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease where the use of current Gd-based agents may be contraindicated.

Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 163 patients with cholecystolithiasis and 163 non-cholecystolithiasis control subjects admitted to our institution between March 2011 and September 2013 were included in this cross-sectional evaluation. There were 98 women and 65 men in cholecystolithiasis group with an average age of 57616 years (range 2586 years). There were 87 women and 76 men in the control group with an average age of 41616 years (range 14-77 years). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and total abdominal adipose tissue (TAT) of all the subjects at navel level were measured on abdominal MRI. According to the visceral adipose area (cut-off point VAT = 100 cm 2), study subjects were divided into 1) increased accumulation of intra-abdominal fat and 2) normal distribution of intra-abdominal fat. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of fat with the presence of cholecystolithiasis, adjusted for age and sex. Results: The incidence of increased intra-abdominal fat accumulation in the cholecystolithiasis group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P = 0.000). After adjusting for age and sex, cholecystolithiasis was associated with a one standard deviation increment in the waist circumference (WC) (OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.01,1.93; p = 0.00), VAT (OR = 4.26; 95% CI: 1.85,5.29; p = 0.00), VAT/SAT (OR = 8.66; 95% CI: 1.60,12.63; p = 0.00), and VAT/TAT (OR = 6.73; 95% CI: 4.24,12.18; p = 0.00), but not with fat content in the abdominal subcutaneous fat (p = 0.19). Conclusions: The visceral adipose tissue and distribution proportion of abdominal adipose tissue are correlates of cholecystolithiasis.

However, these studies have a modest sample size and convey inconclusive results. The aim of this study was to determine, in a meta-analysis, the diagnostic performance of quantitative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in distinguishing pancreatic carcinoma from mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. Methods We determined the sensitivities and specificities across studies. A summary receiver operator characteristic (sROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). Results The pooled sensitivity of DWI was 0.86 (95% Cl: 0.80-0.91) and the pooled specificity was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72-0.89). The AUC of the sROC was 0.91 (95% Cl: 0.88-0.93). Conclusions DWI may be a potentially technically feasible tool for differentiating pancreatic carcinoma from mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. However, large-scale randomized control trials are necessary to assess its clinical value.

Methods: Ninety-eight liver cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B undergoing magnetic resonance (MR) portography, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for grading esophageal varices were enrolled. Diameters of the LGV and its originating vein - the splenic vein (SV) or portal vein (PV) - were measured on MR imaging. Statistical analyses were performed to identify the association of the diameters with the endoscopic grades. Results: Univariate analysis showed that the SV was predominantly the originating vein of the LGV, and diameters of the LGV and SV were associated with grades of esophageal varices. Diameters of the LGV (P = 0.023, odds ratio [OR] = 1.583) and SV (P = 0.012, OR = 2.126) were independent risk factors of presence of the varices. Cut-off LGV diameters of 5.1 mm, 5.9 mm, 6.6 mm, 7.1 mm, 7.8 mm and 5.8 mm; or cut-off SV diameters of 7.3 mm, 7.9 mm, 8.4 mm, 9.5 mm, 10.7 mm and 8.3 mm, could discriminate grades 0 from 1, 0 from 2, 0 from 3, 1 from 3, 2 from 3, and 0-1 from 2-3, respectively. Conclusion: Diameters of the LGV and SV are associated with endoscopic grades of esophageal varices.

The aim of the present meta-analysis was to assess both the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin versus simvastatin, one of the most commonly used statins. Methods A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases was undertaken. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of simvastatin versus pitavastatin, published up to February 2014, were identified. Trials were included if they (1) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration; (2) included patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia; (3) studied outcomes included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); and (4) were published in the English language. A fixed-effects model was used for data analysis if no significant heterogeneity was present; otherwise a random-effects model was used. Efficacy is reflected by the mean difference in the percentage change of plasma lipid profiles. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are presented as risk ratio (RR). Results A total of 1,468 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated similar efficacy of pitavastatin (versus simvastatin) in lowering LDL-C. Pitavastatin also had similar effects to simvastatin on other major aspects of plasma lipids, including TC, TG and HDL-C. Somewhat in contrast to common belief (based on distinct metabolism by P450 subtypes), the two statins did not differ in the incidence of TEAE. Conclusions In clinical trials, pitavastatin was comparable to simvastatin in both efficacy and safety profile. Largescale, high-quality observational studies are required to determine whether the advantage of pitavastatin in metabolism profiles could be translated into noticeable benefits.

MethodsTwo groups of patients (N=192) were treated in different ways, respectively. Group A (N=95) was treated with chemonucleolysis only (the injection of oxygen-ozone combined with collagenase into the lumbar disc and the epidural space); group B (N=97) was treated with chemonucleolysis and PCB. After the treatment, the patients were followed-up, and the therapeutic effect was assessed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months by the relative pain reduction, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. ResultsIn group A, treatment success rate was 64.2% (61 of 95), 82.1% (78 of 95), 84.2% (80 of 95), and 86.3% (82 of 95) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. In group B, treatment success rate was 86.5% (84 of 97), 89.6% (87 of 97), 93.8% (91 of 97), and 91.7% (89 of 97) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in outcome between two groups at 1 week, but there were no statistically significant difference in outcome between two groups at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. VAS scores and ODI were significantly decreased in both group A and group B, when compared with the baseline values in the same group at all points of follow-up. Group B produced a significant reduction in the VAS scores and ODI when compared with group A at: 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month follow-up. ConclusionsComputer tomography (CT)-guided chemonucleolysis combined with PCB leads to rapid pain relief, fewer postoperative pain of collagenase injection happen, and should be regarded as a useful treatment for the management of LDH.

A meta-analysis	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; CYSTIC MASS LESIONS; DIAGNOSIS; MR; TUMORS; DISCRIMINATION	AIM: To explore the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the discrimination of brain abscess from other ring-enhancing brain lesions through meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PUMBED, OVID, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, from January 1995 to March 2013, were searched for studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of DWI in the discrimination of brain abscess lesions. Using the data collected, pooled sensitivities and specificities across studies were determined, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated, and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were constructed. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria and were considered for the analysis. The pooled sensitivity values and pooled specificity values including 95% confidence intervals (Cl) were 0.95 (0.87-0.98) and 0.94 (0.88-0.97). The pooled positive LR (95% CI) was 4.13(2.55-6.7); the pooled negative LR (95% CI) was 0.01 (0-1.7); and the area under the curve of the symmetric SROC was 0.98. CONCLUSIONS: DWI has high sensitivity and specificity for the differentiation of brain abscess from other intracranial cystic mass lesions. (C) 2014 The Royal College of Radiologists.

One-pot synthesis of antibacterial monomers with dual biocidal modes	JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY			English	Article						Antibacterial; Biofilm; Dual biocidal modes; Interface; Universal adhesive	AMMONIUM SILANE COATINGS; QUATERNARY AMMONIUM; IN-VITRO; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; DENTAL ADHESIVES; PHASE-SEPARATION; BONDING ABILITY; NANO-SILVER; SI-29 NMR; BIOFILM	Objectives: The present study reported a method for preparing a blend of antibacterial quaternary ammonium silanes and quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silane (QAMS) based on the sol-gel reaction between dimethyldiethoxy silane and two trialkoxysilanes, one with an antibacterial quaternary ammonium functionality and the other with a methacryloxy functionality. Methods: Reaction products of the sol-gel reaction were characterised by direct infusion mass spectrometry, FTIR and proton, carbon and silicon NMR. This blend of monomers was incorporated into an experimental universal adhesive for evaluation of antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans biofilms, microtensile bond strength and cytotoxicty. Retention of quaternary ammonium species on polymerised adhesive, leaching of these species from the adhesive and the ability of resin-dentine interfaces to inhibit S. mutans biofilms were evaluated over a 3month water-ageing period. Results: The antibacterial adhesive version killed bacteria in S. mutans biofilms not only through the release of non-copolymerisable quaternary ammonium silane species (release-killing), but also via immobilised quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silane that are copolymerised with adhesive resin comonomers (contact-killing). Contact-killing was retained after water-ageing. The QAMS-containing universal adhesive has similar tensile bond strength as the control and two commercially available universal adhesives, when it was used for bonding to dentine in the etch-and-rinse mode and self-etching mode. Incorporation of the antimicrobial quaternary ammonium species blend did not adversely affect the cytotoxicity of the universal adhesive formulation. Conclusions: Instead of using quaternary ammonium dimethacrylates and nanosilver, an alternative bimodal antimicrobial strategy for formulating antimicrobial universal dentine adhesives is achieved using the one-pot sol-gel synthesis scheme. Clinical Significance: The QAMS containing universal dentine adhesives with dual antimicrobial activity is a promising material aimed at preventing second caries and prolonging the longevity of resin composite restorations.

Individual genetic association studies examining the relationship between the ABCG2 gene polymorphisms and gout have yielded inconsistent results. This study aims to evaluate the association between the ABCG2 gene variants and gout using meta-analysis. Materials and methods. Relevant studies were identified by searching databases extensively. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated using a random-effect or fixed-effect model. A Q statistic was used to evaluate homogeneity, and Egger's test and funnel plot were used to assess publication bias. Subgroup analyses on ethnicities and sex were also performed. Results. A total of 7 studies, including 2185 gout patients and 8028 controls from 5 countries or regions, were included and identified for the current meta-analysis. It was found that the A allele or AA genotype of the ABCG2 Q141K polymorphism (rs2231142) had an increased risk of gout in the general population (A allele, p < 0.00001 and AA genotype, p < 0.00001, respectively). On the contrary, CC homozygote played a protective role against the risk of gout (p < 0.00001). Similar results were found in subgroup analyses. However, there was a significant heterogeneity among studies. Conclusions. Existing evidence indicates that the Q141K polymorphism (rs2231142, the A allele and AA genotype) is associated with an increased risk of gout.

The aim of this study is to explore the association between PDCD6 genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to bladder cancer and survival of patients with bladder cancer. Two tag SNPs of PDCD6, rs3756712 and rs4957014, were genotyped in 332 patients with bladder cancer and 509 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and correlated with patients' survival. The frequencies of G allele and GG genotype of rs3756712 in patients were significantly lower than that of controls (P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 0.68 for G allele; P = 0.024, OR = 0.53 for GG genotype in the recessive genetic model, respectively). The GT genotype of rs4957014 was associated with decreased susceptibility to bladder cancer in the overdominant genetic model (P = 0.023, OR = 0.72). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a significant higher risk for death in superficial bladder cancer patients harboring GG homozygous of rs3756712 (P < 0.001), and an increased risk for recurrence in invasive bladder cancer patients carrying GT heterozygous of rs4957014 (P = 0.04). Multiple Cox regression analysis identified rs3756712 GG genotype as an independent prognostic factor for death in superficial bladder cancer patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.11, P = 0.01), and rs4957014 GT genotype as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in invasive bladder cancer patients (HR = 1.93, P = 0.03). PDCD6 may represent a biomarker candidate gene that could help to identify a group of patients at high risk for recurrence and death.

A number of studies have demonstrated a critical role for autophagy in osteosarcoma development, therapy and drug resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the autophagy-mediated chemotherapy resistance of osteosarcoma cells remain largely unknown. In the present study, we determined the autophagy and microRNA-155 (miR-155) expression induced by chemotherapeutic drugs in osteosarcoma cells. Then we determined the promotory role of miR-155 to the chemotherapy-induced autophagy. Our results demonstrated that microRNA-155 (miR-155) expression was highly induced during chemotherapy of osteosarcoma cells, and this was accompanied by upregulated autophagy. The increased miR-155 expression levels upregulated anticancer drug-induced autophagy in osteosarcoma cells and ameliorated the anticancer drug-induced cell proliferation and viability decrease. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR-155 mediated drug-resistance in osteosarcoma cells by inducing autophagy. The present study recognized a novel mechanism of chemoresistance in osteosarcoma cancers.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the potential association of IL-17 polymorphisms with multiple sclerosis (MS) in Chinese Han patients. Two SNPs, rs763780 of IL-17F gene and rs2275913 of IL-17A gene were genotyped in 622 MS patients and 743 healthy controls by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). Allele and genotype frequencies distribution of the two SNPs were examined between patients and controls using the Chi-Square test. All genotypic and allelic frequencies of the tested IL-17 polymorphisms in control cohort were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A significantly increased frequency of rs763780 TT genotype (corrected p value (Pc) = 0.024, odds ratio = 1.472, 95% CI = 1.133-1.913) and T allele (corrected P (Pc) = 0.018, odds ratio = 1.446, 95%CI = 1.134-1.844) was detected in MS patients compared with controls. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs2275913 in IL-17A gene were not different between patients with MS and controls. These results suggest that rs763780 is associated with multiple sclerosis in a Chinese Han population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of miR-20a in colorectal cancer (CRC) development remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression of miR-20a was compared between CRC tissue samples and the normal adjacent mucosa using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The association of miR-20a expression with clinicopathological characteristics was assessed using appropriate statistical analysis. The migration and invasion of SW480 cells was examined following transfection of the cells with either miR-20a precursor or a negative control miRNA precursor. The effect of miR-20a on the EMT in CRC cells in vitro was also analyzed. The regulatory effect of miR-20a on SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) was evaluated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Relative expression levels of miR-20a were significantly higher in CRC tissue than those in the normal adjacent mucosa, and high expression of miR-20a correlated with lymph node metastases and distant metastases. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with increased miR-20a levels exhibited unfavorable overall survival. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that miR-20a was an independent prognostic factor. The transfection of SW480 CRC cells with miR-20a promoted migration and invasion in vitro, and the upregulation of miR-20a induced EMT in CRC cells. An inverse correlation between the levels of miR-20a and SMAD4 was observed in patients with CRC. Overexpression of miR-20a in CRC cells decreased SMAD4 expression and decreased SMAD4-driven luciferase reporter activity. The present study revealed that miR-20a was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. Furthermore, miR-20a induced EMT and regulated migration and invasion of SW480 cells, at least in part via suppression of SMAD4 expression. The present study suggests that miR-20a may serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC.

Materials and Methods: Our Institutional Review Board approval was obtained in this retrospective study. Sixty-nine subjects had both FSPGR and LAVA-Flex sequences. Two radiologists independently scored the acquisitions for image quality, fat suppression quality, and artifacts and the values obtained were compared with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. According to the signal intensity (SI) measurements, the uniformity of fat suppression, the contrast between muscle and fat and normal liver and liver lesions were compared by the paired t-test. The liver and spleen SI on the fat-only phase were analyzed in the fatty liver patients. Results: Compared with FSPGR imaging, LAVA-Flex images had better and more homogenous fat suppression and lower susceptibility artifact (qualitative scores: 4.70 vs. 4.00, 4.86% vs. 7.14%, 4.60 and 4.10, respectively). The contrast between muscle and fat and between the liver and pathologic lesions was significantly improved on the LAVA-Flex sequence. The contrast value of the fatty liver and spleen was higher than that of the liver and spleen. Conclusion: The LAVA-Flex sequence offers superior and more homogenous fat suppression of the abdomen than does the FSPGR sequence. The fat-only phase can be a simple and effective method of assessing fatty liver.

Design: Correlation studies were searched independently in the EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases. The primary endpoints of interest were spontaneous sinus rhythm (SSR) after declamping, perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality (within 30 days). Setting: A hospital. Participants: Randomized controlled trials. Intervention: A meta-analysis of 12 studies. Measurements and Main Results: The 12 included trials recruited a total of 2866 participants; 1357 patients received cold crystalloid cardioplegia, and 1509 patients received cold blood cardioplegia. The pooled analysis showed no significant difference favoring either cold crystalloid cardioplegia or cold blood cardioplegia in terms of spontaneous sinus rhythm (SSR) after declamping (789/1028 [76.75%] v 773/ 1025 [75.41%], relative risk (RR) = 0.92 [0.76, 1.13], p = 0.43 with 6 studies included), mortality (within 30 days) (20/1335 [1.50%] v 24/1469 [1.63%], relative risk (RR) = 1.09 [0.62, 1.91], p = 0.77 with 11 studies included), atrial fibrillation (AF) (329/1043 [31.54%] v365/1040 [35.10%], RR =0.90 [0.80, 1.01], p = 0.08 with 6 studies included) or stroke (45/1114 [4.04%] v 20/1240 [1.61%], RR = 2.18 [0.69, 6.93], p = 0.19 with 4 studies included). The aggregate data showed that the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction was lower in patients who received cold blood cardioplegia (CB) (32/1310 [2.44%] v 17/1434 [1.19%], RR = 2.30 [1.33, 3.98], p = 0.003 with 11 studies included).

In the present study a recombinant plasmid, pReceiver-M03-FBL20 expression plasmid was constructed, which overexpressed FBXL20; this was transfected into Lovo cells to form Lovo-FBL20 cells. The FBXL20 expression level was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. The cell viability and invasion capacity were measured using cell counting kit 8, Transwell chamber and wound healing assays, respectively. The associated genes, including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, c-Myc, SET nuclear oncogene, protein phosphatase-2A, Axin, p53 and caspase 3, were detected by qPCR and western blotting. It was demonstrated that the FBXL20 expression level was markedly upregulated in the Lovo-FBL20 cells transfected with pReceiver-M03-FBL20 expression plasmid, compared with that of the Lovo cells. In addition, the cell viability and invasion capacity of the Lovo-FBL20 cells were significantly increased. These increases correlated with a significant upregulation in the expression level of beta-catenin and c-Myc, and a downregulated expression level of E-cadherin. The results of the present study indicate that FBXL20 may mediate the ubiquitin degradation of E-cadherin resulting in an increased invasive ability of malignant cells.

However, the development of safe, efficient, and targetable gene delivery systems remains a major challenge in gene therapy. The unique material characteristics of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), including high surface area, facile surface modification, controllable size, and excellent magnetic properties, make them promising candidates for gene delivery. The engineered MNPs with modifiable functional surfaces and bioactive cores can result in several advantageous diagnostic and therapeutic properties including enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity, long permeation and retention in the circulatory system, specific delivery of therapeutic genes to target sites. In this review, the updated research on the preparation and surface modification of MNPs for gene delivery is summarized.

GSTs detoxify exogenous and endogenous substances by conjugation to reduced glutathione. We characterized BmGSTD4, an antenna-specific GST, in male silkmoths. The full-length mRNA of Bmgstd4 was cloned by RACE-PCR and contained an open reading frame of 738 bp encoding a 245 amino acid protein. The antenna specificity of BmGSTD4 was validated at the mRNA and protein levels and BmGSTD4 was shown to localize in the sensillum of male silkmoth antennae. Homology modeling and multi-sequence alignment suggested that BmGSTD4 was a typical GST belonging to the delta class and had a canonical GST fold with a conserved N-terminus, including a glutathione-binding site and a C-terminal domain harboring a hydrophobic substrate-binding site. Restricted expression of BmGSTD4 in silkmoth antennae combined with GST activity suggested that BmGSTD4 was involved in the detoxification of harmful chemicals.

Prevention and administration of VRFs can be a vital strategy for delaying cognitive impairment. This study aimed to determine the impact of VRFs on cognitive function of the aged people from Chongqing, Southwest China. Methods: A total of 597 participants (60 years) from hospital and community population were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Participants were screened for hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Blood pressure (BP) and blood lipid were also measured. Cognitive function was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. Logistic regression analysis was used to look for VRFs impacting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Then we investigated the relationship between different types of vascular diseases and MCI. Results: A total of 457 participants showed normal cognitive function and 140 participants showed MCI. After adjusting for age, gender, and education, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hypertension, CHD, systolic BP, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were independently associated with MCI; however, CVD, diastolic BP, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with MCI. Moreover, vascular diseases significantly contributed to MCI compared with no vascular disease; however, no significant difference in incident MCI was found among different combinations of vascular diseases. Conclusions: Hypertension, CHD, TC, and LDL-C are independent risk factors for MCI. Moreover, patients with vascular diseases have a higher risk of MCI; however, the amount of vascular diseases does not increase the risk of MCI.

The levels of ox-LDL, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in the plasma of 41 gout patients [28 in acute phase episode, 13 in intermittent phase (IP)], and in 40 healthy controls. The relationship between ox-LDL and inflammation was also explored by measuring the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma. The plasma levels of ox-LDL, hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in patients with gout in the acute phase compared to those in the IP group and healthy controls (P < 0.05), but the levels of TGF-beta were significantly lower in the acute phase group than in the IP group and healthy controls (P < 0.01). The levels of ox-LDL in the gout patients in the IP were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that the levels of ox-LDL were positively correlated with hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha (r = 0.343, r = 0.386, r = 0.659, P < 0.01, respectively), but negatively correlated with TGF-beta levels in patients in the acute phase (r = -0.240, P < 0.05). The levels of ox-LDL in gout patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. The changes in ox-LDL levels may be associated with enhanced inflammation in gout patients.

Traditionally, EndMT is considered as a source for fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and it is extensively investigated in physiologic cardiac development as well as in pathologic tumor and fibrosis. Recently, new studies have found that EndMT-transformed cells had 'stemness', which means they could differentiate into chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and adipoblasts in differential culture, respectively. This gives EndMT a bright application future in tissue engineering and regeneration, especially for the formation of cartilage and bone.

A comprehensive systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including both English and Chinese databases was conducted to assess the efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of LEP. Methods: Revised STRICTA (2010) criteria were used to appraise the acupuncture procedures, the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. A total of 19 RCTs that compared acupuncture and/or moxibustion with sham acupuncture, another form of acupuncture, or conventional treatment were included. Results: All studies had at least one domain rated as high risk or uncertain risk of bias in the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results from three RCTs of moderate quality showed that acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture. Results from 10 RCTs of mostly low quality showed that acupuncture or moxibustion was superior or equal to conventional treatment, such as local anesthetic injection, local steroid injection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or ultrasound. There were six low quality RCTs that compared acupuncture and moxibustion combined with manual acupuncture alone, and all showed that acupuncture and moxibustion combined was superior to manual acupuncture alone. Conclusion: Moderate quality studies suggest that acupuncture is more effective than sham acupuncture. Interpretations of findings regarding acupuncture vs. conventional treatment, and acupuncture and moxibustion combined vs. manual acupuncture alone are limited by the methodological qualities of these studies. Future studies with improved methodological design are warranted to confirm the efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion for LEP.

On this basis, the excited states geometry structure was optimized by the CIS method, and finally the fluorescence emission spectra were calculated through the TD-DFT method. The results showed that: the four compounds, a large conjugated system, is preferably coplanar structure. Because of introducing hydroxyl and halogen atom on the benzene ring, the molecular pi-electron conjugation is relatively larger, emission wavelength is relatively longer, and fluorescence spectra show different degrees of red shift. As the electron donating group is hydroxy, the fluorescence phenomenon is more obviously red shifted.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between YB-1 expression and the prognosis of patients with early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL. Materials & methods: To clarify the roles of YB-1 in early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL, we used immunohistochemical studies to examine YB-1 expression in 36 early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL specimens. Results: Subsequently, YB-1 expression was correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Higher expression of YB-1 was associated with an increased potential for relapse, poor disease-free survival and reduced overall survival. Discussion: Higher expression of YB-1 could be an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL. Understanding the biology of YB-1-mediated pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL.

Plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Apo B-100 and Apo A-I were analyzed at baseline and before and after the HC/LF diet. The results show that, when compared with before the HC/LF diet, only the male G carriers experienced increased HDL-C (p = 0.008) and Apo A-I (p = 0.005) after the HC/LF diet. Decreased TC in both males and females and increased TG in females were found regardless of the genotype after the HC/LF diet. LDL-C decreased in all the subjects although the decrease was not significant in the female G carriers. These results demonstrate that the G allele of LPL rs326 associates with the elevated levels of HDL-C and Apo A-I after the HC/LF diet in males of the healthy Chinese Han Youth.

We aimed to evaluate whether sclerotherapy with estimated ethanol concentration was helpful in improving the success rate for treatment of symptomatic simple hepatic cysts. Methods: Forty-five patients with 52 symptomatic simple hepatic cysts were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one patients (24 cysts, group A) were treated by sclerotherapy without estimated ethanol concentration and 24 patients (28 cysts, group B) with estimated ethanol concentration. The Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the difference in characteristics and treatment outcomes of the subjects between these two groups. Results: The mean cyst size before and after treatment were 8.4 cm and 2.3 cm, respectively, in group A, and 8.2 cm and 0.8 cm, respectively, in group B. There was no significant difference in the initial size of hepatic cysts between the groups. However, the final size was significantly smaller in group B (P = 0.022). The mean ethanol exposure time was 18.3 minutes in group B, which was less than that in group A (P < 0.001). The success rate was significantly higher in group B (96.4%) than in group A (70.8%) (P = 0.03). There were no major complications in either group. Conclusion: CT-guided sclerotherapy with estimated ethanol concentration yields better results than those without estimated ethanol concentration in the treatment of symptomatic simple hepatic cysts.

However, the mechanisms of HBV reactivation following chemotherapy remain unclear. Epirubicin is an anthracycline drug used in chemotherapy to treat numerous types of malignancy, including breast cancer, acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and stomach cancer. Epirubicin acts by intercalating DNA strands and inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis. In this study, it was demonstrated that epirubicin directly upregulated the levels of in vitro HBV replication in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to epirubicin for 24 h induced >11- and 6-fold increases in the levels of intracellular and secreted HBV DNA, respectively. In concordance with the elevated levels of HBV DNA, the expression levels of HBV pregenomic RNA, intracellular HBV surface and HBV core antigens, and secreted HBV e antigen were significantly increased by treatment with 0.5 mu M epirubicin. Notably, epirubicin promoted cellular excretion of HBV nucleocapsids, which are closely associated with the pathological effects of HBV, including acute liver failure. In conclusion, epirubicin exhibited a direct stimulatory effect on HBV replication and this may be a novel mechanism of HBV reactivation following cytotoxic anticancer chemotherapy.

Given these hypothesis the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HCQ in the inhibition of autophagy and the induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer SiHa cells. Cervical cancer SiHa cells were cultured with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) as positive control of autophagy or treated with HCQ as part of the experimental groups. LC3 and P62/SQSTM1 were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting, respectively in order to evaluate initially autophagosome formation and their degradation. Specific green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 was subsequently detected by fluorescence microscopy in order to confirm the formation of autophagosomes. MTT and flow cytometry were adopted respectively to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of the SiHa cells. miRNA-9* was also investigated. The results demonstrated that HCQ increased the expressions of LC3 mRNA and LC3II protein and GFP-LC3 signalling but reduced the expression of p62/STSQM1 in cervical cancer SiHa cells. These results indicated HCQ has the ability to inhibit autophagy as incapable of degrading the autophagosome. However, HCQ may promote SiHa cell apoptosis as the MTT, apoptotic assay and miRNA-9* results revealed. HCQ has the ability to inhibit autophagy by blocking the degradation of autophagosomes and subsequently facilitates the apoptosis of cervical cancer SiHa cells.

This paper brings forward a new idea for to get regular crystallike CP nanoparticles via the structure-directing role which can be attributed to the dipole and pi-pi interaction between oligomers. The regular hexagonal prism or equilateral triangle shapes PoPD nanoparticles can be easily prepared with our new way. The mechanism is proved by analyzing the morphology of precursor at the early stage of hydrothermal progress. We also explored the feasibility of using nano-sized PoPD hexagonal prisms for Cu2+ supersensitive fluorescence detection. The ultra-sensitive of PoPD hexagonal prisms is remarkable.

Materials and MethodsSixteen piglets were prospectively used to model liver fibrosis and underwent liver DCE-MRI followed by biopsy on the 0, 5th, 9th, 16th, and 21st weekends after modeling of fibrosis. Time of peak (TOP), time to peak (TTP), positive enhancement integral (PEI), maximum slope of increase (MSI), and maximum slope of decrease (MSD) were measured and statistically analyzed for the monitoring and staging. ResultsAs fibrosis progresses, TOP and TTP tended to increase, whereas MSI, MSD, and PEI tended to decrease (all P < 0.05). TOP, TTP, and MSI could discriminate fibrosis stage 0 from 1-4, 0-1 from 2-4, 0-2 from 3-4, and 0-3 from 4; PEI could distinguish the above-mentioned stages except 0-3 from 4; and MSD could distinguish stage 0-3 from 4, and 0 from 1-4 (all P < 0.05). For predicting stage 1, 2, and 3, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of MSI was largest among all parameters; for stage 4 AUC of TTP was largest.

Although there are no conclusive data to support the survival benefits of early detection or early treatment for recurrence, an early and accurate diagnosis of recurrence is critical to optimize therapy. Purpose To compare the diagnostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (18FDG) with conventional imaging techniques (CITs) for the detection of lung cancer recurrence. Material and Methods A meta-analysis was performed, with systematic searches conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases (up to 31 December 2011). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) values were calculated for 1035 patients reported in 13 articles. Summary receiver-operating characteristic curves (SROC) were also generated. Results The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) for PET, PET/CT, and CITs were 0.94 (0.91-0.97), 0.90 (0.84-0.95), and 0.78 (0.71-0.84), respectively. The pooled specificity (95% CI) for PET, PET/CT, and CITs were 0.84 (0.77-0.89), 0.90 (0.87-0.93), and 0.80 (0.75-0.84), respectively. Regarding sensitivity, lower values were associated with CITs than PET (P=0.000) and PET/CT (P=0.005), and there was no significant difference between PET/CT and PET (P=0.102). Regarding specificity, values for PET/CT and PET were significantly higher than for CITs (both P=0.000), and there was no significant difference between PET/CT and PET (P=0.273). In the SROC curves, a better diagnostic accuracy was associated with PET/CT than PET and CITs. Conclusion PET/CT and PET were found to be superior modalities for the detection of recurrent lung cancer, and PET/CT was superior to PET.

MicroRNAs participated in various physiopathological processes; common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pre-miRNAs have been shown to be associated with susceptibility to several human diseases. We evaluated the associations of the hsa-mir-196-a2/rs11614913 T/C, hsa-mir-146a/rs2910164 C/G, and hsa-mir-499/rs3746444 A/G polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs with the risk of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. The three polymorphisms were identified in 296 ischemic stroke patients and 391 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequency of the allele G of hsa-mir-499/rs3746444 A/G showed significant association with ischemic stroke when compared with controls (OR = 1.509, 95%CI = 1.151-1.978, P = 0.003). Increased ischemic stroke risks were associated with rs3746444 A/G genotypes in different genetic model (homozygote comparison: P = 0.045, OR = 2.084, 95%CI = 1.019-4.262; heterozygote comparison: P = 0.024, OR = 1.489, 95%CI = 1.063-2.087; dominant genetic model: P = 0.007, OR = 1.563, 95%CI = 1.135-2.153). Similar results were obtained by adjusted fully risk factors. However, we failed to find any association between the alleles and genotypes of rs2910164 C/G and rs11614913 T/C SNPs and ischemic stroke, respectively (p > 0.05). The present study provided evidence that hsa-mir-499/rs3746444 A/G polymorphism might be associated with a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population, indicating that the common genetic polymorphism in pre-microRNAs contributed to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.

Methods: Two hundred and five consecutive patients with clinically confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis due to hepatitis B and 40 healthy control individuals were enrolled in this study and underwent abdominal triphasic enhanced scans using MR imaging. Spleen maximal width (W), thickness (T) and length (L), together with RV and spleen volume (SV), were measured utilizing MR imaging. Spleen multidimensional index (SI) was obtained by multiplying previously acquired parameters WxTxL. Then statistical assessment was performed to evaluate the ability of these parameters, including RV, SV, RV/SV and SI, to identify the presence of cirrhosis and define Child-Pugh class of this disease. Results: SV and SI tended to increase (r = 0.557 and 0.622, respectively; all P<0.001), and RV and RV/SV tended to decrease (r = -0.749 and -0.699, respectively; all P<0.001) with increasing Child-Pugh class of cirrhosis. All the parameters, including RV, SV, RV/SV and SI, might be the indicators used to discriminate the patients with liver cirrhosis from the control group, and to distinguish these patients between Child-Pugh class A and B, between B and C, and between A and C (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.609-0.975, all P<0.05). Among these parameters, RV/SV was the best noninvasive factor for the discrimination of liver cirrhosis between Child-Pugh class A and B (AUC = 0.725), between A and C (AUC = 0.975), and between B and C (AUC = 0.876), while SI was the best variable to distinguish the cirrhosis patients from the control group (AUC = 0.960, P<0.05). Conclusion: RV/SV should be used to identify the severity of cirrhosis, while SI can be recommended to determine the presence of this disease.

Design The N-DDP score model followed the principles of the traditional DDP (T-DDP) score model (DDP-China for 2000) proposed in 1991 and of food grouping in the dietary pagoda for Chinese residents in 2007, and made detailed ratings by expressing the food weight coefficient, reasonable maximum limit of the score and an algorithm of the deserved score for each group of foods after considering current nutritional problems of Chinese residents. The N-DDP score model was validated against the NRF93 index with linear regression analysis and compared with the T-DDP score model. Settings One set of dietary data was extracted from the diet recommended by the dietary pagoda for Chinese residents in 2007 and the literature on dietary surveys in China. The other two sets of dietary data were from a dietary survey in 2011. DDP scores for all three dietary data sets were calculated with the N-DDP score model and the T-DDP score model. Subjects All items of dietary records in the three dietary data sets were included in the present study. Results All DDP scores obtained with the N-DDP score model were positively correlated (P = 0000) with the NRF93 index. DDP scores obtained with the N-DDP score model had higher R-2 with the NRF93 index than those of the T-DDP score model, as well as higher values. Conclusions It can be considered that the N-DDP score is a more accurate and convenient tool to evaluate current individual and group diet for Chinese residents.

In this paper, the poly(o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) nanospheres were synthesized via chemical oxidation polymerization of o-phenylenediamine (oPD) monomers by (NH4)(2)S2O8 (APS) at room temperature. It is interesting that when this fluorescent nanosphere was doped by F, S and Se via a simple hydrothermal progress, the fluorescence spectrum remarkably changed. The emission peak of F-doped and S-doped PoPD nanosphere was at 411 nm and 530 nm, the spectrum blue shift can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of F and S. On the other side, the emission peak of Se-doped PoPD nanospheres were at 594 nm and can be attributed to the electronic donor effect of Se. These nanomaterials can be used as ultra-sensitive fluorescent detection system (ppb level) for Cu2+, Ca2+, Hg2+ and H2O2. The tunable spectrum and sensing performance of this system is interesting and significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This switch system can be triggered by redox procedure. When this copolymer is oxidized by H2O2, the switch is "off". The switch system is "on" when glutathione (GSH) is added. This switch system has good stability, excellent selectivity and specificity. What is more, the low detective limit indicates (detection limit: 10(-12) M) this switch system can be used as an ultra-sensitive fluorescent probe for H2O2 or GSH. For the mechanism of switch processes, XPS results show the change of binding mode of Se in this copolymer is the main cause. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To investigate the association between APOE polymorphisms and CJD risk, we performed a meta-analysis. We used odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) to assess the strength of the association. The frequency of putative risk alleles in control subjects was estimated with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Cochran's Q statistic and the inconsistency index (I-2) were used to test heterogeneity. Egger's test and an inverted funnel plot were used to assess bias. Our study included 11 published case-control studies with APOE genotyping, involving a total of 1001 CJD patients and 1211 controls. Overall, the APOE 34 (OR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.09-1.72), and APOE 44 (OR 3.16, 95% CI: 1.37-7.26) genotypes and the APOE 4 (OR 1.41,95% CI: 1.08-1.85) allele were associated with an increased risk of CJD, and the APOE 33 (OR 0.81,95% CI: 0.67-0.97) genotype tended to protect against CID. However, we did not find significant evidence supporting associations of the APOE 22 (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.45-2.93), APOE 23 (OR 0.84, 95% Cl: 0.64-1.09), or APOE 24 (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 0.70-2.77) genotypes, nor the APOE 2 (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.73-1.42) or APOE 3 (OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.65-1.02) alleles with CJD using a fixed-effects model. Our results support a genetic association between APOE polymorphisms and CJD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Sixteen normal kittens (4-wk of age) were randomly divided into two groups: control and amblyopic. Amblyopia was produced by atropinization of one eye in eight kittens. Four (2 normal and 2 amblyopia) kittens were sacrificed at weeks 3, 6, 9, or 12 post-treatment respectively. Expression of VIP-mRNA in the visual cortex-17 was detected through in-situ hybridization. Neurons in the visual cortex were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The number of neurons was analyzed via light microscopy (LM). Results: VIP-mRNA expression was increased with age in control kittens but remained nearly static in age-matched anisometropic amblyopic kittens (p<0.05). The number of VIP-positive cells of amblyopic kittens decreased dramatically when compared to normal age-matched kittens (p <0.05). The total comparison between different positive ranks suggested a significant difference. The degree of expression between these two groups was significantly different. Ultrastructurally, in the control group, the nudear membrane of most neurons was discernable and chromatin was evenly distributed within the nucleus. Abundant cytoplasm and tubular-shaped mitochondria were observed. These cells were also rich in Golgi bodies, ribosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. In amblyopic kittens, nuclei of most neurons were aggregated, the number of ribosomes and Golgi bodies was reduced, mitochondria were swollen, and mitochondrial cristae were shortened or even absent. The endoplasmic reticulum was distended and reduced in magnitude. Conclusions: VIP appears to play an important role in visual development, and its mRNA expression is affected by visual experiences. Visual dysfunction may down-regulate the expression of VIP-mRNA by impairing the structure and function of the neurons in the visual cortex, finally leading to amblyopia.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate post-transplant outcomes, survival times, and mortality from cardiovascular complications, sepsis, and graft failure in these patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE, and Cochrane library and Web of Science databases for studies published through September 1, 2012 of patients who underwent liver transplantation for NASH or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). All original studies from single institutions that reported outcomes of patients with or without NASH after liver transplantation were considered. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for patients with NASH, compared with patients without NASH; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Our final analysis included 9 publications, on 717 patients with NASH and 3520 without, all of whom underwent liver transplantation. Similar proportions of patients with and without NASH who received liver transplants survived for 1, 3, and 5 years (OR for survival of patient with NASH 1 year after liver transplantation, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-1.00; P [.05; OR 3 years after transplantation, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.67-1.40; P [.86; OR 5 years after transplantation, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.77-1.56; P [.63). Patients with NASH had a greater risk of death from cardiovascular complications after liver transplantation (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.01-2.70; P[. 05) and from sepsis (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.17-2.50; P[. 006). However, patients with NASH were at lower risk of graft failure compared with patients without NASH (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.89; P [.03). CONCLUSIONS: Similar proportions of patients with and without NASH survive for 1, 3, and 5 years after liver transplantation. However, patients with NASH are more likely to die from cardiovascular complications or sepsis. More attention and careful consideration are therefore required in selecting patients with NASH for liver transplantation, along with aggressive management of cardiovascular complications and sepsis after transplantation.

METHODS: Fluorescent probes were used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LOVO cells. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to examine the migration and invasion of LOVO cells. Expression of CLIC1 mRNA and protein, p-ERK, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. METHODS: H-R treatment increased the intracellular ROS level in LOVO cells. The mRNA and protein expression of CLIC1 was elevated under H-R conditions. Functional inhibition of CLIC1 markedly decreased the H-R-enhanced ROS generation, cell migration, invasion and phosphorylation of ERK in treated LOVO cells. Additionally, the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 could be regulated by CLIC1-mediated ROS/ERK pathway. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CLIC1 protein is involved in the metastasis of colon cancer LOVO cells via regulating the ROS/ERK pathway in the H-R process.

Aberrant expression of miR-378 has been found in some types of cancer. However, effects and potential mechanisms of miR-378 in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been explored. Methods: Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate miR-378 levels in CRC cell lines and 84 pairs of CRC cancer and normal adjacent mucosa. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were utilized to determine the association of miR-378 expression with survival of patients. MTT and invasion assays were used to determine the role of miR-378 in regulation of CRC cancer cell growth and invasion, respectively. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice. Luciferase assay was performed to assess miR-378 binding to vimentin gene. Results: In this study, we confirmed that miR-378 significantly down-regulated in CRC cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, patients with low miR-378 expression had significantly poorer overall survival, and miR-378 expression was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. Over-expression of miR-378 inhibited SW620 cell growth and invasion, and resulted in down-regulation of vimentin expression. However, miR-378 knock-down promoted these processes and enhanced the expression of vimentin. In addition, we further identified vimentin as the functional downstream target of miR-378 by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of vimentin. Conclusions: In conclusion, miR-378 may function as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in inhibiting tumor growth and invasion. Our present results implicate the potential effects of miR-378 on prognosis and treatment of CRC cancer.

PM proteins are important determinants for PM structure and formation. In this study, the silkworm Bombyx mori midgut PM protein BmCDA7 was identified by proteomic tools. The full-length BmCDA7 cDNA is 1357 bp; the deduced protein is composed of 379 amino acid residues and includes a 16 amino acid residue signal peptide, a putative polysaccharide deacetylase-like domain and 15 cysteine residues present in three clusters. The heterologously expressed proteins of the BmCDA7 gene in yeast displayed chitin deacetylase activity. Expression of B. mori BmCDA7 was detected in the midgut at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The BmCDA7 gene was expressed by the newly hatched silkworm larvae until day seven of the fifth instar and was expressed at a high level in the newly exuviated larvae of different instars. The functions and regulatory mechanism of BmCDA7, however, need further investigation.

One hundred eighty consecutive patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma underwent radical surgery, and the tumors were staged as pT1-3N0M0 by postoperative pathology. Lymph nodes recurrence was detected with computed tomography 3-120 months after the treatment. The patterns of lymph nodes recurrence including stations, fields and locations of recurrent lymph nodes, and impacts on patterns of survival were statistically analyzed. There was a decreasing trend of overall survival with increasing stations or fields of postoperative lymph nodes involved (all P<0.05). Univariate analysis showed that stations or fields of lymph nodes recurrence, and abdominal or cervical lymph nodes involved were prognostic factors for survival (all P<0.05). Cox analyses revealed that the field was an independent factor (P<0.05, odds ratio = 2.73). Lymph nodes involved occurred predominantly in cervix and upper mediastinum (P<0.05). In conclusion, patterns of lymph node recurrence especially the fields of lymph nodes involved are significant prognostic factors for survival of patients with pT1-3N0M0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

TLR4 mRNA, TLR4 and NF kappa Bp65 proteins expression and IL1 beta production were measured in 52 acute GA (AGA) and 34 non-acute GA (NAGA) male patients and 78 male healthy subjects (HC). NF kappa Bp65 transcriptional activity and IL1 beta production were measured after TLR4 inhibition with anti-TLR4 antibody in peripheral whole blood from 13 AGA patients. The TLR4, NF kappa Bp65 and IL1 beta expression was significantly increased in the AGA group than those in the NAGA or HC group (P < 0.05, respectively), also the levels were higher in the NAGA group comparing with those in the HC group (P < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, moderate positive correlations were observed between concentration of uric acid and the TLR4 mRNA level, serum IL1 beta production (r = 0.649, 0.616), and strong positive correlation was observed between TLR4 mRNA level and serum IL1 beta (r = 0.848) in 52 AGA patients. On the other hand, NF kappa Bp65 level and IL1 beta production were dramatically reduced after TLR4 blockade with anti-TLR4 antibody in peripheral blood from the AGA patients (P < 0.05, respectively). TLR4-NF kappa B-IL1 beta signaling might play a crucial role in the development of acute inflammation in primary gout patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of miR-183 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its potential relevance to clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival.Materials and methodsSurgical specimens of cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa were obtained from 94 patients with CRC. The relative expression levels of miR-183 in the cancer and the normal adjacent mucosa were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. We analyzed their correlation with clinicopathological parameters and prognostic value.ResultsThe relative expression levels of miR-183 were significantly higher in CRC tissues than in the normal adjacent mucosa (P<0.001), and a high expression of miR-183 correlated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.030), lymph node metastasis (P=0.012), and distant metastasis (P=0.049). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high miR-183 expression had a poor overall survival (P=0.002). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that increased expression of miR-183 was an independent predictor of overall survival.ConclusionThe increased expression of miR-183 is closely related to advanced clinical stage, lymph node and distant metastases, and poor prognosis of CRC, indicating that miR-183 may serve as a predictive biomarker for the prognosis or the aggressiveness of CRC.

Methods: Ninety-eight patients were randomly enrolled to receive either three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy alone (group A) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (group B). A radiation dose of 62-70 Gy/31-35 fractions was delivered to the recurrent tumor. Furthermore, the patients in group B simultaneously received weekly doses of cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)), and the survival outcomes and toxic effects were compared. Results: The response rate of group B (91.8%) was significantly greater than that of group A (73.5%) (chi(2) = 5.765, P = 0.016). The 1- and 3-year survival rates of group B (85.7% and 46.9%, respectively) were also greater than those of group A (69.4% and 28.6%, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the 5-year survival rates. The numbers of patients who died of distant metastases in groups A and B were 13 (26.5%) and 5 (10.2%), respectively (chi(2) = 4.356, P = 0.036). Acute radiation-related esophagitis and granulocytopenia in group B was frequent. However, intergroup differences in terms of late toxicity were not significant. Conclusions: Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) is a practical and feasible technique to treat the recurrence of mediastinal lymph node metastases of postoperative esophageal cancer. In addition, concurrent chemotherapy can increase local tumor control, decrease the distant metastasis rate, and increase the long-term survival rate.

However, preoperative right ventricular (RV) echocardiography parameters that predict adverse events in these patients are poorly understood. Methods and Results-We studied 74 patients (age, 58 +/- 10 years; men, 27%) with significant tricuspid regurgitation who consequently underwent tricuspid annuloplasty during left-side heart valve surgery. A total of 26 adverse events (22 heart failures and 4 cardiovascular deaths) occurred during a median follow-up of 26 months. RV midcavity diameter (hazard ratio=2.44; 95% confidence interval=1.48-4.02; P<0.01), RV longitudinal dimension (hazard ratio=1.64; 95% confidence interval=1.10-2.45; P=0.02), and tricuspid valve tethering area (hazard ratio=3.25; 95% confidence interval=1.71-6.19; P<0.01) were independently associated with adverse events after adjustment for age and New York Heart Association class III/IV. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that RV midcavity diameter (area under the curve=0.74; P<0.01) and tricuspid valve tethering area (area under the curve=0.70; P=0.04) were most associated with adverse events at the 1-year follow-up. The presence of either a large RV midcavity diameter or tricuspid valve tethering area was predictive of adverse outcome at 1 year after tricuspid annuloplasty. Conclusions-The present study demonstrates that RV geometry dimensions, namely RV midcavity diameter and tricuspid valve tethering area, are important preoperative measures associated with adverse events in patients undergoing tricuspid annuloplasty.

Animals were randomly divided into three groups: the control group, the AA group, and the Nec-1 group. Mouse AA model was established by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg/d) and busulfan (20 mg/kg/d) for 12 days. The Nec-1 group mice received intraperitoneal injection of Nec-1 (2 mg/kg/d) for 12 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg/d) and busulfan (20 mg/kg/d) for 12 days. The control mice received intraperitoneal injection of equal volume of saline. At 12 h after the last intraperitoneal injection, blood and bone marrow tissues were collected from mice. Peripheral blood cells were analyzed using hematology analyzer and the histological changes of bone marrow tissues were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The levels of RIP3 and RIP3 in bone marrow were measured using Western blot analysis and the interaction of RIP1 and RIP3 proteins was investigated on the basis of immunoprecipitation analysis. ELISA was used to measure the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and FLT-3L in bone marrow tissue supernatant. Apoptosis and necrosis of bone marrow cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blot showed that the expression of RIP1 and RIP3 was significantly increases in AA mice compared to the normal controls. Immunoprecipitation detected the pro-necrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex, suggesting that RIP1 and RIP3 mediated necroptosis may involved in the damage of bone marrow cells. Compared to the AA mice, Nec-1 group mice exhibited significantly increase of peripheral blood cells and mononuclear cells in bone marrow tissues and decrease of the apoptosis/necrosis of bone marrow cells. In addition, we observed significant decrease of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and FLT-3L in bone marrow tissue supernatant in the Nec-1 group mice compared to AA mice. Our results suggest that Nec-1 can prevent the development of AA by inhibiting bone marrow cells necrosis and the production of inflammatory mediators. RIP1 and RIP3-mediated necroptosis may involve in the pathogenesis of AA induced by cyclophosphamide and busulfan in mice.

However, previous studies of any association between CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI polymorphism and bladder cancer risk have yielded conflicting results. In this study, we performed a more precise estimation of the relationship by a meta-analysis based on the currently available evidence from the literature. Method: To assess the effect of CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI polymorphism on bladder cancer susceptibility, a meta-analysis of 6 available studies with 1,510 cases and 1,560 controls were performed through Feb 2014. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of association for CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI polymorphism under different genetic models. Results: When available studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, we found that the C1C2 and C2C2 genotypes of CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI polymorphism significantly decreased bladder cancer risk under different genetic models (heterozygote: OR=0.766, 95% CI=0.613-0.957, P-OR=0.019; homozygote: OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.303-0.858, P-OR=0.011; dominant: OR=0.733, 95% CI=0.593-0.905, P-OR=0.004; recessive: OR=0.565, 95% CI=0.337-0.947, P-OR=0.030). Subgroup analysis indicated that C2C2 genotype was significantly associated with decreased bladder cancer risk under the homozygote genetic model in Caucasians. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis suggested that the CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI polymorphism might be associated with bladder cancer susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. Further studies are needed to validate the above conclusion.

The expression of integrin beta 1 and VEGF and MVD in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas and normal hypopharyngeal tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The Image-Pro Plus software was used to determine the mean optical density of the immunohistochemical images. Integrin beta 1 expression was significantly higher in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissues (78.00%) than in normal hypopharyngeal tissues (35.00%; P = 0.001) and significantly differed across pathologic grades and different T stages, and regarding the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). VEGF expression was significantly higher in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissues (74.00%) than in normal hypopharyngeal tissues (30.00%; P = 0.002), VEGF overexpression differed significantly across different pathologic grades and different T stages, and regarding the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The MVD count was significantly higher in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissues (37.10 +/- 5.95) than in normal hypopharyngeal tissues (8.70 +/- 3.34; P = 0.000). MVD differed significantly across different pathologic grades and different T stages, and regarding the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The expression of integrin beta 1 and VEGF and the MVD count exhibited no significant differences in terms of age, gender, history of smoking, and clinical stages (P > 0.05). VEGF expression was positively associated with the MVD count of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (r = 0.582, P = 0.000); however, integrin beta 1 was not associated with VEGF or MVD (P > 0.05). Integrin beta 1 and VEGF are overexpressed and MVD increased in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. VEGF is positively correlated with MVD.	[Hong, Y. M.; Xu, Z.

The influence of turbulence on the spreading of apertured partially coherent beams is studied quantitatively by examining the relative mean-squared width, which is defined as the ratio of the mean-squared width of an apertured partially coherent beam in turbulence to the mean-squared width of the same beam in free space. On the other hand, the range of turbulence-independent propagation, also a reasonable measure of the resistance of a beam to turbulence, is obtained by examining the mean-squared width. It is shown that the spreading of apertured partially coherent beams is less affected by turbulence with smaller truncation parameter delta and coherence parameter alpha than with larger delta and alpha. In addition, the influence of turbulence on the spreading of apertured partially coherent beams increases first and then decreases due to increasing waist width w(0).

Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index Expanded. The literature reviewed included meta-analyses, randomized and nonrandomized prospective studies. We utilized mean difference (MD) to measure the mean number of incontinence episodes and the mean number of nnicturitions, and OAB questionnaire (OAB-q) and odds ratio (OR) to measure adverse events rates. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.1 software for statistical analysis. Results: We identified six publications that strictly met our eligibility criteria. Meta-analysis of extractable data showed that mirabegron was more effective than placebo in treating OAB despite different drug dosages in the efficacy end points: mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 h (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.63, -0.45; p = 0.001), mean number of micturitions per 24 h (MD -0.55; 95% CI -0.63, -0.47; p = 0.001), OAB-q (MD -4.49; 95% CI -6.27, -2.71; p = 0.001) and adverse events (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.83, 1.19; p = 0.92). When compared to tolterodine, mirabegron was more effective in terms of mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 h (MD -0.25; 95% CI -0.43, -0.06; p = 0.009). However, there were no differences between mirabegron and tolterodine in mean number of micturitions per 24 h (MD -0.17; 95% CI -0.35,0.01; p = 0.07) and OAB-q (MD -1.09; 95% Cl -2.51, 0.33; p = 0.13). Mirabegron also had a lower adverse reaction rate (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8, 1.0; p = 0.04). Conclusions: In this diverse population, nnirabegron was an effective and safe pharmacologic therapy for OAB.

The HC loss cannot be self-repaired because of the HCs' limited capacity to regenerate in mammals. Atoh1, also known as Math1, Hath1, and Cath1, is a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that played a major role in HC differentiation. Atoh1 activity at various developmental stages can sufficiently drive HC differentiation in the cochlea. Recent issues of a certain publication have identified that Atoh1 is essential for inner ear development, such as cell growth, morphogenesis, differentiation, cellular maintenance, and survival. We summarize the new findings in Atoh1 research and identify the mechanisms underlying the role of Atoh1 in HC regeneration to launch the future of Atoh1 therapy.

In clinical practice, the mesenterical involvement in acute pancreatitis was often observed on MRI in daily works, which was little recorded in the reported studies. We conducted the current study to assess the mesenterical involvement in acute pancreatitis with MRI. We found that the mesenterical involvement of acute pancreatitis patients is common on MRI. The mesenterical involvement has a positive correlation with the MR severity index and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Healthy Evaluation II scoring system. It has been shown that MR can be used to visualize mesenterical involvement, which is a supplementary indicator in evaluating the severity of acute pancreatitis and local and systemic complications.

The current study sought to investigate changes in blood pressures after consumption of a high-carbohydrate (high-CHO) diet by healthy Chinese adolescents. As a population, the Chinese consume a diet with a high carbohydrate content and they have a low incidence of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Dietary data were collected using a 3-day diet diary. Subjects were 672 high school students who were divided into a high-CHO diet group (>= 55% carbohydrates) and a non-high-CHO diet group (< 55% carbohydrates, < 40% fats). Plasma glucose levels, heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured. Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were calculated. Results indicated that males had a higher BMI, glucose level, SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP than females. When diet was taken into account, males in the non-high-CHO diet group had a higher SBP and PP than females. Males in the high-CHO diet group had a higher glucose level than females. Males in the high-CHO diet group had a lower SBP (p = 0.004) and PP (p = 0.002) than males in the non-high-CHO diet group and females in the high-CHO diet group had a lower glucose level (p = 0.003) than females in the non-high-CHO diet group. After adjusting for age, BMI, WHR, heart rate, the total daily energy intake, and the intake of vitamin C, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium, significant differences in SBP and PP were noted in males. These results indicate that male adolescents consuming a high-CHO diet had a lower SBP and PP than males consuming a non-high-CHO diet.

Effects of beraprost sodium on renal function and inflammatory factors of rats with diabetic nephropathy	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Beraprost sodium; Diabetic nephropathy; Renal function; Inflammatory factors	OXIDATIVE STRESS; HYPERGLYCEMIA; PROSTACYCLIN; ANALOG; DAMAGE	Beraprost sodium (BPS) is a prostaglandin analogue. We investigated its effects on rats with diabetic nephropathy. There were 20 rats each in the normal control group (NC), the diabetic nephropathy group (DN), and the BPS treatment group. The rats in DN and BPS groups were given a high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin intraperitoneal injections. The rats in the BPS group were given daily 0.6 mg/kg intraperitoneal injections of this drug. After 8 weeks, blood glucose, 24-h UAlb, Cr, BUN, hs-CRP, and IL-6 levels increased significantly in the DN group compared with the NC group; however, the body mass was significantly reduced in the DN group compared with the NC group. Blood glucose, urine output, 24-h UAlb, Cr, hs-CRP, and IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the BPS group than in the DN group; the body mass was significantly greater in the DN group. Therefore, we concluded that BPS can improve renal function and protect the kidneys of DN rats by reducing oxidative stress and generation of inflammatory cytokines; it also decreases urinary protein excretion of rats with diabetic nephropathy.

The gene effects were stronger among women. Our results show that 17--estradiol (E2) through ER (estrogen receptor) downregulates Glut9 protein expression on human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK2). Intriguingly, E2 does not affect the expression of Glut9 mRNA. ER is linked to PTEN, the PTEN gene negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition may lead to autophagy. Further study indicates that ER may affect the expression of Glut9 though autophagy.

The present study examined the effects of GABA and a GABA receptor agonist on modulating cholesterol-metabolism-associated molecules in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). Methods: ORO stain, HPLC, qRT-PCR, Western blot and EMSA were carried out using HMDMs exposed to ox-LDL with or without GABAergic agents as the experimental model. Results: GABA and topiramate reduced the percentage of cholesterol ester in lipid-laden HMDMs by down-regulating SR-A, CD36 and LOX-1 expression and up-regulating ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI expression in lipid-laden HMDMs. The production of TNF-alpha was decreased in GABA-and topiramate-treated lipid-laden HMDMs, and levels of interleukin (IL)-6 did not change. The activation of two signaling pathways, p38MAPK and NF-kappa B, was repressed by GABA and topiramate in lipid-laden HMDMs. Conclusion: GABA and topiramate inhibit the formation of human macrophage-derived foam cells and may be a possibility for macrophage targeted therapy of atherosclerotic lesions.

Binding of iRGD, a tumor homing peptide, is mediated by integrins, which are widely expressed on the surface of cells. Several types of small molecular drugs and nanoparticles can be transfected into cells with the help of iRGD peptide. Thus, we postulate that SPIO nanoparticles, which have good biocompatibility, can also be transfected into cells using iRGD. Despite the many kinds of cell labeling studies that have been performed with SPIO nanoparticles and RGD peptide or its analogues, only a few have applied SPIO nanoparticles with iRGD peptide in pancreatic cancer cells. This paper reports our preliminary findings regarding the effect of iRGD peptide (CRGDK/RGPD/EC) combined with SPIO on the labeling of pancreatic cancer cells. The results suggest that SPIO with iRGD peptide can enhance the positive labeling rate of cells and the uptake of SPIO. Optimal functionalization was achieved with the appropriate concentration or concentration range of SPIO and iRGD peptide. This study describes a simple and economical protocol to label panc-1 cells using SPIO in combination with iRGD peptide and may provide a useful method to improve the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer imaging.

In contrast to T2 relaxation, which acquires a spin echo signal, T2* relaxation acquires a gradient echo signal. The sequence of a GRET2*WI requires high uniformity of themagnetic field. GRE T2* WIcan detect the smallest changes in uniformity in the magnetic field and can improve the rate of small lesion detection. In addition, the T2* value can indirectly reflect changes in tissue biochemical components. Moreover, it can be used for the early diagnosis and quantitative diagnosis of some diseases. This paper reviews the principles and clinical applications as well as the advantages and disadvantages of GRE T2*WI.

However, the role of IL-27 in the pathogenesis of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia after influenza is unknown. We now report that influenza infection induced pulmonary IL-27 production in a type I IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) signalling-dependent manner, which sensitized mice to secondary pneumococcal infection downstream of IFNAR pathway. Mice deficient in IL-27 receptor were resistant to secondary pneumococcal infection and generated more IL-17A-producing gamma delta T cells but not alpha beta T cells, thereby leading to enhanced neutrophil response during the early phase of host defence. IL-27 treatment could suppress the development of IL-17A-producing gamma delta T cells activated by Streptococcus pneumoniae and dendritic cells. This suppressive activity of IL-27 on gamma delta T cells was dependent on transcription factor STAT1. Finally, neutralization of IL-27 or administration of IL-17A restored the role of gamma delta T cells in combating secondary pneumococcal infection. Our study defines what we believe to be a novel role of IL-27 in impairing host innate immunity against pneumococcal infection.

The aim of this study was to examine the role of integrin subunits and its down-stream signaling molecules in the cyclic hydrodynamic pressure-induced proliferation of human bladder smooth muscle cells (HBSMCs) cultured in scaffolds. The HBSMCs cultured in scaffolds were subjected to four different levels of cyclic hydrodynamic pressure for 24 hours, which were controlled by a BOSE BioDynamic bioreactor. Flow cytometry was used to examine cell cycle distribution. Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting were used to examine the expression levels of integrin subunits and their downstream signaling molecules. Integrin a5 siRNA was applied to validate the role of integrin a5 in cell proliferation. Here, we showed that cyclic hydrodynamic pressure promoted proliferation of HBSMCs. The cyclic hydrodynamic pressure also increased expression of integrin a5 and phosphorylation of FAK, the key mediator of integrin a5 signaling, but not that of integrin a1, a3, a4, av, beta 1 and beta 3. Moreover, inhibition of integrin a5 decreased the level of p-FAK and abolished proliferation of HBSMCs stimulated by cyclic hydrodynamic pressure. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that the integrin a5-FAK signaling pathway controls the proliferation of HBSMCs in response to cyclic hydrodynamic pressure.

Recent evidence indicates that hepatitis B is associated with several types of cancer, but whether endometrial carcinoma (EC) is included has not been reported. Methods: We analyzed HBV serum marker status in 398 patients with endometrial cancer, comparing them to 788 control women undergoing health examination. Results: The total prevalence of HBsAg tested positive in cancer group was significantly higher than the control group (12.8% vs 6.0%, P=0.001), while positive HBsAb was significantly lower (41.2% vs 68.5%, P=0.001). Hepatitis B carriers in endometrial cancer group were also more frequent than in the control group (9.3% vs 5.5%, P=0.013). Interestingly, in the endometrial cancer group, 147 cases were HBV serum marker negative, which was also higher than in the control group (36.9% vs 15.6%, P=0.001).

Materials and Methods: Sixty-seven patients with 70 simple renal cysts were randomly assigned to two groups in a 12-month prospective controlled trial. One group (group A) was treated with computed tomography (CT)-guided sclerotherapy without ethanol concentration monitoring (33 patients with 35 cysts), whereas the other group (group B) had ethanol concentration monitoring (34 patients with 35 cysts) during the procedure. Treatment outcomes between the two groups were compared 12 months later with follow-up ultrasound examination. Results: After the 12-month follow-up period, the overall success rate was 74.3% in group A and 94.3% in group B (p = 0.022). The mean cyst size before and after treatment was 8.6 +/- 2.0 cm and 2.3 +/- 2.9 cm, respectively, in group A, and 8.4 +/- 1.7 cm and 0.8 +/- 1.9 cm, respectively, in group B. The final size of the cysts in group B was significantly smaller than that in group A (p = 0.015). The likelihood of treatment with ethanol concentration monitoring being successful was approximately 16 times higher than without ethanol concentration monitoring (p = 0.026; odds ratio = 15.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.38-179.49). There were no major complications in either group. Conclusion: Monitoring of Hounsfield units (HU) of ethanol by CT is an effective method in the treatment of simple renal cysts with ethanol sclerotherapy. The ethanol sclerotherapy procedure can be terminated at the point of clear fluid aspiration because the HU (-190) of CT scan corresponds to it.

Factors influencing diagnostic yield of CT-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy for bone lesions	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							MUSCULOSKELETAL LESIONS; SOFT-TISSUE; TUMORS; EXPERIENCE; ASPIRATION; UTILITY; SYSTEM	AIM: To evaluate the factors influencing diagnostic yield of computed tomography (CT)guided percutaneous core needle biopsy (CNB) for bone lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2005 and July 2011, 162 consecutive CT-guided CNB procedures were performed in 155 patients. The variables analysed were age, sex, lesion location, lesion type, lesion size, specimen size, biopsy needle gauge, and individual radiologist. The factors influencing diagnostic yield of CT-guided percutaneous CNB for bone lesions were determined by multivariate analysis of variables. RESULTS: The diagnostic yield was 81.5%. Diagnostic yield was 89.9% for lytic bone lesions and 48.5% for sclerotic bone lesions (p < 0.001), and 89.2% for lesions >= 3 cm and 73.4% for lesions < 3 cm (p = 0.010). The significant factors influencing diagnostic yield of CT-guided percutaneous CNB for bone lesions were lesion type [p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) for a lytic lesion was approximately 12 times higher than that for a sclerotic lesion; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.22-34.01], and lesion size (p = 0.012; OR for a lesion size >= 3 cm was about five-times higher than that for a lesion size < 3 cm; 95% CI: 1.42-16.71). CONCLUSION: Lesion type and lesion size are determining factors in diagnostic yield. The higher diagnostic yield is correlated with lytic lesion and lesion size >= 3 cm.

However, its biological role in CRC remains poorly understood. The aim of the study was to determine the role of miR-92a and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism in CRC. The expression levels of miR-92a and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. MTT, migration and invasion assays were used to examine the proliferation, migration and invasion of pre-miR-92a transfected SW480 cells, and a mouse model was used to investigate tumorigenesis. In addition, the regulation of PTEN by miR-92a was evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blot and luciferase reporter assays. The expression of miR-92a was significantly up-regulated in the tissues of CRC patients with lymph node metastasis. The ectopic expression of miR-92a enhanced CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Similar results were found in xenograft assay performed in nude mice. Up-regulation of miR-92a induced EMT in CRC cells. There was an inverse correlation between the levels of miR-92a and PTEN in CRC tissues. The overexpression of miR-92a in CRC cells decreased PTEN expression at the translational level, and decreased PTEN-driven luciferase-reporter activity. Our results demonstrated that miR-92a induced EMT and regulated cell growth, migration and invasion in the SW480 cells, at least partially, via suppression of PTEN expression. MiR-92a may serve as a novel therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

HLA-DR antigen expression of peripheral blood MNCs was examined in 75 patients with AOPP, including 36 patients without multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (non-MODS) and 39 patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as well as in 30 healthy individuals using flow cytometry assay. The associations between HLA-DR antigen expression and certain parameters were analyzed, including acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, serum cholinesterase (ChE) activity, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cardiac enzymes, and liver and kidney function. The mean fluorescence intensity (MCF) of HLA-DR expression in the AOPP group (21.59 +/- 5.36) was significantly lower than that in the control group (27.85 +/- 4.86) (P<0.001). The MCF in the MODS group (18.17 +/- 4.23) was lower than that in the non-MODS group (25.15 +/- 6.15). In addition, the MCF of the deceased patients (15.29 +/- 3.97) was lower than that of the surviving patients (22.34 +/- 2.76) (P<0.001). The MCF of patients with AOPP and MODS was positively correlated with serum ChE (P<0.01) and negatively correlated with the APACHE II score, creatine kinase isoenzyme, cTnI, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine (P<0.05). In conclusion, HLA-DR expression in patients with AOPP was significantly decreased compared with that in healthy individuals; HLA-DR expression may therefore be a good indicator for evaluating AOPP, MODS disease severity, immune function, efficacy of prognosis and prognosis. Examination of HLA-DR antigen expression may be of crucial clinical value.

Materials and Methods: Sixteen piglets were prospectively used to model liver fibrosis staged by liver biopsy, and underwent spleen DCE-MRI on 0, 5th, 9th, 16th and 21st weekend after modeling this disease. DCE-MRI parameters including time to peak (TTP), positive enhancement integral (PEI), maximum slope of increase (MSI) and maximum slope of decrease (MSD) of spleen were measured, and statistically analyzed to stage this disease. Results: Spearman's rank correlation tests showed that TTP tended to increase with increasing stages of liver fibrosis (r = 0.647, P<0.001), and that PEI tended to decrease from stage 0 to 4 (r = -0.709, P<0.001). MSD increased slightly from stage 0 to 2 (P>0.05), and decreased from stage 2 to 4 (P<0.05). MSI increased from stage 0 to 1, and decreased from stage 1 to 4 (all P>0.05). Mann-Whitney tests demonstrated that TTP and PEI could classify fibrosis between stage 0 and 1-4, between 0-1 and 2-4, between 0-2 and 3-4, or between 0-3 and 4 (all P<0.01). MSD could discriminate between 0-2 and 3-4 (P = 0.006), or between 0-3 and 4 (P = 0.012). MSI could not differentiate between any two stages. Receiver operating characteristic analysis illustrated that area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of TTP was larger than of PEI for classifying stage >= 1 and >= 2 (AUC = 0.851 and 0.783, respectively). PEI could best classify stage >= 3 and 4 (AUC = 0.903 and 0.96, respectively). Conclusion: Spleen DCE-MRI has potential to monitor spleen hemodynamic alteration and classify liver fibrosis stages.

When it involves the intestine, it is called entero-Behcet's disease (entero-BD). Case presentation: Here we described a 23-year-old man with entero-BD refractory to conventional therapies who responded well to the combination therapy of infliximab, an anti-tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha antibody, and thalidomide. After combination treatment, the patient's symptoms improved greatly and his Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score decreased from 344 to 52 points, accompanied by a body weight increase from 53 kg to 64 kg. A follow-up endoscopy performed 10 weeks after the treatment showed significant improvement and the patient's multiple ulcers had healed well. Conclusion: The combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide appears to be clinically effective in a patient with refractory entero-BD. However, further studies need to be performed to evaluate the efficacy of this combination therapy.

To analyze mutations in rcDNA and cccDNA, DNA sequencing is often used, although it is time-consuming and expensive. Herein, we report a simple, economic, albeit accurate allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) to detect mutations in these regions of HBV. This method can be extensively used to screen for mutations at specific positions of HBV genome. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Excitatory glutamate transporter subtype 2 (GLT-1) carries bulk of glutamate reuptake in cerebral ischemia. Although GLT-1 expression fluctuates during the period of ischemia, little is known about its regulatory mechanism. Here we show an up-regulation of GLT-1 via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-Akt-nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling cascade in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that brief rapamycin treatment significantly increased GLT-1 expression in cultured astrocytes. Rapamycin increased phosphorylation of raptor at Ser792 and decreased phosphorylation of rictor at Thr1135, suggesting that both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are involved in GLT-1 expression. This conclusion was further confirmed by raptor and rictor disruption experiments. Akt was activated by mTORC1 inhibition and required for GLT-1 expression because triciribine, a specific inhibitor of Akt, blocked the increase of GLT-1 expression. mTOR-Akt cascade then activated NF-kB and increased kB-motif-binding phosphoprotein (KBBP) expression and GLT-1 transcription. We next demonstrated that mTOR-Akt-NF-kB cascade was activated in OGD and subsequently caused the upregulation of GLT-1. Supporting evidence included: (1) inhibition of Akt or NF-kB occluded OGD-induced GLT-1 upregulation; (2) Raptor knock-down plus OGD did not add to the increase of GLT-1 expression; (3) Intact mTORC2 was required for GLT-1 enhancement. In summary, our data first showed that mTOR-Akt-NF-kB cascade played critical roles to up-regulate GLT-1 in OGD. This signaling cascade may work to promote glutamate uptake in brain ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases.

MethodsSixteen miniature pigs were prospectively used to model liver fibrosis, and underwent spleen DWI by using b=300, 500 and 800s/mm(2) on 0, 5th, 9th, 16th and 21st weekend after the beginning of modeling. Signal intensity ratio of spleen to paraspinous muscles (S/M), spleen exponential apparent diffusion coefficient (eADC) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for each b-value were statistically analyzed. ResultsWith increasing stages of fibrosis, S/M for all b-values showed a downward trend; and spleen eADC and ADC for b=300s/mm(2) showed downward and upward trends, respectively (all P<0.05). The area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of spleen DWI parameters was 0.777 or more by S/M for classifying each fibrosis stage, and 0.65 or more by eADC and 0.648 or more by ADC for classifying stage 3 or cirrhosis. Among the spleen DWI parameters, S/M for b=300s/mm(2) was the best parameter in classifying stage 1 or more, 2 or more and 3 or more with AUC of 0.875, 0.851 and 0.843, respectively; and spleen eADC for b=300s/mm(2) was best in classifying stage 4 with an AUC of 0.988. ConclusionSpleen DWI may be used to stage liver fibrosis.

Many microorganisms, including certain viruses, protozoa, and bacteria, have been linked to this injury. In regard to the mechanisms of intrauterine infection-triggered brain injury, the inflammatory risk factors such as cytokines play a central role. The inflammation signal is likely transmitted across the blood-brain barrier and initiates a neuroinflammatory response. Studies have reported that polymorphism of cytokine genes also has been implicated in perinatal brain injury. Moreover, inflammation and HI may be synergistically involved in this process. Although the relationship between inflammation and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in affected infants is slowly being elucidated, the literature contains scant evidence of measures that can improve fetal neurologic outcome. Several pharmacologic molecules such as magnesium sulphate, erythropoietin, and corticosteroids as a neuroprotective agent for the fetus need further investigation. (C) 2013 ISDN.

Anatomy of sodium hypochlorite accidents involving facial ecchymosis-A review	JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY			English	Review						Central venous pressure; Ecchymosis; Facial vein; Intraosseous space; Positive fluid pressure; Root canal treatment; Sodium hypochlorite	ROOT-CANAL TREATMENT; INTRAOSSEOUS VASCULAR ACCESS; COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS; CENTRAL VENOUS-PRESSURE; BONE-MARROW; ENDODONTIC TREATMENT; MAXILLARY SINUS; IRRIGANT FLOW; INADVERTENT INJECTION; AIR-EMBOLISM	Objectives: Root canal treatment forms an essential part of general dental practice. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the most commonly used irrigant in endodontics due to its ability to dissolve organic soft tissues in the root canal system and its action as a potent antimicrobial agent. Although NaOCl accidents created by extrusion of the irrigant through root apices are relatively rare and are seldom life-threatening, they do create substantial morbidity when they occur. Methods: To date, NaOCl accidents have only been published as isolated case reports. Although previous studies have attempted to summarise the symptoms involved in these case reports, there was no endeavour to analyse the distribution of soft tissue distribution in those reports. In this review, the anatomy of a classical NaOCl accident that involves facial swelling and ecchymosis is discussed. Results: By summarising the facial manifestations presented in previous case reports, a novel hypothesis that involves intravenous infusion of extruded NaOCl into the facial vein via non-collapsible venous sinusoids within the cancellous bone is presented. Conclusions: Understanding the mechanism involved in precipitating a classic NaOCl accident will enable the profession to make the best decision regarding the choice of irrigant delivery techniques in root canal debridement, and for manufacturers to design and improve their irrigation systems to achieve maximum safety and efficient cleanliness of the root canal system.

TLR4 functional gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms play a role in some autoinflammatory disease susceptibility. We undertook this study to analyze the association between the genetic polymorphisms within TLR4 gene and the susceptibility to GA in Chinese Han people. Two functional variants, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, in the TLR4 gene were genotyped using 5' exonuclease TaqMan(A (R)) technology from 218 male GA patients and 226 ethnically matched controls. None polymorphisms of Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile were detected in all GA cases and controls, which indicates that there is no evidence for involvement of the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in susceptibility to primary GA in the Chinese Han population. Further studies with extended single nucleotide polymorphisms should be performed.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting & Participants: 95 ambulatory prevalent and incident peritoneal dialysis patients in a well-established renal dialysis center (mean age, 58.26 +/- 12.6 [SD] years; 63% men; mean duration of peritoneal dialysis therapy, 3.2 +/- 4.1 years). Predictor: Estimated volume status using spectral bioelectrical impedance, echocardiography-derived hemodynamic parameters. Outcome: Exercise capacity measured as peak oxygen consumption using symptom-limiting treadmill exercise testing. Results: Exercise capacity was reduced in 96% of patients and severely reduced in 65%. Extracellular to intracellular fluid volume ratio showed the strongest correlation with reduced exercise capacity (R = - 0.63; P < 0.001) and was superior to age, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (E:E' ratio), lean tissue mass index, and hemoglobin and albumin levels in predicting exercise intolerance. Limitations: Relatively small sample size and echocardiogram that was performed only at rest. Conclusions: There was a strong relationship between body extracellular to intracellular fluid volume ratio and exercise capacity in peritoneal dialysis patients. These findings provide new evidence for a connection between fluid distribution, muscle mass, and exercise capacity. Therapeutic strategies targeting fluid status and muscle mass may improve the exercise capacity of patients on peritoneal dialysis therapy. (C) 2013 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Previous study reported that the oligodendrocyte density in hippocampus was increased when the rats were reared in the enriched environment from weaning to adulthood. However, biological conclusions based on density were difficult to interpret because the changes in density could be due to an alteration of total quantity and/or an alteration in the reference volume. In the present study, we used unbiased stereological methods to investigate the effect of enriched environment on the total number of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) positive cells in CA(1) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in aged rats. Our results indicated that there was significant difference in the total numbers of CNPase positive cells in both CA(1) and DG between enriched environment group and standard environment group. The present study provided the first evidence for the protective effects of enriched environment on the CNPase positive cells in aged hippocampus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abnormally expressed miR-224 was found to play a fundamental role in several types of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic and biological values of miR-224 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate expression levels of miR-224. The postoperative survival rate was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The roles of miR-224 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion were analyzed with pre-miR-224 transfected cells. In addition, the regulation of SMAD4 by miR-224 was evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assays. Results: In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-224 was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissue samples and associated with disease relapse and a relative poorer disease-free survival rate. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-224 potently promoted tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-224 in CRC cell lines decreased SMAD4 expression at the translational level and decreased SMAD4-driven luciferase-reporter activity.

METHODS: We searched the published literature in the Medline, Embase, and CBM databases from inception to July 2013. A meta -analysis was performed by the programs RevMan 5.1 and Stata 12.0, and the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in fixed or random effect model based on heterogeneity test among studies. RESLUTS: Seven case control studies with a total of 1 233 cases and 936 controls were included. A statistical significant association with high myopia was observed in the recessive model (TT vs CT+CC: OR =1.92; 95% CI = 1.14-3.23) and codominant model (TT vsCT: OR=1.81, 95%CI=1.19-2.75). CONCLUSION: The present meta analysis suggested that lumican 1554 T/C polymorphism might be moderately associated with high myopia susceptibility. This conclusion warrants confirmation by further studies.

Methods: Patients with stage IIIC and IV ovarian cancer were identified from articles in Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE database (1989 to February 2013). Two authors independently extracted the data. To assess the risk of bias of included literatures, Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used. Meta-analysis on literatures was conducted by using RevMan 5.2 software. Results: Two high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. These multicenter trials randomized 1,220 women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer to NACT or PDS followed by chemotherapy. There were no significant differences between the study groups with regard to overall survival (OS) (1,120 women; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.14) or progression-free survival (PFS) (1,120 women; HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.16). Conclusion: There was no statistical difference in median OS and PFS between the two treatment groups. With regard to selecting who will benefit from NACT, treatment should be tailored to the patient and should take into account respectability, age, histology, stage, and performance status.

Methods: This study was conducted using a case-control method. Genotypes of apolipoprotein E (APOE e4) and CLOCK gene 3111T/C were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism method and TaqMan assay method, respectively. Results: In this study, we gathered 296 unrelated AD patients and 423 control subjects. Both in the whole sample and APOE e4 noncarriers, prevalence of C carriers in CLOCK gene 3111T/C in AD patients was significantly higher than that in control subjects (in the whole sample: chi(2) = 37.615, P < 0.0001; in APOE e4 noncarriers: chi(2) = 46.809, P G 0.0001). However, among APOE e4 carriers, prevalence of C carriers in CLOCK gene 3111T/C between patients and control subjects presents nonsignificant difference (chi(2) = 0.812, P = 0.451). Conclusions: Among APOE e4 noncarriers, C carriers in CLOCK gene 3111T/C were associated with a high susceptibility of AD, but among APOE e4 carriers, the functional polymorphism of CLOCK gene 3111T/C was not associated with the susceptibility of AD.

The muscle RAS oncogene homolog gene (MRAS) has been identified as a susceptibility locus for CAD and is implicated in atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of MRAS are associated with increased risk of ATS in a population of Han Chinese. Methods A case-controlled association study was conducted in which only patients with ATS (identified as a major subtype in the Korean modification of the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification) were enrolled. Subgroup analyses were carried out to determine whether the effect of the MRAS polymorphism was specific to age and gender among the subjects. Results In total, 194 ATS and 186 control subjects were included in the present study. Two tagging SNPs were identified in MRAS (rs40593 and rs3755751). A multivariate regression analysis revealed a positive association between rs40593 and ATS under dominant and additive models after adjustment for covariates. Subgroup analyses revealed that there were no gender differences with respect to allele or genotype frequencies between the groups. The AG genotype for rs40593 (p=0.028), the CT genotype for rs3755751 (p=0.036), and G-allele carriers (AG plus GG) for rs40593 (p=0.015) exhibited a significant protective effect among those aged >= 45 years. For the haplotype analysis, ATS subjects aged >= 45 years had a higher frequency of the ACAC haplotype (76.0%) than the controls (68.1%; p<0.05); that haplotype was associated with an increased risk of ATS. Conclusions The obtained data suggest a positive association between MRAS and ATS among the Han Chinese. Further studies should be performed with larger sample and among different ethnic populations, and gene-gene or gene-environment interactions should be considered.

However, little is known about the microRNAs that potentially regulate beta-like globin gene expression directly or indirectly during erythropoiesis. In this study, we show that microRNA 23a (miR-23a) and miR-27a promote beta-like globin gene expression in K562 cells and primary erythroid cells through targeting of the transcription factors KLF3 and SP1. Intriguingly, miR-23a and miR-27a further enhance the transcription of beta-like globin genes through repression of KLF3 and SP1 binding to the beta-like globin gene locus during erythroid differentiation. Moreover, KLF3 can bind to the promoter of the miR-23a similar to 27a similar to 24-2 cluster and suppress this microRNA cluster expression. Hence, a positive feedback loop comprised of KLF3 and miR-23a promotes the expression of beta-like globin genes and the miR23a similar to 27a similar to 24-2 cluster during erythropoiesis.

The CD40/CD4OL system is related to proinflammatory and prothrombogenic responses, which are involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate association between the CD40 -1C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. Methods: We conducted a case-control study including 286 ischemic stroke patients and 336 controls. CD40 -1C/T SNP was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing methods, and evaluated its relevance to ischemic stroke susceptibility. Results: Significantly increased ischemic stroke risk was found to be associated with the T allele of CD40 -1C/T (OR = 1.273, 95% CI = 1.016-1.594). The frequencies of CT and TT/CT genotypes of CD40 -1C/T in ischemic stroke patients were significantly higher than those of controls, respectively (for CT: OR = 2.350, 95% Cl = 1.601-3.449; for TT/CT: OR = 2.148, 95% CI = 1.479-3.119). And, similar results were obtained after adjusting non-matched variables. We found that the frequency of carried T genotypes (TT and TT/CT) was significantly increased in patients with history of stroke compared with patients without (for TT: OR = 6.538, 95% CI = 1.655-25.833; forIT/CT: OR = 3.469, 95%CI = 1.031-11.670), respectively.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Two hundred sixteen patients with resectable AEG prospectively underwent contrast material-enhanced thoracoabdominal multidetector CT less than 2 weeks before curative resection. Gross tumor volume was retrospectively measured on CT scans. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify whether gross tumor volume is associated with regional lymph node metastasis. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare gross tumor volume among N stages, with Bonferroni correction for multigroup comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine if gross tumor volume could help classify N stage. Results: Univariate analysis showed that gross tumor volume is associated with regional lymph node metastasis (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that gross tumor volume is an independent risk factor of lymph node metastasis (P = .023, odds ratio = 2.791). The Mann-Whitney U test showed that gross tumor volume could help differentiate between stage N0 and stages N1-N2 or N1-N3 disease and between stages N1-N2 and stage N3 disease (P < .0001 for all). In patients with stage T1-T3 AEG, gross tumor volume could help differentiate between stage N0 and stages N1-N2 (cutoff, 15.23 cm(3)) or N1-N3 (cutoff, 17.16 cm(3)) disease and between stages N1-N2 and stage N3 disease (cutoff, 33.96 cm(3)). In patients with stage T3 AEG, gross tumor volume could help differentiate stage N0 from stages N1-N2 (cutoff, 18.41 cm(3)) or N1-N3 (cutoff, 19.30 cm(3)) disease and stages N1-N2 from stage N3 disease (cutoff, 33.96 cm(3)). Conclusion: Gross tumor volume of AEG measured with multidetector CT is associated with regional lymph node metastasis and N stage.

However, their significance is still a matter of dispute among medico-legal experts. This study was aimed to determine the factors which influenced post-mortem blood culture results and to assess their value in determining the cause of death. Methods: We retrospectively investigated 76 post-mortem cases with suspected infection and correlated pathological findings with heart blood culture results. Results: We found that survival time after onset of illness was significantly associated with positive heart blood cultures ( P = 0.014). Blood culture results were not influenced by age, gender, prior antibiotic therapy, interval time from death to store or interval time from death to autopsy ( P > 0.05). In those who had heart blood cultures taken, 49 cases (64.5%) including four cases with mixed growth, showed positive results, and approximately one-third of blood cultures were sterile. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 77.6% (38/49) including two cases with mixed growth; most were genuine pathogens according to the clinical and pathological findings. However, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 59.3% (16/27). Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella spp. were isolated most often. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the results of post-mortem heart blood cultures, when combined with clinical and pathological findings, strengthen the understanding of the cause of death.

Moreover, NMR spectra of curcumin analogues compounds were studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) by GIAO method. The results show that the structure of four kinds of compounds, a larger conjugated system, has good planarity. Because of introducing hydroxyl and methoxy, the compound-B/C/D-C-3, C-4 and compoud-A and compound-D-C, have greater delta value. delta value of compound-A-C,. C-6 is relatively smaller, and value of C-3 is relatively larger. In the conjugated carbonyl compounds, compared with the acetaldehyde value (201 ppm), carbonyl C-13 delta value (183 ppm) decreases relatively, C-11, 15 (a-carbon) delta value(122 ppm) decreases relatively, and C-9,(17) (beta-carbon) value(145 ppm) increases relatively. Finally, the correlation between experimental & value and theoretical & value of the H-1 NMR was analyzed through the linear regression method. Results show that they have good correlation, and the experimental values coincide with the theoretical values.

This study investigated the influence of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation on changes in several nonlinear dynamic electroencephalographic parameters in rats with chronic epilepsy and explored the mechanism underlying repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation-induced antiepileptic effects. An epilepsy model was established using lithium-pilocarpine intraperitoneal injection into adult Sprague-Dawley rats, which were then treated with repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation for 7 consecutive days. Nonlinear electroencephalographic parameters were obtained from the rats at 7, 14, and 28 days post-stimulation. Results showed significantly lower mean correlation-dimension and Kolmogorov-entropy values for stimulated rats than for non-stimulated rats. At 28 days, the complexity and point-wise correlation dimensional values were lower in stimulated rats. Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation has suppressive effects on electrical activity in epileptic rats, thus explaining its effectiveness in treating epilepsy.

Materials and Methods: Sixteen minipigs were used to prospectively model liver fibrosis staged by biopsy. Abdominal gadolinium-enhanced MRI was performed on the 0, 5th, 9th, 16th, and 21st weekend after beginning of the modeling. Splenic maximal width (W), thickness (T), length (L), and area (S) together with spleen volume (SV) and liver volume (LV) were measured on enhanced MRI and the ratio of SV to LV (SV/LV) was calculated. Spleen multidimensional indexes 1 and 2 were obtained by W x T x L and S x L, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed to determine which parameter could best stage the fibrosis. Results: W, T, L, S, SV, index 1 and 2, and SV/LV tended to increase with increasing stages of fibrosis (r = 0.46-0.796, all P < 0.001), and might predict liver fibrosis stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.697-1.0, all P < 0.05). Among the parameters, splenic index 1, SV, and SV/LV might be best for predicting stage 1 (AUC = 0.941), 2 or 3 (AUC = 0.875 or 0.978, respectively), and 4 (AUC = 1.0), respectively. Conclusion: Spleen size measured on MRI could be used for staging liver fibrosis. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2013;38:540-547. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Materials and Methods: A total of 239 patients with acute pancreatitis and 125 controls were analyzed in this study. The severity of acute pancreatitis was graded using the MR severity index (MRSI) and the Acute Physiology And Chronic Healthy Evaluation II(APACHE II) scoring systems. The number of main pancreatic duct (MPD) segments visualized, and both MPD diameter and pancreatic duct disruption were noted and compared with the severity of acute pancreatitis. Results: The frequency of MPD segment visualization in the control group was higher than that in the acute pancreatitis group (p<0.05). The number of MPD segments visualized was negatively correlated with the MRSI score (p<0.05) and the APACHE II score (p<0.05). There was no difference in the MPD diameter between the acute pancreatitis and control groups or among the patients with different severities of acute pancreatitis (p>0.05). The prevalence of pancreatic duct disruption was 7.9% in the acute pancreatitis group. The prevalences of pancreatic duct disruption were 4.8% and 15.3% in the mild and severe acute pancreatitis groups based on the APACHE II score, respectively, and were 0%, 5.7% and 43.5% in the mild, moderate and severe acute pancreatitis groups according the MRSI score, respectively. The prevalence of pancreatic duct disruption was correlated with the severity of acute pancreatitis based on the APACHE II score (p<0.05) and MRSI score (p<0.05). Conclusion: The pancreatic duct in acute pancreatitis patients was of normal diameter. The number of MPD segments visualized and visible pancreatic duct disruption on MRI may be supplementary indicators for determining the severity of acute pancreatitis.

HIV-1 is capable of entering the CNS through infected peripheral monocytes, but its effect on OIs of CNS remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with CNS OIs. A total of 24 patients with CNS OIs and 16 non-CNS OIs (control) cases were selected. These AIDS patients were infected with HIV-1 by paid blood donors in China. HIV-1 loads in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected using RT-PCR, and the C2-V5 region of HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified from viral quasispecies isolated from CSF using nested PCR. The CSF HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was higher than that of non-CNS OIs, but plasma HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was not higher than that of non-CNS OIs. The nucleotide sequence of C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs had a high diversity, and the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs revealed R5 tropism as 11/25 charge rule. These results suggest that high levels of divergent HIV-1 quasispecies in the CNS probably contribute to opportunistic infections.

A SGC-7901 cell system with tetracycline-inducible ECRG4 expression (SGC-7901/ECRG4) was successfully established. ECRG4 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was examined by cell proliferation assay and cell apoptosis assay. ECRG4 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly upregulated in SGC-7901/ECRG4 cells induced with tetracycline. Compared with control cells, the growth inhibition rate of cells with ECRG4 overexpression was significantly increased when treated with 5-FU. Treatment with 5 mu mol/l 5-FU resulted in 15.2 % apoptotic cells, whereas such treatment after overexpression of ECRG4 resulted in 44.5 % apoptotic cells. In conclusion, overexpression of ECRG4 enhanced the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells to 5-FU through induction of apoptosis.

Methods: Thirty-four patients, including 23 males and 11 females whose ages ranged from 24 to 65 years (mean 41.3 years), were treated for posterior vertebral rim separation by various methods. All patients had discectomy and removal of bony fragment. Wide fenestration or hemilaminectomy was performed for 24 type I-III lesions, laminectomy for four type II and one type III lesion, and bilateral fenestration for 5 of 17 type II lesions. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) was performed in 11 patients using autogenous iliac bone or poly (ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) spacer implant. Results: Follow-up studies were performed for all patients ranging from 11 months to 4.6 years with an average period of 2.7 years. There were no serious intra-operative or postoperative complications. Satisfactory results were achieved in all patients except two with type III lesions, mostly because of a long history of hypaesthesia of the leg and a drop foot. Eleven patients who had PLIF exhibited bony fusion at final follow-up. Conclusions: Early operative treatment should be performed on patients after a brief trial of conservative treatment. A proper surgical operation must be based on the type and location of the separated bony fragment and clinical symptoms.

J	Qing, YF; Zhang, QB; Zhou, JG				Qing, Yu-Feng; Zhang, Quan-Bo; Zhou, Jing-Guo			Innate immunity functional gene polymorphisms and gout susceptibility	GENE			English	Article						Gout; Susceptibility; Innate immunity; TLRs; NALP3; Inflammasome	CROHNS-DISEASE; HYPERURICEMIA; ASSOCIATION; VARIANTS	Gout is a common autoinflammatory disease characterized with elevated serum urate and recurrent attacks of intra-articular crystal deposition of monosodium urate. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that MSU crystal-induced inflammation is a paradigm of innate immunity and the TLRs, NALP3 inflammasome and IL1R pathways are involved in gout development. Innate immunity components containing TLR2, TLR4, CD14, NALP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and CARD-8 are essential in the development of gouty inflammation. Recent studies suggest that innate immunity component gene functional mutations contribute to the development of autoinflammatory diseases including hereditary periodic fever syndrome, arthritis as well as inflammatory bowel disease. Taking into account these genetic findings, we would like to propose a novel hypothesis that the gene functional mutations might make innate immunity components as attractive susceptibility candidates and genetic markers for gout. Further Clinical genetic studies need to be performed to confirm the role of innate immunity in the etiology of gout. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LMWH on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, in which acute colitis progresses to chronic colitis, and to explore the potential mechanism involved in this process. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control, DSS, and DSS plus LMWH groups (n = 18). Disease activity was scored by a disease activity index (DAI). Histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The mRNA levels of syndecan-1, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-10 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression of syndecan-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The serum syndecan-1 level was examined by a dot immunobinding assay. LMWH ameliorated the disease activity of colitis induced by DSS administration in mice. Colon destruction with the appearance of crypt damage, goblet cell loss, and a larger ulcer was found on day 12 after DSS administration, which was greatly relieved by the treatment of LMWH. LMWH upregulated syndecan-1 expression in the intestinal mucosa and reduced the serum syndecan-1 level on days 12 and 20 after DSS administration (P < 0.05 vs. DSS group). In addition, LMWH significantly decreased the expression of both IL-1 beta and IL-10 mRNA on days 12 and 20 (P < 0.05 vs. DSS group). LMWH has therapeutic effects on colitis by downregulating inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting syndecan-1 shedding in the intestinal mucosa.

Materials and Methods: Eighty patients with CO-poisoning diagnosed with otic and sinus barotrauma after HBO therapy were recruited. Brain MRI was performed to predict delayed encephalopathy. Over the same period, 88 patients with acute otitis media with effusion on MRI served as control. The abnormalities of the middle ear and paranasal sinuses on MRI were noted and were compared between groups. Nine patients with barotrauma were followed up by MRI. Results: In the barotrauma group, 92.5% of patients had bilateral middle ear abnormalities on MRI, and 60% of patients had both middle ear cavity and mastoid cavity abnormalities on MRI in both ears. Both rates were higher than those in the control group (p = 0.000). In the two groups, most abnormalities on MRI were observed in the mastoid cavity. The rate of sinus abnormalities of barotrauma was 66.3%, which was higher than the 50% in the control group (p = 0.033). In the nine patients with barotrauma followed up by MRI, the otic barotrauma and sinus abnormalities had worsened in 2 patients and 5 patients, respectively. Conclusion: MRI is able to depict the abnormalities of otic and sinus barotrauma in patients with CO-poisoning during HBO therapy and to differentiate these from acute otitis media with effusion.

However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unelucidated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of miR-155 on CRC cells. The expression level of miR-155 was quantified by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) in primary CRC tissues and normal adjacent mucosa. MTT, migration and invasion assays were used to examine the proliferation, migration and invasion of SW480 cells transfected with miR-155. The expression of miR-155 was significantly upregulated in the CRC tissues and the high expression of miR-155 correlated with an advanced clinical stage, lymph node and distant metastases. The ectopic expression of miR-155 enhanced the migration and invasive ability of the SW480 cells and altered their morphological appearance; however, cell proliferation was not affected. E-cadherin expression levels decreased, while ZEB1 expression levels increased in the SW480 cells overexpressing miR-155. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-155 upregulated claudin-1 expression. Thus, our data suggest that miR-155 plays an important role in promoting CRC cell migration and invasion, at least in part through the regulation of claudin-1 expression and controlling metastasis in CRC.

A few recently reported studies have been developed using gene expression microarrays of glioma to identify differentially expressed genes from several to hundreds. This study was designed to analyze vast amounts of glioma-related microarray data and screen the key genes and pathways related to the development and progression of glioma. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and meta-analysis of seven included studies after standardized microarray preprocessing, which increased concordance between these gene datasets. After GSEA, there were 14 mixing pathways including 13 up- and 1 down-regulated pathways. Based on the meta-analysis, 268 significant genes were screened out (P < 0.05); there were 249 genes identified by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and 27 KEGG pathways closely related to the set of the imported genes were identified. At last, six consistent pathways and key genes in these pathways related to glioma were obtained with combined GSEA and meta-analysis. The gene pathways that we identified could provide insight concerning the development of glioma. Further studies are needed to determine the biological function for the positive genes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of drug resistant profiles and quorum sensing related virulence factors. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from different patients hospitalized in China, the isolates were tested for their susceptibility to different common antimicrobial drugs and detected QS-related virulence factors. We identified 170 isolates displaying impaired phenotypic activity, approximately 80 % of the isolates were found to exhibit the QS-dependent phenotypes, among them, 12 isolates were defective in AHLs production, and therefore considered QS-deficient strains. Resistance was most often observed to Cefazolin (81.2 %), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.5 %), ceftriaxone (62.4 %) and Cefotaxime, Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin (58.8 %), and to a lesser extent Meropenem (20.0 %), Cefepime (18.8 %), and Cefoperazone/sulbactam (2.4 %) The QS-deficient isolates that were negative for virulence factor production were generally less susceptible to the antimicrobials. The results showed a high incidences of antibiotic resistance and virulence properties in P. aeruginosa, and indicate that the clinical use of QS-inhibitory drugs that appear superior to conventional antimicrobials by not exerting any selective pressure on resistant strains.

The aim of this present study was to determine whether the TLR4 gene rs2149356 SNP is associated with gouty arthritis (GA) susceptibility and whether rs2149356 SNP impacts the TLR4-IL1 beta signaling pathway molecules expression. Methods and Findings: The rs2149356 SNP was detected in 459 GA patients and 669 control subjects (containing 459 healthy and 210 hyperuricemic subjects). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) TLR4 mRNA and serum IL1 beta were measured in different genotype carriers, and correlations between TLR4 gene SNP and TLR4 mRNA, IL1 beta were investigated. The frequencies of the genotype and allele were significantly different between the GA and control groups (P < 0.01, respectively). The TT genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of GA (OR = 1.88); this finding was not influenced by making adjustments for the components of possible confounders (adjusted OR = 1.96). TLR4 mRNA and IL1 beta were significantly increased in the TT genotype from acute GA patients (P < 0.05, respectively), and lipids were significantly different among three genotypes in the GA patients (P < 0.05, respectively). Conclusions: The TLR4 gene rs2149356 SNP might be associated with GA susceptibility, and might participate in regulating immune, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the degree of esophageal circumferential tumor involvement and tumor size of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) assessed on computed tomography could predict T category. Methods. One hundred eighty- five consecutive patients with ESCC underwent radical esophagectomy less than 3 weeks after contrast- enhanced computed tomography. The degree of esophageal circumferential tumor involvement and tumor size of ESCC expressed as tumor length, maximal thickness, and gross tumor volume were evaluated on computed tomography. Statistical analyses were performed to identify whether degree of esophageal circumferential tumor involvement and tumor size could predict T category. Results. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with whole esophageal circumferential tumor involvement was more likely to be at T3 category, whereas tumor without this involvement was more likely to be at T1 or T2 category (p < 0.001). Degree of esophageal circumferential tumor involvement could distinguish ESCC at T1/T2 from ESCC at T3 category with a sensitivity of 77.4% and specificity of 74.8%. Tumor length, maximal thickness, and gross tumor volume increased with advancing T category (p < 0.001). Mann-Whitney tests showed that tumor size could distinguish T category (p < 0.001). Compared with degree of esophageal circumferential tumor involvement, tumor length, and maximal thickness, gross tumor volume could be a better differentiating indicator between T1 and T2 categories (cutoff, 5.15 cm(3)), between T1 and T3 categories (cutoff, 11.1 cm(3)), between T2 and T3 categories (cutoff, 17.75 cm(3)), and between T1/T2 and T3 categories (cutoff, 15.9 cm(3)), with sensitivity of 81.3%, 88.8%, 68.8%, and 78.8%, and specificity of 76%, 88%, 67.5%, and 75.4%, respectively. Conclusions. Gross tumor volume of resectable ESCC measured with computed tomography could be a recommended indicator for predicting T category.

J	Xiang, Y; Luo, P; Cao, Y; Yang, ZW				Xiang, Yu; Luo, Peng; Cao, Yun; Yang, Zheng-Wei			Long-term effect of vasectomy on spermatogenesis in men: a morphometric study	ASIAN JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY			English	Article						histology; humans; morphometry; spermatogenesis; testis; vasectomy	OBSTRUCTIVE INTERVAL; SEMEN QUALITY; HUMAN TESTIS; AGE; REVERSAL	Spermatogenic damage may occur after vasectomy, and the damage is pressure mediated, occurring when the occluded reproductive tract is unable to accommodate additional sperm produced by the testis. This study aimed to determine the long-term effect of vasectomy on spermatogenesis in humans and clarify how the balance between sperm production in the testis and sperm storage in or removal from the tract might be maintained. During inguinal hernia repair, an open biopsy was performed to obtain testicular tissue blocks from 51 Chinese men (aged >= 50 years), of whom 25 (control group) had not undergone vasectomy and 26 (vasectomized group) had undergone bilateral vasectomy 22-42 years before. Methacrylate resin-embedded testicular sections were made, and morphometric studies were performed using light microscopy. In addition, sizes of the testis and epididymis were estimated with ultrasonography. The testicular tissue blocks obtained from one control and seven vasectomized men consisted almost completely of connective tissue. In the other 43 men, significant differences were not found between the two groups in the testicular or epididymal size, qualitative histology or quantitative parameters including the mean diameter or volume fraction of the seminiferous tubules. In conclusion, sperm production and sperm storage/removal reached a static equilibrium after vasectomy, likely due to spermatogenic degeneration or less sperm production as a result of aging or due to vasectomy-induced testicular (interstitial) fibrosis. Thus, complications that might occur in association with overproduction of sperm and distension of the tract would disappear or be relieved with time.

However, investigators have been able to illustrate communication relationships in the retroperitoneal space by drawing potential routes in computerized tomography (CT) images or a virtual anatomical atlas. We established a new imaging anatomy research method for comparisons of the communication relationships of the retroperitoneal space in combination with the Visible Human Project and CT images. Specifically, the anatomic pathways of peripancreatic fluid extension to the mediastinum that may potentially transform into fistulas were studied. Methods: We explored potential pathways to the mediastinum based on American and Chinese Visible Human Project datasets. These drainage pathways to the mediastinum were confirmed or corrected in CT images of 51 patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis in 2011. We also investigated whether additional routes to the mediastinum were displayed in CT images that were not in Visible Human Project images. Principal Findings: All hypothesized routes to the mediastinum displayed in Visible Human Project images, except for routes from the retromesenteric plane to the bilateral retrorenal plane across the bilateral fascial trifurcation and further to the retrocrural space via the aortic hiatus, were confirmed in CT images. In addition, route 13 via the narrow space between the left costal and crural diaphragm into the retrocrural space was demonstrated for the first time in CT images. Conclusion: This type of exploration model related to imaging anatomy may be used to support research on the communication relationships of abdominal spaces, mediastinal spaces, cervical fascial spaces and other areas of the body.

In clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the imaging tools for the evaluation of prostate cancer, the fusion of MRI or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is improving the evaluation of cancer location, size, and extent, while providing an indication of tumor aggressiveness. This review summarizes the role of MRI in the application of prostate cancer and describes molecular MRI techniques (including MRSI and DCE-MRI) for aiding prostate cancer management.

Although several miRNAs regulate erythroid differentiation, how the key erythroid regulator, GATA-1, directly orchestrates differentiation through miRNA pathways remains unclear. In this study, we identified miR-23a as a key regulator of erythropoiesis, which was upregulated both during erythroid differentiation and in GATA-1 gain-of-function experiments, as determined by miRNA expression profile analysis. In primary human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, miR-23a increased in a GATA-1-dependent manner during erythroid differentiation. Gain- or loss-of-function analysis of miR-23a in mice or zebrafish demonstrated that it was essential for normal morphology in terminally differentiated erythroid cells. Furthermore, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2, was identified as a downstream target of miR-23a that mediated its regulation of erythropoiesis. Taken together, our data identify a key GATA-1-miRNA axis in erythroid differentiation.

However, to date, only a few tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or therapeutic targets have been identified. Identification of more immunogenic antigens is essential for improvements in multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosis and therapy. In this study, we synthesized a polyclonal antibody (PAb) by immunizing rabbits with whole human plasmacytoma ARH-77 cells and identified MM-associated antigens, including enlonase, adipophilin, and HSP90s, among others, via proteomic technologies. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that 200 mu g/mL PAb inhibits the proliferation of ARH-77 cells by over 50% within 48 h. Flow cytometric assay indicated that PAb treatment significantly increases the number of apoptotic cells compared with other treatments (52.1% vs. NS, 7.3% or control rabbit IgG, 9.9%). In vivo, PAb delayed tumor growth and prolonged the lifespan of mice. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay showed that PAb also induces statistically significant changes in apoptosis compared with other treatments (P<0.05). We therefore conclude that PAb could be used for the effective screening and identification of TAA. PAb may have certain anti-tumor functions in vitro and in vivo. As such, its combination with proteomic technologies could be a promising approach for sieving TAA for the diagnosis and therapy of MM.

METHODS: A total of 1308 patients with UC and 1308 age-matched and sex-matched controls were prospectively studied in China. The UC cases were collected from 17 hospitals in China from April 2007 to April 2010. Uniform questionnaires were designed to investigate risk factors including smoking, appendectomy, stress, socio-economic conditions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections and family sanitary conditions. Group comparisons by each factor were done using simple logistic regression analysis. Conditional logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the variables predictive of UC included feeling stress, light and heavy alcoholic drinking, spicy food, sugar consumption and infectious diarrhea, while heavy tea intake and tap water consumption were protective against UC. On multivariate analysis, the protective factor for UC was tap water consumption [odds ratios (OR) = 0.424, 95% CI: 0.302-0.594, P < 0.001]; while the potential risk factors for UC were heavy sugar consumption (OR = 1.632, 95% CI: 1.156-2.305, P < 0.001), spicy food (light intake: OR = 3.329, 95% CI: 2.282-4.857, P < 0.001; heavy intake: OR = 3.979, 95% CI: 2.700-5.863, P < 0.001), and often feeling stress (OR = 1.981, 95% CI: 1.447-2.711, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as smoking habit, appendectomy, breastfeeding, a history of measles, rural or urban residence, education, oral contraceptives, and NSAID use have not been found to have a significant association with the development of UC in the present study.

J	Jin, L; Feng, G; Reames, DL; Shimer, AL; Shen, FH; Li, XD				Jin, Li; Feng, Gang; Reames, Davis L.; Shimer, Adam L.; Shen, Francis H.; Li, Xudong			The effects of simulated microgravity on intervertebral disc degeneration	SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Intervertebral disc; Microgravity; Disc degeneration; Apoptosis; Extracellular matrix	NUCLEUS PULPOSUS; ORGAN-CULTURE; IN-VITRO; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; LIMITED NUTRITION; BONE-FORMATION; END-PLATES; BACK-PAIN; CELLS; SYSTEM	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Astronauts experience back pain, particularly low back pain, during and after spaceflight. Recent studies have described histologic and biochemical changes in rat intervertebral discs after space travel, but there is still no in vitro model to investigate the effects of microgravity on disc metabolism. PURPOSE: To study the effects of microgravity on disc degeneration and establish an in vitro simulated microgravity study model. STUDY DESIGN: Discs were cultured in static and rotating conditions in bioreactor, and the characteristics of disc degeneration were evaluated. METHODS: The mice discs were cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor where the microgravity condition was simulated. Intervertebral discs were cultured in static and microgravity condition. Histology, biochemistry, and immunohistochemical assays were performed to evaluate the characteristics of the discs in microgravity condition. RESULTS: Intervertebral discs cultured in rotating bioreactors were found to develop changes of disc degeneration manifested by reduced red Safranin-O staining within the annulus fibrosus, down-regulated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and GAG/hydroxyproline ratio, increased matrix metalloproteinase 3 expression, and upregulated apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that simulated microgravity induces the molecular changes of disc degeneration. The rotating bioreactor model will provide a foundation to investigate the effects of microgravity on disc metabolism. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Methods: The case was a cohort that included 50 patients with AD. For each case subject, 1 control who was of similar age, sex, daily activities (scale of Lawton), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and depression (15-item Geriatrics Depression Scale) was recruited. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3), total tetraiodothyronine (TT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) were detected using radioimmunity. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with AD had significantly lower levels of TRH (67.72 +/- 18.44 vs 78.64 +/- 14.31 pmol/L; t = 2.078; P = 0.036), TSH (3.89 +/- 1.22 vs 4.31 +/- 1.07 mIU/L; t = 2.331; P = 0.024), TT3 (1.44 +/- 0.21 vs 1.63 +/- 0.19 nmol/L; t = 3.761; P = 0.018), TT4 (119.71 +/- 18.64 nmol/L vs 129.54 +/- 23.17 nmol/L; t = 1.328; P = 0.044), FT3 (4.01 +/- 1.27 vs 5.41 +/- 0.99 pmol/L; t = 4.976; P = 0.008), and FT4 (9.84 T 1.56 vs 12.96 +/- 2.20 pmol/L; t = 5.381; P = 0.006). In the AD cases, none of the correlations between TRH and TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4, and between TSH and TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 was significant. However, in the healthy controls, TRH was significantly correlated with TSH (R = 0.020; P = 0.042) and FT4 (R = 0.015; P = 0.018), and TSH was significantly correlated with TT4 (R = 0.209; P = 0.017) and FT4 (R = 0.215; P = 0.009). Conclusion: Alzheimer disease was associated with abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

Although p53 and p63 have high sequence and structural similarities, the molecules differ in function and expression profiles. p63 is critical for the development of epithelial organs or tissues, including the epidermis and other squamous epithelia, as well as the salivary, lachrymal, mammary and prostate glands and the urothelium. In addition, p63 is essential for the proliferative potential of stem cells in the epidermis. In contrast to p53, the role of Delta Np63 in tumors remains unclear and complex. Our previous study demonstrated that Delta Np63 is overexpressed in human bladder carcinoma tissues. The mechanism by which Delta Np63 promotes tumor cell development, including adhesion, proliferation and polarity, is unknown. Data demonstrate that Delta Np63 induces the invasiveness of cancer cells through specific downstream genes and the mechanism is associated with cell junctions. Claudin-1 is an important p63 target gene for normal skin development. Claudin-1, as a connexin, functions in a similar manner to other connexins to affect important events during cancer cell development. In the present study, Delta Np63 gene expression in bladder tumor tissues was found to be significantly higher than that in normal tissue, indicating that Delta Np63 is localized to the nucleus. In addition, Delta Np63 silencing decreased invasion and metastasis in UM-UC-3 cells and reduced claudin-1 expression.

A SURVEY OF PHYSICIANS WHO CARE FOR OLDER PERSONS IN SOUTHWEST CHINA	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article						Southwest China; physician survey; gerontology; geriatrics; continuing medical education	GERIATRICS; PROGRESS	Objective: The aim of this survey is to determine the main barriers of geriatric health care from the physicians' point of view and compare the improvement before and after the Continue Medical Education (CME) provided by International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (IAGG). Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting and Participants: Five hundred samples were generated using systematic random sampling from the address lists of physicians in Southwest China who had received the IAGG CME or been trained in Sichuan Association of Geriatrics (SAG) CME. Measurements: The interview instrument examined demographics and information on geriatric education. Results: Of the 500 physician sampled, 461(92.2 percent) responded. 34.3 percent of the respondents reported that over 70 percent of their patients were older persons. 76.8 percent of the respondents felt that they lacked geriatric knowledge. Only 15.6 percent of the respondents had geriatric curriculum before graduation, and 26.0 percent received geriatric trainings after graduation. Most physicians felt that "Language barrier" and "Insufficient geriatric education in undergraduate medical school and postgraduate education" were the main challenges in practicing geriatric medicine. Geriatric training and knowledge are inadequate due to the lack of geriatric curriculums in medical schools and CME for physicians who practice geriatrics. With the help of IAGG, CME in Southwest China provided more workshops on geriatric progress in year 2011 than in year 2007-2010. Eighty percent of the physicians acknowledged that the IAGG CME was helpful for their clinical practice. The physicians paid more attention to geriatric syndromes rather than age-related pathophysiology alone. Conclusion: CME provided by geriatric associations is helpful. Collaboration between different geriatric societies such as IAGG and SAG may be a good model for spreading geriatric knowledge and should be considered by medical educational administration.

CT-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy for small (<= 20 mm) pulmonary lesions	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							COAXIAL CUTTING NEEDLE; ASPIRATION BIOPSY; LUNG-BIOPSY; COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY; NODULES; COMPLICATIONS; RISK; PNEUMOTHORAX; ACCURACY; CANCER	AIM: To assess the accuracy and risk factors for complications of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy (CNB) for small (<= 20 mm) pulmonary lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken comprising 169 patients who underwent CT-guided CNB for small (<= 20 mm) pulmonary lesions. To assess the accuracy of the procedure, the diagnosis at biopsy was compared with the diagnosis after definitive surgery or clinical follow-up. The risk factors for pneumothorax and bleeding were determined by multivariate analysis of variables. RESULTS: The overall diagnostic accuracy was 93.5%. The sensitivity for malignancy and specificity for benign lesions were 90.4% and 100%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 83.3%, respectively. Twenty-five patients (14.8%) had pneumothorax after CT percutaneous CNB of the lung. The significant risk factors affecting the incidence of pneumothorax were lesion-pleural distance (p = 0.008) and needle-pleural angle (p = 0.012). The highest rate of pneumothorax correlated with a lesion-pleural distance >= mm (OR = 18.46; 95% CI: 2.27-149.95) and a needle-pleural angle >= 51 degrees (OR = 8.22; 95% CI: 2.14-31.49). Bleeding occurred in 30 patients (17.8%). The only significant risk factor affecting the incidence of bleeding was lesion-pleural distance (p = 0.011). The highest bleeding rate correlated with a lesion-pleural distance >= 21 mm (OR = 7.93; 95% CI: 1.73-36.43). CONCLUSION: CT-guided percutaneous CNB of small (<= 20 mm) pulmonary lesions provides high diagnostic accuracy with acceptable complications. A lesion-pleural distance of >= 21 mm and needle-pleural angle of >= 51 degrees are identified as the risk factors for highest pneumothorax rate. In addition, the needle-pleural angle is a novel predictor of pneumothorax. A lesion-pleural distance of >= 21 mm is also identified as a risk factor for the highest bleeding rate.

Each protein was ranked and those most associated with OSCC were mined within the network. First, OSCC-related genes were retrieved from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Then they were mapped to their protein identifiers and a seed set of proteins was built. The seed proteins were expanded using the nearest neighbor expansion method to construct a PPI network through the Online Predicated Human Interaction Database (OPHID). The network was verified to be statistically significant, the score of each protein was evaluated by algorithm, then the OSCC-related proteins were ranked. 38 OSCC related seed proteins were expanded to 750 protein pairs. A protein-protein interaction nerwork was then constructed and the 30 top-ranked proteins listed. The four highest-scoring seed proteins were SMAD4, CTNNB1, HRAS, NOTCH1, and four non-seed proteins P53, EP300, SMAD3, SRC were mined using the nearest neighbor expansion method.

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease. The present research was designed to explore the contribution of progenitor cells to the progression of atherosclerotic plaques and the possible modulatory role of PNS in this process. Methods: PNS (60 or 120 mg/ kg via intraperitoneal injection) was administered over 8 weeks in apolipoprotein E knockout mice on an atherogenic diet. The sizes and histochemical alteration of atherosclerotic lesions and numbers of EPCs in BM and peripheral blood were analyzed. The expression of chemokine stromal cell derived factor la (SDF-1a) and its receptor, CXCR4, was monitored as well. Results: PNS significantly reduced the lesion area and intima-to-media ratio compared to vehicle treatment. PNS also augmented endothelialization and reduced the smooth muscle cell (SMCs) content of the lesions. The number of c-kit and sca-1 double-positive progenitor cells and flk-1 and sca-1 double-positive progenitor cells were significantly increased in the BM and the peripheral blood of the PNS-treated groups. PNS treatment increased the plasma levels of SDF-la and SCF as well as the BM levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, the m RNA levels of S DF-la and protein levels of CXCR4 were both increased in the BM of mice treated with PNS, while SDF-la expression decreased. Conclusion: PNS reduce the size of atherosclerotic plaques, and this effect appears to involve progenitor cell mobilization. SDF-la CXCR4 interactions and the possible modulatory role of PNS in this process may contribute to the increased progenitor cell mobilization. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between DNT cells and disease progression during the first 2 years of HIV infection. We found that DNT cell numbers tended to decrease with disease progression. There was a positive correlation between DNT cells and CD4 counts. The DNT cell numbers were significantly lower in the high viral load group compared with the low viral load group. Therefore, we conclude that DNT cells correlated with disease progression in HIV infection. These data provide valuable information for further understanding of the role of DNT cells during HIV infection.

Plxnd1 expression in thymocytes regulates their intrathymic migration while that in thymic endothelium impacts medullary topology	FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						plexind1; thymic development; thymic epithelial cells; angiogenesis; autoimmunity		An important role for plexinD1 in thymic development is inferred from studies of germline Plxnd1 knockout (KO) mice where mislocalized CD69(+) thymocytes as well as ectopic thymic subcapsular medullary structures were observed. Given embryonic lethality of the Plxnd1(-/-) genotype, fetal liver transplantation was employed in these prior analyses. Such embryonic hematopoietic reconstitution may have transferred Plxnd1 KO endothelial and/or epithelial stem cells in addition to Plxnd1 KO lymphoid progenitors, thereby contributing to that phenotype. Here we use Plxnd1(flox/flox) mice crossed to pLck-Cre, pKeratin14-Cre, or pTek-Cre transgenic animals to create cell-type specific conditional knockout (CK0) lines involving thymocytes (D1ThyCKO), thymic epithelium (D1EpCKO), and thymic endothelium (D1EnCKO), respectively. These CKOs allowed us to directly assess the role of plexinD1 in each lineage. Loss of plexinD1 expression on double positive (DP) thymocytes leads to their aberrant migration and cortical retention after TCR-mediated positive selection. In contrast, ectopic medulla formation is a consequence of loss of plexinD1 expression on endothelial cells, in turn linked to dysregulation of thymic angiogenesis. D1 EpCKO thymi manifest neither abnormality. Collectively, our findings underscore the non-redundant roles for plexinD1 on thymocytes and endothelium, including the dynamic nature of medulla formation resulting from crosstalk between these thymic cellular components.

Methods: A search of randomized controlled trials was conducted in Medline and Embase from 1970s to 2010. Two reviewers independently selected trials, conducted critical appraisal of the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Meta-analyses were performed using all time-points meta-analysis (ATM). Results: Nineteen trials met inclusion criteria. For arthritis, the findings of this study showed that self-management programs have small to moderate effects in improving pain and disability at the long-term level, but the medium-term effect for disability is not significant. For chronic back pain, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of self-management programs. Conclusion: The encouraging evidence of this study indicates that it is recommended to provide self-management programs to adult patients with arthritis. Further research is needed on self-management for chronic back pain. Practice implications: Self-management is a safe, community-based and effective way for patients with arthritis to manage pain and disability. Core skills of self-management should be delivered using multiple approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the value of ethanol concentration monitoring for efficacy of CT-guided sclerotherapy of simple renal cysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS. For the experimental study, ethanol solutions with various concentrations (from 10% to 100% at 10% increments) were scanned with CT; the correlation between the CT density values and different ethanol concentrations in the ethanol solution were analyzed. For the clinical study, a total of 66 consecutive patients with simple renal cysts treated with sclerotherapy were retrospectively studied. Of the 66 patients, 45 (group A) did not have ethanol concentration monitoring, whereas 21 (group B) had ethanol concentration monitoring during the procedure. Treatment results between the two groups were compared 6 months later with follow-up ultrasound. RESULTS. In the experimental study, there was a linear correlation (r = -0.981) between the CT density values and the ethanol concentration (p < 0.05). In the clinical study, for group A, 25 of 45 patients (55.5%) showed complete regression of the cysts and nine of 45 cases (20%) showed partial regression of the cysts. There was a 24.5% recurrence rate (11/45) in Group A. In group B, 17 of 21 patients (81%) exhibited complete regression of the cyst and four of 21 (19%) showed a partial regression of the cyst. There was no recurrence in Group B. CONCLUSION. Our in vitro experiment showed a linear correlation between ethanol concentration and CT density values. CT density values can be used to measure ethanol concentration. Ethanol concentration monitoring during the procedure can improve the success rate in CT-guided sclerotherapy for simple renal cysts.

Objectives circle To review the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for TN. Methods circle English and Chinese databases were searched extensively to identify randomized controlled studies of acupuncture treatment for TN. Selected studies were assessed for methodological quality. Odds ratios (OR) between treatment and control groups were used to assess efficacy. Results circle Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria with 506 people in the acupuncture arm and 414 people in the control arm, in which carbamazepine (CBZ) was used as the control treatment. They were all low-quality studies, hence precluding meta-analysis. I Only four trials reported that acupuncture was superior to CBZ, and the remaining eight studies showed no difference between the treatment and control groups. Adverse effects of acupuncture, which were reported in three studies, were mild. Conclusion circle The evidence reviewed previously suggests that acupuncture is of similar efficacy as CBZ but with fewer adverse effects in treatment of TN. However, the evidence is weak because of low methodological quality of the reviewed studies. Further studies with improved methodologies are recommended to support the use of acupuncture for TN.
